France is grappling with the aftermath of Storm Nils, as several regions remain under threat of flooding. Portugal and Spain have also been affected by a series of storms that have swept across the Iberian peninsula in recent weeks.
The aftermath of Storm Nils continued to disrupt parts of France on Friday. While wind alerts were lifted, some areas remain at risk for flooding, according to State forecaster Météo-France.
"We’re stepping up vigilance because the outlook over the next 48 hours is uncertain," said La Réole town councillor Vincent Gorse, as the River Garonne continues to rise in the town of Gironde. Twelve people have had to be rehoused in an emergency shelter.
The storm claimed the lives of at least two people, government spokesperson Maud Bregeon told local media.
On Thursday, a lorry driver died after a tree branch fell on his vehicle near Dax in south-west France. The second victim was a man who was found in his garden in Tarn-et-Garonne.
Storm Nils also left hundreds of thousands of people without energy.
Network operator Enedis said up to 900,000 customers were left without power at the peak of the storm. The operator restored service to about half of those affected by Friday morning and mobilised 3,000 personnel, including 2,100 technicians.
"Flooding complicates repairs because the fields are waterlogged and some roads are blocked," Enedis crisis director Herve Champenois said at a press briefing Thursday.
The storm arrived late on Wednesday evening and swept across western France before moving southeast towards the Mediterranean coast and Corsica. Météo-France said the storm, which has moved on tracking east into Europe, had “uncommon strength".
Iberian peninsula hit by back-to-back storms
Portugal and Spain were also impacted by the storm, with one fatality reported in Spain after a roof of an industrial warehouse collapsed on a woman, authorities said.
Dozens more were also injured in weather-related incidents in Spain, and a viaduct in Portugal partially collapsed because of flooding.
The Iberian peninsula has been battered by back-to-back storms over the past few weeks, leaving widespread destruction as the region struggles to recover from the prolonged periods of heavy rain and deadly floods.
Scientists say human-driven climate change is increasing the length, intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods and heatwaves.

Kazakhstan to hold referendum on adopting new constitution

The draft of Kazakhstan's new constitution will consolidate the president's powers and introduce a number of additional changes. The referendum on its adoption is set for 15 March.
Kazakhstan will hold a referendum on 15 March to vote on the new constitution, after Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed a decree following the Constitutional Commission's presentation of the final project on Wednesday.
“The proposed amendments will allow for the redistribution of powers, strengthen the system of checks and balances, and, most importantly, increase the effectiveness and sustainability of all political institutions,” said Tokayev during a government session on Tuesday.
The previous constitution played a tremendous role in the country’s achievements over the last 30 years, Tokayev said, but it no longer reflects the realities of today’s economic, geopolitical, and technological landscape.
“We must take into account that it was adopted when our country was just getting on its feet and bears the imprint of the first difficult years of establishing our independence. Since then, our society has changed significantly,” the president explained.
This is why it is important to "update the country’s goals, values and principles, and enshrine them at the constitutional level,” he added.
If the proposed constitution is adopted, the amendments are expected to change 84% of the old text.
Stronger presidential role on the table
The role of the president was strengthened in the new constitution. Currently, the president, with the approval of the Senate, can appoint the chairs of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Judicial Council, the National Bank, the National Security Committee, and the Prosecutor General.
The new constitution gives him the power to also appoint the heads of the Supreme Court, the Central Electoral Commission, the Supreme Audit Chamber, the State Security Service, and the Human Rights Commissioner.
The president will also be able to appoint 10 judges of the Constitutional Court, six members of the Central Electoral Commission and eight members of the Supreme Audit Chamber – all with the approval of the new unicameral parliament, dubbed Kurultai.
However, a provision states that if Kazakhstan's Kurultai refused these candidacies twice, the president would have the right to dissolve the parliament.
In its temporary absence, he would hold the power to “issue decrees that have the force of constitutional laws or laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan.”
The Kurultai chairperson and the vice president would also be subject to this rule.
Return of the vice president position
The reform would also reinstate the position of vice president. The country had this position between 1991 and 1996, but it was later abolished.
Now his duties would include representing the country abroad, representing the president at parliamentary and other meetings, and interacting with social, cultural and scientific communities at home and abroad. The rest of his powers and duties would be determined by the president.
Reestablishing this office also means a change in the order of power transfer. Under the current constitution, if the president can no longer fulfil his duties due to abdication, illness, or death, the line of succession is: the Senate speaker, the speaker of the lower chamber, and then the prime minister.
Under the proposed new rules, the mantle would first be transferred to the vice president, then to the speaker of the parliament, and finally to the prime minister.
Unicameral parliament and People's Council
The unicameral parliament, the Kurultai, whose shift was first announced during Tokayev's September address, would also be reformed to consist of 145 members — as opposed to 148 across two chambers — and would be elected for five years.
Kurultai would have all the powers of both chambers, including the power to pass new laws. All laws would undergo three readings. The president, Kurultai members, the prime minister and members of the People's Council would have the power to initiate draft laws.
The People's Council is, in fact, another novelty. In January, Tokayev abolished the National Congress, which met to discuss important matters with the people, and the Assembly of the People of Kazakhstan, which represented the interests of all ethnicities living in the country.
The new structure would combine the essence of the two, but would also have the power to propose laws and initiate referendums.
Other provisions
The wording on freedom of speech provisions have been amended as well: the current constitution says that "freedom of speech and art is guaranteed."
However, the proposed version has expanded these guarantees to "scientific, technical and artistic creativity" as well.
One of the most discussed provisions is a minor change in the wording on the use of the Kazakh and Russian languages. Instead of being used on "equal grounds," the two will be used "alongside," implying that Kazakh would take precedence, according to experts.
"Official documents in the Kazakh language will have the highest authenticity. This means that if versions of the same document in different languages contradict each other, the version in Kazakh will be considered the correct one," said political scientist Gaziz Abishev.
The scope of protection of personal data is expanded. It is now also clearly stated that religion is separate from the state.
Marriage will no longer be a union of two people, but a union of a man and a woman, which comes on the heels of the recent ban on LGBTQ+ propaganda.
Kazakhstan is a member of many international organisations and a signatory to agreements, such as the UN and the Paris Agreement. Under the current constitution, Kazakhstan's international commitments take precedence over domestic law. The new version no longer makes this promise.
While the constitution still requires respect for international law, and the main principles of foreign policy will remain friendly relations, dialogue, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, Kazakhstan wants to exclude the provision that requires it to "renounce the first use of armed force."
Non-profits and political parties financed by international sources will have to openly show the money coming from not only foreign governments and organisations, but also foreign companies and companies with foreign participation.
If the new constitution is adopted through the referendum, it will take effect on 1 July, after which the parliamentary election will take place sometime in August, so that the new season will start with the new convocation.
The third constitution
If passed, the new constitution would be its third iteration. The first one was adopted in 1993 but was quickly scrapped, and another constitution was adopted on 30 August 1995.
Since then, the constitution has been amended six times, with the latest round made in 2022.
Following the January 2022 unrest, the amendments were part of the country's political reform, and the new constitution is said to be the continuation of that process.
The Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law conducted a comparative analysis of the three versions of the constitution.
While acknowledging that assessing political regimes was not their task, they stated that the 1993 constitution was the least stringent.
“We note the more authoritarian nature of the 1995 constitution and the project and the clear strengthening of the role and powers of the president in them compared to the 1993 constitution,” said their press release.

Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces release footage of strikes on Russian airfield in Crimea, other targets in occupied territories
Ukrainian forces have struck multiple Russian military targets, including an airfield, in Russian-occupied territories over the past two days, the Unmanned System Forces (USF) said on Feb. 13.
Ukraine regularly attacks military facilities in Russian-occupied areas that supply weapons, fuel, and equipment to Russian troops.
The 1st Separate Center of the USF struck on Feb. 12 an airfield in the village of Hvardiiske in Crimea, the Kirova electrical substation in the city of Luhansk, Luhansk Oblast, and a data center in Prymorsk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
All targets were struck with mid-range precision weapons and were located in Russian-occupied territories, according to the USF.
Drone operators from the "Kairos" unit of the 414th Separate Brigade, also known as "Madyar's Birds", targeted an ammunition depot near the village of Rozivka in the Russian-occu[ied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Feb. 11, according to the statement.
"Systematic strikes on such infrastructure disrupt command and logistics, reducing the Russian army's ability to sustain combat operations," the USF said.
The full extent of the damage is still being clarified.
The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.
Ukrainian long-range drones also struck on Feb. 12 the Ukhta oil refinery in Russia's Komi Republic, located 1,750 kilometers (1,087 miles) from Ukraine's border, a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) told the Kyiv Independent.
The strike marks a new range record for Ukrainian drones, according to the source. The drones were operated by the SBU's Alpha special operations center.

Sugarcane costumes worn during Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show go up for sale
The viral grass costumes were part of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show, which drew 128.2 million viewers, just shy of Kendrick Lamar’s 133.5 million record

This year’s Halloween costume could be an official relic from Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX Halftime show performance — if you have $5,000 to spend.
At least two of the already infamous sugarcane grass costumes worn by backup performers, affectionately known as “grass bunnies” during Sunday’s nearly record-breaking halftime show, are now up for sale on eBay.
Each costume comes with the green sweatsuit that performers wore underneath the massive grass getup, plus the grass-covered arms that made the humans inside of them nearly undetectable. The outfits instantly became one of the most unforgettable parts of Bad Bunny’s halftime show, with the dancers inside forced to stand perfectly still for nearly 13 minutes as part of the tribute to Puerto Rican culture.
One listing, posted for $5,000 or the best offer, includes a green sweatsuit size medium-large, a balaclava or ski mask, shoulder harness, gloves, safety glasses and the large prop arms used in the performance, along with an official in-ear radio used during rehearsals with surprise halftime show guests Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin.
The package also comes with an official Super Bowl LX tote bag and an NFL credential as proof of participation in the event.
“All in all, I really do not want to part with this, but you’ll be helping me pay off my student loans and will be helping me with my grandparents' medical! God bless America and God bless Bad Bunny,” the seller wrote.
Another listing, priced at $4,499.99 with a current bid of $1,125, includes a mix-and-match costume set: large sweatpants, a small sweatshirt, a numbered cast-member arm strap, an in-ear radio with earpiece, a balaclava, grass shoulder and forearm pads, and an official Super Bowl LX tote bag.
“All sales final. No returns,” the seller wrote.
Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show drew 128.2 million viewers, making it one of the most-watched performances in the event’s history. However, it fell short of Kendrick Lamar’s record of 133.5 million viewers.
The performance took place during the NFL championship game between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, which itself reached a peak audience of 137.8 million, setting a new record for U.S. television.
Bad Bunny made history as the first solo male Latin artist to headline the halftime show and the first to perform entirely in a language other than English.

Europe’s open-border dreams meet German politics

The European Commission is embarking on a joint exercise with member states to evaluate Germany’s application of Schengen border rules and safeguards, with the review expected to begin in March, according to two sources familiar with the process. The evaluation follows a POLITICO investigation that found Germany had marked Ukrainian citizens who had served time in prisons under Russian control as security threats and prevented them from entering the European Union.
The Schengen evaluation will draw new scrutiny of Berlin’s assertive control of border crossings into and around Europe. Germany has imposed temporary, randomized police checks along its own national borders, and is now using technology to play an outsized role in shaping how other countries police Europe’s external frontier as well.
Germany’s tough posture toward border enforcement is driven as much by domestic politics as by security concerns: Friedrich Merz’s conservative-led administration has embraced the controls and deportations to blunt the electoral appeal of the far right and to signal a break with Berlin’s traditionally welcoming stance toward asylees. In March, Merz’s government will have to decide whether to renew the temporary border checks, a policy that has been widely criticized for violating the European Union’s promise of free movement.

Tony Blair urges Labour to reverse ban on new licences for oil drilling in the North Sea
Former prime minister’s think-tank says government’s clean power plan is ‘leading the UK in the wrong direction’

Tony Blair has called on the Labour government to reverse its ban on new licences for drilling oil and gas in the North Sea, echoing calls made by US president Donald Trump.
The former prime minister’s think-tank said Sir Keir Starmer should cut the windfall tax rate on oil and gas firms, saying the government’s clean power plan is “leading the UK in the wrong direction”.
Labour has committed to plans to phase out production of oil and gas in the North Sea by restricting new licences for drilling and increasing the rate of the Energy Profits Levy.
But in a new report, the Tony Blair Institute (TBI) called on the government to lift its ban on new exploration licences and to cut tax rates on the industry, saying the measures have “sharply increased policy risk and driven capital out of the basin”.
“New licences should be granted a clear framework, focused on projects that are commercially viable, less carbon-intensive than imported alternatives and compatible with a declining long-term production profile,” the report states.
“This is not about slowing the transition or denying the direction of travel – it is about making the transition governable. An energy strategy that ignores revenue, security and political consent in pursuit of symbolic purity will not endure – and it will not deliver the climate outcomes it promises.”
The call echoes comments made by Donald Trump who has described the North Sea as “one of the greatest reserves anywhere in the world” and criticised the UK for making it “impossible for the oil companies to go”.
“The United Kingdom produces just one-third of the total energy from all sources that it did in 1999 – think of that, one-third – and they’re sitting on top of the North Sea, one of the greatest reserves anywhere in the world, but they don’t use it, and that’s one reason why their energy has reached catastrophically low levels, with equally high prices,” he said in Davos last month.
The TBI also criticised Labour’s bold pledge to deliver “clean power by 2030” in a bid to curb bills and tackle climate change.
Under energy secretary Ed Miliband, the government is striving to ensure almost all of Britain’s electricity coming from clean sources such as renewables and nuclear by the end of the decade.
But the TBI said the plan has become an “exercise in measuring the wrong achievements”, dubbing it as “climate theatre” rather than “climate leadership”.
“This is not to say that the UK needs less ambition. What it needs is a strategy that is grounded in today’s reality,” it said.
“Clean Power 2030 is leading the UK in the wrong direction. Replacing it with a clear focus on cheaper, abundant power is the only way to sustain growth, enable electrification and maintain public consent for climate action.”

Gaza govt urges new 'Board of Peace' committee to enter enclave

Gaza government urges new committee to enter enclave as ambulance officer dies in Israeli custody
Authorities in war-torn Gaza have urged the newly established National Committee for the Administration of Gaza to "urgently" enter the enclave as it pledges full cooperation.
This came amid reports that a Palestinian ambulance officer from Gaza had died in Israeli detention.
On Thursday, the Government Media Office in the war-devastated enclave issued a statement urging the US-backed committee for Gaza - established to oversee the territory’s future administration under the second phase of President Donald Trump’s ceasefire plan - to enter Gaza and begin carrying out its mandate.
"In light of the ongoing political and administrative developments, and out of keenness to ensure the regular functioning of institutional work and the continuity of essential services, we renew our welcome to the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza and stress the importance of its urgent presence to assume its tasks and national responsibilities," the Gaza government media office said.
It confirmed the government's "full readiness to transfer relevant powers and to take all necessary measures within professional and legal frameworks that safeguard the rights of citizens and employees and ensure the uninterrupted provision of services with the highest levels of efficiency and transparency".
"All government institutions and departments in Gaza and their employees across various sectors are fully prepared to cooperate with the committee in a manner that serves the public interest, contributes to improving services, alleviates citizens’ suffering and enhances administrative and institutional stability," the statement added.
It also underscored "the unity of Palestinian land and the political geography between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip”, stressing that "strengthening national unity and internal cohesion constitutes a top national priority at this sensitive stage".
Nearly a month after its formation was announced, the committee - led by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath - has yet to enter Gaza.
One day after its establishment was made public, the body began operating from Cairo in January.
The renewed appeal comes amid Israeli and Palestinian reports this week that Israel is preventing committee members from entering Gaza, while imposing a series of demands and conditions.
These reportedly include objections related to symbols, the committee’s identity, and a requirement that Hamas be disarmed as a precondition for transferring control of the Strip to another authority.
This is despite additional reports of American pressure on Israel to move forward with the committee’s work, which operates under the authority of the executive arm of Trump’s newly established Board of Peace, headed by Bulgarian diplomat Nikolay Mladenov.
As questions persist over the committee’s failure to enter Gaza, Israel attacks have persisted despite the 10 October ceasefire agreement, which was intended to pave the way towards ending Israel’s two-year genocidal war that began on 7 October 2023.
Since the deal was announced, at least 591 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,578 others wounded in Israeli attacks.
On Thursday, a Palestinian ambulance officer from Gaza died while being held in Israel’s Negev Prison, more than a year after his arrest, according to a joint statement issued by the Palestinian Prisoner Society and the Palestinian Commission of Detainees Affairs.
The Palestinian Civil Affairs Authority identified the deceased man as 59-year-old Hatem Ismail Rayan who was detained on 27 December 2024 from Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza.
His son, Moaz, who was injured at the time of his father’s arrest, remains in Israeli custody, the groups said.
The statement reported that as of 12 January, at least 87 Palestinian detainees whose identities are known have died in Israeli prisons since the start of the war on Gaza.
The causes cited include torture, starvation, sexual abuse, and the systematic denial of basic rights, alongside degrading and inhumane detention conditions.
The organisations estimate that the total number of Palestinians who have died in Israeli custody has now exceeded 100, noting that dozens of detainees from Gaza remain forcibly disappeared.
They also stated that dozens of Palestinians were summarily executed in the field.
Israel is additionally reported to be withholding the bodies of 95 deceased prisoners whose identities are known, including 84 who died after the outbreak of the Gaza war.
Since 1967, at least 324 Palestinian prisoners are known to have died while in Israeli custody, according to the two Palestinian rights bodies.
These developments come as Israeli forces continued bulldozing operations in Gaza on Friday.
According to The New Arab's sister site Al-Araby al-Jadeed, the Israeli army carried out four demolition operations targeting residential buildings in the southeast of Khan Younis.
Israeli forces have previously demolished homes east of Khan Younis in what residents describe as a renewed escalation against civilian neighbourhoods.
Media reports indicate that the Israeli military has continued demolishing buildings in areas of the Gaza Strip it has occupied since the ceasefire with Hamas came into effect - these areas cover more than half of the devastated territory.
Gaza's government has condemned the demolitions as a violation of the ceasefire agreement, while legal experts and the United Nations have repeatedly warned throughout the Gaza that the destruction of civilian infrastructure could constitute a war crime.

U.K. Ban on Palestine Action Group Under Terrorism Legislation Ruled Unlawful
Unknown

22:47:30 KST

The British government’s designation of Palestine Action as a terror group has been deemed unlawful by London’s High Court.
In a ruling issued on Friday, three senior judges said the decision implemented last July was “disproportionate” and breached free speech rights.
“At its core, Palestine Action is an organization that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality. A very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action within the definition at section 1(1) of the 2000 Act, ” the ruling stated. “We propose to make an order quashing the Home Secretary’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action.”
The High Court determined that former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (who now serves as Foreign Secretary) had not properly followed her own policies when deciding what constitutes an organization being proscribed under the Terrorism Act.
The government has vowed to appeal the decision.
For now, Palestine Action will remain a proscribed terror group until a consequential hearing takes place on Feb. 20. Any appeals will have to be laid out in that hearing and it will be determined what happens next.
As such, the High Court judges stressed that due to the proscription remaining in place, it is still an offence to support, fund, or belong to Palestine Action.
Despite that, demonstrators gathered outside of the court on Friday in support of the group, holding placards that read “we won” and “I’m not a terrorist.”
Huda Ammori, the co-founder of Palestine Action who brought the appeal over the designation to the High Court, also celebrated the decision. “We won. The High Court ruled the Palestine Action ban is unlawful as it is disproportionate to free speech,” she said.
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood intends to fight the ruling in the Court of Appeals.
“Supporting the Palestinian cause is not the same as supporting Palestine Action,” said Mahmood. “The court has acknowledged that Palestine Action has carried out acts of terrorism… and that its actions are not consistent with democratic values and the rule of law.”
“I am disappointed by the Court’s decision and disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organization is disproportionate,” she argued.
Prior to its designation as a terror group, Palestine Action was linked to a break-in at the Royal Air Force's Brize Norton air base in Oxfordshire, England, in June last year. Two planes were damaged during the incident.
Former Home Secretary Cooper cited the break-in when explaining her decision to add Palestine Action to the list of proscribed organizations.
“The disgraceful attack on Brize Norton in the early hours of the morning on Friday 20 June is the latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal damage committed by Palestine Action,” she told the House of Commons. “The U.K.’s defence enterprise is vital to the nation’s national security and this Government will not tolerate those that put that security at risk. Counter Terrorism Policing are leading the criminal investigation into this attack.”
Last month, five alleged Palestine Action protesters pleaded not guilty to offences relating to the air base break-in.
The government’s designation of Palestine Action as a terror group last year drew significant criticism from high-profile organizations such as Amnesty International, the U.K.-based Jewish Voice for Labour, and others.
United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk referred to the decision as “disproportionate and unnecessary.”
In August, hundreds of protesters were arrested by police as they gathered outside the British Parliament, holding placards in support of Palestine Action. By doing so, they broke the law in showing support for the group.

Sudan civil war: Ethiopia's, UAE's role under scrutiny

Sudan civil war: Ethiopia's, UAE's role under scrutiny
February 13, 2026The recent report by Reuters found that Ethiopia is hosting a secret camp to train thousands of fighters for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group in neighboring Sudan. The revelation is a sign that one of the world's deadliest conflicts is being fueled by regional powers from Africa and the Middle East.
The report is the first direct evidence that Ethiopia is indeed involved in the conflict in Sudan. It is reported to provide the Rapid Support Forces with a substantial supply of soldiers and training for the paramilitary group that has been battling Sudan's government troops since 2023.
According to the report, the camp's construction was financed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which also provided military trainers and logistical support to the site. However, the news agency could not independently verify the UAE's involvement. When the agency requested a comment, the UAE responded that it had no involvement and was not a party to the conflict.
"The Rapid Support Forces were reported to have set up camp in western Ethiopia two months ago," Abdurahman Seid, a geopolitical analyst for the Horn of Africa, told DW.
Sudan's government has long accused foreign powers of aiding the RSF. Martin Plaut, a journalist and Horn of Africa expert, told DW that there had been many indications that things would move in that direction.
"It's the UAE that is the driving force in all of this," Plaut said, adding that if the Ethiopians were ever against their interests, they would not have gone along with it. "It is absolutely clear that the UAE is now the main driver in what is going on."
No end to fighting soon
Plaut noted that it would take a miracle to end the ongoing conflict in Sudan. "It is going to be extremely difficult for either side to inflict a decisive defeat on the other because if you look at it this way, the RSF is supported by the UAE. It has support from sections of Libya, Chad, and Ethiopia," adding that they have a good base and sufficient funds.
"On the other hand, the Sudanese military is backed by Egypt, the Saudis [Saudi Arabia] and by Somalia," he said, stressing that neither side is going to run out of equipment, money, or personnel. "So, I don't see any end to the conflict."
Amza Hussein, a 54-year-old refugee, said that he had "lived through other wars in Sudan, but this one feels impossible to stop. Too many rebels are fighting."
In 2024, Ethiopia hosted over 50,000 Sudanese refugees, even as it faced its own challenges. Issues of food insecurity were paramount while it faced internal displacement, with 3.5 million Ethiopians uprooted by conflicts in Tigray, the Amhara and Oromia regions.
Humanitarian crisis
In early February, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, reported that acute malnutrition had reached famine levels in two more towns in Darfur. Last year, IPC warned that people in Darfur's major city of el-Fasher, which was captured by the RSF after an 18-month siege, were enduring famine.
According to the United Nations (UN), the war has claimed over 40,000 people and displaced an estimated 14 million others.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described the ongoing conflict in Sudan as "the world's worst health and humanitarian crisis." More than 20 million people are in need of health assistance and more than 21 million are in desperate need of food.
The WHO also said, "an estimated 33.7 million people will need humanitarian aid this year." However, severe access constraints and reduced humanitarian funding have worsened the situation in Sudan. Health services across the country have been severely affected by ongoing fighting and attacks, leading to shortages of health personnel and essential medical supplies.
WHO has reported that 201 attacks on health care have taken place since April 2023, with 1,858 deaths and 490 injuries.
Timeline of Sudan's brutal civil war
Sudan has been in conflict since April 2023, when fighting broke out between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). The roots of the conflict lie in Sudan's fragile political transition following the mass anti-government protests that began in December 2018 and led to the military ousting of long-time President Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.
After Bashir's removal, a tense power-sharing arrangement was negotiated between the military and civilian protest leaders. In August 2019, a transitional government was formed under a Sovereign Council composed of both military and civilian members, alongside a civilian-led cabinet headed by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok. The arrangement was meant to lead to Sudan's first-ever democratic elections.
However, on October 25, 2021, the military staged a coup that dissolved the civilian government. The coup was led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the SAF and chair of the Sovereign Council, alongside Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, widely known as Hemedti, the leader of the RSF. The two generals had previously shared power but joined forces to consolidate full military control.
Although Burhan and Dagalo were allies during the 2021 coup, tensions between them grew over the terms of a proposed new civilian transition—particularly over plans to integrate the RSF into the regular army, the timeline for security sector reform, and questions of ultimate command authority.
These disputes escalated into open warfare on April 15, 2023, beginning in the capital, Khartoum, before quickly spreading to other parts of the country, including Darfur, where the RSF has deep roots. The RSF itself evolved from the Janjaweed militias accused of atrocities during the Darfur conflict in the 2000s under Bashir's rule.

Teaching assistant jailed for abusing at least 20 children
A 26-year-old teaching assistant from Helmond has been sentenced to eight years in prison and compulsory psychiatric treatment for sexually abusing children under the age of 12.
The court was told that Wesley W had abused at least 20 victims over a period of 10 years. Until recently he worked as a classroom assistant at a primary school in his home town and also babysat for families. The abuse took place both at the school and at the children’s homes.
The youngest victim was two years old and the oldest 10, regional broadcaster Omroep Brabant reported.
W was arrested in September 2024 after several parents raised concerns about him. He has admitted almost all the offences.

Ukrainian forces strike Russian Nebo-U radar in Crimea, key targets in occupied territories
According to Ukrinform, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces said this in a post on Facebook.
"As part of systematic measures to reduce the offensive potential of the Russian aggressor, units of the Ukrainian Defense Forces carried out strikes overnight on February 13 against a number of key enemy targets in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine," the statement said.
In the temporarily occupied areas of the Zaporizhzhia region, enemy concentrations of personnel were hit near Solodkovodne and Liubymivka, while UAV operator deployment sites were struck near Tokmak and Mykhailivka.
In the temporarily occupied areas of the Donetsk region, an enemy logistics depot was hit near Selydove.
Yesterday, a 55Zh6U Nebo-U radar was struck near Yevpatoria in the temporarily occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea.
Also, near Komyshuvakha in the temporarily occupied areas of the Donetsk region, a concentration area of enemy military equipment was hit.
Enemy losses and the extent of the damage are being specified.

Sweden proposes making gang membership a jailable offence

The inquiry proposes adding two new crimes to Sweden's penal code: participating in a criminal organisation and associating with such an organisation.
A criminal organisation is defined as more than two people who commit crimes, or who otherwise contribute to serious crime, for financial gain or other "unfair advantage".
The goal, according to the inquiry's chair, Hans Harding, is to target several different groups of people.
"It's everything from loosely organised groups to well-organised criminal structures. This could include companies, motorcycle clubs, criminal networks and even family-based networks, what we call clans," he said.
The crime of association with a gang, he added, was designed to criminalise those who enable criminal gangs, and could be used to prosecute lawyers, accountants and bank officials who help gangs launder their money.
"It's not enough to just support the association in general, you have to do something active," Harding said.
Sweden's justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer, said that he was convinced the two new criminal offences would make it easier to crack down on gang crime.
"It could be gang leaders, or other people who in various ways enable gangs' criminal activities, without it being possible to tie them to a specific criminal act," he said.
The Swedish police estimate that around 1,000 people would be arrested on suspicion of committing one of the two crimes per year, of whom around 700 could be sentenced to prison.
The police have previously estimated that about 17,500 people are active in a criminal gang in Sweden, with a further 50,000 people linked to various gangs and gang members.
As the new law requires additional limitations to Sweden's constitutional right to free association, it will need two majority votes in parliament, once before a general election and second time after it.

The next round of U.S.-brokered peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia is set to take place in Geneva next week as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is about to enter its fifth year.
According to Russian state news agency Interfax and Ukrainian officials, both sides scheduled talks for Tuesday and Wednesday, Feb. 17-18, in Switzerland. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s press office confirmed the time and venue to POLITICO on Friday and said the delegation had begun preparations.
Moscow will be represented by Vladimir Medinsky, a Putin aide who led the Russian delegation in talks in Istanbul last year. Ukrainian media have portrayed his inclusion as a negative signal for the negotiations.

MSC: Germany's Merz says old world order 'no longer exists'

- Secretary of State Marco Rubio is representing the United States
- This year's MSC comes during turbulent times for the transatlantic relationship between the US and Europe
Read below for the latest headlines, videos and deep dives into the 2026 MSC from Friday, February 13 to Sunday, February 15
US top diplomat Marco Rubio meets China's Wang Yi in Munich
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met and talked on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday but shared no information about the talks with the press.
The Friday meeting was held behind closed doors at a hotel conference room with senior aides from both sides also in attendance. The talks lasted at least an hour, according to Rubio's team.
The US and China are locked in a prolonged standoff over trade and security issues. A deal between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in October averted Washington's threat of escalating tariffs on Chinese imports to 130% and a similar Chinese response, but tensions persist over US arms sales to Taiwan.
This week, Trump confirmed he would be visiting Xi Jinping in April.
"He will be coming to the US later in the year, and I look forward to it," Trump said.
Merz warns Europe's 'freedom' is at stake
Friedrich Merz has warned Germany's partners and allies in Europe that the freedom the continent has enjoyed since World War II "is no longer a given."
The chancellor urged European nations to "show firmness and determination to assert this freedom" amid challenges posed to the world order by China, Russia and the United States.
"This will require a willingness to engage in new beginnings, in change, and yes, also to make sacrifices. Not just some day, but right now," Merz said.
He said Europe's "huge" untapped potential needs to be fully realized if the bloc is to address global challenges.
Merz noted that although the EU's GDP is 10 times higher than Russia's, the bloc's global influence does not reflect that wealth.
"Our military, political, economic and technological potential is huge, but we haven't tapped it to the necessary extent for a very long time. So the most important thing is to turn the switch in our minds now," he said.
'We can shape the new world order,' Merz says
Friedrich Merz said European nations have reached "a different conclusion" on how to address the challenges posed by a new world order driven by big power politics.
While Washington and Donald Trump are pursuing an isolationist, "America First" approach, Europe, Merz said, does not have to accept a new global landscape dominated by major powers "as an inevitable fate."
"We are not at the mercy of this world, we can shape it," Merz said, arguing that Europeans can do so if they "step up together with determination and confidence in our own strengths."
"This way, we will weather the storm and preserve our freedom, we will push open new doors and seize new opportunities, if we get it right, we will emerge even stronger from this testing time," the German leader said.
Merz warns world has entered era of 'big power politics'
Friedrich Merz has warned that the world order is increasingly being defined by a return to power politics and rivalry between superpowers.
Merz said the post-World War II order, which had been shaped by US supremacy and Europe enjoying a "vacation from world history" under Washington's security umbrella, has come to an end.
"The United States' claim to leadership has been challenged, and possibly lost," Merz said, warning of the rise of Russia and China.
The chancellor said this shift was not only "rooted in the rivalry between great powers," but also reflected "restless, agitated societies in a time of revolutionary changes." He added that it expressed "a wish for strong leadership in a globalized world in which especially democratic states are coming close to the limit of their ability to act."
At first glance, "big power politics, it seems, gives strong and easy answers," Merz said — at least to the major powers.
Merz warned that big power politics are "fast, hard and often unpredictable," with natural resources, technologies and supply chains reduced to "bargaining tools in a zero-sum game."
"This is a dangerous game," the chancellor warned.
He said the US was already adapting to this changing world order "at a fast pace" and in a "radical" way that only serves to "accelerate" these changes.
Merz says old world order 'no longer exists'
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has started his opening speech to the Munich Security Conference (MSC) by stressing that the world has entered an era that is "once again marked by power and big power politics."
Merz highlighted Russia's "violent revisionism" and its "brutal war against Ukraine," as well as its attacks on the Western political order and infrastructure as evidence.
Merz also pointed out to China's growth in recent years. Beijing "wants to be a leader in shaping the world, and it has paved the way for that with strategic patience," Merz said.
"In the future, Beijing could be on an equal footing with the US in military terms," Merz added.
But the chancellor warned that China "systematcially uses dependencies of others" and is "redefining the international order in its own favor."

Greenlanders 'not happy' about US pressure, Greenland PM tells DW
A lot of Greenland residents are "scared" by the transatlantic crisis triggered by US President Donald Trump's ambition to annex the Danish territory, Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told DW.
"There live people in Greenland, and they're, of course, not happy with the situation," he said.
Talking to DW chief political correspondent Nina Haase at the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Nielsen emphasized that the dispute "still affects the Greenlandic people a lot, going through all the feelings you can imagine — if the biggest power in the world is talking about annexation and acquiring your country."
The prime minister also said he was due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the security conference.
"We have said from the beginning, if you want to do more on defense, on surveillance, on anything, we can talk about it. We already have a defense agreement," Nielsen said. "But we are ready to talk about anything when it's in mutual respect and in respect for international law and integrity."

Ukraine peace talks move to Geneva next week — Kremlin
While Western and Ukrainian leaders are attending the Munich Security Conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States on ending the war in Ukraine will move to Geneva next week.
According to Russian news agencies, Peskov said that the talks would take place on Tuesday and Wednesday and that Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky would lead the Russian delegation.
The talks in Geneva will follow two rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi. During those negotiations, Russia's team was led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of its military intelligence.
Medinsky's return, after leading the Russian team at earlier talks in Turkey in 2022 and again last year, could signal Russia's expectation that the focus will shift from security issues to the broader points of disagreement between the warring sides.
Meanwhile, Rustem Umerov, the head of Kyiv's delegation, said Ukraine hopes for "serious and responsible" talks with Russia backed by the US in Geneva on February 17-18.
The Ukrainian team remains the same and was "formed taking into account the military, political, and security components of
the process", Umerov wrote on the Telegram app.
NATO chief Rutte lauds 'staggering change' in Europe's defense approach
European members of the NATO military alliance have undergone a profound "shift in mindset" on defense and military spending, the NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Friday.
Rutte was speaking on the opening day of the Munich Security Conference, a day after he met with NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
"I felt a shift in mindset in the room," he said. "We had years, decades, of complaints by the US about the fact that in Europe we were not spending enough on defense. That has changed," the former Dutch prime minister said.
While calls for European NATO members to spend more have sharpened since Donald Trump returned to the White House, they have been a refrain of US administrations, both Republican and Democratic, for decades.
"Europe [is] taking more of a leadership role within NATO. Europe [is] also taking more care of its own defence. And this is really a staggering change," Rutte said.
He made the remarks during an appearance at the Transatlantic Forum, an event hosted by the conservative Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is helmed by Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul — both members of the CDU — also attended the event.
Wadephul told the forum that NATO's European members have the chance to step up and fill the void being created by Washington's increasingly isolationist approach to foreign policy.
"Now is Europe's moment," Wadephul said.
"We will only be able to weather the profound global upheavals we face if we preserve our alliances, if we stand by what has always made us strong and capable of defending ourselves," the German foreign minister said.
Old world order is gone and US-Europe ties face 'defining moment,' Rubio says
Ties between the US and Europe are facing a "defining moment," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned.
Rubio is the most senior US representative attending the Munich Security Conference, which began Friday.
"I think it's at a defining moment ... the world is changing very fast right in front of us," Rubio said Thursday, before leaving for Munich.
"The Old World is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
New era driven by Trump's 'wrecking-ball politics'
Many in Europe have argued that the US under Donald Trump has been the main driver of that changing world order. The head of the MSC, Wolfgang Ischinger, described Trump's approach as "wrecking-ball politics" that prioritises "sweeping destruction — rather than careful reforms and policy corrections."
At the MSC last year, US Vice President JD Vance strongly condemned Washington's European allies, signalling a major shift in the transatlantic relationship that has underpinned global security since World War II.
As part of the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, over the past year, the US has:
- withdrawn from international treaties and climate commitments
- slashed its contributions to global aid programs
- used punitive tariffs to disrupt global trade
- cast doubt over its long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia
Trump has also been pressing for Greenland — a semiautonomous, resource-rich Arctic territory that is part of Denmark — to become part of the US.
While he has since softened his stance following a "framework" agreement between the US and NATO over Greenland, the issue created a serious rift with US allies in Europe.
Washington's approach to diplomacy has forced its traditional European allies to pursue new, more independent policies that are less reliant on the US and its unpredictable leadership.
While acknowledging these changes, Rubio tried to strike a warmer tone than Trump or Vance have. The US top diplomat said his country remains "deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be. So we've just got to talk about what that future looks like."
European leaders are set to meet with Rubio during the conference, which runs until Sunday. Rubio will address the summit on Saturday morning.
The prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, said "several meetings with American politicians, including the secretary of state" will be held, with Greenland also set to be discussed.
At the start of the Munich conference on Friday, Frederiksen reiterated her warning to Denmark's European allies.
"The Americans have been very honest — from Trump's inauguration speech to a new security strategy and a new defence strategy, the threats against Greenland — everything points in one direction, namely that the US, unfortunately, is moving away" from Europe, she said.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is also set to have a private meeting with Rubio, where he's expected to sound out the secretary of state on what kind of policies Europe can expect from the United States.
German and Ukrainian foreign ministers open Ukraine House at MSC
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrij Sybiha, opened the Ukraine House at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday morning.
DW correspondent Michaela Kuefner reported ministers also held a bilateral meeting, adding that both countries have the joint challenge of keeping US President Donald Trump committed to NATO and convincing the US to bring Europe back into the Ukraine talks.
Wadephul said after the meeting that Ukraine is fighting for freedom in Europe and that Russian leader Vladimir Putin shows no willingness to end this war.
"We're working on a strong 20th sanctions package and will keep up the pressure on Russia. You can count on us," he wrote on X.
Meanwhile, Sybiha thanked Germany for its leadership in supporting Ukraine and strengthening the security of Europe.
"This year, German defense support for Ukraine is at record €11.5 billion ($13.6), while its winter energy assistance packages totalled €75 million," he wrote on X.
The Ukrainian minister also mentioned that he and his German counterpart discussed ways to advance Ukraine’s EU accession as part of security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe.
Later, Sybiha said that, after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, he had invited his Chinese counterpart to visit Ukraine and added that Beijing could help end the four-year war with Russia.
Europe is wide awake and evaluating its options
There is a sense of post-Greenland-shock at the Munich Security Conference.
Earlier comments and analyses about a "wake-up call" for Europe are no longer being used in the corridors. Europe is wide awake and clearly signaling that it is now looking in all directions — not just to the United States.
This is also expected to be a key theme of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's speech before he meets US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later today.
EU trade agreements with both the Mercosur group and India are living proof of Europe's newfound self-confidence. But the European security and strategic dependence on the US remains. And so does the commitment of US Congress, which has sent one of the largest delegations in history to the annual conference in Munich.

German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said the Munich Security Conference (MSC), which officially opens on Friday afternoon, represents a chance to reset transatlantic ties.
Relations between the United States and its NATO allies have been strained since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year.
Trump's insistence that the US "has to have" Greenland, a semiautonomous territory that is part of Denmark and will acquire it "one way or the other," has caused a serious diplomatic rift between Washington and most of its allies in Europe. Denmark and the US are both members of the NATO military alliance.
Trump and some of the top members of his administration have also been heavily critical of NATO's European members for what Washington says is their failure to spend enough on defense and for their perceived overreliance on the US military.
At the MSC last year, Trump's vice president, JD Vance, alarmed many in Europe when he used his keynote speech to highlight attempts by some countries in Europe to limit the rise of right-wing and far-right populism as proof of the weak state of European democracies and free speech. Vance also warned of the perceived perils of mass migration.
Wadephul acknowledged those tensions in remarks to German public broadcaster ARD on Friday morning in Munich, saying the "alliance is also under pressure."
"There is alienation, there is irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to talk about this here together. We want to define our common denominators and the meaning of NATO," Wadephul said.
Germany's Merz to meet Marco Rubio on Friday
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz plans to meet one-on-one with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and California Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday, said DW Chief Political Editor Michaela Kuefner.

Rome cuts down ageing pines along avenue leading to Colosseum

ROME, Feb 13 - Rome started cutting down ageing umbrella pines flanking the ancient Roman Forum on Friday after tests found a dozen were at risk of collapse.
Three large trees have fallen along the ceremonial avenue that links the Colosseum with Piazza Venezia since early January, slightly injuring three people.
The pines provide welcome shade during the summer months, but they have grown increasingly fragile, partly because of climate change with the weather in Rome marked by alternating periods of extreme heat and intense rainfall.
Authorities closed the panoramic road which is often packed with tourists, and convened a technical committee to investigate the problem.
It said in a statement on Friday that 12 of the first 36 trees tested in the vicinity of the forum were unstable, while 24 were either considered secure or required further checks.
The area has 54 historic pines, many believed to be around 120 years old.
The Rome statement said officials hoped to partially reopen the avenue to pedestrians from Monday, while additional tests continue on the remaining trees.
"The removed pines will be replaced with specimens of the same species, of suitable size and age," the statement said.
Besides suffering from extreme weather, many pines which used to dot Rome have succumbed in recent years to an invasion of the Pine Tortoise Scale parasite.
City officials estimated two years ago that up to 80% of its 60,000 pines were infested and launched a programme to try to counter the deadly pest. REUTERS

Dubai's DP World replaces leader after Epstein files naming
Dubai's DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Friday, replacing its former leader Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.
"DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as Chairman of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as Group Chief Executive Officer," the group said in a statement published by the Dubai media office.
The statement did not mention Sulayem.
Described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his "most trusted friends", Sulayem was group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the largest port operators on the globe.
He is cited more than 9,400 times in the documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, which revealed close ties between the two men.
They maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on intimate matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.
The wealthy Emirati businessman, was presented at the time by Epstein as close to Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid.
The correspondence suggests he visited the US sex offender in his home several times, including on his island.

Shirley Ballas sparks Strictly Come Dancing exit speculation after ‘landing new job’ in the US
The Head Judge once nearly quit ‘Strictly’ due to relentless trolling
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The next series of Strictly Come Dancing will be fronted by two new hosts – and fans are now wondering if the BBC could be searching for a new judge too.
Shirley Ballas, who joined as head judge in 2017, has sparked speculation that she could be about to exit the programme after reportedly landing a huge new job in the US.
The 65-year-old is said to be in talks to head stateside and serve as a judge on Dancing with the Stars: the Next Pro, an upcoming spin-off of the US version of Strictly.
The show will chart the hunt for a new addition to the US cast and Ballas is reportedly in the running for a spot on the panel alongside her son, Mark, who has been a professional dancer in 21 series of Dancing with the Stars. Its 2025 winner, Robert Irwin, is slated for hosting duties.
According to Deadline, the programme will air this summer – when vital preparation for Strictly is usually underway.
The news has left fans of the hit BBC show wondering if Ballas’s Strictly future could be in doubt, with one labelling it “very interesting” and writing on Reddit: “[It] makes me wonder if she’s considering leaving Strictly for the DWTS main show!”
“With Tess and Claudia leaving and now Shirley heading somewhere else, I’m afraid this may be the start of the end,” another said. “Hope she isn’t leaving!”
The Independent has approached representatives for the BBC and Ballas for comment.
Ballas joined Strictly in 2017, replacing Len Goodman, who had served as head judge since the first series in 2004.
The star, who was a world champion during her professional career, has often spoken candidly about the toll judging the show takes on her mental health.
The head judge traditionally has the deciding vote if a dance-off results in a deadlock, and Ballas has frequently found herself on the receiving end of relentless messages about her decisions.
Ballas admitted in 2023 that the trolling once left her on the verge of quitting the show, explaining: “Some of the messages were so cruel. Just, how ugly you are and how fat you are, and how you’ve got horrible arms, and, ‘You don’t like men. You don’t like women. You don’t like Black men. You don’t like Black women.’
“And then once it starts steamrolling, it goes even further.”
For 2025, Strictly bosses switched things up so that a different judge was given the deciding vote each week – but Ballas said she still found herself bearing the brunt of criticism when series favourite Lewis Cope was eliminated in the quarter-finals.
While all of the judges voted to save Amber Davies in the dance-off, Ballas said she was “called every name in the book” for telling Cope his dance wasn’t the best during the live show.
“After his dance, I just said: ‘It wasn’t your best day’ – which it wasn’t. Then they went to Craig [Revel Horwood], who said the same thing,” she told The i. “He scored him an eight, I gave him a nine, but I was blamed for him going home. I think it is disgraceful that somebody would write that.”

CAPE CANAVERAL /Florida/, February 13. /TASS/. Russian-American cooperation ensures continuous and relatively safe space exploration, US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) head Jared Isaacman said.
"We could bring our astronauts home early, knowing that the relationship we’ve constructed with our partners in Russia enables continuous operations of the space station in a relatively safe way. So I think that the design of the International Space Station really had a chance through its international partners; it had a chance to really showcase itself over the last month or so," he said, responding to reporters’ questions after the launch of the Crew Dragon spacecraft with the Crew-12 mission, which includes Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyayev.
Isaacman added that in the coming years, Russia and the US will have many opportunities for cooperation in space. "We're making preparations for a discussion with my counterpart (Roscosmos CEO Dmitry Bakanov - TASS) at the earliest opportunity. As you know, the ISS is going to still be up there for a long time. There is a lot that we need to accomplish together [with Russia] in the years ahead. There are certainly a lot of opportunities for good conversation," he said.
On February 13 at 1:15 p.m. Moscow time (10:15 a.m. GMT), the US company SpaceX launched the Crew Dragon manned spacecraft from Cape Canaveral in Florida using a Falcon 9 launch vehicle. The Crew-12 mission, consisting of Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyayev, NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, headed to the International Space Station.

Lebanon's Berri says parliamentary election must be held on time
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BEIRUT, Feb 13 - Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said on Friday he was committed to holding a parliamentary election as scheduled on May 10, despite calls from some politicians to postpone the vote.
Several politicians have called for a delay, citing security concerns in southern Lebanon, where Israel has carried out air strikes targeting Hezbollah.
Berri, a Shi'ite leader allied with Hezbollah, said in a statement carried by the state-run National News Agency that he had informed President Joseph Aoun and the government of his position.
"It is not permissible that, at the start of a new era, we obstruct its launch by disrupting, postponing or extending the most important constitutional entitlement, which is the foundation for forming authorities and producing political life," Berri said.
Berri has opened the candidacy registry for the election and submitted the first nomination request for the Tyre-Zahrani district in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon last held a parliamentary election in May 2022, a vote marked by low turnout and deep public anger over a financial collapse. The election saw some gains by reformist candidates emerging from the 2019 protest movement, while the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies lost their parliamentary majority. REUTERS

Trans people facing ‘workers’ rights crisis’ as court rules employers can ban trans women from using female toilets
But a High Court judge said service providers should be ‘guided by common sense and benevolence’ when providing toilet facilities to trans people
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Trans people are facing a “workers’ rights crisis”, campaigners have warned, after the High Court ruled that employers can legally ban transgender women from using female toilets and changing rooms in the workplace.
The Good Law Project and three individuals brought the legal challenge against Britain’s rights watchdog over interim “guidance” issued in the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling on the legal definition of a woman. The campaign group have since said they will challenge the ruling.
The latest ruling means that workplaces must provide single sex bathrooms on the basis of biological sex, with employers being unable to allow, for example, trans women to use the women’s toilets.
The only exception to this is if workplaces provide individual rooms which are lockable from the inside.
However, this does not mean that trans people will be required to use facilities corresponding with the sex they were assigned at birth. Instead, employers may be required to provide gender neutral facilities in addition to single sex bathrooms.
The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)’s guidance was published last April but was removed from the watchdog’s website in October.
It stated that trans women “should not be permitted to use the women’s facilities” in workplaces or public-facing services such as shops and hospitals, with the same applying for trans men using men’s toilets.
But Friday’s judgement also ruled that service providers are not required to exclude trans people from using toilet provisions which are in line with their lived gender, with a High Court judge saying service providers should be “guided by common sense and benevolence” rather than be “blinkered by unyielding ideologies” when providing toilet facilities.
Mr Justice Swift said on Friday that it was “fanciful” to suggest that the law seeks to regulate “every possibility that can arise” when providing facilities.
He also said that the notion that a person or employer was required to “police” the use of toilets “reveals the application of a ‘logic’ so strict that it is divorced from reality and from any sensible model of human behaviour”.
It has been reported that the EHRC’s draft code of practice - updated in the wake of the Supreme Court edict on biological sex in April and shared with the government last year - will force service providers to ban trans women from spaces such as women’s toilets and changing rooms.
But the latest ruling means that equalities minister Bridget Phillipson will likely ask the EHRC to redraft this guidance.
Jess O’Thomson, GLP’s trans rights lead, argued the judgement “makes it absolutely clear the law has been dangerously misrepresented”.
“Contrary to what has been widely claimed by politicians and the media, it can be entirely lawful for service providers to let trans women use the women’s toilets. The minister must now reject the draft Code – which is wrong about the law”, they said.
While this section of the High Court judgement can be seen as a victory for trans people, there are also concerns that it leaves deep inconsistencies in the law between the workplace and outside it.
“The legal situation for trans people, employers and service providers is now completely incoherent. What bathroom a trans person can use in a pub may now depend whether they are there as an employee or for a drink”, a spokesperson for the Trans Solidarity Alliance said.
“We are pleased the court has confirmed that the Equality Act does not function as a bathroom ban, but outdated workplace regulations have failed to keep up with modern times and last year’s Supreme Court judgment has made them entirely unworkable.”
The organisation warned that the implications of the judgement for workplaces means trans people are at risk of being outed at work, pointing out that they “may have been using gendered facilities without issue for years”.
“And it is unclear how trans people without access to gender neutral facilities will be able to do their jobs”, they added.
“This is a worker's rights crisis for the trans community, and one which will cause issues for employers across the country.
“The High Court has clarified that trans people should not be forced to use facilities in line with their birth sex, but it is hard to see how treating us as a 'third sex' at work aligns with the privacy protections in the Gender Recognition Act or the Human Rights Act.
“We must be allowed to transition and move on with our lives with privacy, not be outed every day at work.”
But Maya Forstater, CEO of gender critical campaign group Sex Matters, which intervened in the case, said: “This judgment vindicates the EHRC’s swift action in publishing practical guidance in April last year, just a few weeks after the Supreme Court judgment.
“The law is clear. There was never any excuse for the government, public bodies, regulators, charities or businesses to delay in implementing the Supreme Court judgment.
“We are proud to have provided witness evidence to the High Court to ensure that when the judge was thinking about the black letter of the law, he was also reminded of the underlying reality of what words like privacy, decency and propriety mean in the real world for women and girls using showers, changing rooms and toilets.”
In the ruling on Friday, Mr Justice Swift ruled that the GLP “does not have standing to bring the challenge in this case”, and also dismissed the individuals’ claims.
Following the ruling, the GLP said that it will seek to challenge the judgment at the Court of Appeal.
Jo Maugham, director and founder of the body, said that the ruling was “very distressing” and described aspects of it as “deeply troubling”.
“This is a very distressing judgment for me as a lawyer, as it will be for the trans community. Aspects of it - that wave away as ‘workplace gossip’ evidence of what it means to be outed in an increasingly transphobic and violent society - are deeply troubling”, he said.
“They remind me of how the pain of women was once dismissed as hysteria. I urge the judiciary to listen harder to what trans people say about what their lives have become.”

World hails Bangladesh elections as 'triumph of democracy', congratulates victorious BNP

The Bangladesh Election Commission declared on Friday that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won 209 seats, while its main competitor, a Jamaat-e-Islami party-led bloc, secured 77 seats in the 300-seat parliament.
Bangladesh held general elections on Thursday, the first since the 2024 popular uprising that ousted the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
Reactions have poured in from several countries, including Dhaka’s neighbours, who congratulated Tarique Rahman, the BNP leader, and hailed the elections as a triumph of democracy.
China
China extended support to Dhaka and hailed the “steady and smooth” elections held a day earlier; Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Beijing supports Dhaka “in advancing its domestic political agenda.”
China stands ready to “work with Bangladesh to take the bilateral comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership forward,” Lin told reporters in Beijing.
Pakistan
Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Rahman on his “resounding victory” and the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.
“I look forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership to further strengthen our historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability and development in South Asia and beyond,” Sharif said.
Pakistan and Bangladesh have seen ties warming in recent months.
India
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said New Delhi will continue to support a “democratic, progressive and inclusive” Bangladesh in a post on X.
Modi also held a phone call with Rahman after the declaration of victory.
“I conveyed my best wishes and support in his endeavour to fulfil the aspirations of the people of Bangladesh,” Modi said.
“As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India’s continued commitment to the peace, progress and prosperity of both our peoples.”
However, on Thursday, New Delhi declined Dhaka's invitation to send election observers, even as approximately 400 international observers and 200 foreign journalists monitored the polls.
"We did receive an invitation to send observers. We have not sent our observers to Bangladesh to observe the elections," Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said during a briefing in New Delhi.
Ties between the neighbours have soured ever since Hasina fled to India in August 2024.
Dhaka has demanded that New Delhi hand over the former prime minister, who was sentenced to death in absentia by Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal in November 2025 for her role in the 2024 crackdown.
Maldives
Extending warm regards to the BNP, Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu expressed readiness to “work closely together to further advance and deepen the longstanding friendship and cooperation between the Maldives and Bangladesh.”
Malaysia
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim called the BNP victory “a triumph of democracy”, offering congratulations to Rahman and the party on their “emphatic election victory”.
US
The United States congratulated the party led by Rahman on its "historic victory" in elections, its embassy in Dhaka said.
"Congratulations to the people of Bangladesh on a successful election and to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and Tarique Rahman on your historic victory," the statement read.
"The United States looks forward to working with you to realise shared goals of prosperity and security."

Good Law Project loses challenge to interim EHRC advice on single-sex spaces

22:32:59 KST

The Good Law Project (GLP) has lost its legal challenge to interim advice released by the UK equalities watchdog that in effect said transgender people should be banned from using bathroom and changing facilities according to their lived gender.
The advice from the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), which has since been withdrawn from its website, was published soon after the landmark supreme court ruling on biological sex last April.
On Friday, Mr Justice Swift found the GLP “does not have standing to bring the challenge in this case” and rejected the arguments put by the group, along with two trans people and one intersex person, that the interim advice was rushed, legally flawed and excluded trans people from accessing services they had been using for years.
Welcoming the high court decision, the EHRC chair, Dr Mary-Ann Stephenson, said: “As Britain’s equality regulator, we uphold and enforce the Equality Act. This is the second time the way we have done our duty in the wake of the supreme court’s ruling has been tested in the courts. Both times our actions have been found to be lawful.
“It’s our job to champion everyone’s rights under the Equality Act, including those with the protected characteristics of sex, sexual orientation and gender reassignment. A shared and correct understanding of the law is essential to that endeavour.”
The ruling did find there was “scope for a strong argument” that allowing a trans woman to use a female toilet did not amount to discrimination against biological men, as some have argued since the supreme court ruling.
But in applying the ruling to workplaces, Swift came to the conclusion that transgender employees being forced to out themselves to co-workers by using unisex toilets did not amount to less favourable treatment in the eyes of the law, stating “up to a point, being the subject of comment by others is burden that anyone can expect to bear from time to time, and ought not to be a foundation for legal redress”.
The GLP director and founder, Jolyon Maugham, said this “wave away as ‘workplace gossip’ evidence of what it means to be outed in an increasingly transphobic and violent society” was “deeply troubling”. The GLP said it planned to appeal against the decision.
Maugham added: “I urge the judiciary to listen harder to what trans people say about what their lives have become.”
Melanie Field, a former civil servant who played a key role in drafting the Equality Act, said: “Sadly this judgment has not provided the clarity many were hoping for in this atmosphere where there are hardline positions on both sides and employers and service providers remain uncertain of their duties. Its reliance on the provision of universal and ‘third spaces’ to meet the needs of trans people raises practical challenges and could impact on the overall availability of single-sex facilities and the ability of trans and disabled people to live in equal dignity with others.
“It is positive in that it seems to reduce the risk that a women’s service that chooses to include trans women will face a successful discrimination case from a man. But overall the judgment highlights the difficulties caused by having a new interpretation of the legislation which conflicts with the original policy and drafting intention. Hopefully the government will now take steps to set out clearly its policy on the treatment of trans people in our society and ensure the law reflects that.”
The high court judgment is a significant boost for campaigners who have been growing increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of application of the ruling across the UK.
Earlier this month For Women Scotland, the gender-critical group that brought the original supreme court challenge, took the Scottish government to court again over guidance that trans prisoners should be housed according to individual risk assessment, which the group argues is contrary to last April’s ruling.
Maya Forstater, the chief executive of the gender-critical campaign group Sex Matters, which intervened in the GLP case, said the UK government’s equalities minister, Bridget Phillipson, “should now lay the full EHRC code of practice for service providers before parliament without further delay”.
UK ministers are still considering final guidance from the EHRC on new rules on how public bodies, businesses and other service providers should apply the supreme court ruling in practice.
Last month, the Guardian was told that in a change in approach under Stephenson, the new rules were being adapted to lessen the impact on businesses and to ensure the guidance tries to balance single-sex spaces with the lives of transgender people.

US military says it completed Syria mission to transfer ISIS members to Iraq
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 13 - U.S. military forces have completed their mission in Syria to transfer Islamic State detainees to Iraq, U.S. Central Command said on Friday.
"The 23-day transfer mission began on Jan. 21 and resulted in U.S. forces successfully transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS fighters from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody," Central Command said in a statement.
The transfer started after a rapid offensive by Syrian government forces in northeast Syria against Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a U.S. ally which had guarded the Islamic State detainees and the facilities where they were incarcerated for years.
On January 29, the United States brokered a ceasefire deal that set out a phased integration of Kurdish fighters into the central state.
U.S. Maj. Gen. Kevin Lambert, a CENTCOM commander, said “The successful execution of this orderly and secure transfer operation will help prevent an ISIS resurgence in Syria.”
Iraq’s foreign minister Fuad Hussein told Reuters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that discussion with “some Arab and Muslim countries” to take back their citizens had started.
Baghdad would need more financial assistance to deal with the influx, Hussein said. REUTERS

The United States is more anchored than ever in NATO as European countries increase their defense efforts, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Friday.
Delivering doorstep remarks at the Munich Security Conference, Rutte highlighted that Europeans and Canada are finally taking greater responsibility for collective defense.
"Europe is really stepping up, taking more of a leadership role within NATO, and also taking more responsibility for its own defense. I think this will only strengthen NATO," he said.
"We will stick together with the United States anchored more than ever inside NATO, because they know that what they have asked for decades, Europeans and Canada are taking more care of the collective defense, particularly spending," Rutte said.
He also stressed the importance of continued support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war.
"More money is coming in to support Ukraine in the war effort, but we still need more. Particularly, we need interceptors. We need the ammunition to make sure Ukraine can stay strong in the fight," Rutte said.

Macron denounces 'antisemitic hydra' and calls for election bans for antisemitic and racist acts

President Emmanuel Macron denounced what he described as an "antisemitic hydra" on Friday, February 13, saying it had crept into "every crack" of society as he commemorated Ilan Halimi, a French Jewish man tortured to death in 2006.
In a crime that horrified France in January 2006, Halimi was kidnapped by a gang of around 20 youths and tortured, in a low-income housing estate in the Paris suburb of Bagneux. Found three weeks later, the 23-year-old died on the way to the hospital.
"In 20 years, and despite the resolute efforts of our police officers, gendarmes, judges, teachers and elected officials, the antisemitic hydra has kept advancing," he said. "Constantly assuming new faces, it has insinuated itself into the heart of our societies, into every crevice, too often accompanied by that same pact of cowardice: to keep silent, to refuse to see," he added.
Speaking at his presidential palace, Macron decried what he called "Islamist antisemitism which was behind the pogrom of October 7," referring to the attack against Israel on October 7, 2023 by Palestinian militant group Hamas. The term "pogrom" refers to violent attacks on Jews because of their religion.
He also attacked "far-left antisemitism," saying it "rivals that of the far right," and "antisemitism that uses the mask of anti-Zionism to advance quietly."

Macron also said he wanted "mandatory electoral bans" for officials guilty of "antisemitic, racist, and discriminatory acts and remarks." All too often, the sentences handed down against the perpetrators of antisemitic offenses and crimes seem derisory," he said. "Government and parliament will work to strengthen the penalties for antisemitic and racist acts," he added.
France is home to Western Europe's largest Jewish population, at around half a million people, as well as a significant Muslim community sensitive to the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza.
Members of France's Jewish community have said the number of antisemitic acts has surged following the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023, which triggered Israel's military response in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.

Lloyds sets out new pay policy with potential for boss to land £17.7m payout
Lloyds said the changes would more closely align pay to the financial performance of the bank.
- Bookmark
Lloyds has revealed that its boss’s pay package jumped by a fifth in 2025, and set out proposals that could mean he has the potential to earn as much as £17.7 million this year.
Total pay for group chief executive Charlie Nunn jumped to £7.4 million in 2025, from £6.2 million the prior year.
This was driven by an increase in his salary as well as a bigger annual bonus and long-term share awards.
Mr Nunn “demonstrated strong leadership throughout another challenging year for consumers”, the banking group said in its annual report, published on Friday.
Chief finance officer William Chalmers also saw his total pay rise by 18% to £5 million for 2025.
The payouts come on the back of Lloyds reporting a 12% increase in its annual pre-tax profit to £6.7 billion, while it also upped the outlook for key performance measures in 2026.
Annual bonus awards took into account the fact that Lloyds’ financial performance was impacted by it setting aside another £800 million charge in the third quarter to compensate customers unfairly sold a car loan, bringing the group’s total bill so far for the saga to £1.95 billion.
Lloyds also set out plans to change how its top bosses are compensated, which it said would more closely align pay to the financial performance of the bank.
The proposals involve increasing the maximum annual bonus award for the chief executive from 140% to 300% of their base salary, and the maximum long-term incentive plan from 300% to 500%.
At the same time, it intends to cut fixed pay by about 44%, which means there are more consequences if the bank’s performance does not hit targets.
The policy means that if Mr Nunn hits all his performance targets, which are greater than those set in 2025, then he could earn £13.9 million this year.
Furthermore, in a scenario where Lloyds’ share price increases by 50%, his pay packet could rise to a maximum of £17.7 million.
Lloyds’ share price rose by about 75% last year.
Lloyds said the proposals, which shareholders will vote on at this year’s annual general meeting, will bring the total reward package on offer to executives closer to what similar banks are doing.
The chief executive of Barclays, CS Venkatakrishnan, was handed a £15 million pay packet for 2025, up from the £11.6 million he took home in 2024.
NatWest’s boss Paul Thwaite saw his total pay jump by a third last year to £6.6 million.
Mr Thwaite said on Friday that he recognised that senior roles in banking and financial services are “very well paid” and that he was “fortunate”.

Dual nationals to be denied entry to UK from 25 February unless they have British passport

Dual British nationals have been warned they may be denied boarding a flight, ferry or train to the UK after 25 February unless they carry a valid British passport.
The warning by the Home Office comes amid scores of complaints from British people living or travelling abroad who have suddenly found themselves at risk of not being allowed into the UK.
The problem has arisen because of a change in border controls on 25 February, when everyone travelling to the UK will need permission to travel, unless they are a British or Irish citizen or are otherwise exempt. Visitors for short stays must apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation that costs £16.
But dual nationals will, for the first time, be obliged to show their British passport to travel to the UK or pay what many believe is a punitive price of £589 for a “certificate of entitlement” to attach to their second nationality passport in order to board a flight, ferry or train.
One British woman living in Germany for years who has dual nationality said she feared her children were going to be affected by the changes, particularly her son who is due to travel to the UK in four weeks’ time.
“I’m really annoyed about being treated as Brexit collateral once again with this short-notice, shortsighted, arbitrary change of the rules,” she said.
While the government introduced the rules last year, she and many others feel they had not been communicated well to those living abroad and that keeping up two passports for a family is an expensive “luxury” that not everyone can afford.
One British woman living in Spain for more than 30 years chose to take out Spanish citizenship because of Brexit and up to now was free to go to and from the UK with her Spanish passport.
But Spain requires non-nationals naturalising to renounce their previous nationality and presenting her British passport at the airport will legally risk her Spanish nationality.
She said she is aware that many will argue she should not have renounced her British passport but that this change of rules will apply to many children of British citizens born in Spain who have never held a British passport but whose records will show as dual nationality at border control.
“It seems a strange anomaly that while the UK is willing to recognise dual nationality, it refuses to recognise that a valid EU passport held by a UK citizen can give right of entry to the UK,” said Julie, who asked that her real name not be used.
Another dual national born and educated in London told how he had booked a flight for a work trip in the last week and has only just discovered he may be stranded. He is British Italian but has never held his own British passport and has freely travelled around for his job on his Italian passport.
He is due to fly to New York on Friday with his Italian passport but returns after 25 February and won’t be able to present immigration with an ETA or a British passport. Asked if he had considered paying £589 for a certificate of entitlement to attach to his Italian passport, he said the weeks-long backlog made it impossible to get hold of before Friday.
“I found myself having to travel at short notice and am now facing the idea that I may not be allowed back into the country,” said James, who is travelling to a museum in New York to complete logistics on works of art being lent to a gallery in Europe.
A Home Office spokesperson said: “From 25 February 2026, all dual British citizens will need to present either a valid British passport or certificate of entitlement to avoid delays at the border.”
They said this was part of a digitisation programme to enable a “seamless travel experience”, while also giving the government “greater power to stop those who pose a threat from setting foot in the country and gives us a fuller picture of immigration”.
The EU citizens’ campaign group The 3 million called for a low-cost, one-off travel authorisation similar to one in Canada in place of the £589 certificate currently available.
“The UK already has the technology to do the same, so we urge them to act now to ensure British citizens are not locked out of their own country,” said Monique Hawkins, the head of policy and advocacy at The 3 million.

From Latin America to Israel, Trump escalates foreign political interventions
Unknown

22:27:20 KST

The harsh remarks voiced Thursday by U.S. President Donald Trump against President Isaac Herzog for not granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu surprised many. In practice, however, they marked another milestone in a style long associated with Trump, one far more explicit than the American interventions of past decades in other countries’ domestic affairs, particularly elections. In earlier eras, such efforts were carried out through covert or special CIA operations. Today, the approach appears different.
Trump’s extension of influence into political systems abroad seems paradoxical in light of statements he made just last year. In a speech in Riyadh in May, he condemned interference in the affairs of foreign states, at least in the Middle Eastern context, saying past American attempts had turned into disasters.
His interventionist approach has been especially blunt in Latin America, a region with a long history of U.S. involvement. The most memorable recent episode was the U.S. move in Venezuela, where Washington had been unable to influence the elections. American Delta Force soldiers raided the fortified compound of President Nicolás Maduro, arrested him and brought him, along with his wife, to stand trial in the United States. His vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, was subsequently appointed president and has cooperated almost fully with American demands.
In Brazil, Trump intervened in an effort to aid his ally, former President Jair Bolsonaro. His administration imposed sanctions on senior judicial officials over their role in prosecuting Bolsonaro for an alleged coup attempt. Trump also temporarily imposed tariffs on Brazilian goods in an attempt to pressure authorities to release him.
In Argentina, Trump pledged last year to inject $220 billion into the country’s struggling economy but warned he would withhold the funds if voters rejected the party of President Javier Milei, a libertarian right-wing ally, in midterm legislative elections. Milei’s party ultimately prevailed.
Another notable intervention came late last year in Honduras, when Trump urged voters to support right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura, the son of Palestinian immigrants, calling him “the only true friend of liberty.” In a post, Trump promised cooperation if Asfura won but warned that if he lost, U.S. aid to the impoverished country would be cut. Asfura went on to win.
Silman’s warning: No pardon could mean sanctions
Whether Trump intends to intervene in Israel’s elections this year remains an open question. Israel maintains far deeper ties in Washington than most of the countries mentioned. During his first term, Trump explicitly said he would be happy to work with any prime minister Israelis chose, including Benny Gantz. Still, it is difficult to ignore the unusual praise he has heaped on Netanyahu in recent months, calling him, among other things, “a great leader in a time of war.”
After criticizing Herzog on Thursday, Trump said, “Bibi was a great prime minister during war, and I was the best friend Israel, I think, has ever had. People say more than any president they ever had. And I will continue to be.” The pardon issue Trump is promoting, both publicly and behind the scenes, has already led figures in Netanyahu’s camp to harness that intervention to advance their interests. Chief among them is Environmental Protection Minister Idit Silman, who warned that if Herzog does not heed Trump’s request to grant a pardon, the U.S. president “could take steps and impose sanctions, possibly on senior officials in the judicial system.” For now, Trump has limited himself to attacking Herzog and has not said he intends to take action. “He should be ashamed that he is not giving a pardon to Prime Minister Netanyahu,” Trump said emphatically, a day after meeting Netanyahu at the White House.
Netanyahu himself has not commented on Trump’s involvement in the pardon matter, perhaps unsurprisingly. When Trump raised the issue in a speech at the Knesset last October, Netanyahu appeared uncomfortable in his seat in the plenum but thanked Trump while clasping his hands. Herzog also smiled awkwardly at the remarks. Not only Netanyahu and coalition members remained silent after Trump’s comments Thursday, opposition lawmakers were also largely quiet. The President’s Residence later clarified that consideration of the request would not be influenced by external pressure.
“The prime minister’s request is, according to the rules, under review at the Justice Ministry for a legal opinion, and only after the process is complete will the president examine the request in accordance with the law, the good of the state, and his conscience, without any influence from external or internal pressures,” the statement said.
In his pardon request, Netanyahu did not admit to the charges against him. He argued that while his personal interest is to continue managing the trial and prove his innocence, the public interest dictates otherwise. “In recent years, tensions and divisions have intensified among segments of the people and between state authorities,” Netanyahu wrote to Herzog. “I am aware that the proceedings in my case have become a focal point of fierce disputes. I bear broad public and moral responsibility, understanding the implications of all these events.”
According to the request, the grounds for a pardon are “the good of the state,” which would enable him to continue managing state affairs. “The prime minister believed from the outset, and still believes, that if the legal process runs its course it will end in full acquittal,” the request states. “He has significant criticism of law enforcement authorities’ conduct in handling his case, and these matters have been and continue to be proven in court. For many years, the prime minister has been determined to prove these matters through every legal means available to him.”
‘Trump feels he has friends he wants to help’
Trump has also sought to weigh in on European elections. His homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, expressed open support during a visit to Poland for conservative presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki, who later won the election. In Romania, however, Trump saw less success when his far-right ally lost, albeit in a rerun vote after the initial ballot was controversially annulled. Vice President JD Vance has also taken part. During a visit to Germany, he publicly criticized restrictions imposed on the far-right Alternative for Germany party, known as AfD.
In Britain, Trump and his aides have praised rising right-wing leader Nigel Farage, who campaigns against immigration and is climbing in the polls. In France, they criticized the conviction of far-right leader Marine Le Pen for embezzlement, a ruling expected to prevent her from running for president in 2027 at a time when she is at the height of her political strength.
Researcher Dov Levin wrote in a 2021 book that since World War II, the United States has intervened in more than 80 foreign elections, more than any other country in the world. Still, according to Thomas Carothers, director of the Democracy, Conflict and Governance Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Trump is unique not only in the public manner in which he acts, but also in his apparent motives. “This is different from the Cold War era, when the United States often preferred a particular individual but did so for geostrategic reasons,” Carothers said. “What we have here is more a situation in which Donald Trump feels he has a group of friends around the world that he wants to help.”
Carothers said only Russia, which frequently interferes in elections in former Soviet bloc countries such as Moldova, comes close to U.S. methods. “A very high percentage of European leaders would like to see Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán lose next year’s election, but they would not say so out loud,” he said. Trump, for his part, has repeatedly welcomed Orbán, including at the White House. At a joint news conference last year, he used the opportunity to bolster him, saying European leaders should appreciate Orbán more.

VILNIUS, February 13. /TASS/. Lithuania’s authorities plan to spend 223 million euro on military aid to Ukraine in 2026, the country’s defense ministry said.

According to the minister, the money will be spent to buy air defense systems, artillery rounds, and support drone production in Ukraine.
In 2024, Lithuania undertook to allocate 0.25% of its GDP, or around 190 million euro, on Ukraine’s defense and security needs annually. In 2025, it reiterated this committement.

KitchenAid debuts new stand mixer colour – and it will definitely stand out on your counter
The brand’s iconic stand mixer has been given a fresh look and feel
- Bookmark
Kitchenaid has dropped an annual limited-edition shade for the last eight years, from bang-on-trend yellow in 2025 to periwinkle blue the year before that. Now, the kitchen appliance aficionado has served up a refreshing colour to zhoosh up our kitchens – ‘spearmint’ green.
Available for the brand’s 4.7l stand mixer, the toothpaste-fresh hue is described by the brand as a “feel-good shade” that “lifts your space and mood while indulging your playful, expressive side”. This make-over also includes a fresh new finish, too – instead of a high-shine finish, the mixer is matte, having been designed with a sandy and tactile feel.
The brand serves up a host of high-performance, retro-style kitchen appliances, spanning everything from blenders and toasters to coffee machines and kettles, but its stand mixer is its most iconic. It’s a hefty investment, but its popularity speaks volumes. As for our verdict? In our review of the best stand mixers, our kitchen appliance tester dubbed it the ‘perfect buy’.
If the mixer has been on your wishlist for awhile and you’re a fan of the spearmint colourway, let this be your nudge to finally invest. To find out everything you need to know about the mixer, keep reading.

Kitchenaid 4.7l artisan stand mixer
In the brand’s new, limited-edition ‘spearmint’ green the Kitchenaid 4.7l artisan is an excellent choice for home cooks and bakers. It was the first home stand mixer to work with a planetary action – that is, the shaft and the mixing accessory rotate in opposite directions for better reach – and features 20 different speeds. It comes with a 4.7l and a 2.8l bowl as well as plenty of accessories, including a pastry beater, a whisk for aerating, a dough hook for kneading and a flex edge beater for stickier mixtures, and features a tilt-head design for easy access and cleaning.
In her review of the best stand mixers, our kitchen appliance tester was impressed with its performance when testing the 4.8l model. “There’s real force behind this machine; it seems like it could run for hours without faltering (not that that’s necessary, given our egg whites reached soft peaks in mere moments)”, they said. While it’s definitely not cheap, they said that, “if you’re going to have this machine forever – and you really might – it’s worth the investment.”

Norway’s Klaebo makes history on skis, ties all-time Winter Olympics gold record
TESERO, Italy (AP) — Friday the 13th will be remembered as a lucky day for Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo. Norway’s cross-country skiing star won an eighth gold medal at the Milan Cortina Olympics Friday, tying an all‑time Winter Games record. The 29‑year‑old claimed victory in the men’s 10 kilometer interval‑start race, for his third gold at the 2026 games.
Will three races still ahead of him, Klaebo now shares the record with three other Norwegian athletes who have all retired: Marit Bjoergen and Bjoern Daehlie in cross-country skiing and Ole Einar Bjoerndalen in the biathlon. Klaebo again gained vital ground in the final hill and clocked 20 minutes, 36.2 seconds, showing rare signs of fatigue as he collapsed at the finish line of the race considered to be his toughest challenge.
He was 4.9 seconds head of Frances’s Mathis Desloges and 14 in front of his main challenger Einar Hedegart also of Norway who lost momentum on the last hill.
“It’s a special day,” Klaebo said. “This one means a lot for sure … I’m lost for words.”
The Norwegian said he was happy with his tactics, racing the first half of the course with a controlled pace, saving energy for a burst up the last hill and home stretch.
“It was really hard out there today so I’m very proud,” he said.
Over at the French camp, athletes and team officials celebrated as if they had one the race, linking arms and dancing on the snow after underdog Mathis Desloges won his second silver medal, competing at his first Olympics at Milan Cortina. “I trained incredibly hard for these races,” Desloges said. “I told people I was at this level — and now we are delivering.” The 23-year-old Frenchman, like many other top racers in the interval start, was mostly unaware of his position during the race.
“I don’t really pay attention to what’s being shouted from the sidelines,” he said. “Honestly, I don’t listen to them. I just focus on my race. I know what I have to do and I give it everything.” On a blue-sky day in northern Italy, with the race track surrounded by the snow-capped Dolomite mountains, temperatures hovered around 5 degrees Celsius (41 Fahrenheit). A few racers chose to compete wearing only their race bibs.
Organizers had treated the course with salt Thursday to harden the surface but left it untouched Friday — a decision that favored Klaebo, who started early among the seeded skiers. Celebrations were led by Norwegian fans: national flags — red with a blue cross outlined in white — were draped over athletes and the railing on the spectators’ area. Klaebo’s grandfather, Kare Hoesflot, who helped launch his career traveled to northern Italy to watch the race, while messages of congratulations poured in from back home, where cross-country skiing is a prime time sport.
“Another show of strength from Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo. What a performance in a thriller of a race! Congratulations on gold number three in these Olympics!,” Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere wrote on social media. Finn Dahl, a retired marketing manager from Norway, watched Klaebo win, and credited his success to relentless hard work.
“He’s so dedicated. He sacrificed everything in terms of training, how he eats, how he sleeps and calms down after races,” he said.
“It’s fantastic … he’s up to eight now,” Dahl said. “I hope he’ll be the biggest winner ever.” —-

Ukraine puts former Presidential Office official, his brother on wanted list
That is according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's "Wanted Persons Registry" website, Ukrinform reports.
In addition to Rostyslav Shurma, his brother Oleh Shurma has also been placed on the wanted list.
Both men are listed as having gone missing on February 12, 2026. The charges brought against both brothers are Part 5 of Article 191 (embezzlement, misappropriation of property, or its seizure through abuse of office) and Part 3 of Article 209 (legalization/laundering of proceeds of crime) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
According to the case files, no preventive measure has been imposed on either brother.
Ukrinform reported earlier that the Cabinet of Ministers had prematurely terminated Rostyslav Shurma's term on the supervisory board of Naftogaz of Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky dismissed Rostyslav Shurma from the post of Deputy Head of the Presidential Office on September 3, 2024. He had held the position since November 23, 2021.
On January 21, 2026, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office announced that they had uncovered a scheme to embezzle funds earmarked for payments under the "green tariff," which benefited a number of commercial power-generating companies located in the temporarily occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia region.
During the investigation, law enforcement notified nine people of suspicion, including a former deputy head of the Presidential Office and former member of the supervisory board of Naftogaz of Ukraine; his brother, the owner of a network of Ukrainian and foreign companies; a trusted associate of the former high-ranking official; managers and employees of affiliated companies; and the former commercial director of Zaporizhzhiaoblenergo.
In February 2026, Shurma said he was ready to cooperate with the National Anti-Corruption Bureau but was currently in Germany.

15 unmissable game announcements at Sony’s State of Play
Sony’s showcase was a nostalgia-fuelled event, featuring the return of Kratos, a new Castlevania and a surprise John Wick game
- Bookmark
Worried that 2026 was going to be a quiet year for the PlayStation 5? Well you can rest easy. Sony’s latest State of Play presentation was packed with new games and enough remakes and sequels to keep your nostalgia-tank topped up until the PS6 rolls around.
The headline act was a double dose of Kratos. Not only did we get the confirmation of a full-blown God of War Trilogy Remake – bringing the original Greek saga up to modern standards – but Sony surprised us with God of War: Sons of Sparta, a retro-style side-scroller available to play right now.
There’s a new John Wick game in the works, while Konami continued its redemption arc with a glut of major announcements for Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, and Castlevania. We also got our first proper look at the future of Bungie’s Marathon.
Whether you missed the live stream or just want the highlights without the filler, I’ve rounded up every major trailer and game announced at State of Play 2026.

God of War Trilogy Remake
After years of rumours, Santa Monica Studio confirmed that the original PS2 and PS3 trilogy is being rebuilt from the ground up for the PS5. It’s still early days, but the teaser trailer confirms that Kratos’s original voice actor, Terrence C. Carson, is returning to the role. Great news if you miss the angry, shouting Kratos before he became a sad dad.
Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2
The moustache-heavy Metal Gear Solid 4 has finally escaped the confines of the PlayStation 3. The second volume of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection arrives on 27 August and includes MGS4, Peace Walker and MGS5.
John Wick
The John Wick movies are already pretty videogamey, so it’s a wonder it’s taken this long to get an official (and as yet untitled) John Wick game. Starring Keanu Reeves and developed by Saber Interactive, the game promises action-heavy “gun-fu” on next-gen hardware.
Silent Hill Townfall
We got a suitably spooky first look at Silent Hill Townfall. The trailer for the first-person psychological horror was light on story but heavy on creepiness, all excitingly set in a nightmarish version of a small UK town this time. There’s even a newsagent’s!
Marathon
Bungie’s extraction shooter is inching closer to release. A new story and gameplay trailer showed off a slick, stylised sci-fi world that looks distinctly different from Destiny. A beta test is running from 26 February to 2 March, with the chance to unlock rewards that carry through to the full game.
God of War: Sons of Sparta
In a delightful surprise, this 2D side-scrolling prequel launched during the show. It focuses on a young Kratos and features pixel-art combat. It’s available on the PlayStation Store immediately.
Pragmata
Capcom’s mysterious sci-fi astronaut puzzler re-emerged with a new trailer and a free demo that you can download right now. If you’ve been wondering what the game is actually about since its 2020 reveal, now is your chance to take a look.
Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition
Ubisoft is honouring its limbless hero with a collection of five playable versions of the original game, including a lost prototype and a documentary. It lands digitally today.
Kena: Scars of Kosmora
A sequel to the charming Bridge of Spirits, this looks bigger, darker, and more combat-focused. It’s set in a new location with an overhauled fighting system and is slated for a 2026 release.
Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse
At last, we’re getting a brand new 2D Castlevania game. This one is set in France, renowned for its castles and its vanias, and marks the first mainline 2D entry in the series for years. It’s launching in 2026.
007 First Light
We got another peek at IO Interactive’s James Bond game, which apparently can’t clear the image rights to Daniel Craig’s face but promises an entertaining mix of gunplay and hand-to-hand combat. It’s out sooner than expected, with a release date of 27 May.
Legacy of Kain: Ascendance & Defiance Remastered
Vampire fans are eating well. Not only is a remaster of Defiance coming next month, but a completely new side-scrolling entry, Ascendance, arrives on 31 March.
Ghost of Yotei: Legends
A co-op multiplayer expansion for Sucker Punch’s samurai epic arrives as free DLC on 10 March.
Death Stranding 2: On the Beach
The PC port was confirmed for 19 March, bringing ultra-wide support and unlocked frame rates.
Resident Evil: Requiem
First revealed last year and due to launch later this month, Resident Evil: Requiem gets a new gameplay trailer showing Leon Kennedy and a shiny new character exploring a very familiar-looking Raccoon City Police Department.
The verdict
It’s a banner day for people approaching middle age who simply want to keep playing the same games over and over again in slightly higher resolutions.
Sony’s going hard on nostalgia in 2026, with remakes and sequels to some of the most beloved PlayStation titles in history, but tempered its line-up with just enough new stuff to not feel like a trip to the recycling centre. The fact there’s a new God of War game and a Pragmata demo available right now is a nice little bonus.

Leader diplomacy brings greater stability to Türkiye-US ties: Turkish parliamentary official
Talks in US Congress reflect a more positive atmosphere than previously, signal progress on defense issues, says Fuat Oktay
ANKARA
The head of the Turkish parliament’s Foreign Affairs Committee said Thursday that relations between Türkiye and the US are on a more stable footing due to direct engagement between the countries’ leaders.
Speaking to Turkish journalists in Washington, Fuat Oktay, a former Turkish vice president, said the current “healthy” relationship between President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and US President Donald Trump has contributed to steadier bilateral ties.
Oktay said meetings on Capitol Hill reflected a more positive atmosphere compared to previous visits, suggesting that the constructive approach at the leadership level is also visible in Congress.
He said bilateral trade between the two NATO allies stands at nearly $40 billion, with a target of $100 billion, adding that new areas of cooperation have emerged in defense and security.
Reiterating that NATO allies should not impose embargoes on one another, Oktay said issues such as the S-400 air defense systems should be handled in a way that allows both sides to move forward. He said Türkiye procured the systems to meet urgent security needs at a time when it was unable to obtain US-made Patriot systems.
On regional issues, Oktay also emphasized that strengthening Syria’s central government and ensuring integration across the country would contribute to regional stability, arguing that this approach serves the interests of both Türkiye and the US.

Are African ‘water wars’ on the horizon as AU puts the issue on its agenda?
Experts weigh in on challenges, from climate change and water scarcity to upstream-downstream conflict and industry abuse.
Johannesburg, South Africa – From deadly Cyclone Gezani in Madagascar and surging waterborne disease risks across flood-affected Mozambique, to parched land and herds of dead livestock along the Kenya-Somalia border, the continent is starting 2026 under siege from water‑linked climate shocks – just as African leaders gather for a summit that puts the precious resource at the centre of its agenda.
On paper, the African Union’s choice of water as its 2026 summit theme – with a focus on water as a vital resource for life, development and sustainability – appears apolitical. But experts say it is anything but.

“Water is life,” said Sanusha Naidu, a foreign policy analyst at the South African think tank, the Institute for Global Dialogue.
“But it’s not just that water is life – water is becoming a commodity of corporatisation and access. It is a humanitarian conflict. It is a climate change conflict.
“It’s a peace and security issue.”
Water and conflict
Although worsening climate change and the strain it puts on resources is a main pressure point, analysts point to other flashpoints where water and conflict intersect – including upstream-downstream tensions over shared natural resources, water being used as a weapon of war, and big industry claiming water resources at the cost of human beings.
In Africa, water cuts across interstate disputes like Egypt and Ethiopia’s fight over the Nile, deadly tensions between farmers and herders in Nigeria over access to the same arable land, antigovernment protests over failed service delivery in Madagascar, and the outbreak of health epidemics in the wake of major floods and droughts.
It’s really a “multitude” of competing or interlinked factors that are creating a “vicious circle” of challenges people have to deal with, Naidu says, especially in Africa, which is particularly vulnerable to climate change.
With temperature increases in Africa slightly above the global average, the continent faces a disproportionate burden from the climate crisis, according to the World Meteorological Organization and climate experts.
For Dhesigen Naidoo, a senior water and climate researcher with African policy think tank, the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), climate change is now experienced first and foremost as a water crisis.
“We’re talking about floods and droughts and very high energy storms that have been experienced around the world and in Africa with absolutely devastating impact,” he said, noting that “our ability to manage that has really diminished over time as the challenge gets bigger and bigger.”
From desertification to huge flooding, “too much and too little water have the same impact” as they both diminish people’s access to the resource, he said.
This lack of access leads to water scarcity as well as increased food shortages, growing numbers of climate refugees, and the higher prospect of conflict, according to Naidoo.
“If you look at the Sahel and [across Africa], the correlation between the activities of al-Shabab on the east side and Boko Haram on the west side, and the desertification creep, there’s an almost direct correlation [between strained resources and conflict],” he said.
In areas where there is a scarcity of basic resources like water, people are often forced to do whatever they can to survive, Naidoo explains. “And sometimes it leads to very, very bad security outcomes.”
This is evident in northern Nigeria, where an array of armed groups are recruiting among vulnerable local populations, while in the middle belt region, intercommunal conflict between farmers and herders over shared pastoral land resources has turned deadly.
Even away from front-line battles, water scarcity is heightening geopolitical security concerns. Observers point to electricity and water cuts that prompted angry antigovernment protests in Madagascar last year; and this week in South Africa, the country’s Human Rights Commission called for the water crisis to be declared a national disaster, amid protests from many Johannesburg residents who have gone without water for 20 days.
Upstream-downstream Nile tensions
Some water tensions were drawn into the very borders that delineate the continent.
When European powers carved up Africa before, and at the Berlin Conference more than a century ago, they crudely drew lines between tribes, territories, and key water sources.
Across Africa, 90 percent of surface water is in transboundary basins and requires transboundary cooperation or treaties to manage, according to the World Bank.
These include the Senegal and Niger River Basins in West Africa that cover Guinea, Mali, Senegal, Niger and Nigeria; the Limpopo and Orange River Basins in Southern Africa, which cover South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique and Namibia; and the Nile River Basin in the east and north, spanning Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt.
While the treaties that govern water sharing are operating well in most regions, recent tensions around the Nile have revealed the potential for future upstream-downstream conflict, experts say.
Last year, Ethiopia inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), its most ambitious infrastructure venture on the Blue Nile, amid tensions with downstream neighbours Egypt and Sudan, which rely heavily on the Nile and fear the Ethiopian dam will threaten their water security.
“The level of tension is relatively high at the moment” between Ethiopia and the downstream countries, particularly Egypt, who were unable to block the dam’s construction, notes Magnus Taylor, the deputy director of the Horn of Africa project at conflict prevention think tank, International Crisis Group.
Beyond the technical operational concerns of the dam, there are also broader tensions, Taylor says, as the GERD marks a historic shift in Nile power relations.
“Egypt fears [the GERD] will challenge both its practical control over the Nile waters but also its broader political hegemony over the Nile basin,” he said.
That tension is then dispersed and “translated through other political and security situations which have been influenced by the GERD issue,” the analyst noted.
He points to the advantage that Egypt’s backing of the Sudanese Armed Forces in Sudan’s ongoing war has created for Cairo in ensuring Sudan supports its view on the GERD.
Separately, Cairo has also diplomatically courted Eritrea, Ethiopia’s northern neighbour with which it has contentious relations, he said, while Egypt has also offered security support to Somalia when Ethiopia pursued a sea access deal with the breakaway rival region of Somaliland.
Water as root, site, weapon of war
Taylor says that while the world is not yet seeing outright “water wars”, water disputes are nevertheless shaping and intensifying other conflicts across the Horn of Africa.
For ISS water expert Naidoo, “the notion of an inter-country conflict based on water is a very real thing,” and upstream-downstream tensions escalating into conflict are “a possibility in several parts of the world and certainly in several parts of Africa”.
The Egypt-Ethiopia tensions are currently the clearest example of a historically hegemonic downstream country now having to play by the rules of an upstream country that has asserted itself, he said. But “many very big economies in Africa”, like Nigeria, South Africa and Senegal, are also downstream countries, he points out.
“On the Niger River, Nigeria is a downstream country and currently has very poor relations with its northern neighbours, Mali and Niger. And that is a very serious issue about an upstream-downstream dynamic that might mimic what is currently happening between Ethiopia and Egypt,” Naidoo said.
Water has historically been a source of conflict, he argues.
“The art of war around water is well honed into the psyche of human beings,” said Naidoo, who remarks that the first-ever resource wars in prehistoric times were fought over water and food – even long before oil.
But more than just the root and reason, experts say water is sometimes used as the weapon itself.
Naidoo pointed to the wars in Sudan and Gaza as current examples “where there is a very high level of the weaponisation of water currently under way”. In both places, civilians suffer deprivation as supplies are blocked and water sources are targeted in armed attacks.
“We have, for a very long time, organised ourselves to have an informal agreement that all parties in any conflict would not weaponise water. But events are teaching us that people are quite happy to go back on that,” the water expert noted.
At the same time, technology is another factor putting strain on people’s access to water. Communications infrastructure and AI data centres all require industrial-scale amounts of water for cooling, putting more strain on the supplies that people rely on.
This means the prospect of water conflicts “will probably get a lot worse”, Naidoo said.
“We have organised ourselves to develop economies that are very highly dependent on regular water supplies. And so small perturbations in the system – being without water for three days – is cause for conflict,” he remarked.
“You can’t tolerate it because you actually can’t do without it. Not just personally on your own consumption, but because everything that works around you has a water dependency.”
Who is responsible?
The scale of challenges is concerning for experts and observers, and many feel those in leadership positions have not done enough to mitigate the crisis.
The AU’s decision to put water at the centre of its 2026 summit this weekend is important, yet overdue, Naidu says.
She says the continental bloc and national governments have known about the emerging water crisis for years, but have largely failed to act at the necessary scale.
She also argues that the responsibility lies not only with governments, but also with local officials, corporations that exploit and pollute, and consumers and civil society, who must change their behaviour and demand accountability.
Crisis Group’s Taylor says the AU may issue a communique at the summit, but because of the limited remit of the AU, this is unlikely to translate into any binding continent‑wide water agreements that can be enforced.
Al Jazeera reached out to the AU with questions about this year’s summit, but received no response.
For ISS’s Naidoo, treaties and agreements have a place, but power also lies with national governments, who can work to support and scale up real solutions already being produced at ground level.
He sees a silver lining in African innovation projects, including non‑sewered sanitation systems, which treat waste on-site through biological, chemical, or mechanical processes that rely less on water, or projects like the “overhead aqueduct” system in Kenya’s Kibera, which offers a way for areas without traditional underground piping to get clean water to residents of the Nairobi slum.
These examples show that Africa is not only a victim of the water crisis, he said, but also a source of potential solutions and a space where the continent can exercise Global South‑led leadership.
Getting water right is a non-negotiable, “social, humanitarian, economic, and security” issue, Naidoo said.
“The conundrum is that Africa has a very high level of tolerance to certain things, like the lack of services or lack of decent sanitation. Part of the reason why we don’t make progress in this domain is because it’s kind of accepted,” Naidoo said.
“But you can’t be tolerant of having no water,” he warned, “or you will die.”

Milano Cortina acting as ‘propaganda for Russia’, says banned Heraskevych

Milano Cortina acting as ‘propaganda for Russia’, says banned Heraskevych
Ukrainian skeleton racer Heraskevych says 2006 Winter Olympics ‘acts as propoganda for Russia’ after IOC decision.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) began hearing Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych’s appeal on Friday, with a decision expected later in the day on whether he can return to competition at the Milano Cortina Olympics after his disqualification over his “helmet of remembrance”.
The 27-year-old was removed from the Olympic programme on Thursday when the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation jury ruled that imagery on the helmet — depicting athletes killed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 — breached rules on political neutrality at the Games.

Heraskevych is seeking reinstatement or at least a CAS-supervised run, pending a decision by sport’s highest court in advance of the final two runs set for Friday evening.
“I’m pretty positive about how it went,” he told reporters outside the office of CAS in Milan following his appearance before the court. “I hope the truth will prevail, and I know that I was innocent.”
The racer said he was now getting threats from Russians and blamed the IOC’s decision for that.
“I believe that these Games now and this act of the IOC also serves as an instrument of propaganda for Russia,” Heraskevych said. “I still receive a lot of threats from the Russian side.”
The IOC, whose president, Kirsty Coventry, met Heraskevych on Thursday in a last-ditch effort to break the impasse, has allowed the athlete to keep his credentials despite his disqualification, so he can stay at the Milano Cortina Games.
“For me, sitting down with Vladyslav and his dad, the conversation was extremely respectful,” Coventry told a news conference on Friday. “After that, I asked the disciplinary commission to re-look at not pulling his accreditation, out of respect for him and his dad. I thought that was the right thing to do.”
The case has dominated headlines in the first week of the Olympics.
CAS Secretary-General Matthieu Reeb could not say exactly when they were likely to reach a decision, despite the tight schedule.
“We hope to have a final decision announced today, but it’s difficult for me to say when,” Reeb told reporters. “Obviously, we know the schedule of the competition, and it is an objective for CAS to be able to run the decision before the start of the race, but we don’t know how long the hearing will take.
“We have only one arbitrator from Germany, and she will be in charge of this case. We have participants attending in person, like the IOC, the athlete is here, the father of the athlete is here.
“We have a representative of IBSF attending remotely. The athlete is also assisted by legal counsel speaking from Kyiv.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Oil prices may create certain risks and speed up inflation if they fail to recover to the levels that the Bank of Russia set in its baseline scenario, the regulator’s Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
"Significant risks are associated with oil prices. If they don't recover from current levels to those we included in the baseline scenario this could accelerate inflation through the foreign exchange channel," she told a press conference.
In 2025, oil supply grew at an accelerated rate, resulting in a global market surplus, Nabiullina noted, adding that this, in turn, puts pressure on prices. "For Russian exporters, the situation is further complicated by sanctions restrictions," she stressed.
Against this backdrop, the Bank of Russia, taking into account global market trends, lowered its oil price forecast for the next three years. "Accordingly, the forecast for export value volumes was also adjusted," the regulator’s chief stated.

Is it still illegal to support Palestine Action? What High Court ruling means
- The High Court has ruled that the decision to ban Palestine Action as a terror group was unlawful and disproportionate, stating it should be overturned.
- Huda Ammori, co-founder of Palestine Action, successfully challenged the Home Office's proscription of the group under the Terrorism Act 2000.
- Despite the ruling, the ban currently remains in effect, making it a criminal offence to be a member of or support Palestine Action, as the Government plans to appeal – however the Met Police says it will not arrest supporters holding signs.
- The judge, Dame Victoria Sharp, concluded that while Palestine Action promotes its cause through criminality, its activities had not reached the level, scale, and persistence to warrant proscription as a terror group.
- Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood expressed disappointment and confirmed her intention to challenge the judgment in the Court of Appeal, while the Metropolitan Police will adjust its enforcement approach.

RSF committed atrocities during al-Fashir capture, UN body says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 13 - Rapid Support Forces violations in Sudan during the capture of the city of al-Fashir amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said on Friday.
Darfur's al-Fashir fell to RSF forces in October 2025 after a long siege that led to mass killings.
Based on interviews with over 140 victims and witnesses conducted in Sudan's Northern state and in eastern Chad in late 2025, the UN Human Rights Office documented more than 6,000 killings in the first three days of the RSF offensive on al-Fashir after the siege, it said.
RSF committed "widespread atrocities that amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity," said a report published by the Human Rights Office.
UN Human Rights Chief Volker Tuerk renewed his call on parties to the conflict to take effective steps to end the grave violations by forces under their command, he said in a statement.
He appealed to states with influence to act urgently to prevent the repetition of violations documented in al-Fashir. "This includes respecting the arms embargo already in place, and ending the supply, sale or transfer of arms or military material to the parties." REUTERS

The United States Central Command said on Friday it had completed the transfer of detained ISIL group suspects held in Syria to Iraq.
CENTCOM said it "completed a transfer mission following a nighttime flight from northeastern Syria to Iraq on Feb 12 to help ensure ISIL detainees remain secure in detention facilities."
"The 23-day transfer mission began on Jan 21 and resulted in U.S. forces successfully transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS (ISIL) fighters from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody," it added. The U.S. had previously announced it would transfer around 7,000 detainees.

The world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has been ordered to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East.
That’s according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity. It comes as U.S. President Donald Trump considers whether to take possible military action against Iran.
The move, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region as Trump increases pressure on Iran to make a deal over its nuclear program.

Trump goes to Fort Bragg to celebrate Maduro’s capture
Trump is heading to North Carolina on Friday to celebrate members of the special forces who stormed into Venezuela on the third day of the New Year and whisked away that country’s leader, Nicolás Maduro, to face U.S. smuggling charges.
First lady Melania Trump will also be making the trip to Fort Bragg, one of the largest military bases in the world by population, to spend time with military families.
The president spoke at Fort Bragg in June at an event meant to recognize the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. But that celebration was overshadowed by his partisan remarks describing protesters in Los Angeles as “animals” and his defense of deploying the military there.
Republicans mostly don’t like Trump’s stand on Greenland
A new AP-NORC poll finds that Trump’s recent push to seize control of Greenland is divisive even within his own party.
The survey finds that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.
That’s higher than the share who dislike how he’s handling foreign policy generally, suggesting that Trump’s Greenland approach has created a particular weak spot for the administration.
Even Republicans aren’t thrilled. About half don’t like his attempt to turn the icebound landmass into American territory, something that Trump has insisted is critical for national security in the Arctic.
Taiwan reaches trade deal with U.S.
Taiwan has reached a trade deal with the United States that cuts almost all of its tariff barriers.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office says the agreement covers 99% of Taiwan’s tariffs. The U.S. relies on Taiwan for computer chip production.
U.S. data shows chip exports from Taiwan help drive a large trade imbalance. The gap reached nearly $127 billion in the first 11 months of 2025.
U.S. officials attended the signing through the American Institute in Taiwan. The deal comes ahead of Trump’s planned visit to China in April and suggests a deepening economic relationship between the U.S. and Taiwan.

The instructions given by a certain "Bouzou" were clear. For €100 a day, according to her statement to police, Zoé M. was tasked in late December 2022 with driving slowly through the streets of Paris. But before she started, the 23-year-old, who had just completed her training as a flight attendant, had a small operation to perform. With the phone she had been given, she was to log into the software installed on the device in the trunk, go to "SMS configuration," enter the word "Chronopost" (a package delivery company), press "Save" and then "Start Sending" before making some final adjustments.
This series of steps resulted in a veritable bombardment of text messages sent to all phones in the vicinity. The unusual piece of equipment hidden in the trunk was, in fact, an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)-catcher. This intelligence-gathering tool, which mimics a cell tower to spy on cell phones, is at the heart of the case being heard in a Parisian courtroom starting Friday, February 13. Six men and two women will stand trial.
Complaint from Orange network
Legalized and regulated by the July 2015 intelligence law, the use of IMSI-catchers by investigators requires "authorization from a judge for freedoms and detention," as investigating judge Brice Hansemann recalled in his order to stand trial, which Le Monde reviewed. The accused are suspected of misusing this sensitive tool to send phishing messages and commit scams.

CAPE CANAVERAL /Florida/, February 13. /TASS/. US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) head Jared Isaacman plans to attend the next launch of the Russian Soyuz spacecraft and believes there are many opportunities for cooperation between Moscow and Washington in space.
"Right now, I am certainly planning to attend the next Soyuz launch," he said at a press conference at the Cape Canaveral spaceport in Florida after the launch of the next crew to the International Space Station (ISS), commenting on a TASS request to clarify whether he planned to go to Baikonur.
"There is a lot that we need to accomplish together in the years ahead. There are certainly a lot of opportunities for good conversation," the NASA chief emphasized when asked about specific areas of cooperation between Russia and the United States, as well as the prospects for negotiations with Roscosmos CEO Dmitry Bakanov. "A good friend will be going up on that mission. So it will be hard to imagine missing it," Isaacman pointed out.
"As you know, the ISS is going to still be up there for a long time. There is a lot that we need to accomplish together [with Russia] in the years ahead. There are certainly a lot of opportunities for good conversation," the NASA chief emphasized when asked about specific areas of cooperation between Russia and the US, as well as the prospects for negotiations with Bakanov. At the same time, he signaled his intention to hold talks with Bakanov at the earliest convenient opportunity. "We're making preparations for a discussion with my counterpart at the earliest opportunity," Isaacman noted. He did not specify when exactly these contacts might take place.
"Everything you just asked [about] is in some degree of work," the NASA chief noted.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The termination of the New START Treaty will not trigger a new arms race, because one is already underway in one form or another, Leonid Slutsky, Chairman of the International Affairs Committee of the State Duma lower house of Russia’s parliament and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, said in an interview with TASS.
"According to experts, an arms race is already underway in one form or another. So, this is more of a rhetorical device. It would be an exaggeration to say that the expiration of the New START Treaty will trigger a new round of the arms race," Slutsky said, answering a related question.
The parliamentarian also noted that the treaty did not cover the latest types of weapons, "including hypersonic weapons." "However, the New START Treaty was a crucial element in the entire system of nuclear safety and strategic stability control," he added.
The Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms (the New START Treaty) between Russia and the United States, the last remaining international legal constraint on nuclear weapons deployment, expired on February 5 due to Washington’s reluctance to extend it. US President Donald Trump earlier indicated that he expected to negotiate a "better" agreement that would include China.
On September 22, 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Moscow was prepared to adhere to the designated restrictions for another year after the New START Treaty expired in February 2026. He emphasized that this measure was feasible only if Washington acted in a similar manner. A few days later, the US administration praised the Russian leader’s initiative, but no formal response to Moscow's proposal was received from Washington.

Erdoğan: Universities must adapt as Türkiye’s influence grows

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has called on Turkish universities to modernize and strengthen their research capacities, saying young people are key to advancing his government’s "Century of Türkiye" vision.
"I believe it is essential that our universities focus on research, producing original and high-quality knowledge and developing projects that broaden Türkiye's horizons," Erdoğan said during a speech at Boğaziçi University during the opening of new student dormitories.
The president criticized what he described as a "restrictive mentality that treats universities as ideological battlegrounds" rather than centers of science. "Despite the oppressive mentality, we are moving towards our goals," he said.
"While there is the reality of a Türkiye whose star is increasingly shining on a global scale, our universities must adapt to this, renew and update themselves," Erdoğan added.
"Especially... those who have established feudalism in universities do not want to lose their privileges. The normalization of Türkiye, the diversification of art, does not suit these groups... We will continue to move forward until we reach our destination."
Erdoğan highlighted his administration’s investments in student housing, noting that the number of dormitories had risen from 190 in 2002 to 880, with bed capacity growing from roughly 182,000 to 1 million. The new facilities at Boğaziçi include a 210-capacity male dormitory and a 706-capacity female dormitory.
Looking ahead, Erdoğan said a laboratory building would be built next year with an investment of 3 billion Turkish Liras, and the university library, demolished last year due to earthquake vulnerability, would be rebuilt.
"We provide scholarship or loan opportunities to every student who applies. We also stand by our young friends in their process of entering working life," he said.
"Seeing the light and determination in the eyes of our young people renews our strength and energy. Believe me, looking at you further reinforces our passion for a 'Century of Türkiye.'"
Erdoğan's Boğaziçi visit came after he met with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic on Feb. 12 at the presidential complex in Ankara.
During a joint press conference after their talks, Erdoğan emphasized regional engagement and highlighted Turkish efforts to promote peace and stability across the Balkans alongside broader diplomatic initiatives.
“Türkiye’s total trade volume with Serbia reached $3.5 billion last year as we are moving step by step toward our $5 billion target,” he said.
The president said growing trade and investment ties serve as the driving force behind bilateral relations.

Can tax help Malawi out of a health funding crisis deepened by Trump’s aid cuts?
The country is having difficulty rolling out tax measures aimed at trying to revive an ailing economy that has been further weakened by falling aid spending
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Malawi has postponed the introduction of a new electronic tax reporting system after protests by small business owners, as the government faces mounting pressure to raise funds following major reductions in foreign aid and an ailing economy.
Thousands of traders shut their shops and marched last week in Blantyre, Lilongwe, Zomba and Mzuzu in opposition to the electronic invoicing system (EIS), which would require businesses to report sales in real time to the tax authority. Authorities have since delayed the rollout until April.
Officials say the system will reduce tax evasion and widen the tax base, but traders warn it will increase prices and threaten already fragile businesses struggling with inflation and foreign-currency shortages.
External financing, such as aid, previously accounted for about 55 per cent of the country’s health budget and, before Donald Trump slashed US aid spending, Malawi received hundreds of thousands of dollars annually across health, agriculture and education. The loss of funding has already led to reductions in HIV services and raised concerns about the continuity of antiretroviral drug supply.
Tax collection has long been a challenge in Malawi, where a large informal economy and heavy reliance on donors historically reduced both the need and capacity to enforce compliance. At the same time, a ruling in the country’s Supreme Court of Appeal ordering the government to pay a significant sum over the handling of the suspension of the Finance Bank of Malawi has drawn criticism from the governance watchdog CDEDI, which says it could push the country deeper into crisis and force further tax increases or borrowing.
The group says the government collects only about half of its roughly 8 trillion kwacha (£325 million) budget in tax revenue and relies heavily on debt. It warned the payout could reduce funds for hospitals, schools and salaries.
To raise money, authorities have introduced higher income and value-added taxes, levies on mobile money and bank transfers, taxes on gambling winnings and renewed duties on imported cement. Other proposals include taxes on pensions and inheritance.
Finance Minister Joseph Mwanamvekha has urged citizens to “remain resilient” as the country works to stabilise its finances and improve revenue collection.
The measures come as fuel prices have risen by more than 40 per cent, inflation remains high and businesses face severe foreign-currency shortages, forcing importers to buy dollars on the black market at far above the official rate.
Malawi already spends about 90 per cent of domestic revenue on wages and legal obligations, leaving limited funds for health and social services previously funded by donors. Under a health agreement with the United States, it must also spend $143m (£105m) of its own funds on health over five years.
Across Africa, countries are trying to replace declining aid with domestic taxes. In Malawi, the delayed tax system reflects a wider shift - from donor-funded services towards funding them at home, during a period of economic hardship.

With French female astronaut Sophie Adenot joining the crew at the International Space Station, it is the perfect moment to reflect on the role of women in space; a field still very much dominated by men. Yet years before Adenot set her sights on a career in space, other women were actively involved in the sector. But despite their achievements in computing, engineering and even on board the launches, many of their names have been forgotten by history. Annette Young also talks to Meganne Christian, a fellow British-Australian astronaut who’s been training with Adenot, on gender differences in space.

Kyiv's Desniansky district head calls for alternative sources of electricity and heat of 100 MW and 300 MW before the start of next heating season
The head of the Desniansky district state administration in Kyiv, Maksym Bakhmatov, has proposed building alternative electricity and heat sources with a combined capacity of 100 MW and 300 MW respectively ahead of the next heating season, as the district’s sole combined heat and power plant (CHP) has once again been knocked offline.
"If we don’t start thinking about independent heat and electricity generation now, Desniansky district will freeze next year. By Sept. 15, 2026, we must build 100 MW of electricity and 300 MW of heat. Or more — as much as we can manage," Bakhmatov wrote on Facebook.
He said such capacity would give the district a genuine chance of getting through the next heating season.
Bakhmatov explained that the district’s heat supply depends on a single CHP plant, which was shut down again on Feb. 12 following a Russian strike. He said Russian forces would continue to target the plant regardless of how many times Kyiv repaired it, and that the only solution for residents of what he described as Ukraine’s largest district was to build a network of smaller heat sources. He pointed to more than 100 boiler houses on Kyiv’s right bank as a working model.
"Even if billions of hryvnias — or perhaps even dollars — are poured into repairing destroyed CHPs, the aggressor country will keep hitting them. And heating will stop again. There is only one way out: dozens and hundreds of small facilities. Kyiv has 130 small boiler houses and they are supplying heat right now — to residential buildings, dormitories, enterprises. That’s the right bank. We have nothing like that," he said.
Bakhmatov added that he intends to initiate an expert hackathon to develop concrete solutions for Desniansky district’s energy independence.
The proposal echoes comments made in late January by former Ukrenergo CEO Volodymyr Kudrytskyy, who said problems with Kyiv’s electricity and heat supply following Russian strikes could have been significantly reduced had generation sources been decentralized. He noted that Kyiv’s peak consumption reaches up to 2,000 MW, and that building approximately 700 MW of gas piston or gas turbine units would have been sufficient to ensure relative energy independence in the event of major generation facilities being destroyed. Kudrytskyy also highlighted that no air defense system in the world can guarantee 100% interception of missiles and Shahed UAVs, while the Troieshchyna residential area — home to 300,000 people — depends on a single large generation source.

Boss of P&O Ferries owner DP World leaves over Jeffrey Epstein links

The boss of P&O Ferries owner, DP World, has left the company after revelations over his ties with the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein forced the ports and logistics company to take action.
Dubai-based DP World, which is ultimately owned by Dubai’s royal family, announced Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem’s departure as the group’s chair and chief executive on Friday.
Sulayem – the brother of Mohammed Ben Sulayem, the head of the FIA, which governs the world’s motor sport championships including Formula One – has been under intense pressure after the publication of messages with Epstein.
Documents disclosed by the US Department of Justice revealed that Sulayem emailed Epstein in 2015 that he met a girl “two years ago” who went to an American university in Dubai was “the best sex I ever had amazing body”.
He said: “She got engaged but now she back with me.”
Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman from Kentucky, who has inspected unredacted Epstein files, said earlier this week that the justice department also appeared to confirm that Sulayem was the recipient of an email from Epstein in which he said: “I loved the torture video.”
The Dubai government’s statement on Friday did not mention Sulayem but announced that Essa Kazim had been named as the chair and Yuvraj Narayan as the chief executive.
Earlier this week, two of DP World’s largest international partners, including Canada’s La Caisse pension fund and British International Investment, said they would halt future deals with the group.
Sulayem had helped transform DP World from an operator of Dubai’s Jebel Ali port into one of the world’s largest logistics company.
It owns six ports in Canada, the London Gateway container port, as well as P&O Ferries, which it acquired in 2019
On Thursday, Kathy Ruemmler, the top lawyer at Goldman Sachs and a former White House counsel to Barack Obama, announced her resignation in the wake of emails showing a close relationship between her and Epstein.
Ruemmler, who had referred to the sex offender as “Uncle Jeffrey”, had repeatedly tried to distance herself from the emails and other correspondence that has been released and had said she would not resign.

Macron calls for stronger measures against antisemitism in France
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS, Feb 13 - French President Emmanuel Macron called for intensified efforts to combat antisemitism in France, as recent government data showed hostility toward Jews has remained high despite a decline in recorded incidents last year.
France, which has the largest Jewish community in Europe, documented 1,320 antisemitic acts in 2025, accounting for 53% of all anti-religious incidents, according to a report released on Thursday by the Interior Ministry.
Even as incidents fell 16% year-on-year, they remained at "historically high" levels for three consecutive years, the Ministry said.
The increase followed the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and subsequent conflict in Gaza.
"Schools, the justice system, elected officials: everyone must be mobilised," Macron said at a ceremony commemorating 20 years since the death of Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish man who died after being kidnapped and held captive for 24 days. A gang leader was sentenced in 2009 to life in prison for his abduction, torture and murder.
Macron criticized what he called the "poison of online hatred" and urged the European Commission to hold big online platforms accountable.
"In the France of the Enlightenment, 'free speech' stops at antisemitism and racism," the French leader said.
Antisemitic acts continue rising across Europe. Britain recorded 3,700 antisemitic incidents in 2025, a 4% increase and the second-worst year on record, according to data published on Wednesday by the Community Security Trust, which protects Jews in the UK.
In Germany, cases of antisemitism nearly doubled to 8,627 last year, according to the Federal Research and Information Point for Antisemitism, pointing to violence, vandalism, and threats tied to the Gaza conflict. REUTERS

China mulls US manufacturing fund ahead of Xi-Trump summit, business leader says
Leaders to secure ‘very positive’ outcomes but no ‘grand bargain’ during talks in Beijing, AmCham China chair predicts
China and the US are likely to secure several “very positive” outcomes but not a “grand bargain” at their presidential summit in April, according to the board chief of a major American business lobby.
Speaking at an event at the Lowy Institute think tank in Sydney, the Beijing-based lawyer said another issue “still out there” was for China to invest in manufacturing in the United States. He added that China had shown receptiveness to such proposals but would require “protection” in return.
“Apparently there is a discussion about the possibility of Beijing setting up a fund to encourage Chinese investors to make manufacturing investment in the US, and similar to that encouraged of Japan, Taiwan and South Korea,” Zimmerman said.
“You won’t see a grand bargain worked out at the April meeting, but you may see certain deliverables that are very positive,” he said during the talk, adding that the pressure of the US midterm elections in November could contribute to Trump’s eagerness for those outcomes.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The European Union (EU) purchased Russian pipeline gas for 5.8 bln euros in 2025, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) for 7.4 bln euros, according to Eurostat data and TASS calculations. The EU's total purchases of Russian gas decreased by 13% in the reporting period to 13.2 bln euros.
In total, the European Union purchased gas from Russia worth around 13.2 bln euros in 2025, which is 13.2% lower than in 2024. LNG purchases from Russia during this period amounted to 7.4 bln euros, down from 7.6 bln euros in the previous year. The EU also paid 5.8 bln euros for Russian pipeline gas, compared to 7.6 bln euroes in 2024.
In December 2025, EU countries paid 575 mln euros for LNG from Russia, which is the highest since July 2025. The main importers were France (227 mln euros), Spain (145 mln euros), and Belgium (134 mln euros). The Netherlands purchased LNG from Russia for 40 mln euros.
The share of Russian LNG in total EU liquefied natural gas imports in 2025 equaled 16.1%. The United States ranked first with a 52.5% share.
The EU also imported 407 mln euros worth of Russian pipeline gas in December. The TurkStream gas pipeline currently remains the only active route for Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe.
The share of pipeline gas from Russia in the value of EU pipeline gas imports amounted to 16.3% last year. Algeria ranked first with 27.4%, followed by Norway (24.9%), and Azerbaijan (12.8%).

'I'll rip your head off': Gang's grip over gold mines sows terror in Peru's La Pampa
Peru's Guardianes de la Trocha gang has taken over La Pampa, a gold-rich area running alongside the Tambopata National Reserve, one of the most biodiverse regions on the continent. Forbidden Stories and its partner Mongabay Latam reveal how this criminal organisation spreads terror, silencing any opposition with the help of rising corruption in the country.

This article was written by Forbidden Stories journalist Emmanuel Colombié in partnership with the nature conservation news website Mongabay Latam.
The once-lush forest is now little more than a wasteland. For 15 years, illegal miners have been setting up camp in La Pampa, in southeastern Peru, in the department of Madre de Dios.
Previously covered in tropical jungle, the area surrounding the Interoceanic Highway has become a living hell. Every day, men tear up the ground and pollute the waterways.
“Birds don’t like the mine. They’ve all left,” said Diego Torres,* a farmer with a front-row seat to the gold fever that has seized his region. For the past two years, orange mud has covered his plot, along with fuel canisters and scraps of wood and metal. Torres’ dogs wallow in patches of oil-stained land. Here and there, miners have left huge metal pipes abandoned among dying palm trees.
Upon arriving at Torres’ farm, the roar of dredgers and gold-extraction machinery is immediately audible. Visible between the dead foliage, the looters are hard at work. Near a washing ramp, designed to trap gold particles on a mat, several men stand guard – over Torres’ own land.
Torres says as soon as they arrived, he reported the looters to the Specialised Environmental Prosecutor’s Offices of Peru, also called FEMA. Police visited him in March 2024, but the miners were not there that day, apparently tipped off in advance. A few days later, they were back to work with total impunity, under the protection of armed men, less than a kilometre from an active military base.
Determined to defend his land, Torres has already confronted the illegal miners on his property. He says he is not afraid of them. However, Torres is reluctant to discuss Guardianes de la Trocha, the criminal group that controls gold-extraction activities in La Pampa. “Through intermediaries, they told me not to oppose the miners, not to say anything or to leave, otherwise they could eliminate me … But where could I go? I have nowhere else to go,” he said.
Keep quiet or face death threats: independent journalist Manuel Calloquispe deals with the same dilemma. For more than a decade, he has been one of the only local reporters documenting and denouncing the activities of illegal gold miners in the region. He has paid a steep price. Calloquispe has been beaten and had his equipment stolen, and he has lost count of the threats and intimidation he has received – even from right outside his home.
In 2022, Calloquispe’s family had to leave Puerto Maldonado, the capital of Madre de Dios. With danger growing, in January 2025, the journalist decided to join Forbidden Stories’ SafeBox Network to protect sensitive documents: the product of years of investigations.
In early 2025, Calloquispe was investigating Edison Fernandez Perez, alias Chili, one of the two leaders of Guardianes de la Trocha. In an investigation published on the Inforegion website, he revealed the seizure of numerous weapons and shed light on the gang’s internal struggles.
On August 28, 2025, a few days before releasing his article, Calloquispe received a chilling phone call. On the other end, he recognised Alver Carranza Fernandez, Chili’s lieutenant. The warning was unambiguous: “I’m going to rip your head off … Who will speak when you’re gone? You’ve already been identified. We’re going to kill your son, your brother. We know where you are, we know where your family is.”
Shaken by the call, Calloquispe says he had to stop publishing and left the city to go into hiding for the fourth time since 2011. With his consent, in October 2025, Forbidden Stories and publication partner Mongabay Latam decided to travel to Madre de Dios to continue his work.
Watch moreLords of Gold: the gangs’ grip on Peru’s mines
Calloquispe has tirelessly documented and denounced the activities of Guardianes de la Trocha, which has spread terror in La Pampa for nearly 15 years. Madre de Dios is Peru’s least populated department – but one saturated with gold. The country’s Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Institute estimates that it now accounts for 11% of national production.
As the main artisanal mining area in Peru, Madre de Dios is home to widespread illegal gold mining, which has exploded there since the Interoceanic Highway opened in 2011, according to the Centre for Amazonian Scientific Innovation. The center notes that deforestation is directly linked to gold mining and has increased by 425% since the new paved road made the region more accessible.
The rainforest: a victim of the gold rush
Logging and agricultural operations, primary forests, private property: In this region, nothing can withstand the gold rush and its immense damage. By mid-2025, 97.5% of the 139,169 hectares of forest that illegal mining has destroyed in Peru were in Madre de Dios, according to the Monitoring of the Andes Amazon Program, or MAAP.
La Pampa lies in the province of Tambopata, home to a national nature reserve popular with tourists and boasting some of the richest biodiversity in Latin America.
Since 2011, Guardianes de la Trocha has ruled La Pampa with an iron fist, controlling most illegal gold production there. At first, the gang consisted of a handful of men providing security for artisanal mines. Their power grew as mining expanded on both sides of the Interoceanic Highway, until they were able to impose their own law.
“Starting in 2013, Guardianes de la Trocha set up tolls, managed mine security and began killing. In 2015, there was a second wave of violence: no one could enter La Pampa without their authorisation,” said Rodrigo*, a La Pampa resident whose name has been changed as a security precaution. The gang killed one of his relatives for opposing its invasion of his family’s forestry concession.
Meeting Rodrigo means passing through a heavily armored door protecting the entrance to his property. The site is a veritable bunker, with barbed wire surrounding each of the farmhouses. A witness to the gang’s rise, Rodrigo’s own life has come under threat.
“In 2017, a line was crossed: extortion increased, they started calling themselves ‘Security,’ and they brought in their own machines to extract gold. During the pandemic, they took over all extraction sites, and starting in 2022, they began to show themselves openly in public,” Rodrigo said. “After the murder, we thought about leaving, but my parents didn’t want to, so we decided to stay and confront them.”
Unfortunately, Rodrigo’s family is not the only one this climate of violence has affected. Having cross-referenced official information, police sources and his own work, journalist Calloquispe estimates that at least 400 people may have been murdered or gone missing since 2014. “There are students, transport workers and taxi drivers who went into La Pampa and never came out,” he said.
Gold: A crucial resource for Peru
In 2025, mining was Peru’s main source of foreign income, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mines. The High Commissioner for the Fight against Illegal Mining, Rodolfo García Esquerre, states that in 2024, “Peru exported around 180 tonnes of gold, but of that amount, at least 80 were of unknown origin,” citing the Peruvian Institute of Economics (IPE). This think tank considers that 44% of the illegal gold extracted in South America comes from Peru and that, over the past two decades, “the volume of illegal gold exports has increased eight-fold and, by the end of 2025, will reach that of legal gold.”
“In 2024, this amount was almost six times higher than what was generated by the illegal drug trafficking economy, which amounted to around 1.2 billion dollars,” García Esquerre adds.
Boosted by soaring gold prices, these organisations have built up arsenals over the years to protect their increasingly lucrative business.
With this weaponry, Guardianes de la Trocha sows fear throughout La Pampa. “Since June 2025, it’s gone crazy. You’d need a tank here to fight back, because there are between 40 and 60 people armed with machine guns, submachine guns and grenades,” Rodrigo said. He revealed his own gear: a rifle, a pistol and even a drone, which he intends to use to protect his family in the event of another invasion.

Police echo the same concern, as described by Commander Carazas, the imposing head of the Criminal Investigation Division in Madre de Dios. Forbidden Stories met him in his small office in Puerto Maldonado, cluttered with stacks of files. “Brayan has military-grade, heavy-caliber equipment and Uzi machine guns,” he said, in reference to one of Guardianes de la Trocha’s current leaders. “We don’t have enough people to fight that.”
On surveillance footage journalist Calloquispe obtained, Chili and several dozen men move around La Pampa heavily armed, equipped with bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles. Some of them wear police uniforms. One clip shows the daylight execution of Ana Denisse García Solsol on Jan. 10, 2025. In the streets of the village of Virgen de la Candelaria, this trade unionist – who was responsible for allocating municipal land – is shot dead by armed men in the back of pickup trucks. The killers disappear to cries of “Viva el Chili.”

This well-equipped private army, ready to kill, is therefore fully capable of protecting illegal mining activities. To guard extraction sites, “they hire retired police officers as security agents,” Carazas said.
On the trail of the nuggets
Although illegal mining is a punishable offense in Peru, the purchase of small quantities of gold is poorly controlled. As a result, impunity reigns, fueling the informal economy. Once extracted from the mines, clandestine gold is easily resold in “acopiadoras", authorised collection shops where anyone can sell nuggets in exchange for a simple receipt.
Opening one of these shops requires going through a series of government-imposed procedures. The law mandates that individual gold purchases over $10,000 and cumulative purchases of up to $50,000 per month be declared. Below those thresholds, gold is virtually untraceable. Each individual encountered during reporting attested to this difficulty. In a lawless area like La Pampa, the subject is extremely sensitive and dangerous.
Over the years, Calloquispe has tried to investigate the origins and destinations of illegally mined gold. According to the journalist, before the coronavirus pandemic, “Guardianes de la Trocha extorted shops already established in the area in exchange for their security services. Then from 2024, they gradually took control of the existing shops by placing family members and friends there, and by creating their own collection centres.”

Rodrigo confirms this takeover of the gold collection process. “Security sees everything. They even have surveillance cameras in front of wherever they buy gold,” he said.
What happens to the precious nuggets next? Guardianes de la Trocha may have entered into agreements with gold export companies, according to Calloquispe’s observations and information. These companies reportedly finance the shops at a rate of one Peruvian sol (around 0.25 euros) per gram of gold collected.
The accumulated gold is then allegedly transported overland in convoys protected by company personnel, gang members and sometimes even the local police, towards the regions of Puno and Arequipa or into neighbouring countries to be smelted and reintroduced into the legal circuit.
According to Cesar Ipenza, a lawyer specialising in environmental issues, illegal gold mined in La Pampa takes several routes. The main one leads to neighboring Bolivia, where the metal is exported as Bolivian gold. Other channels pass through the Peruvian department of Cusco before reaching the capital, Lima. “It wouldn’t be surprising if the gold went through Brazil,” Ipenza said. “I’ve taken that road, and checks are almost non-existent.”
Calloquispe estimates that the amount of gold extracted in La Pampa “could exceed 40 tons per year", the equivalent of $6.55 billion calculated from the price of gold on January 26, 2026.
Faced with vast gold volumes, an opaque supply chain and rampant corruption, the state appears powerless. The rapid spread of illegal gold mines has also benefited from weak regulation, despite the Ministry of Energy and Mines establishing the Comprehensive Mining Formalisation Registry, or REINFO, in 2016. Originally, the system was meant to enable artisanal operations to legalise their activities by committing to comply with environmental standards within a limited period, without ceasing to operate.
But the system has proved deeply flawed: Deadlines for meeting environmental criteria, initially set for 2020, have been extended until December 2026. The registry can also provide cover for gangs that simply appropriate the forms of duly registered miners.
“In practice, there is no oversight mechanism,” said Ipenza. “And what often happens is that the REINFO is simply rented out.” According to the lawyer, people who illegally rent or buy REINFO forms transport and sell gold as if it came from concessions they genuinely operate.
As of January 26, 2026, of the 31,628 miners registered with REINFO across Peru, only 23,809 are reportedly valid. In other words, nearly a quarter of them appear to be operating without any oversight. In Madre de Dios, that proportion rises to ¾ of the miners. In the province of Tambopata, where La Pampa is located, 1,021 of the 1,489 concessions registered benefit from this legal gray area and operate with free rein. They do so under the governance of authorities that seem to have neither the resources nor the capabilities needed to stop them.
Lima unable to fight illegal mining
Nevertheless, the Peruvian government launched the high-profile Operation Mercury in 2019 to “totally eradicate” La Pampa’s illegal mines, according to the defence minister at the time. Some 25,000 miners were expelled from the area, and MAAP indicates deforestation fell by 92% that same year.
Shortly after these expulsions, the government sought to implement a “restoration plan” to promote new activities in La Pampa and, above all, extend the fight against illegal gold mining to the entire department of Madre de Dios and the regions of Cusco and Puno.
However, due to a lack of resources and political will, it was unsuccessful, and the miners who had been expelled not only retained control of new mining areas but also returned en masse to La Pampa. By 2023, the number of mining infrastructures had jumped by 400% compared to 2021, according to MAAP.
Smaller-scale, less publicised interventions coordinated by police and prosecutors to seize or destroy illegal miners’ equipment also tend to prove ineffective. Well-informed miners often hide their machines in waterways and leave the area before police arrive. “They just have to wait a few days and retrieve them from the bottom of the water. We don’t have the means to bring them to the surface,” explained a representative of FEMA, which is responsible for these operations.
Forbidden Stories and Mongabay Latam met with this representative in Puerto Maldonado. Fearing for her life, she chose to remain anonymous and took numerous precautions before the meeting, which happened in a discreet location. “My family doesn’t live with me here; it’s too dangerous,” she said, before sharing a video that showed miners fleeing as the FEMA team arrived.

Worse still, these operations are sometimes nothing more than staged interventions designed to boost official statistics and feed corruption. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a local official, well-informed about government action against illegal mining, elaborated.
“I was told that during an intervention, three machines out of 10 are destroyed,” he said. “Why? What’s the theory that always circulates? That they only destroy the ones they don’t pay for. Then they give false information about the operations. … Police information differs from FEMA’s, and the law doesn’t allow operations without FEMA present.”
“Gold brings in more money than drug trafficking here.”
A senior official at the Madre de Dios Prosecutor’s Office, speaking anonymously
In response to Forbidden Stories’ questions, the FEMA representative agreed. “We have very few convictions,” he said, on the topic of illegal mining. “I would say that it doesn’t even reach 5% of cases. We need new legal measures. We need to hit these miners financially with operational bans, pretrial detention and sanctions. The problem is that there’s populist rhetoric and so much money at stake that the current situation benefits everyone. Those who denounce it are seen as enemies of the people.”
Following requests for comment, Frank Almanza Altamirano, the prosecutor in charge of national coordination for FEMA, said that in 2025 in Madre de Dios, six people were placed in pretrial detention and 84 convictions were handed down for various offences related to illegal gold mining. He added that 193 operations to shut down clandestine mines had been co-ordinated in the department. But these figures cannot hide the unbridled corruption in La Pampa or the inertia of authorities, who constantly pass the buck from one department to another.
'It's like a giant pizza. Everyone takes their slice'
When he met with Forbidden Stories and Mongabay Latam in Puerto Maldonado, a senior official at the Madre de Dios Prosecutor’s Office, who requested anonymity, admitted his powerlessness and openly denounced the endemic corruption in his department. “I don’t work with the local police because they’re corrupt; I try to work with Lima. We need undercover personnel who are fresh and focused,” he said.
In this official’s view, every authority responsible for fighting illegal mining is corrupt. “It’s like a giant pizza. Everyone takes their slice: the police, the justice system, the navy, the army, the SUNAT … and there’s a lot to go around. Gold brings in more money than drug trafficking here,” he said.
The senior official also deplores the lack of coordination between agencies. “There are two or three cases here linked to Guardianes de la Trocha, but you have to check with the Organised Crime Prosecutor. His office is right next to mine, but I don’t know him; we’ve never spoken,” he said.

Calloquispe is all too familiar with the authorities’ shortcomings. “You can’t trust anyone,” he said. A few days after receiving threats from Fernandez, Chili’s lieutenant, he filed a complaint. The police, who were supposed to patrol around his home, allegedly leaked photos of his house to the local press, putting him in serious danger.
Rodrigo went a step further in his assessment of the authorities. “Illegal mining is run by the police. Everyone turns a blind eye. It’s the Prosecutor’s Office and the police who make the most money. And as soon as someone speaks out, they’re eliminated. It’s hard to live here,” he said. The army and police have four bases in the La Pampa area.

Europe defends NATO, US ties at security gathering
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH - European leaders strove to shore up relations with the United States and insisted they were strengthening their defences as they gathered for a security conference on Feb 13 under heavy pressure from US President Donald Trump.
Political and business leaders, military officers and intelligence agents convened at two fortified hotels to talk international security and stability at the Munich Security Conference (MSC).
The event comes at a time of strained ties between Europe and the US, after Mr Trump threatened to take over Greenland and criticised European countries’ record on immigration.
Russia’s war against Ukraine, which is set to enter its fifth year in February, will be high on the agenda, alongside efforts by European NATO members to build up their defences.
European leaders ahead of the gathering defended their security commitments and vowed to strengthen NATO, after Mr Trump called it into question and accused allies of not spending enough on defence.
Europe is “stepping up... taking more of a leadership role within NATO” and “taking more care of its own defence”, the alliance’s Secretary-General Mark Rutte said at an event on transatlantic relations on the sidelines of the conference.
“A strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever.”
US-Europe relations
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron were scheduled to make an address on the first day of the conference on Feb 13.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived on Feb 13, is due to speak at the annual gathering the next day, as is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, organisers said.
Mr Rubio is seen as a more conciliatory choice of envoy, a year after US Vice-President J.D. Vance used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
Mr Rubio also met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on Feb 13 on the sidelines of the conference, an AFP journalist said, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
Meanwhile, relations between Europe and the US, a traditional ally and guarantor of the continent’s security for decades, are under pressure.
Since returning to the White House in 2025, Mr Trump has frequently criticised European countries for not sharing enough of the burden on common defence.
Ties plunged further in January when Mr Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Ukraine discussions
Overall, more than 60 heads of state and government and around 100 foreign and defence ministers were to descend on the southern German city amid high security, with about 5,000 police officers deployed for the event.
Mr Merz was to open the conference on Feb 13 at 1.45pm local time, while the French President will close the day’s official programme with a speech at 7pm, according to the MSC agenda.
The two were scheduled to meet Mr Rubio and British Premier Keir Starmer and Mr Zelensky on the afternoon of Feb 13 for talks on Ukraine.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper will also address the conference over the course of the day.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the Munich conference “stands like no other for what is in the DNA of our foreign and security policy, namely the transatlantic bond”.
“I believe we are working on this even in difficult times,” he added.
“We will only survive them if we preserve our alliances, if we stand by what has always made us strong... that is the most successful defence alliance in the world: NATO.” AFP

US’ potential nuclear tests will trigger chain reaction, warns senior Russian MP

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. A senior Russian lawmaker has warned the United States against conducting nuclear tests as this violation of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) will trigger a chain reaction.
"If the United States carries out nuclear test, this will constitute a violation of the moratorium under the CTBT and trigger a chain reaction. Russia has repeatedly said (despite its re-ratification of this treaty) that it will remain committed to the ban on nuclear tests as long as other parties comply with it," Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international committee of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), told TASS.
According to the lawmaker, the US needs to take a responsible approach to nuclear deterrence to avoid such a scenario. "The ball is now in the Americans’ court," he stressed.
In November 2025, the White House said that the Pentagon had been instructed to resume nuclear weapons testing immediately, citing the fact that other countries were already doing so. It did not specify what kind of tests were meant or whether they would include the detonation of nuclear warheads.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said back then that Russia had always been committed to its obligations under the CTBT and would continue doing so until any other country conducted such tests.

Patriots’ Stefon Diggs to be arraigned and denies assault allegation
New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is scheduled to be arraigned in Massachusetts on a felony strangulation charge and a misdemeanor assault and battery charge stemming from an alleged dispute with his former private chef
- Bookmark
New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Massachusetts on felony strangulation and other criminal charges stemming from an alleged dispute with his personal chef.
The arraignment at Dedham District Court was postponed until after Super Bowl LX so Diggs could play in the NFL championship game.
According to court records, the woman told Dedham officers she and Diggs argued about money he owed her for her work as his private chef. During the Dec. 2 encounter at his home, she said, he “smacked her across the face” and then “tried to choke her using the crook of his elbow around her neck,” leaving her feeling short of breath.
Diggs’ arraignment was originally slated for Jan. 23 but was moved to Feb. 13 — five days after the Patriots’ 29-13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks — to accommodate his playing schedule.
Diggs’ attorney has said he “categorically denies these allegations,” calling them unsubstantiated and motivated by a financial dispute. The Patriots released a statement saying they support him.
Investigators allege the woman first reported the incident to police on Dec. 16, two weeks after it occurred; she initially hesitated to file charges but later chose to do so, according to court documents.
The arraignment Friday will be the first court appearance in the case. The judge is expected to address bail conditions and set future hearing dates.

Top U.K. court rules terror designation of pro-Palestinian group unlawful

U.K. High Court rules Palestine Action protest group's designation as terrorist organization unlawful
London — Britain's High Court ruled Friday that the government's decision last year to outlaw the protest group Palestine Action as a designated terrorist organization was unlawful, but it kept the ban in place pending an appeal.
Judges Victoria Sharp, Jonathan Swift and Karen Steyn said "the nature and scale of Palestine Action's activities" did not meet the "level, scale and persistence" that would justify proscription.
The judges said they were "satisfied that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate."
Palestine Action revels in "victory," government vows appeal
Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori called the decision "a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history."
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was "disappointed by the court's decision and (I) disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organization is disproportionate.
"I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal," she said.
Last year, the U.K. government declared the pro-Palestinian group a terrorist organization alongside the likes of al-Qaeda and Hamas, making membership in or support for Palestine Action a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Since then, more than 2,000 people have been arrested for holding signs saying, "I support Palestine Action."
Supporters of Palestine Action and civil liberties groups say the arrests for peaceful protest ride roughshod over free speech and the right to protest.
London police say focus now on gathering info, not "making arrests"
As supporters of the pro-Palestinian protest group celebrated outside the High Court on Friday, London's Metropolitan Police force acknowledged that the ruling would likely cause "some confusion among the public as to what happens next," and it warned that "the group remains proscribed pending the outcome of any Government appeal, which means expressing support is still a criminal offense."
The force said officers would "continue to identify offenses where support for Palestine Action is being expressed, but they will focus on gathering evidence of those offenses and the people involved to provide opportunities for enforcement at a later date, rather than making arrests at the time."
"This is the most proportionate approach we can take, acknowledging the decision reached by the court while recognizing that proceedings are not yet fully concluded."
Palestine Action's protests and vandalism
The government banned Palestine Action in July last year, about a month after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base to protest British military support for Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. The activists sprayed red paint into the engines of two tanker planes and caused further damage with crowbars.
Palestine Action has carried out direct action protests at military and industrial sites in the U.K. since it formed in 2020, including breaking into facilities owned by Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems UK. Officials say the group's actions have caused millions of pounds in damage that affect national security.
Earlier this month, six Palestine Action members were cleared by a jury of aggravated burglary charges over their break-in at an Elbit Systems facility. They activists faced multiple criminal charges, but the jury returned no convictions after more than 36 hours of deliberations.
Before that, Palestine Action said members targeted President Trump's golf resorts in Scotland in March last year, vandalizing a clubhouse and the green at the Turnberry course in response to his proposal to empty the Gaza Strip of its Palestinian population and have the U.S. and its allies "take over" the territory.
The group said at the time that it rejected "Donald Trump's treatment of Gaza as though it were his property to dispose of as he likes. To make that clear, we have shown him that his own property is not safe from acts of resistance."
Police Scotland said the force was investigating the incidents, but no arrests were announced.
In their ruling on Friday, the High Court judges said that while "a very small number of" the protest group's actions "amounted to terrorist action ... regardless of proscription, the criminal law is available to prosecute those concerned."
Palestine Action terror designation came amid push to address antisemitism
In December, in the wake of the terrorist attack in Bondi Beach, Australia, targeting a Hanukkah event, Britain's two biggest police forces said officers would take an "enhanced approach" to counter antisemitism, arresting protesters who use certain slogans and phrases as they sought to address a surge in hate crimes targeting Jewish people in the U.K.
The announcement was a response, the London Metropolitan and Greater Manchester Police forces said, to the Bondi Beach attack, in which 15 people were killed.
The police forces cited a spate of incidents on British soil, including a vehicle and knife assault outside a synagogue in Manchester in October 2025 that left two Jewish people dead.
"Antisemitic hate crime has surged, protests have intensified, and online abuse has grown since 2023," the police forces said. "The increased fear in Jewish communities, and high number of terrorist attacks disrupted in recent years requires an enhanced response."
"The words and chants used, especially in protests, matter and have real world consequences," the statement said. "Now, in the escalating threat context, we will recalibrate to be more assertive."
"We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalize the intifada' and those using it at future protest or in a targeted way should expect the Met and GMP to take action," the two forces said. "Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed — words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests."

DHS shutdown looms as negotiations on funding bill stall on Capitol Hill
Lawmakers in the House and Senate left Washington on Thursday as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) heads for another shutdown, when stopgap funding lapses tonight. Nearly all Democrats blocked a second attempt to pass the annual DHS appropriations bill as negotiations for guardrails on federal immigration enforcement have stalled. Senator John Fetterman was the only lawmaker to break ranks with the party.
Forcing a shutdown is one of the few levers Democratic members of Congress can use to force Republicans to consider their demands to rein in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) as they conduct surges throughout the country. These include preventing officers from wearing masks, making sure body-worn cameras are used at all times, and requiring judicial warrants to conduct raids and arrests. Notably, these are requests that Republicans say are off the table.
This ongoing battle on Capitol Hill comes as Tom Homan – Trump’s “border czar” – announced the immigration crackdown in Minnesota would end on Thursday, after widespread backlash against ICE and CBP officers’ use of force in the state, which saw the fatal shooting of two US citizens and several weeks of protests.
US inflation eases to 2.4% according to latest data
The annual rate of US inflation eased in January, according to the latest data consumer price index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Over the last 12 months, the cost of goods has increased by 2.4% – down from 2.7% in last month’s report.

Donald Trump will travel to Fayetteville, North Carolina, with the first lady, Melania Trump,later today. He’ll deliver remarks to families of the Fort Bragg military base at 1.30pm ET, before heading to Palm Beach, Florida – where he’ll hold closed-door meetings over the weekend.
The treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said on Friday that any decision to narrow the scope of US metals tariffs would be made by President Trump.
Bessent, asked on CNBC about a Financial Times report that Trump is planning to roll back some of his 50% tariffs on steel, aluminum, copper and other metal goods, said he spoke to US trade representative Jamieson Greer about the matter and added: “We’ll see if there is a narrowing.“
“If anything is done, I think it would be some sort of clarification on some incidental objects, but again, that’s going to be the president’s decision,” Bessent said.
Donald Trump’s return to the White House has accelerated a profound shift in the global order, according to new analysis.
A report from Focal Data, which analyses UN voting records, reveals how Washington’s “America First” agenda has started to redraw the geopolitical map in favour of China.
In 2026, the world is now diplomatically closer to Beijing than it has been in recent memory, with significant shifts in alignments taking place during the start of Trump’s second presidential term.
These charts show how Trump is isolating the US on the world stage:
Donald Trump plans to scale back some tariffs on steel and aluminum goods, the Financial Times reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.
Officials in the commerce department and the US trade representative’s office believe the tariffs are hurting consumers by raising prices for goods including pie tins and food-and-drink cans, the FT report said.
Voters nationwide are worried about prices, and cost-of-living concerns are expected to be a major factor for Americans heading into the November midterm elections.
A recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 30% of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the rising cost of living, while 59% disapproved, including nine in 10 Democrats and one in five Republicans.
Justice department moves to drop charges against men accused of hitting ICE officer in Minnesota
Federal prosecutors in Minneapolis have moved to drop felony assault charges against two Venezuelan men, including one shot in the leg by an immigration officer, after new evidence emerged undercutting the government’s version of events.
In a filing on Thursday, the US attorney’s office for the district of Minnesota said “newly discovered evidence” in the criminal case against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis “is materially inconsistent with the allegations against them” made in a criminal complaint and a court hearing last month.
The government’s motion asked the judge for “dismissal with prejudice”, meaning the charges against the two men cannot be resubmitted.
The pending dismissal comes after a string of high-profile shootings involving federal immigration agents where eyewitness statements and video evidence called into question claims made to justify using deadly force. Dozens of felony cases against protesters accused of assaulting or impeding federal officers have also crumbled.
The case at issue in Thursday’s filing stemmed from a 14 January incident during which an FBI investigator alleged in an affidavit that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Aljorna, who crashed and fled on foot toward an apartment complex.
As an immigration officer chased and tried to arrest him, the government claimed, Aljorna began to violently resist.
As the officer and Aljorna struggled on the ground, Sosa-Celis and another man came out of a nearby apartment and attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle, the complaint alleged. The officer, who was not named in court filings, then fired his handgun, striking Sosa-Celis in the upper right thigh. The men then fled into a nearby apartment, where they were later arrested.
Thursday’s one-page motion seeking to dismiss the charges did not detail what new evidence had emerged, but cracks began to appear in the government’s case during a 21 January court hearing to determine whether the accused men could be released pending trial.
A senior US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) official says Moderna’s clinical trial on a new, potentially more effective flu vaccine was a “brazen failure” and that the FDA is now calling it into question.
The FDA unexpectedly refused to consider Moderna’s application for a flu shot based on messenger RNA (mRNA) technology in a decision that experts say is already having a chilling effect on vaccine development.
Officials say the issue is the design of the study, in which control group participants over the age of 65 should have received a high-dose flu shot instead of a standard flu shot. Outside experts say the reasons seem to go deeper.
“It’s all pretext and obfuscation when the real agenda is rejecting conventional science and serving a predetermined anti-vaccine agenda,” said Richard Hughes IV, a partner with Epstein Becker Green and law professor at George Washington University.
Dorit Reiss, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco, said “personally humiliating a company is not a legitimate reason to refuse to review a submission”, and the refusal needs to “address substantive reasons”. Angela Rasmussen, an American virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan, says “they’re just coming up with reasons to not approve mRNA anything, and they’re going to eventually do it to all these vaccines”.
Andrew Nixon, a spokesperson for the US Department of Health and Human Services, said the concerns that mRNA and other vaccines are being targeted by officials were “baseless”.
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, an AFP journalist said, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
The meeting came days after Donald Trump said he would host the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, at the White House late this year, as the world’s two biggest economies look to reset ties marred by a trade war.
Rubio arrived late on Friday in the Germany city, and is set to deliver a speech on Saturday to the annual meeting focused on international security and defence.
Trump’s climate repeal 'un-American' and 'Orwellian', says Kerry
Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you the latest news lines over the next few hours.
We start with news that the Trump administration has revoked the bedrock scientific determination that gives the government the ability to regulate climate-heating pollution. The move was described as a gift to “billionaire polluters” at the expense of Americans’ health.
The endangerment finding, which states that the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare, has since 2009 allowed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to limit heat-trapping pollution from vehicles, power plants and other industrial sources.
Donald Trump called the move “the single largest deregulatory action in American history”. “This is a big one if you’re into environment,” he told reporters on Thursday. “This is about as big as it gets.”
The move comes as part of Trump’s bigger anti-environment push, which has seen him roll back pollution rules and boost oil and gas.
On social media, Barack Obama said the repeal will leave Americans “less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change – all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money”.
The former secretary of state John Kerry called the new rule “un-American”.
“Repealing the Endangerment Finding takes Orwellian governance to new heights and invites enormous damage to people and property around the world,” said Kerry, who also served as Joe Biden’s climate envoy. “Ignoring warning signs will not stop the storm. It puts more Americans directly in its path.”

In other developments:
Daniel Rosen, the Trump-appointed US attorney in Minnesota, said in a court filing that charges should be dropped against an immigrant who was shot by a federal immigration officer last month because “newly discovered evidence” contradicts the account of the incident from federal officers.
Sensitive intelligence that a whistleblower has accused Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, of mishandling concerned a report from the National Security Agency on an intercepted phone call last year between two members of foreign intelligence who were discussing Jared Kushner and Iran, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times report.
Asked if he has “fired or disciplined that staffer who posted the video from your account that included the Obamas”, Donald Trump said that he had not. The president then went on to excuse the racist clip, which depicted Barack and Michelle Obama as cartoon apes.
A federal judge denied a request on Thursday from the Trump administration to pause her order keeping temporary legal protections for Haitian immigrants in place, and said that she would not be intimidated by death threats she read aloud in court.
Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, claimed US Customs and Border Protection in the San Diego area has saved 1.7 billion lives by seizing drugs.

US smuggled thousands of Starlink terminals to Iran as Iranian TV airs threats to Israeli leaders
The Trump administration smuggled thousands of Starlink terminals into Iran in January amid an internet shutdown, as tensions persist over the possibility of direct US military action on the country.
According to US officials who spoke to The Wall Street Journal, the US covertly shipped approximately 6,000 of the satellite-internet kits into Iran at the height of the regime's brutal crackdown on anti-government protests.
The Internet was shut down in Iran on January 8, amid reports that thousands of protesters had been killed by government security forces.
The shipment marks the first time the US has directly sent Starlink infrastructure to the country with the scope of assisting activists and civilians in circumventing the widescale internet outage imposed by the government, which left the country largely offline for more than 20 days.
Starlink is owned by the right-wing billionaire Elon Musk. The state department had previously bought nearly 7,000 Starlink terminals in the preceding months, according to the WSJ.
Meanwhile, US military deployment to the Middle East continues with the Pentagon saying it will send the navy’s largest and most advanced aircraft carrier to the region.
The USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group will be deployed to waters near Iran after spending multiple months in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean. It was involved in the operation to kidnap Venezuela’s President Nicholas Maduro on 3 January.
The carrier will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and at least nine other warships already deployed in the region amid escalating rhetoric between Washington and Tehran.
New Iranian 'hitlist'
On Friday night, Iranian state television aired a 'hitlist' of seven top Israeli officials saying that "by assassinating these criminals, Iran will bring security and peace around the world".
A photo of Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu featured alongside headshots of Mossad director David Barnea and Defence Minister Israel Katz titled "legitimate targets" were broadcast on Ofogh TV, a channel operated by the Iranian state broadcaster IRIB.
The presenter also issued a threat in Hebrew saying "we will determine the time of your death, wait for the Ababil" in reference to an Iranian-made drone by that name.
Previously, Iran’s Channel 12 had published a similar message of what it said was an assassination list of Iranian officials including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei.
Iran has accused Israel of attempting to sabotage the ongoing nuclear negotiations with the US following a visit by Netanyahu to Washington on Wednesday, who appeared to be pressing Trump to include the issue of Iran’s ballistic missile programme in the deal.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump denied that Netanyahu had asked him to stop negotiations with Tehran, saying an agreement could be finalised within the next month, "otherwise it’s going to be very traumatic for Iran".
Although no date has been set for the second round of the nuclear talks between the two countries, Iranian officials have said subsequent talks with the US were being planned.
Meanwhile, judicial authorities in Iran have released two reformist leaders after they were arrested earlier in the week, their lawyer told Iranian Students’ News Agency.
Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh were released after posting legal bail, with their representative saying he hoped Azar Mansouri, the head of the Iranian Reform Front who was arrested alongside the two officials, would likewise be released within the next two days.

UN defends expert on Palestinian rights after European criticism
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
GENEVA, Feb 13 - A U.N. human rights spokesperson expressed concern on Friday about attacks on independent U.N. experts after several European governments criticised the organisation's special rapporteur for Palestine, Francesca Albanese, and called for her resignation.
This follows condemnation from Germany, France and Italy this week of Albanese's alleged criticism of Israel. Albanese, an Italian lawyer, denies making the remarks.
"We are very worried. We are concerned that U.N. officials, independent experts and judicial officials, are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues," U.N. human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told a press briefing when asked about the criticism.
U.N. experts are commissioned by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to monitor and document specific human rights crises but are independent of the organisation itself.
On Friday, the Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Petr Macinka quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a "common enemy of humanity", and he also called for her resignation.
A transcript of Albanese's remarks made in Doha on February 7 seen by Reuters did not characterise Israel in this way, although she has consistently criticised the country in the past over the Gaza conflict.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Thursday that Albanese's position was "untenable", while French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot accused her of making "outrageous and reprehensible remarks" against Israel.
ALBANESE CRITICISES EUROPEANS OVER GAZA
Albanese said in overnight remarks on X: "Three European governments accuse me - based on statements I never made - with a virulence and conviction that they have NEVER used against those who have slaughtered 20,000+ children in 858 days."
She was citing figures from the Palestinian Health Ministry, which puts the total death toll from the Gaza war at more than 72,000.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration imposed sanctions on Albanese after she wrote letters to U.S. companies accusing them of contributing to gross human rights violations by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank.
Albanese, whose term expires in 2028, is due to speak at the Rights Council in Geneva next month on Palestinian rights.
There is no precedent for removing a special rapporteur during their term, although diplomats said that states on the 47-member council could in theory propose a motion to do so.

UN 'extremely worried' for Cuba amid US oil blockade

The United Nations said Friday it was deeply alarmed by the crisis unfolding in Cuba as the island nation struggles under what amounts to a US blockade of oil deliveries.
President Donald Trump has vowed to starve Cuba of oil after last month's US military abduction of Nicolas Maduro, the leader of Venezuela, which had been Cuba's main oil supplier.
"We are extremely worried about Cuba's deepening socio-economic crisis amid a decades-long financial and trade embargo, extreme weather events, and the recent US measures restricting oil shipments," UN human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told a media briefing in Geneva.
"This is having an increasingly severe impact on the human rights of people in Cuba.”
UN rights chief Volker Turk "reiterates his call on all states to lift unilateral sectoral measures, given their broad and indiscriminate impact on the population. Policy goals cannot justify actions that in themselves violate human rights," the spokesperson said.
Hurtado said that given the dependence of health, food, and water systems on imported fossil fuels, oil scarcity in Cuba had put the availability of essential services at risk.
"Intensive care units and emergency rooms are compromised, as are the production, delivery, and storage of vaccines, blood products, and other temperature-sensitive medications," she said.
More than 80 percent of water pumping equipment in Cuba depends on electricity, she added, saying power cuts were undermining access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene.
The island of 9.6 million inhabitants, under a US trade embargo since 1962, has for years been mired in a severe economic crisis marked by extended power cuts and shortages of fuel, medicine and food.
"The long-term, sustained impact of sectoral sanctions creates economic hardship and weakens the state's capacity to fulfil its core responsibilities, including providing protection and assistance services. This increases the risk of fuelling social disruption in Cuba," Hurtado said.
Cuba needs to respond to the situation in line with international human rights law, she added, prioritising mediation, de-escalation, and the safeguarding of the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression.

TESERO /Italy/. February 13. /TASS/. Norwegian cross-country skier Johannes Klaebo is now an eight-time Olympic champion after racing to the gold on Friday in the 10-km men’s cross-country skiing event Interval Start Free.
The 29-year-old Norwegian clocked the distance in 20 minutes 36.2 seconds to win the gold. Mathis Desloges from France crossed the finish line 4.9 seconds behind Klaebo to win the silver while another Norwegian athlete, Einar Hedegart, took home the bronze finishing 14 seconds behind his gold-medal-winning compatriot.
With the win, Klaebo equaled the record for most gold medals by a cross-country skier in Winter Olympics history belonging to his countryman Ole Einar Bjorndalen (also an eight-time Olympic champion). Norway’s Marit Bjorgen is the most decorated Olympian in women’s cross-country skiing with eight golds.
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026.

Ukrainian foreign minister says he invited Chinese counterpart to visit Ukraine
Andrii Sybiha meets with Wang Yi in Munich, says China can play ‘important role in bringing about just peace for Ukraine’
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Friday that he invited his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi to visit Ukraine during talks held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, which began earlier in the day.
In remarks to Ukrainian TV channel Novyny following the meeting, Sybiha said he and Wang had a “very substantive, pragmatic” conversation and discussed issues on the bilateral agenda as well as regional and global developments.
Noting that China is currently Ukraine’s primary trading partner, Sybiha said bilateral trade reached $21 billion last year and that Kyiv is interested in continuing the cooperation.
“We believe that China can play an important role in bringing about a just peace for Ukraine. We appreciate that China supports the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” Sybiha said.
He said the coming year will mark the 35th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Ukraine and China, and that they exchanged invitations to visit each other’s countries.
A later statement by Sybiha on US social media company X said he and Wang focused on "ways to develop mutually beneficial trade and bilateral ties based on reciprocal respect for territorial integrity."
Sybiha said he reiterated Kyiv's interest in contacts with Beijing at the highest level and that they discussed peace efforts and China’s role in facilitating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war, which will enter its fifth year later this month.
"I informed my Chinese counterpart about the battlefield situation, Russian attacks against our energy system, and the damage to Chinese companies from Russian strikes. I am grateful for Beijing’s decision to provide an additional humanitarian energy assistance package to Ukraine," he added.
Earlier in the day, Sybiha also held talks with German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and took part in the opening of the Ukraine House in Munich on the sidelines of the three-day conference.

‘We were careless’: Valeria Chomsky regrets relationship of her family with Jeffrey Epstein

Valeria Chomsky said she and her husband, linguist and philosopher Noam Chomsky, made a “grave mistake” and were “careless” in failing to examine Jeffrey Epstein’s background before befriending him, The Guardian reported Sunday.
Chomsky, 97, and his wife appeared in the Epstein files in connection with assistance provided to Epstein in 2019. In a lengthy statement published Saturday, Valeria said the disgraced financier had deceived them.
The most recent release of Epstein-related documents revealed that Chomsky maintained a friendship with him and, in 2019, offered advice on how to respond to sex-trafficking accusations.
“I’ve watched the horrible way you are being treated in the press and public. It’s painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,” Chomsky wrote in a message to Epstein, signing it “Noam.” Epstein later forwarded the message to an associate.
“What the vultures dearly want is a public response, which then provides a public opening for an onslaught of venomous attacks, many from just publicity seekers or cranks of all sorts,” Noam Chomsky wrote.
“That’s particularly true now with the hysteria that has developed about abuse of women, which has reached the point that even questioning a charge is a crime worse than murder.”
A friendship that cost Chomsky’s credibility
Valeria said her husband advised Epstein in 2019 on how to rehabilitate his public image, arguing the matter should be understood in proper “context.”
“Noam’s criticism was never directed at the women’s movement; on the contrary, he has always supported gender equity and women’s rights. What happened was that Epstein took advantage of Noam’s public criticism towards what came to be known as ‘cancelling culture’ to present himself as a victim of it,” she said.
She acknowledged that the couple conducted two financial transactions with Epstein, citing financial need. According to her statement, Epstein offered assistance after discovering “inconsistencies in his retirement resources that threatened his economic independence and caused him great distress.” She later concluded the offer was a “machination” to draw her closer to her husband.
Valeria said they never held investments with Epstein’s office.
Despite defending Chomsky, she admitted the couple had been “careless” in overlooking Epstein’s background and later realized they had been manipulated by someone leading a hidden, criminal, and inhumane life.
Although Epstein had claimed to Noam that he was being unfairly persecuted, Noam spoke from his own experience in political controversies with the media. Epstein created a manipulative narrative about his case, which Noam, in good faith, believed in,” she said.
She added that Epstein orchestrated a strategy to use someone from Chomsky’s youth to repair his reputation “by association.”
Last year, Chomsky described it in a message released by the House as the “most valuable experience” to have “regular contact” with Epstein. It remains unclear whether the message was ever sent.
Valeria confirmed the couple had a close relationship with Epstein, attending dinners at his New York townhouse, staying at his apartments in New York and Paris, dining at his ranch in New Mexico, and participating in academic gatherings with him.
According to her, they were unaware of Epstein’s true nature. “We never went to his island or knew about anything that happened there,” she said, adding that he had presented himself as a philanthropist interested in science.
“By presenting himself this way, Epstein gained Noam’s attention, and they began corresponding. Unknowingly, we opened a door to a Trojan horse,” she said.
“Epstein began to encircle Noam, sending gifts and creating opportunities for interesting discussions in areas Noam has been working on extensively. We regret that we did not perceive this as a strategy to ensnare us and to try to undermine the causes Noam stands for,” Valeria said.

Netanyahu faces tight race against Bennett in upcoming elections, new poll finds

A new Maariv poll showed Israel’s opposition bloc rising to 60 seats, tightening the political balance and intensifying competition ahead of the next election.
The survey pointed to a virtual dead heat in the race for prime minister between Benjamin Netanyahu and Naftali Bennett. Netanyahu received 41% support, while Bennett trailed narrowly at 40%.
At the same time, Gadi Eisenkot boasted a notable gain, rising three seats to 12. Bennett’s party dropped three seats to 21.
The poll was conducted by Lazar Research, headed by Dr. Menachem Lazar, in cooperation with Panel4All, following what it described as a turbulent week on the diplomatic and political front. Overall, the opposition bloc gained one seat, bringing its total to 60.
Most of this week’s movement occurred within the opposition itself. Alongside Eisenkot’s increase and Bennett’s corresponding decline, Yesh Atid rose by two seats, while the Democrats lost one.
Amid an ongoing wave of murders and violence in Arab society, Hadash-Ta’al dropped one seat to five, while Ra’am maintained its current strength.
Netanyahu coalition bloc remains at 50 seats ahead of elections
On the coalition side, the bloc remained steady at 50 seats, unchanged from the previous poll. Within the coalition, Likud lost one seat, while Otzma Yehudit gained one.
The breakdown showed the coalition bloc at 50 seats, the opposition–Bennett–Eisenkot bloc at 60 (up from 59), and Hadash-Ta’al and Ra’am together at 10 (down from 11).
The survey also tested several head-to-head matchups for prime minister.
Bennett nearly matched Netanyahu, with 40% preferring him and 41% preferring Netanyahu.
Against Eisenkot, Netanyahu held a narrow advantage, with 42% choosing him versus 38% who prefer Eisenkot.
Netanyahu’s lead widened against Avigdor Liberman, where he led 46% to 30%, and against Yair Lapid, where he led 47% to 30%.
The poll also found that 47% of Israelis do not believe Netanyahu’s version of events regarding the chain of events that led to October 7. By contrast, 28% said they believe his account, while 25% said they do not know.
The survey was conducted on February 11–12 among 593 respondents, representing a sample of Israel’s adult population aged 18 and over, both Jewish and Arab. The maximum margin of error is 4%.

Taylor Swift requests Trademark Office block bedding company's 'Swift Home' logo

Pop superstar Taylor Swift has asked the US Patent and Trademark Office to block a bedding company from securing a federal trademark featuring the phrase "Swift Home," arguing it would confuse shoppers.
Swift's company TAS Rights Management LLC told the agency in a filing on Wednesday the cursive "Swift" in Cathay Home Inc's logo closely resembles the singer's trademarked signature and would likely mislead consumers into thinking that she endorsed Cathay's products.
Attorneys and spokespeople for Swift and Cathay Home did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the filing.
Cathay's website says it sells its products through Bed Bath & Beyond, Target, Nordstrom, and other retailers. It applied last year to register a federal "Swift Home" trademark covering bedding items including pillows, mattresses and sheets.
Swift is a 14-time Grammy Award winner whose recent "Eras" tour was the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her company's filing on Wednesday said she owns federal trademarks covering the use of her name on bed linens, clothing, and other products, and that Cathay's proposed trademark would cause consumer confusion.
Swift registers few trademark disputes
Swift has experience with intellectual property disputes, but Josh Gerben, a trademark attorney who first reported the filing, told Reuters the pop megastar has filed relatively few trademark oppositions for a celebrity of her stature. Gerben, who is not involved in the case, said the logo's similarity to her signature may have been the trigger.
"Normally, somebody that has as much invested in IP as Taylor does, we would see more activity at the Trademark Office," Gerben said. "There just hasn't been this really strong enforcement or policing effort around 'Swift.'"

Middle Israel: Netanyahu's 55-page scarlet letter cannot rewrite October 7 - opinion
Unknown

‘Truth springs up from the earth,” this column warned Benjamin Netanyahu last fall (“The truth about denial,” 21 November 2025), and “justice looks down from the heaven” (Psalms 85:12).
The prime minister, as his latest attempt to distort the truth makes plain, was unconvinced.
Deluding himself he can manipulate public opinion no matter what the people saw, felt, and endured, Netanyahu this week released a 55-page booklet containing his responses to State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman’s questions about the October 7 fiasco’s events.
Sifting through its pages, a Martian might think it represents a sincere effort to expose the military thinking and political decisions that preceded Hamas’s invasion.
For instance, replying to the comptroller’s question about his Gaza strategy, Netanyahu sprinkles quotes from a cabinet meeting in 2014 in which the IDF, Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency), and the day’s ministers of defense, economics and justice all opposed conquering the Gaza Strip.
Similarly, concerning the days immediately before the massacre, the quotes include one from a representative of Military Intelligence that “we should preserve [in Gaza] the situation that is convenient to us.”
And concerning the funneling of Qatari cash into the Strip, Netanyahu declares that “all the security agencies presented the funding as an indispensable component in preventing escalation.”
Netanyahu's attempt to evade responsibility
Unfortunately for Netanyahu, the readers of this archival hodgepodge are not Martians but the people who have been here throughout the events it is designed to redraw as part of his ongoing effort to evade responsibility and flee the truth.
The tactic of this publication is as obvious as the strategy behind it.
The tactic is to cherry-pick quotes from protocols which the rest of us can’t access, and thus avoid the full, systematic, and impartial scrutiny that this war’s documentation demands. The strategy is also obvious: torpedo the emergence of a judicial commission of inquiry.
Netanyahu knows that a judicial panel’s creation after the Yom Kippur War resulted in Golda Meir’s departure, and another’s creation in the wake of the First Lebanon War ended Menachem Begin’s career.
Like David after learning of Bath-sheba’s pregnancy, Netanyahu fears the truth; the truth about the war that has his name written all over it.
This surfaced forcefully already in summer 2024, when he assigned Transportation Minister Miri Regev with planning the ceremonies of October 7’s first anniversary.
Incredibly, the site Regev chose for the commemoration’s main event was not one of the five kibbutzim where 245 Israelis were murdered, and from which most of the hostages were abducted. Instead, she – meaning Netanyahu – chose Ofakim, which was also victimized but much less than the kibbutzim.
The rationale was clear: kibbutznikim don’t vote Likud. They might use the opportunity to scream the truth. Ofakim votes Likud. Its people might swallow our lies.
Like the Ministry of Truth in George Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four, Netanyahu set out, then and there, to rewrite the past, in this case by diminishing the kibbutzim’s dominant share among the Hamas invasion’s victims.
The same fear made the prime minister fail to attend even one of the kibbutznikim’s funerals, or visit any of the hundreds of shiva houses where the slain kibbutznikim were mourned.
Fearing the truth and its most natural and potent vehicle, a judicial commission of inquiry, Netanyahu then had his people launch an all-out attack on Supreme Court President Isaac Amit. The same fear then made him reject President Isaac Herzog’s suggestion that the commission be headed by Amit’s deputy, Justice Noam Sohlberg, even though he is a conservative jurist appointed, for that reason, by Netanyahu’s government.
And last fall that same fear made Netanyahu pass a cabinet decision that the war would be probed by a panel selected not by judges but by politicians, a cowardly choice that even in its manipulative format has yet to be executed.
Now that same fear produced this week’s clumsy attempt to hoodwink any seeker of truth. The truth, alas, will not play by Netanyahu’s script.
The truth that Netanyahu has resolved to bury rests on three foundations, all of which don’t even need an investigation, because they are glaring.
The first is a televised vow outside Ashkelon on February 3, 2009, following a rocket attack from Gaza, in which a grandstanding Netanyahu said: “We can’t rely on miracles. We need action, action that will remove the threat. There is only one act that will do this, and it is to collapse Hamas’s rule in Gaza.”
Netanyahu, who was leader of the opposition at the time, won the following week’s general election, and then served as prime minister for 12 straight years. He had all the time in the world to do as he promised. In fact, he did the exact opposite.
The second truth is that the policy of cultivating Hamas, despite his booklet’s quotes, was Netanyahu’s idea. He had two reasons, which he refuses to admit: strategically, he thought Gaza was marginal, and ideologically, he thought cultivating Hamas would weaken the Palestinian Authority and thus strengthen Israel’s grip on the West Bank.
Lastly, and most crucially, no matter what any other official said or did, Netanyahu was in charge. That is what he fears a judicial commission will rule, and that is why he is out to besmirch the judges, twist the facts, and sabotage any panel that would unveil them.
It is a strategy second in its immorality only to its futility.
Like Nathaniel Hawthorne’s character Arthur Dimmesdale – the church minister whose cowardice makes him join the investigation of the married woman he himself got pregnant – Netanyahu is trying to glue to others the scarlet letter he should wear himself. It failed for that tormented priest, and it will fail for this godless enemy of truth.

Putin Will Miss Pax Americana

Putin Didn’t Know How Good He Had It
The Russian leader has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.
For decades, Russian President Vladimir Putin railed against the world that the United States built after the Cold War. In his account, an international order run by a single power would hinder Russia and produce needless conflict, especially when that power was as self-serving and duplicitous as America.
Now Donald Trump is dismantling the order that Putin had so long abhorred, and a new multipolar world is emerging in its place. Putin had thought he could rise to the top of such a system, in which raw economic and military might outweigh diplomacy and alliances. But he was mistaken: The norms and institutions of the postwar order actually masked Russia’s vulnerabilities. Putin has gotten the world he wished for—and it’s threatening to crush him.
Moscow had assumed that its immense nuclear arsenal, unparalleled natural resources, and extensive territory in the heart of Eurasia would keep Russia competitive with China and the United States. But these assets have been unable to slow its rapid decline. Russia’s economy is at best one-quarter the size of China’s and America’s, and the gap is growing. Meanwhile, it risks becoming an afterthought in the race for technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. The country’s economy and technology base are even slowly losing ground to India’s.
To make the case that his power is still secure, Putin has touted a wide-ranging strategic partnership with China, which Russia has tried to strengthen particularly since 2022. But the relationship has fallen short of his expectations. Bilateral trade increased at first, but it now appears to have plateaued. China has invested little in Russia’s economy, and nowhere near the amount that the West withdrew after Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Because Russia has few other major trading partners, China seems empowered to drive hard bargains: Negotiations on energy deals—one, called Power of Siberia 2, would bring Russian natural gas to China—have stalled because Moscow hasn’t been able to get Beijing to cover enough of the costs.
The war in Ukraine has only deepened Russia’s disadvantages. Before February 2022, some observers thought Russia was one of the world’s premier military powers—an assessment that Ukraine quickly upended. The conflict has now dragged on longer than the Soviet Union’s campaign against Nazi Germany, and it has resulted in more than 1 million Russian casualties, exacerbating the country’s chronic demographic crisis. Even if Putin is able to seize additional territory, most of it will be shelled-out cities and deserted land. Reconstructing it would require billions of dollars that Russia does not have and is unlikely to receive from others.
As Putin continues to pour resources into the war, he is hemorrhaging international support and influence. Russia’s long-standing partners in Syria and Venezuela have been swept out of power. Meanwhile, former Soviet states have reoriented away from Moscow and toward Western countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan turned to Trump to resolve a simmering dispute over a transportation corridor. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are strengthening their ties with Washington. Moldova has accelerated its political shift toward Europe. Putin believed that the end of the U.S.-led order would help him consolidate power in the former Soviet space. But Russia has been too weak and ineffective to take advantage.
Putin also assumed that a multipolar world would free him from American interference. And indeed, Trump has accommodated Moscow in some ways. His conciliation does not, however, extend to Russia’s energy sector, the foundation of its economy: Last fall, Trump levied wide-ranging sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil, the country’s two largest oil producers. The U.S. has also ramped up enforcement against shadow tankers, threatening a primary channel that Russia has used to sidestep sanctions on its oil sales. Trump’s plans to revive Venezuela’s petroleum sector might likewise hurt Russia. Executing those plans may prove more complicated than Trump anticipates, but they could drive Russia’s oil prices below what its federal budget can sustain.
Moscow is at the mercy of an American president who circumvents traditional channels of power and obliterates the constraints that once regulated their use. For example, Trump could attempt to use his recently constituted Board of Peace to bypass the United Nations Security Council—and Russia’s veto—and muscle through his preferred policy in the Middle East, eroding Moscow’s influence in the region. Thanks to decisions by both Trump and Putin, moreover, the two powers no longer have any functional arms-control agreements. Without these, Trump could choose to accelerate his “Golden Dome” missile-defense program, which Russia fears could undermine its own nuclear deterrence.
Trump’s disdain for international alliances and norms has also begun to reshape Europe in a way that may exacerbate Russia’s weakness. As U.S. security assurances wane, European countries are developing their hard-power capabilities. Germany has committed 100 billion euros to modernize its military, and Poland is building up its armed forces with a goal of amassing 300,000 troops. Putin has long wanted to split the U.S. and Europe. But he might soon find that the continent—which collectively dwarfs Russia in population and wealth—poses a significant challenge even if it doesn’t belong to a U.S.-dominated alliance.
Shortly before becoming president in 2000, Putin issued a manifesto explaining how Russia could keep from falling into the second or third rank of world powers. He insisted that America’s global leadership was holding Moscow back. In reality, he didn’t know how good he had it.

Informal meeting of EU countries ends in failure — Politico

BRUSSELS, February 13. /TASS/. An informal meeting of European Union member states, to which only 19 of the 27 community countries were invited, has ended in failure, the European publication Politico reported.
Originally planned on the initiative of Belgium, Germany and Italy as "a simple sit-down with like-minded countries," the meeting was reportedly supposed to take place before the main summit. Representatives of countries not invited to the meeting expressed concern that such gatherings could lead to pre-agreed decisions without the approval of all bloc members. Irish Taoiseach Micheal Martin, who said he was not invited, told journalists he did not "get the necessity of a private club convening separately."
According to Politico, out of the 19 leaders in attendance, only a few were given the opportunity to speak during the meeting. When asked by journalists what was discussed, one diplomat from a country that was in attendance, said "nothing."
Another factor "adding to the rancor" was that Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron were all running late after the informal summit, as a result of which Council President Antonio Costa began the first session on economic growth "before the three largest economies were even represented."

Newly uncovered footage from a camera inside Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach house has surfaced among the latest batch of Epstein files.
Three million pages of documents, including 2,000 videos and 18,000 photos, in the Epstein files were released more than a month after the congressionally-mandated deadline.
The fallout from the newly-released documents continues to embroil high-profile politicians and other figures as more revelations are uncovered.

US paid $32m to five countries to accept about 300 deportees, report shows

The Trump administration has spent more than $1m per person to deport some migrants to countries they have no connection to, only to see many sent back to their home nations at further taxpayer expense, according to a new congressional investigation.
A 30-page report from Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats, released on Thursday and shared with the Guardian, details how the US government paid more than $32m to five foreign governments – including some of the world’s most corrupt regimes – to accept approximately 300 third-country nationals deported from the US.
In the most extreme case, the administration paid Rwanda $7.5m plus an estimated $601,864 in flight costs to accept just seven people – about $1.1m per individual, according to the report’s analysis of government spending data and flight records. The administration similarly paid Equatorial Guinea $7.5m to take 29 people, costing taxpayers an estimated $282,126 per person. Palau was paid $7.5m with no documented flights, Eswatini was paid $5.1m for 15 people, and El Salvador $4.76m for about 250 people.
Committee staff indicated the state department is pursuing third-country deportation agreements with 70 to 80 countries. More than 80% of migrants sent to these third countries have already returned to their home nations or are in the process of doing so, the investigation found, raising the question as to why they were not deported directly in the first place.
“The Trump administration is sometimes paying the country to take people, flying them there and then paying to take them to their home country. It doesn’t make sense,” one current US official told committee staff, according to the report, which is the first of its kind under the second Trump administration.
“This is a scare tactic for them be able to tell people here in the US: if you don’t self deport, you could get sent to South Sudan. You could get sent to Eswatini,” a member of the committee told the Guardian. “I really think that that is a huge driving factor, both for the pace and the way in which they’ve been carrying this out.”
The practice has resulted in the US government paying twice for some deportees’ travel. In one case, a Jamaican national was sent to the southern African nation of Eswatini at an estimated cost of more than $181,000, only to be flown back to Jamaica on US-funded flights weeks later. The Jamaican government publicly stated it had “not refused the return of any of our nationals,” contradicting administration claims that third countries are only used when home governments refuse to accept deportees back.
“We spent so much of last year hearing about how we have to cut waste, we have to cut spending,” said the member. “We’re not spending millions of dollars on foreign assistance, on health saving dollars for childcare and maternity health and diseases and epidemics and famine around the world, but we are spending it on this.”
The administration has defended the removals by claiming it must send migrants to third countries when they are “so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won’t take them back,” as the Department of Homeland Security wrote in a June press release.
But the report documents multiple cases where home governments were willing to accept their nationals or were never properly contacted.
Court filings show that in several instances, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) did not request travel documents from home countries or failed to give governments sufficient time to process the paperwork. Mexico’s president said her government was never informed before a Mexican national was deported to South Sudan, the second most corrupt country in the world, according to Transparency International.
The report identifies a lack of oversight for the millions of dollars sent to foreign governments, several of which have documented records of corruption and human rights abuses. Equatorial Guinea, which received $7.5m to accept 29 people, ranks 172nd out of 182 countries for corruption according to Transparency International. The payment exceeds all US assistance provided to the country over the previous eight years combined.
Despite these red flags, there is no evidence the state department is monitoring how the funds are being used. The department appears to be relying on the foreign governments themselves to report on spending, rather than using independent auditors that typically oversee US assistance.
In the case of El Salvador, which received at least $4.76m, more than 250 Venezuelans were sent from the US and detained at the CECOT prison, where Human Rights Watch has documented credible reports of torture. The administration also returned several MS-13 gang leaders who had been serving as US informants, undermining a long-running federal investigation, according to the report.
The investigation reveals the administration has pursued these arrangements through opaque negotiations involving political concessions or pressure tactics. South Sudan requested sanctions relief on government officials and US investment in oil and gas in exchange for accepting just eight deportees.
Perhaps most controversially, the administration has struck a deal with Iran to deport 400 Iranian nationals, including Christian converts, ethnic minorities, and political dissidents. At least eight people on the first flight begged not to be sent because they feared for their lives.
“One man says he attempted suicide at a US detention facility in an attempt to avoid being sent back to Iran but was still deported,” the report reads.
The report also raises concerns the administration may be using third countries to circumvent US immigration law. Since September 2025, the majority of migrants flown to third countries had US court-ordered protections, meaning the US could not legally send them to their home countries due to the likelihood they would face persecution, torture or death. Yet within days of arriving in Ghana and Equatorial Guinea, many were sent back anyway.
A federal district judge, reviewing removals to Ghana, said in September: “These actions also appear to be part of a pattern and widespread effort to evade the government’s legal obligations by doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.”
Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee, wrote in the report’s introduction: “At a time when the Administration is already straining its relationships with longstanding allies, it is building transactional relationships with corrupt and adversarial regimes – not around shared interests or strategic goals, but opaque deals that do not serve American taxpayers or American security.”
The Guardian has approached the state department for comment on the concerns raised in the report.

Labour factions vie for influence over Starmer’s reset after McSweeney exit

As the prime minister fought for his political life before Labour MPs at their Monday evening meeting, even hardened sceptics saw a flash of something different in Keir Starmer.
Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said Starmer had been “liberated”. He did not have to spell out who from. His comments came 24 hours after the departure of Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, a man who has shaped Labour’s modern incarnation.
McSweeney’s presence loomed the largest over any other in Starmer’s government, and his departure means there are many cabinet ministers, groups and factions of the party who spy an opportunity to define what comes next.
“There is a vacuum in Morgan’s absence,” one senior Labour figure said. Referring to the cruel anecdote often used about Starmer – that he is a man who believe he is in control of a driverless train – he said: “Everyone is now vying for the central controls of the DLR, with Keir still in the fake driving seat. We really need the prime minister at some point to work out the controls for himself.”
Starmer’s closest friends in politics, including his biographer Tom Baldwin, have often expressed frustration that he has not shown his true beliefs in power.
On Tuesday, Miliband said he believed this was a moment when Starmer could decide to be more radical. “I’m one of his closest friends in politics. I have had a frustration, that the private Keir we know hasn’t been sufficiently on display to the public,” he said. He believed Starmer would “seize this moment and make it a moment of change”.
But what does that mean? Another senior Labour source said: “When people say: ‘Let Keir be Keir,’ they can often just mean he should do whatever they personally believe in.”
There are those who want to see a progressive pivot, for Starmer to more aggressively challenge Reform UK. Many want to see a symbolic gesture to end the McSweeney era of factionalism – a cabinet reshuffle, a change to the whips’ office, the end of parliamentary suspensions. Many believe the party needs to chart a new economic course, especially on the cost of living.
“He’s on reprieve until May. I think people looked on Monday and went: ‘I definitely don’t want a leadership contest now,’” one MP said. “But people can’t afford a decent life; it’s the most important issue. If you want to win again, we have to sort that out. The current policy prospectus isn’t going to do it.”
The faction that will flex its muscles the most in the coming weeks is the soft left, represented by the Tribune group of Labour MPs, of which Starmer was himself once a member.
Tribune’s executive, which includes the former cabinet minister Louise Haigh, will soon begin to put forward its own policy proposals, on the economy, long-term welfare reform and social cohesion.
One soft-left MP said: “We need a much more coherent economic and political strategy. Yes, the culture needs addressing, but No 10 also needs beefing up. It is horribly underpowered. And we need to turbocharge cleaning up politics – put some white knight in charge of it and let them crack on, not just a review.
“I don’t know what Keir’s appetite actually is to change anything radically. It’s not been evident so far. I fear he will just think he’s got through this and now back to business as usual.”
A left turn would be fiercely resisted by some in the parliamentary party. Starmer may have started off in Tribune, but under McSweeney’s direction, his most natural loyalists are now on the party’s right – including many ambitious new MPs who want to modernise Labour’s economic offering.
They want a focus on housing, growth and opportunities for the young, rather than a return to Labour’s traditional comfort zones of nationalisation and welfare.
In the coming weeks, the Labour Growth Group (LGG) will produce a document with the draft title the Beveridge report for the economy, which is already in the hands of Treasury ministers.
The group, often painted as loyalists to the Starmer project, will accuse the government of having come into power without a without a political and economic philosophy. But it will say a relentless focus on wages, opportunity and costs is the way to attract voters back both from Reform and the Greens.
The group will argue that Labour’s economic vision has been insufficiently radical and say Britain has become an “extraction economy” that rewards loopholes, skimming and grifting, rather than building and investing.
It will name a new list of “five giants” – as William Beveridge did in his 1942 foundation for the welfare state. The new barriers are the immiseration of low wages; the insecurity that comes from crushingly high bills; powerlessness that comes from a loss of faith in democracy; indignity, and the fracture of communities pitted against each other.
But the new MP Yuan Yang, who sits both on Tribune’s executive and the LGG, said there was common ground between the two groups.
“I’m personally very concerned about where productivity growth is really happening in the economy,” she said, adding that there were far too many companies that thrived on rent extraction, rather than innovation or producing valued services.
“In my part of Reading, property management agencies are a prime example of this. Residents are trapped and paying hundreds of pounds in monthly fees to them. They get away with it because they effectively have a monopoly over each residential estate,” she said.
“There are too many examples of this kind of anticompetitive behaviour. I want economic regulation, including a tax system, that disincentivises corporate grift and rewards hard graft. We need to make clear whose side we’re on.”
One minister called the report the most serious answer they had seen to the question of what Labour should be for. “Reform, the Greens and the nationalists are all eating into our vote because they can name something people feel in their daily lives – the system is broken – and point to who broke it. Their answers are garbage but at least they have a diagnosis. Right now we don’t even have that,” the minister said.
“The question the whole party is struggling with is how to respond when you’re losing voters to Reform and the Greens on both flanks. You can’t rebuild the coalition by just tacking one way and giving up the other, you need to be able to speak to both.”
For many new MPs there is intense frustration at the pace of change and the infighting and scandal that have dominated the last 18 months. More groups across the parliamentary Labour party are multiplying to generate new ideas to offer up.
Five MPs – Jeevun Sandher, Liam Byrne, Anna Gelderd, Andrew Lewin and Luke Murphy – have set up a space called Labour Thinks to bring in guest speakers on how to govern well and win back disillusioned voters.
Among almost all of Starmer’s critics, there is a desire to see a big change in the way No 10 operates and communicates. At present, Starmer has no chief of staff, communications chief or cabinet secretary, with the roles split across a number of acting placeholders.
“The most important thing Keir can do now is build the right team,” one minister said. “He must have the right chief of staff, the right lines of accountability, a person who can command trust and make fast decisions. I don’t know who that person is.
“I do not think it works as a shared position. Someone has to make the final call, quickly, and that cannot always be the prime minister himself, but someone who absolutely knows his mind and instincts.”
Cabinet ministers also wanted to see a marked change in approach. “You make bad decisions and bad judgments when you have an ever increasingly smaller worldview. That’s what leads to missteps and mistakes, because you’re not hearing alternatives,” one said. “We just need to give a much clearer articulation of ourselves and whose side we’re on and what we’re doing, who we’re doing it for.”
Another cabinet minister said: “I think Keir often gives the impression he thinks it is unfair that we are not being sufficiently credited for what we are doing,. Instead of believing it is unfair, we need to ruthlessly interrogate why that is.”
MPs and ministers are divided about whether a post-factional reshuffle would help Starmer, though the Tribune group made an explicit call when it gave its qualified backing to Starmer on Monday.
Many say the whips’ office is in need of total reform, with too many of the whips distrusted by MPs because they have personal relationships with ministers or advisers in No 10.
“In an ideal world we would do a reshuffle. We clearly need a broader coalition of voices at the top; we clearly need to bring in new talent,” one senior party figure said. “But at the same time, I don’t know if you can do an effective reshuffle at this point, when you are weak like this. It has to come from a position of strength. We are only a few months since the last disastrous one. I think Keir would have to tread very carefully with that.”
Almost every MP and cabinet minister said Starmer’s reprieve was temporary. Another scandal, the loss of the Gorton and Denton byelection, or catastrophe in the May elections could seal the prime minister’s fate.
But almost all said they thought the fundamental work of what needed to change to revive Labour’s fortunes had not been done by its potential new leaders. “I could not tell you a single thing about what the difference is between Wes [Streeting] and Angela [Rayner] and what they would change about the country – apart from vibes,” one Labour MP said.
For some new MPs, there is a sense of despair about how shallow the thinking is among those eager to change leader, reflected in the obvious leadership candidates’ lack of depth.
“One thing that has fucked our politics since 2016 is the delusion of people who think they can do the job for reasons that are ultimately facile and nothing to do with the massive challenges our country faces,” one said.
“Until people get serious about that being the test of who should be PM, our politics will keep convulsing and cycling through PMs at pace.”

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, US' Marco Rubio meet in Munich
Meeting on sidelines of Munich Security Conference comes as US President Donald Trump prepares for China trip in April
ISTANBUL
China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi and his US counterpart Marco Rubio met in Munich, Germany, on Friday.
The two are attending the 2026 edition of the Munich Security Conference.
A video record of the meeting showed Wang and Rubio holding talks along with their delegations.
No details on the outcome of the meeting were immediately available.
This was Wang and Rubio's second in-person meeting, following their first interaction in Malaysia last July.
The meeting comes as US President Donald Trump is expected to make his first trip to China, in his second term at the White House, in April.
The world’s top two economies have seen ties stabilize since last November, after momentary tensions over Trump’s steep tariffs.
Early this month, Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping, after the two met face-to-face in South Korea last October, during which the two leaders discussed bilateral ties, with the Chinese leader issuing a warning on arms supplies to Taiwan.

Chinese power line projects seek private capital in sign of infrastructure shift
Beijing is encouraging more private investment in a range of critical infrastructure projects, from railways to nuclear power plants
In the latest sign of China’s push to channel private capital into infrastructure, several local governments have begun actively seeking private investors for two major ultra-high-voltage power line projects – the first schemes of their kind to open up to non-state funding since a Beijing directive encouraging the practice last November.
One of the lines seeking private investment will stretch 1,996km (1,240 miles) from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in China’s far northwest to the city of Mianyang in Sichuan province. It will also provide power to the southwestern municipality of Chongqing.
The governments of Xinjiang, Qinghai province and Chongqing released separate notices last week calling for private investors to participate in the 31.1 billion yuan (US$4.5 billion) project alongside the State Grid Corporation of China, a major state-owned player in China’s energy sector.
The northwestern Gansu province issued a similar notice last month calling for private investment in another power line running from Gansu to Sichuan province, which has a planned investment of about 24.6 billion yuan.
Both projects are scheduled to be put into operation by the end of 2028.

UK spends over £400 million on long-range weapons as cooperation scales up with European allies

UK spends over £400 million on long-range weapons as cooperation scales up with European allies
UK will spend over £400 million this financial year on hypersonic and long-range weapons including joint projects with France, Germany, and Italy.
The UK is scaling up cooperation with key European allies to develop new long-range precision and hypersonic weapons, with spending on projects set to exceed £400 million this financial year.
Britain is progressing the Stratus joint missile programme with France and Italy – leading the work to develop a next generation stealth replacement to the Storm Shadow missile.
Stratus, which is developing both stealth and high-speed missile variants, already sustains over 1,300 high-skilled jobs in the UK. The new missiles will be able to defeat high-value targets, destroy enemy ships, and suppress enemy air defences.
At the same time, Britian’s new long-range weapon programme with Germany is progressing rapidly with a new joint study phase about to begin, accelerating both future stealth and hypersonic weapons. This follows the landmark UK-Germany Trinity House Agreement signed within the first months of this Government in 2024.
The new system – known as Deep Precision Strike – will have a range of over 2,000 km and be among the most advanced systems ever designed by the UK, coming into service in the 2030s. Long-range weapons are crucial to protecting the UK and our allies and boosting NATO deterrence.
The government has committed to the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War – hitting 2.6% of GDP from 2027 – to ensure that Britain and our allies are safe.
Defence Secretary John Healey MP said:
To meet this new era of rising threats, we need hard power, strong alliances and sure diplomacy.
We can see from the war in Ukraine the decisive impact of long-range precision weapons, so the UK is stepping up, investing more than £400 million for long-range and hypersonic weapons this year.
Alongside Germany, France and Italy, we will deliver the cutting-edge weapons that will keep the UK and NATO safe, boost deterrence, and build a new deal for European security.
Hypersonic weapons investment this year also includes funding for developing critical technologies, ground and flight testing, as well as significant funding for academic skills and training including funding post-graduate study.
The Defence Secretary is expected to discuss these projects and deepening industrial cooperation during crucial meetings with European and international allies at the Munich Security Conference.
This ramped up missile cooperation by European allies comes as Russia’s aggression in Ukraine continues. In early February, UK Defence Intelligence confirmed that Russia conducted a major multi-axis and multi-weapon strike on Ukraine, using long range bombers, hypersonic missiles, over 60 ballistic and cruise missiles, and 450 one-way attack drones.
The Defence Secretary is expected to talk to allies during a series of bilateral meetings at the Munich Security Conference about boosting support for Ukraine, defending Europe against growing Russian threats, and enhancing industrial partnerships with key allies and partners.

Ukraine to receive 10,000 drones produced jointly with Germany in 2026 – Zelensky
The Ukrainian President made the statement on Telegram after visiting the first German-Ukrainian joint enterprise producing drones for the Ukrainian military, located in Germany, Ukrinform reports.
“Already this year, 10,000 drones produced here will be delivered to Ukraine to strengthen our forces. Ukraine has long been working on establishing joint production lines in Europe. Today, this line is operational – the first in Germany. This is a real achievement,” Zelensky said.
During the visit, he received the first jointly made attack drone.
“We saw the production line and the first flight of the drone. This is modern Ukrainian technology. Battle-tested. Powered by AI. It will strike, it will scout, it will protect our soldiers,” the President added.
Zelensky noted that by the end of the year, a total of ten joint enterprise for Ukrainian drone production will be launched.
As previously reported, President Zelensky and Germany’s Minister of Defence Boris Pistorius toured the production facilities of the German-Ukrainian joint venture Quantum Frontline Industries GmbH in southern Germany.
The joint defense enterprise was established on December 15, 2025, under the “Build with Ukraine” initiative. The partnership between Germany’s Quantum Systems and Ukraine’s Frontline Robotics opened the path for the first industrial-scale production of Ukrainian drones in Europe.
The first fully automated industrial drone production line in Europe for the Armed Forces of Ukraine combines proven Ukrainian drone technology with German expertise in scaling and automation, setting a new standard for cross-border defense cooperation.
The companies are scaling up production of the Linza bomber drone, which enhances the tactical reconnaissance capabilities of the Ukrainian Defense Forces and allows remote mining operations.

Ukrtransnafta management not allowing to resume oil pumping via Druzhba

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Ukrtransfta operator, which provides for oil transit via the territory of Ukraine, is technically ready to resume oil pumping via the Druzhba oil pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia but company management is not authorizing the restart, several informed sources in the oil sector told TASS.
The Ukrainian company eliminated the contingency at the Brody line operation and dispatch station in Ukraine as early as on February 6, the sources said. Oil transportation over the Mozyr-Brody main oil pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia was halted in late January by a request of the Ukrainian side but the exact cause of the shutdown is not known. "Technical readiness to resume oil transportation is in place but there is no decision of Ukrtransnafta management to resume transportation," they added.
Ukraine blocked oil supplies to Hungary from Russia over the Druzhba oil pipeline to create difficulties for the Hungarian government on the verge of parliamentary elections, Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister of Hungary Peter Szijjarto said earlier.

US completes transfer of over 5,700 ISIS detainees from Syria to Iraq
Central Command says 23-day mission aimed at ensuring secure detention, preventing ISIS resurgence
Ankara
ANKARA
US Central Command (CENTCOM) announced on Friday that it has completed a 23-day mission to transfer more than 5,700 adult male ISIS (Daesh) fighters from detention facilities in northeastern Syria to Iraqi custody.
The transfer mission began on Jan. 21 and concluded following a nighttime flight from northeastern Syria to Iraq on Feb. 12, according to a CENTCOM statement.
CENTCOM said US forces successfully transported the detainees to help ensure they “remain secure in detention facilities.”
“Job well done to the entire Joint Force team who executed this exceptionally challenging mission on the ground and in the air with great focus, professionalism, and collaboration with our regional partners,” said Admiral Brad Cooper, CENTCOM commander.
“We appreciate Iraq’s leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security,” he added.
US and coalition forces operating under Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) led mission planning, coordination, and execution.
“I am extremely proud of the coalition’s exceptional work,” said US Army Maj. Gen. Kevin Lambert, CJTF-OIR commander.
“The successful execution of this orderly and secure transfer operation will help prevent an ISIS resurgence in Syria,” Lambert said.
CENTCOM established CJTF-OIR in 2014 to advise, assist, and enable partner forces in the fight against ISIS, which was territorially defeated in 2019.

Next Ukraine negotiations to be held in Geneva
The next round of negotiations between Moscow, Kyiv and Washington to try to find a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, the Kremlin announced on Friday.

“The next round of negotiations (…) will take place on February 17 and 18 in Geneva, also in a tripartite format between Russia, the United States and Ukraine,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Ria Novosti.
He said that Russian negotiator and presidential adviser Vladimir Medinsky, who has already taken part in several rounds of talks between Ukraine and Russia, would lead the Moscow delegation in Geneva.
Asked about this announcement, the Ukrainian leader’s adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn, confirmed that the Kyiv delegation was “preparing” for these talks in Switzerland.
Contacted by the Swiss News Agency Keystone-ATS on Friday, the Swiss foreign ministry said Switzerland supported any diplomatic initiative aimed at establishing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine. “The foreign ministry is in contact with all the parties and is constantly offering its good offices to help find a path to peace,” said Nicolas Bideau, head of communications at the foreign ministry. He added that this offer was reiterated during talks held last week in Kyiv and Moscow.
+ Why Switzerland is cautious about using Russian funds to finance Ukraine
On Wednesday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the United States had proposed to organise a third round of direct talks between Kyiv and Moscow next week in Miami, following two meetings this year in Abu Dhabi.
According to the Ukrainian president, Kyiv “immediately” accepted this meeting in Florida. “It is not important for us whether the meeting takes place in Miami or Abu Dhabi. The main thing is that there are results,” he continued.
In recent weeks, Russia, Ukraine and the United States have held two rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi on a cessation of hostilities, while Russia’s deadly and devastating bombardment of Ukraine’s energy network continues.

AI safety expert quits Anthropic and says the the ‘world is in peril’
Mrinank Sharma said he was worried about the dangers posed by AI – and would instead write poetry
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
An AI safety expert has quit one of the world’s leading artificial intelligence firms, warning that the “world is in peril”.
Mrinank Sharma, who previously worked at Claude maker Anthropic, said that we are in danger from “a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment”.
Instead of continuing to work on the safety of artificial intelligence systems, he would work on poetry and move back to the UK and “become invisible”, he said.
It comes amid increasing concern over the safety of artificial intelligence systems, and the behaviour of the companies building them. Mr Sharma’s announcement came around the same time that an OpenAI researcher left the company over its decision to put ads into ChatGPT.
“It is clear to me that the time has come to move on. I continuously find myself reckoning with our situation,” Mr Sharma wrote. “The world is in peril. And not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.
“We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences. Moreover, throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions.
“I've seen this within myself, within the organization, where we constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most, and throughout broader society too.”
Mr Sharma said that he had been particularly proud of his work on examining “AI sycophancy and its causes”, as well as the ways that artificial intelligence could be used to enable bioterrorism.

Hong Kong’s West Kowloon arts hub secures HK$3 billion, 10-year loan facility
Deal, together with US$1 billion bond issuance in tranches, will help operator meet financing challenges until property project generates revenue
The financing would provide a much-needed lifeline to the West Kowloon Cultural District Authority in the coming decade before its residential property development could start to generate income, board chairman Bernard Chan said on Friday.
“The loan facility will bridge a funding gap, and the significance is that the bank is confident about our future ability to make money,” Chan said.
The authority said it had signed the HK$3 billion, 10-year loan facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Asia), or ICBC.
The duration is unusually long, as such deals are normally five years in the city.
ICBC (Asia) chairman and executive director Liu Yagan said that along with the authority the bank hoped to add more financial momentum to the soft power of Hong Kong and the country as a whole.

Global logistics and transport giant DP World has ousted its chairman after the publication of messages between him and Jeffrey Epstein.
The Dubai-based firm, which owns P&O Ferries in the UK, said it has replaced Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem as chairman of the state-backed business.
The company, which also runs container ports in London and Southampton, did not directly name Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem in its announcement but said Essa Kazim would now become DP World’s chairman.
Meanwhile, Yuvraj Narayan has been named as group chief executive officer to help lead the company.
It came after DP World faced intense pressure over the future of Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem’s position after the publication of fresh files related to Jeffrey Epstein by the US justice department.
Mr Epstein died in jail in 2019 after he was charged with sex trafficking.
The emails included messages from Sulayem describing women, one of which included details about their age, weight, height and bra size.
Some of the company’s largest international partners, such as the British International Investment development finance operation, reportedly threatened to halt future partnerships with DP as a result.
On Friday, the company added: “DP World affirmed that the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth and reinforce its role in strengthening global supply chains and supporting Dubai’s position as a leading hub for trade and logistics.”
DP World faced criticism from British MPs and unions in 2022 after its P&O Ferries business sacked 800 staff and replaced them with cheaper agency workers.

The next round of talks on Ukraine will take place in Geneva on Feb. 17-18, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday.
According to Peskov, cited by Russian state media outlet TASS, Vladimir Medinsky will lead the Russian delegation. Peskov also confirmed that the meetings will be held in a trilateral format including Russia, the US, and Ukraine.

Ukraine’s presidential office confirmed the dates and format of the peace talks. Presidential communications adviser Dmytro Lytvyn told reporters that Kyiv’s delegation is currently preparing for the negotiations.
At the center of the discussion is Medinsky, former Russian culture minister and favored ideologue of Russian President Vladimir Putin. RBC-Ukraine notes that Medinsky organizes propaganda events in Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine and supports Russian military units through the Russian Military Historical Society, which he founded and leads.
He also oversees Kremlin-aligned indoctrination programs for schoolchildren and has authored history textbooks used across Russia and in Ukraine’s occupied territories.
Observers have recalled Medinsky’s role in talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 16, 2025, where he cited fabricated quotes attributed to Napoleon I and Otto von Bismarck.
According to Russian outlet Vazhnye Novosti, Medinsky told Russian television propagandist Yevgeny Popov that he had conducted the negotiations according to a folder of documents, which he showed him during the broadcast. Medinsky then launched into an improvised lecture on various historical wars – from the Russo-Turkish conflicts to World War I and the Soviet-Finnish War – ultimately using these dubious historical references to argue that Russia could not accept a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.
Ramstein Meeting Secures $38B in Military Aid for Ukraine in 2026, Defense Minister Says
Andriy Kovalenko, head of Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council Information Counteraction Center, later addressed Medinsky’s claims.
He said Medinsky had falsely attributed to Bismarck the line that Russians cannot be deceived because they “always come back for their own.” Kovalenko stressed that no such wording appears in Bismarck’s memoirs, letters, or speeches – a point confirmed by German historians and even by Medinsky’s own Russian Military Historical Society.
Medinsky had likewise misquoted Napoleon, attributing to him a statement about conducting war and negotiations simultaneously. According to Kovalenko, no historical sources support this claim either.
He concluded that Medinsky’s repeated use of apocryphal quotations appears designed to provide ideological cover for Moscow’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday said negotiations to end the war in Ukraine remain far from finished, dismissing what he called overly optimistic claims of progress.
Speaking to Russian TV, Lavrov said talks held in Abu Dhabi showed there was “still a long way to go,” pushing back on suggestions that US President Donald Trump had forced Kyiv and Europe toward a ceasefire.
Prior to that, Lavrov accused Washington of derailing its own peace initiative, claiming Russia accepted US proposals during earlier talks in Anchorage but that the Americans later backed away while maintaining sanctions.
Previous US-mediated Russia-Ukraine talks took place on Jan. 23-24 and Feb. 4-5. Trump said a settlement was “almost achieved,” while US envoy Steve Witkoff called the discussions “constructive” – an assessment echoed by Peskov.
According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, a “fundamental difference” remains: Kyiv wants a ceasefire which would retain current territory, while Russia is demanding sweeping concessions, including Ukraine’s withdrawal from large areas and international recognition for Russian-occupied regions.
Four years into Russia’s full-scale war, Moscow has gained control over roughly 20 percent of Ukraine, with the Kremlin promising to push onwards if peace talks collapse.

Sweden's finance minister says 'no money for reforms' after election

"It's an election year and many parties are going to present their reforms, but people also need to bear in mind that a large proportion of the leeway for extra spending over the coming mandate period is already spoken for," Svantesson said at a press conference on Friday morning.
"There is going to be limited space for unfinanced election promises. This is something it is important for the Swedish people to know."
At the press conference, Svantesson presented a slide showing the spending decisions already made for the years 2027 to 2030, with high spending expected on defence (green), infrastructure (light blue) and criminal justice (dark blue).
Svantesson's statement drew sharp criticism from the opposition parties and comes as the Swedish Fiscal Policy Council, which assesses the economic impact of government borrowing and spending, is expected to slam the government's 2026 budget in its annual assessment.
The experts on the council write that they have presented the "most severe criticism" the council has ever given a government in this year's report, which has been obtained by Swedish public broadcaster SVT ahead of publication on Monday.
The report slams the government as behaving in a "short-sighted and political" way, by using debt to finance heavy tax cuts while massively increasing defence spending outside of Sweden's fiscal policy framework.
“It is striking to claim that it is necessary to deviate from the balance target in order to cope with the increased defense spending in the short term, at the same time as it is clearly possible to further reduce income tax by a similar amount,” the report reads.
The Social Democrats and Centre Party, who backed the decision to fund defence spending from outside the framework, nonetheless accused Svantesson of mismanaging the nation's finances.
Mikael Damberg, economic spokesperson for the Social Democrats, attacked Svantesson for her "deeply irresponsible" statement.
"We are seeing the receipts of an irresponsible economic policy," he said. "This is not the first time we have had a right-wing government that leaves behind it a big deficit, low growth and high unemployment."
Martin Ådahl, the Centre Party's economic policy spokesperson, said the government's economic policy had failed.
"Despite an expansionary fiscal policy, the Swedish economy is in the bottom league of the EU. It is disappointing that the government has wasted so many resources without reducing unemployment and increasing people's real incomes," he wrote.
Svantesson said that the leeway for future spending was tight because of the major spending commitments the government has made on building new prisons, increasing Sweden's defence capacity, and on other infrastructure.
In the autumn, the government presented an extremely expansive pre-election budget which included 80 billion kronor in extra spending, including a decision to halve VAT on food during the election year, with most of the extra spending funded by increased government debt.
Svantesson said that the Moderate Party intended to ensure that all of its election promises for the coming mandate were properly financed, so that if the government wins a second term it can carry out its election pledges at the same time as strengthening the public finances.
"You can finance a lot of what you want to do with higher taxes, the problem is that this drags down growth," she said. "I also think it's bad politics."
She said that there was also limited scope for the debt funding of government spending if the government wanted to bring the public finances back into balance, as the Social Democrats have also agreed to do.

Landmark civil case seeks reparations from Myanmar military for Rohingya genocide
Unknown

A UK-based human rights group has filed a civil claim in an Argentine court seeking reparations for survivors of the Rohingya genocide.
Filed in Buenos Aires by the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK (BROUK), the petition targets senior Burmese military leaders and demands that their economic assets be used to compensate victims.
A Muslim ethnic minority group that has lived for centuries in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar, the Rohingya have suffered decades of violence.
In August 2017, a massive wave of violence in Myanmar’s Rakhine State forced more than 750,000 people to seek refuge in Bangladesh after entire villages were burned to the ground, killing thousands of families.
The petition is filed under the principle of universal jurisdiction, which says that all states have the obligation to prosecute a serious crime like genocide even if it is conducted elsewhere by a non-national.
The civil claim is part of a criminal investigation in Argentina, where the judiciary is already pursuing charges against senior Burmese military officials for genocide and crimes against humanity against the Rohingya.
The petition names Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Soe Win, among others, and urges the court to identify and seize assets linked to the military’s vast business empire.
Tun Khin, president of BROUK, described the filing as a critical step towards meaningful justice for the persecuted community.
“(The) Rohingya have suffered through a decades-long genocide, affecting every aspect of their lives,” Khin said in a press statement on Friday.
Under international human rights law, victims of gross violations have a recognised right to reparations, including financial compensation, rehabilitation, public apologies and guarantees of non-repetition.
“The generations of Rohingya victims – whether still in Burma or living as refugees elsewhere – have a right to reparations, and we hope this case in Argentina will be the first real step towards that,” Tun Khin said.
The petition highlights assets identified by the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar, including the two major military-owned conglomerates, namely Myanmar Economic Holdings Limited (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), as well as other “crony companies” tied to the armed forces.
BROUK has asked the Argentine court to collaborate with the UN mechanism and domestic financial investigators to trace further assets that can fund compensation.
According to Maung Zarni, a UK-based genocide scholar originally from Myanmar, the Argentine civil claim sets a precedent in terms of universal jurisdiction in post-Holocaust legal history.
“But like all judicial decisions coming out of the existing body of UN and state-based courts, even if reparations are ordered, the Argentine court ruling amounts to little or nothing if it cannot be enforced,” he tells TRT World.
He says the genocide in Myanmar is not the work of isolated individuals. “Genocide is a crime jointly perpetrated by the state organs… and dominant society at large. Seeking reparations has to mean reparations from these institutions,” he says.
Who are the Rohingya?
A Muslim minority in majority-Buddhist Myanmar, the Rohingya have faced systematic persecution for more than four decades.
In 1978, the military regime of General Ne Win launched Operation Dragon King, which drove about 200,000 Rohingya into Bangladesh.
Many of them later returned, only to face renewed cycles of discrimination, denial of citizenship under the 1982 Citizenship Law that turned members of the community into “resident foreigners”.
The 2017 military crackdown marked the most brutal phase of the ongoing persecution of the Rohingya.
Triggered by attacks on police posts by the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, Myanmar security forces unleashed what the UN described as a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in a matter of months.
The UN Fact-Finding Mission later concluded that the operations “bore the hallmarks of genocide”.
In 2022, the US formally determined that the Myanmar military had committed genocide against the Rohingya.
Today, over a million Rohingya remain in overcrowded camps in Bangladesh, facing little prospect of safe return.
Inside Myanmar, those who stayed suffer severe restrictions, while the country has been plunged into civil war since the military’s 2021 coup against the government of Aung San Suu Kyi, who herself is now imprisoned.
What began as widespread protests have now evolved into a nationwide armed resistance involving ethnic militias and armed groups challenging the junta, also known as the Tatmadaw or feudal army.
The military controls major cities like Yangon, but rebels hold parts of border regions, leading to a patchwork of control that experts describe as “internal balkanisation”.
Reparations, financial and otherwise
Zarni, the genocide scholar, acknowledges the symbolic importance of naming generals for personal asset seizure as they bear the “highest personal criminal responsibility” for the genocide.
However, he insists that the naming exercise “simply does not make sense” beyond establishing in a court of law that each individual bears criminal responsibility.
On the practicality of seizing military conglomerates such as MEHL and MEC, Zarni is blunt: “(There’s) absolutely zero chance of military-owned economic institutions such as those named in the case to comply with any court order for reparations for the Rohingya,” he says.
International legal rulings are “typically not enforceable”, he adds.
Instead, Zarni points to the far greater leverage held by the US in the shape of sanctions.
“The US treasury has incomparably greater power to exact economic punishment,” he says, adding that the talk of reparations will remain symbolic unless Washington decides to back a court order.
About $1 billion belonging to Myanmar’s military rulers remains frozen in the US banking system since 2021.
Asked what non-financial reparations matter most to the Rohingya, Zarni says the recognition of the full historical scope of their suffering is important.
“It is still important for the victims to receive legal recognition by the world’s court of the gravest crimes the Rohingya have suffered,” he says.
“I would still consider court rulings as something worthwhile, although they will not guarantee no repetition of the same crimes against the Rohingya.”

Merz, Macron to address Munich Security Conference amid disputes with US
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will also address the conference.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron will deliver addresses on the first day of the Munich Security Conference (MSC), with Russia’s four-year war in Ukraine high on the agenda and amid strained ties between the United States and Europe.
Merz will open the conference at 1:45pm local time (12:45 GMT), while his French counterpart will close Friday’s official programme with a speech at 7pm (18:00 GMT), according to the MSC agenda.

European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper will also address the conference over the course of the day.
They are among more than 60 heads of state and government and about 100 foreign and defence ministers who have descended on the Bavarian southern German city amid high security, with about 5,000 police deployed for the event.
This year’s conference comes as relations between Europe and the US, their traditional allies and guarantors of the continent’s security for decades, are under immense pressure.
Since returning to the White House last year, US President Donald Trump has frequently criticised European countries for not sharing enough of the burden on common defence.
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex the Arctic island Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest, pushing back in a rare and concerted public rebuke of Washington.
Top of the agenda are issues on which the US has been leading diplomatic efforts: not only Russia’s war in Ukraine but also Iran’s nuclear programme and Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, said Al Jazeera’s James Bays, reporting from Munich.
The mood ahead of this conference is “very different from years in the past,” said Bays.
“Diplomats I’ve spoken to since I was in Munich a year ago talk about the Munich moment, when US Vice President JD Vance” used the occasion to criticise European policies on immigration and free speech, said Bays, adding: his behaviour was “such a contrast with the past, when this was quite a cosy gathering, celebrating the transatlantic alliance.”
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, “arguably a slightly more diplomatic figure” than Vance, arrived in Munich on Friday and will address the conference on Saturday, said Bays.
Before departing for Germany, Rubio said that transatlantic ties faced a “defining moment” in a rapidly changing world.
“The Old World is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be,” he said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy also arrived on Friday and will speak at the annual gathering on Saturday, organisers said.
Zelenskyy is expected to discuss security with a string of European allies, including Rubio and Merz, ahead of the next round of US-brokered talks with Russia, which the Kremlin said would resume next week.

Iran's military degraded by 12-day war with Israel, but still has significant capabilities
Fears are rising of the outbreak of another war that could spread into a regional conflict in the Middle East as U.S. President Donald Trump raises the pressure on on Iran to give up its nuclear program
- Bookmark
With one American carrier strike group already in the Middle East and another apparently on its way as U.S. President Donald Trump ramps up pressure on Iran to give up its nuclear program, fears are rising of the outbreak of another war that could spread into a regional conflict.
The 12-day Israel-Iran war last year appeared to cripple key elements of Iran’s military, yet left its capabilities far from neutralized — a distinction that looms large as tensions rise again.
If hostilities erupt again, the risk of a broader protracted conflict returns, especially if Iran's leadership sees the fight as one for its existence.
Open skies
The June 13-24 war started when Israel launched strikes targeting Iran’s nuclear program and top military officials. The United States joined the conflict, hitting three nuclear sites with massive “bunker-buster” bombs dropped from B-2 stealth bombers that flew their mission from their home base in Missouri.
It was a risky move for Trump, who has criticized his predecessors for involving the U.S. in “stupid wars,” but Iran responded weakly, with a limited missile attack on an American military base in Qatar that it warned Washington of in advance, and which caused no casualties. Tehran and Israel then both agreed to a ceasefire.
Israel was able to significantly degrade Iran's air defenses with airstrikes and covert attacks from teams on the ground. Iran, presumably aware that its older F-14 and MiG-29 fighters were no match for the fifth-generation American F-35 stealth fighters and other aircraft flown by Israel, also never sent its air force into action.
That left the skies clear for Israel to carry out waves of attacks, and for the U.S. to hit Iran's nuclear facilities and get out of Iranian airspace without the B-2 bombers ever being fired upon.
If hostilities resume, that scenario is likely to repeat, said Sascha Bruchmann, a defense analyst with the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Bahrain.
“In practical terms, in reductionist terms, the sky is open for American and Israeli planes,” he said. “The problem is how to defend the region from the retaliation.”
Bruchmann said in the case of an expanded war, Iran would most likely hit back by targeting U.S. bases in the region, but could also attack oil infrastructure and mine the Strait of Hormuz, which links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman, through which about a fifth of the world's oil is transported.
They could also attempt to hit the American aircraft carriers, though they're well defended by the destroyers in their strike groups, Bruchmann said.
“If the regime itself believes its survival is at stake, which it did not believe in June last year, I think the game is different,” he said. “If you have a ... regime that thinks it's about to go down, when why would you hold back with retaliation?”
Iran's missile cupboard
Iran fired hundreds of missiles during the 12-day war and used more than 1,000 attack drones, killing nearly three dozen Israeli civilians and wounding thousands.
Danny Citrinowicz, a researcher at Israel’s Institute for National Security Studies and a former Iran specialist in Israel’s military and intelligence services, said that it remains unclear how much missile capacity Iran has rebuilt.
“You can see through satellite imagery, attempts to restart manufacturing,” he said, adding that government leaks in Israeli media suggest that Israel assumes Iran still retains a substantial number of short-range ballistic missiles.
Israeli strikes last year focused on what officials saw as the most immediate threats — Iran’s medium- and long-range missiles — leaving Tehran with a reduced but far from eliminated ability to threaten Israel. Its ability to hit nearby U.S. bases with short range missiles, seems barely diminished.
“The short-range ballistic missiles did not suffer any significant hit whatsoever in the 12-day war,” Citrinowicz said.
Iran's exact capabilities aren't known, but it’s thought to still have more than 1,000 long range missiles that could hit Israel, and several thousand of the shorter-range missiles that could be used to hit American bases or other targets nearby, Bruchmann said.
Missile stockpiles matter only if a country retains the systems to launch them. Israel also took out many of Iran's launchers, but wasn't able to destroy them completely, and it seems likely that Iran will have been working hard to rebuild that capacity.
Very different stakes
Iran's military vastly outnumbers that of Israel, with about 600,000 regular troops and 200,000 in the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, including the elite Quds Force.
In the past they have also relied on proxy forces. Those include Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. But each has been so degraded by recent fighting that it's an open question whether they would be able — or willing — to come to Iran's assistance from Gaza, Lebanon or Yemen.
A bigger threat might come from Iran-linked militias in Iraq, which could threaten U.S. forces on the ground there.
Israel has around 170,000 members of active duty forces and another 400,000 reserves. But even though their military is smaller, many have been battle hardened by regional conflicts and they also have the latest U.S. and European equipment as well as a robust domestic defense industry.
It also has the support of the U.S., both with its naval assets and multiple bases in the Middle East, including Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which hosts thousands of American troops and is the forward headquarters for U.S. Central Command.
But beyond comparing numbers and capabilities, Bruchmann said that when thinking about a possible all-out conflict, one has to look at what the sides are willing to risk.
“My assumption is that Americans are trying to plan for zero casualties,” he said. “We're talking regime survival versus a zero casualty intervention — so just phenomenally different stakes.”

My Word: The painful probe into October 7 - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
12:53:13 UTC
21:53:13 KST

The basic guideline of journalism is often summed up as “The 5 Ws”: Who, What, When, Where, and Why.” This provides a good starting point for any investigating committee, too, which is why I am running into difficulties writing this piece and why the country does not yet have an official, accepted commission of inquiry into the events surrounding October 7, 2023.
There is no doubt about the seriousness of what happened that dreadful day. Hamas led an invasion from Gaza into southern Israel and perpetrated a mega-atrocity that resulted in the slaughter of 1,200 people, the abduction of 251, the wounding of thousands, and the displacement of tens of thousands. In the North, thousands more became refugees as Hezbollah also launched rockets and seemed poised to join in with a similar attack.
The resulting war, known variously as the “October 7 War,” “Swords of Iron,” and “Tkuma” (revival) was conducted on seven fronts, including missile barrages from Iran and its proxies, as well as intensive fighting in Gaza and Lebanon that cost the lives of more than 1,000 soldiers. The nation was scarred and traumatized even after the existential threat had been successfully repelled – and in some operations, spectacularly so.
When the body of Ran Gvili, the last of the hostages, was returned from Gaza last month, the country moved into a new phase. Demands for a commission of inquiry naturally increased. Just what type of probe it should be, however, is far from being a consensus issue. The basic lack of trust between the judiciary, the government, and the general public has exacerbated the problem. Any commission of inquiry runs the risk of increasing polarization.
The question of “Who” covers both who will be investigated – political, military, and civilian figures – as well as who will carry out the investigation: a state committee of inquiry (headed by a judge and appointed by the president of the Supreme Court); a governmental review commission (appointed by a minister or the government); or a parliamentary commission of inquiry (established by the Knesset). So far, calls by the government for the opposition to join a commission with equal numbers of members on the panel have been rejected.
As former Likud MK Michael Kleiner noted recently in Maariv: “The important question at hand is not whether the committee is state, governmental, or parliamentary – but whether it is a professional committee, built on the foundations of knowledge, restraint, and good judgment.”
Multiple inquiries into the October 7 massacre
State Comptroller Matanyahu Englman began his own inquiry, although it was opposed by Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara and frozen by the High Court in December. The IDF and Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) have also carried out internal investigations, although just how thoroughly an organization probes its own failings is a mute question.
The months preceding October 2023 were marked by the upheaval surrounding the government’s proposed judicial reform and the response, which included paralyzing strikes and demonstrations as well as calls for a refusal to serve, particularly among pilots and elite units. These are among the factors that must be investigated. Israel’s enemies did not disguise their glee as the protests weakened the country.
In addition, the justice establishment will need to answer questions regarding its open-fire regulations, which limited the response before the war, along with rulings regarding the scope and type of “humanitarian” aid to Gaza.
It is tempting to demand that personal blame be assigned and that heads roll, metaphorically and politically. This, however, is not necessarily effective: It tends to draw out the investigatory process and might consciously or subconsciously affect the nature of the testimonies submitted.
The IDF chief of staff, head of Military Intelligence, and other senior military officials from October 7 are no longer serving. Ditto the head of the Shin Bet. The fate of political figures can be determined in elections.
The recommendations of investigating committees can be circumvented. For example, the Kahan Commission investigated the Sabra and Shatila massacre of Palestinians by Christian Phalangists in an area under Israeli control in 1982 during the First Lebanon War. It ruled that Ariel Sharon could not serve as defense minister; that did not prevent him from later becoming prime minister.
There might even be some kind of perverse pendulum effect. The Agranat State Commission of Inquiry examined the massive failings of the 1973 Yom Kippur War and their primary conclusion was that military leaders were reluctant to take the threats seriously; the Winograd Commission that examined the 2006 Second Lebanon War determined that, under prime minister Ehud Olmert, the country had leaped to war while unprepared. In both cases, it was public pressure, rather than the commissions, that ultimately forced prime ministers Golda Meir and Olmert to resign.
For too many years, Israel stuck to what was known as Haconceptzia – The Concept – a narrow security rationale holding that Israel’s enemies lacked the capacity or the desire to wage war. This same misconception somehow survived the Yom Kippur War and can be seen pre-October 7, exactly 50 years later. The leadership was both unprepared and reluctant to take action, despite the obvious signs of mounting threats seen in Hamas maneuvers, violent rallies on the Gaza border, rocket attacks, and eco-terrorism.
Deterrence was the buzzword of the top military and political echelons. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former (briefly) prime ministers Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid all fell into the same trap. Netanyahu let large amounts of Qatari money into Gaza in the hope of maintaining quiet if not peace; Lapid, in October 2022, during his last days in office, pushed through a deal with Lebanon, effectively handing over part of Israel’s waters and potential maritime gas field in the vain attempt to stave of Hezbollah’s hostilities.
Last week, Netanyahu reportedly presented the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee with a long list of documents he had supplied the state comptroller, supporting his claims that he had not been provided with the necessary intel. The opposition, including Lapid, immediately accused the prime minister of “cherry picking” selected statements.
This all brought to mind the quote attributed to Israel’s first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion: “Anyone who believes you can’t change history has never tried to write his memoirs.”
The Questions of “when” and “what” are no less important than the “who.” The Agranat Commission investigating the Yom Kippur War limited its scope to the few days before it broke out and the first days of the fighting. The causes of the “October 7 War” will have to go back further than that: How far depends on whom you ask.
Many believe the roots of the war lie in the 2005 “Disengagement” from Gaza, removing all Israeli presence from the Strip – and no less significantly, losing invaluable human intelligence sources (HUMINT) which the Shin Bet apparently did not replace. Some people will go back further still, blaming the Oslo Accords in the 1990s, which also resulted in the loss of such intel while leading the terrorist organizations to believe that escalating violence could drive the Jews away.
Certainly, the existence of terror tunnels – particularly seen in the 2005 murder of two soldiers and the abduction of Gilad Schalit to Gaza – needs to be investigated in this context. Tunnels are still being discovered. The extent of these tunnels – dug under civilian homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques – shows them to be a strategic threat that was created while Israel placed its head in the sand to try to drown out the sound of the drilling.
The massive release of more than 1,000 terrorists in exchange for Schalit in 2011 also cannot be ignored. It’s not by chance that the October 7 invaders abducted more than 250 hostages to use as bargaining chips.
Why Israel was lulled into complacency; why was strategic intelligence ignored; at what point did the IDF and Shin Bet realize the extent of the threat and when did they warn the prime minister; why it took so long for forces, particularly the Air Force, to respond – all these are haunting questions that need investigation. The public needs answers and closure – and the ability to try to believe that this will not happen again.
Inquiring minds can ask questions and demand answers, but an investigatory committee is only as good as the implementation of its recommendations. We can’t change what happened, but we can still try to prevent history from repeating itself.

Allies pledge 35 Patriot missiles for Ukraine — sounds a lot, but is it?

Ukraine is set to receive 35 missiles for U.S.-produced Patriot air defense systems from its partners soon, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told journalists on Feb. 12 following a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at NATO headquarters.
The announcement comes as Ukraine faces continued large-scale Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, leaving thousands of residents without electricity, heating and water and causing significant damage that could take weeks to repair.
Thirty of the missiles will be provided by member states participating in the Ramstein format, while Germany pledged five additional interceptors, Pistorius said.
Crucially, Pistorios said the missiles would be the PAC-3 variant. Unlike its predecessor, the PAC-2 GEM-T, the PAC-3 uses hit-to-kill technology, destroying incoming warheads through direct contact rather than relying on a fragmentation blast.
Though its range is shorter, typically around 35 to 50 kilometers (20 to 30 miles), it offers greater precision and is specifically tailored for high-speed ballistic threats.
Responding to news of new deliveries, Yurii Ihnat, head of the Air Force communications department, said Ukraine critically needs additional systems to repel Russian attacks.
"Every time Russia attacks us with ballistic or cruise missiles, we use a large number of interceptor missiles," Ihnat said, adding that usually one interceptor shoots down one aerial target, though sometimes a single missile can take out two.
Russian attacks have escalated this winter with dozens of ballistic missiles sometimes launched at Ukraine in a single night — targets that can only be intercepted by Patriot air defenses. During a mass attack on Feb. 3, Russia launched 71 missiles, 32 of them ballistic, marking the largest missile strike of this winter.
Russian forces also launched 24 Iskander-M and S-300 ballistic missiles and 219 drones overnight on Feb. 12. Ukraine used 24 interceptor missiles to repel the attack, according to Ihnat.
"That gives you the answer to how much (35 additional Patriot missiles) will help," he said. "We critically need replenishment every time."
Ukraine's Air Force has previously reported a shortage of systems to repel Russian attacks. Ihnat said some air defense systems had been left without missiles.
At the same time, Russian attacks are so massive that shooting down all aerial targets is a difficult challenge for Ukraine's strained air defenses.
"Even if 80% of the total is shot down, the remaining 20% causes great damage," he added.
Russia has also modified some of its Iskander-M and Kinzhal ballistic missiles to perform unpredictable maneuvers late in flight, making them harder for Patriot systems to intercept, the Financial Times (FT) reported on Oct. 2.
In the wake of Russian mass strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Air Force’s work "unsatisfactory" in some regions and announced personnel changes, particularly in units responsible for shooting down Russian drones, including Shahed-type unmanned aerial vehicles.
The U.S.-made Patriot air defense system is one of the few in the world that defend against ballistic missiles, which Russia regularly launches against Ukraine, and which Israel and Iran traded salvos of last month.
The reduction in missile supplies to Ukraine is tied to a drawdown in U.S. stockpiles. The U.S. used roughly a quarter of its high-end THAAD missile interceptors during Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June, according to CNN.

Alton Towers U-turns on controversial rule change after major backlash
- Merlin Entertainments has cancelled a planned trial to change eligibility for its theme park disability access passes following public outrage.
- The trial would have excluded individuals with autism and ADHD from using the Ride Access Pass (RAP) by altering criteria related to 'difficulty with crowds' at it’s attactions including Alton Towers.
- This proposed change stemmed from an update by Nimbus Disability, which verifies additional needs, separating 'difficulty standing' from 'difficulty with crowds'.
- The decision to cancel came after extensive feedback from the public and a petition signed by over 25,000 people.
- Merlin's Chief Operating Officer apologised for the impact of the announcement, confirming that existing RAP criteria, including the Access Card 'crowd' symbol, will remain in use.

Merz says Russia must be made to see no advantage in war
During a Q&A session after his speech, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia must be brought to a point where it sees "no further advantage" in continuing its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
In response to a question about why, unlike the Americans, Europeans were not talking directly to Russia, Merz replied: "We are in close contact with those who are talking to Russia."
In an apparent reference to Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, Merz cited the example of an EU prime minister who had "achieved nothing" during a visit to Russia. Shortly afterward, Russia launched a particularly harsh attack on Ukraine, the German chancellor said.
Merz stressed the importance of bringing Russia to a point where waging war is no longer advantageous for Moscow.
"We have to bring them to this point to stop it," the German chancellor said. "We must do everything we can militarily, economically, politically, and diplomatically to achieve this," he added.
US top diplomat Marco Rubio meets China's Wang Yi in Munich
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met and talked on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday but shared no information about the talks with the press.
The Friday meeting was held behind closed doors at a hotel conference room with senior aides from both sides also in attendance. The talks lasted at least an hour, according to Rubio's team.
The US and China are locked in a prolonged standoff over trade and security issues. A deal between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in October averted Washington's threat of escalating tariffs on Chinese imports to 130% and a similar Chinese response, but tensions persist over US arms sales to Taiwan.
This week, Trump confirmed he would be visiting Xi Jinping in April.
"He will be coming to the US later in the year, and I look forward to it," Trump said.
Merz warns Europe's 'freedom' is at stake
Friedrich Merz has warned Germany's partners and allies in Europe that the freedom the continent has enjoyed since World War II "is no longer a given."
The chancellor urged European nations to "show firmness and determination to assert this freedom" amid challenges posed to the world order by China, Russia and the United States.
"This will require a willingness to engage in new beginnings, in change, and yes, also to make sacrifices. Not just some day, but right now," Merz said.
He said Europe's "huge" untapped potential needs to be fully realized if the bloc is to address global challenges.
Merz noted that although the EU's GDP is 10 times higher than Russia's, the bloc's global influence does not reflect that wealth.
"Our military, political, economic and technological potential is huge, but we haven't tapped it to the necessary extent for a very long time. So the most important thing is to turn the switch in our minds now," he said.
'We can shape the new world order,' Merz says
Friedrich Merz said European nations have reached "a different conclusion" on how to address the challenges posed by a new world order driven by big power politics.
While Washington and Donald Trump are pursuing an isolationist, "America First" approach, Europe, Merz said, does not have to accept a new global landscape dominated by major powers "as an inevitable fate."
"We are not at the mercy of this world, we can shape it," Merz said, arguing that Europeans can do so if they "step up together with determination and confidence in our own strengths."
"This way, we will weather the storm and preserve our freedom, we will push open new doors and seize new opportunities, if we get it right, we will emerge even stronger from this testing time," the German leader said.
Merz warns world has entered era of 'big power politics'
Friedrich Merz has warned that the world order is increasingly being defined by a return to power politics and rivalry between superpowers.
Merz said the post-World War II order, which had been shaped by US supremacy and Europe enjoying a "vacation from world history" under Washington's security umbrella, has come to an end.
"The United States' claim to leadership has been challenged, and possibly lost," Merz said, warning of the rise of Russia and China.
The chancellor said this shift was not only "rooted in the rivalry between great powers," but also reflected "restless, agitated societies in a time of revolutionary changes." He added that it expressed "a wish for strong leadership in a globalized world in which especially democratic states are coming close to the limit of their ability to act."
At first glance, "big power politics, it seems, gives strong and easy answers," Merz said — at least to the major powers.
Merz warned that big power politics are "fast, hard and often unpredictable," with natural resources, technologies and supply chains reduced to "bargaining tools in a zero-sum game."
"This is a dangerous game," the chancellor warned.
He said the US was already adapting to this changing world order "at a fast pace" and in a "radical" way that only serves to "accelerate" these changes.
Merz says old world order 'no longer exists'
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has started his opening speech to the Munich Security Conference (MSC) by stressing that the world has entered an era that is "once again marked by power and big power politics."
Merz highlighted Russia's "violent revisionism" and its "brutal war against Ukraine," as well as its attacks on the Western political order and infrastructure as evidence.
Merz also pointed out to China's growth in recent years. Beijing "wants to be a leader in shaping the world, and it has paved the way for that with strategic patience," Merz said.
"In the future, Beijing could be on an equal footing with the US in military terms," Merz added.
But the chancellor warned that China "systematcially uses dependencies of others" and is "redefining the international order in its own favor."

Greenlanders 'not happy' about US pressure, Greenland PM tells DW
A lot of Greenland residents are "scared" by the transatlantic crisis triggered by US President Donald Trump's ambition to annex the Danish territory, Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told DW.
"There live people in Greenland, and they're, of course, not happy with the situation," he said.
Talking to DW chief political correspondent Nina Haase at the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Nielsen emphasized that the dispute "still affects the Greenlandic people a lot, going through all the feelings you can imagine — if the biggest power in the world is talking about annexation and acquiring your country."
The prime minister also said he was due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the security conference.
"We have said from the beginning, if you want to do more on defense, on surveillance, on anything, we can talk about it. We already have a defense agreement," Nielsen said. "But we are ready to talk about anything when it's in mutual respect and in respect for international law and integrity."

Ukraine peace talks move to Geneva next week — Kremlin
While Western and Ukrainian leaders are attending the Munich Security Conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States on ending the war in Ukraine will move to Geneva next week.
According to Russian news agencies, Peskov said that the talks would take place on Tuesday and Wednesday and that Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky would lead the Russian delegation.
The talks in Geneva will follow two rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi. During those negotiations, Russia's team was led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of its military intelligence.
Medinsky's return, after leading the Russian team at earlier talks in Turkey in 2022 and again last year, could signal Russia's expectation that the focus will shift from security issues to the broader points of disagreement between the warring sides.
Meanwhile, Rustem Umerov, the head of Kyiv's delegation, said Ukraine hopes for "serious and responsible" talks with Russia backed by the US in Geneva on February 17-18.
The Ukrainian team remains the same and was "formed taking into account the military, political, and security components of
the process", Umerov wrote on the Telegram app.
NATO chief Rutte lauds 'staggering change' in Europe's defense approach
European members of the NATO military alliance have undergone a profound "shift in mindset" on defense and military spending, the NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Friday.
Rutte was speaking on the opening day of the Munich Security Conference, a day after he met with NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
"I felt a shift in mindset in the room," he said. "We had years, decades, of complaints by the US about the fact that in Europe we were not spending enough on defense. That has changed," the former Dutch prime minister said.
While calls for European NATO members to spend more have sharpened since Donald Trump returned to the White House, they have been a refrain of US administrations, both Republican and Democratic, for decades.
"Europe [is] taking more of a leadership role within NATO. Europe [is] also taking more care of its own defence. And this is really a staggering change," Rutte said.
He made the remarks during an appearance at the Transatlantic Forum, an event hosted by the conservative Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is helmed by Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul — both members of the CDU — also attended the event.
Wadephul told the forum that NATO's European members have the chance to step up and fill the void being created by Washington's increasingly isolationist approach to foreign policy.
"Now is Europe's moment," Wadephul said.
"We will only be able to weather the profound global upheavals we face if we preserve our alliances, if we stand by what has always made us strong and capable of defending ourselves," the German foreign minister said.
Old world order is gone and US-Europe ties face 'defining moment,' Rubio says
Ties between the US and Europe are facing a "defining moment," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned.
Rubio is the most senior US representative attending the Munich Security Conference, which began Friday.
"I think it's at a defining moment ... the world is changing very fast right in front of us," Rubio said Thursday, before leaving for Munich.
"The Old World is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
New era driven by Trump's 'wrecking-ball politics'
Many in Europe have argued that the US under Donald Trump has been the main driver of that changing world order. The head of the MSC, Wolfgang Ischinger, described Trump's approach as "wrecking-ball politics" that prioritises "sweeping destruction — rather than careful reforms and policy corrections."
At the MSC last year, US Vice President JD Vance strongly condemned Washington's European allies, signalling a major shift in the transatlantic relationship that has underpinned global security since World War II.
As part of the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, over the past year, the US has:
- withdrawn from international treaties and climate commitments
- slashed its contributions to global aid programs
- used punitive tariffs to disrupt global trade
- cast doubt over its long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia
Trump has also been pressing for Greenland — a semiautonomous, resource-rich Arctic territory that is part of Denmark — to become part of the US.
While he has since softened his stance following a "framework" agreement between the US and NATO over Greenland, the issue created a serious rift with US allies in Europe.
Washington's approach to diplomacy has forced its traditional European allies to pursue new, more independent policies that are less reliant on the US and its unpredictable leadership.
While acknowledging these changes, Rubio tried to strike a warmer tone than Trump or Vance have. The US top diplomat said his country remains "deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be. So we've just got to talk about what that future looks like."
European leaders are set to meet with Rubio during the conference, which runs until Sunday. Rubio will address the summit on Saturday morning.
The prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, said "several meetings with American politicians, including the secretary of state" will be held, with Greenland also set to be discussed.
At the start of the Munich conference on Friday, Frederiksen reiterated her warning to Denmark's European allies.
"The Americans have been very honest — from Trump's inauguration speech to a new security strategy and a new defence strategy, the threats against Greenland — everything points in one direction, namely that the US, unfortunately, is moving away" from Europe, she said.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is also set to have a private meeting with Rubio, where he's expected to sound out the secretary of state on what kind of policies Europe can expect from the United States.
German and Ukrainian foreign ministers open Ukraine House at MSC
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrij Sybiha, opened the Ukraine House at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday morning.
DW correspondent Michaela Kuefner reported ministers also held a bilateral meeting, adding that both countries have the joint challenge of keeping US President Donald Trump committed to NATO and convincing the US to bring Europe back into the Ukraine talks.
Wadephul said after the meeting that Ukraine is fighting for freedom in Europe and that Russian leader Vladimir Putin shows no willingness to end this war.
"We're working on a strong 20th sanctions package and will keep up the pressure on Russia. You can count on us," he wrote on X.
Meanwhile, Sybiha thanked Germany for its leadership in supporting Ukraine and strengthening the security of Europe.
"This year, German defense support for Ukraine is at record €11.5 billion ($13.6), while its winter energy assistance packages totalled €75 million," he wrote on X.
The Ukrainian minister also mentioned that he and his German counterpart discussed ways to advance Ukraine’s EU accession as part of security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe.
Later, Sybiha said that, after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, he had invited his Chinese counterpart to visit Ukraine and added that Beijing could help end the four-year war with Russia.
Europe is wide awake and evaluating its options
There is a sense of post-Greenland-shock at the Munich Security Conference.
Earlier comments and analyses about a "wake-up call" for Europe are no longer being used in the corridors. Europe is wide awake and clearly signaling that it is now looking in all directions — not just to the United States.
This is also expected to be a key theme of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's speech before he meets US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later today.
EU trade agreements with both the Mercosur group and India are living proof of Europe's newfound self-confidence. But the European security and strategic dependence on the US remains. And so does the commitment of US Congress, which has sent one of the largest delegations in history to the annual conference in Munich.
Germany's foreign minister admits NATO 'irritation' at Trump administration
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said the Munich Security Conference (MSC), which officially opens on Friday afternoon, represents a chance to reset transatlantic ties.
Relations between the United States and its NATO allies have been strained since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year.
Trump's insistence that the US "has to have" Greenland, a semiautonomous territory that is part of Denmark and will acquire it "one way or the other," has caused a serious diplomatic rift between Washington and most of its allies in Europe. Denmark and the US are both members of the NATO military alliance.
Trump and some of the top members of his administration have also been heavily critical of NATO's European members for what Washington says is their failure to spend enough on defense and for their perceived overreliance on the US military.
At the MSC last year, Trump's vice president, JD Vance, alarmed many in Europe when he used his keynote speech to highlight attempts by some countries in Europe to limit the rise of right-wing and far-right populism as proof of the weak state of European democracies and free speech. Vance also warned of the perceived perils of mass migration.
Wadephul acknowledged those tensions in remarks to German public broadcaster ARD on Friday morning in Munich, saying the "alliance is also under pressure."
"There is alienation, there is irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to talk about this here together. We want to define our common denominators and the meaning of NATO," Wadephul said.

MAGA v MAGA: Georgia election exposes divisions in Trump’s base
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
DALTON, Georgia – President Donald Trump may have expected his endorsement of a local prosecutor in the race to replace US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to clear the Republican field.
Instead, more than a dozen Republicans are still competing, turning this deeply conservative corner of Georgia into an election-year test of Mr Trump’s hold on his Make America Great Again movement.
Mr Clay Fuller, the former district attorney for four counties in north-west Georgia, became the presumptive front runner after Mr Trump threw his support behind him on Feb 4, describing him as a torchbearer of MAGA.
Mr Trump’s endorsement, however, has not deterred 14 other Republican candidates from pressing ahead in the March 10 special election, with early voting to start on Feb 16. Three Democratic candidates and one independent are also competing.
Several of the Republican candidates are casting themselves as the true champions of Mr Trump’s right-wing populism, vying to fill the vacuum left by Ms Greene, who resigned her congressional seat in January
Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, a mostly blue-collar corridor from Atlanta’s exurbs up to the Tennessee border, has established itself as a MAGA stronghold since Ms Greene swept to victory in 2020 and quickly became one of the movement’s most outspoken national figures.
Now, with Ms Greene stepping aside, the district’s voters are grappling with what comes next for the party and who should lead it.
Interviews with 22 voters suggest the race remains fluid. Most Republicans said they had not settled on a candidate and that Mr Trump’s endorsement alone will not decide their vote.
“I’m a Trump supporter, and I respect his opinion, but he doesn’t live in this district,” said Mr John Burdette, a voter who attended a candidate forum this week in the city of Kennesaw. “I think we have a better perspective on who is best to represent us.”
The fight to claim the mantle of MAGA standard-bearer in Ms Greene’s district highlights how the movement nationally is evolving. While fealty to Mr Trump is still the distinct denominator, there is increasingly less agreement on what it means to be “MAGA”, a label that now covers a far more diverse coalition.
These emerging divisions pose a risk for Republicans’ control of Congress in November’s midterm elections, creating potential openings for Democrats to take advantage of any infighting in competitive districts.
With Republicans splitting votes, political observers say the leading Democratic candidate, Mr Shawn Harris, could gain enough support to make a run-off, set for April 7 if no candidate secures a majority.
After losing to Ms Greene by 64.4 per cent to 35.6 per cent in 2024, his performance will be watched to see if Democrats can sustain their recent streak of outperforming in special elections, though outright victory is seen as highly unlikely.
A US Air Force veteran, Mr Fuller said he aims to focus on bringing economic development to the district’s poorer rural communities stretching across the foothills of Appalachia. He also vowed to move past Ms Greene’s combative style, marked by conspiracy-mongering and online attacks on Mr Trump’s perceived enemies that drew scrutiny to the district.
“I’ve got the gear for fire and brimstone when the situation calls for it,” he told Reuters after a campaign event. “But I’m my own man. I don’t think the voters want that style again.”
‘God, guns, Trump’
Still, Mr Fuller does sometimes use inflammatory rhetoric in support of Mr Trump’s agenda.
On Jan 24 – the same day federal immigration officers shot and killed nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis – he pledged in a post on X that, if elected, he would nominate all Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents for the Presidential Medal of Freedom and push to triple the agency’s budget.
But no candidate in the race has been as fiery or aggressive in backing the president over the years as Mr Colton Moore, a hard-right former state senator who calls himself “Trump’s #1 Defender” and is running under the slogan “GOD. GUNS. TRUMP.”
A longtime champion of Mr Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, Mr Moore has repeatedly clashed with Georgia’s Republican leadership.
To Mr Charles Stoker, an 81-year-old Republican voter, that confrontational approach is precisely what resonates with grassroots conservatives eager to challenge the establishment. He noted that a string of Georgia Republicans lost their races in the 2022 midterms despite being endorsed by Mr Trump.
“President Trump has been getting bad advice,” he said, voicing disappointment with the Fuller endorsement. “Directions need to come from the people upward.”
Though he missed out on Mr Trump’s endorsement, Mr Moore has secured backing from former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and the Georgia Republican Assembly (GRA), a group that represents the party’s far-right wing.
“President Trump’s going to be gone in a few years,” GRA President Nathaniel Darnell told Reuters, arguing that Mr Moore, not Mr Fuller, could be trusted to work in the district’s best interests.
The main differences between candidates are on style rather than substance. Some candidates have embraced the combative approach that defines Trumpism, while some have called for more civility and consensus-building in politics.
Ms Meg Strickland, who voted for Mr Trump, is one of the few self-described moderates in the race. She says the party should chart a new course that would see it return to its small-government roots and move away from caustic, personality-driven politics.
“I don’t think that Trump is a true conservative and I hope that we can get back there,” said the 39-year-old travel consultant and mother of three.
Long odds for Harris, but could send Republicans a message
Ms Strickland, running on a “return to normal” message, acknowledges the steep odds she faces in a district Mr Trump carried with 68 per cent of the vote in 2024.
But she believes Republicans are misreading the moment, pointing to the voter backlash to aggressive tactics by federal immigration agents and the cost-of-living squeeze she says dominates her campaign stops.
Mr Harris, a 59-year-old cattle farmer and retired brigadier general, has made courting disaffected Republican voters a central focus of his Democratic candidacy, aiming to win them over with a message centered on lowering costs for everyday workers and expanding access to affordable healthcare.
Mr Harris, who has US$1.2 million (S$1.52 million) on hand to campaign, said he sees overlap between his positions and Ms Greene’s since her break with Mr Trump
“Marjorie Taylor Greene is a Republican that has moved back into what the old Republicans were,” Mr Harris said. “Her talking points are the same talking points that I had when I ran against her the last time.”
A Quantus Insights poll of 729 registered Republicans conducted in the last week of January, before Mr Trump’s endorsement, pointed to a wide-open race, with Mr Moore and Mr Fuller at the top with 13.4 per cent and 12.6 per cent support, and more than a third of respondents undecided.
Professor Nathan Price, a political science professor at the University of North Georgia, said the race’s fluidity reflects a Republican Party and a MAGA movement in transition.
“I think you’re starting to see perhaps the party looking beyond him a little bit as he gets into the sixth year and maybe starting to think about the future of the party,” he said. REUTERS

UK terrorism ban on Palestine Action group unlawful, court rules after appeal

UK terrorism ban on Palestine Action group unlawful, court rules after appeal
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON, Feb 13 - Britain's ban on pro-Palestinian campaign group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation was ruled unlawful by London's High Court on Friday, though the ban will temporarily remain in place and the government said it would appeal against the decision.
Palestine Action was proscribed in July, having increasingly taken "direct action" against Israel-linked defence companies in Britain, often blocking entrances or spraying red paint.
Britain argued the group's escalating actions amounted to terrorism, citing a 2024 raid on a factory of Israel's largest defence firm Elbit Systems, in which prosecutors said activists caused around 1 million pounds ($1.4 million) of damage and a police officer was hit with a sledgehammer.
BAN FOLLOWED BREAK-IN AT AIR BASE
Palestine Action was banned shortly after a June break-in at the Royal Air Force's Brize Norton air base, in which activists damaged two planes, an action described by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as "disgraceful".
Lawyers representing Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020, argued at a hearing last year that the move was an authoritarian restriction on the right to protest.
Judge Victoria Sharp said Palestine Action "promotes its political cause through criminality and the encouragement of criminality".
The High Court nonetheless ruled the ban was a disproportionate interference with the right to freedom of expression, though the ban was not lifted ahead of a further hearing to decide whether it should remain pending an appeal.
Interior minister Shabana Mahmood said in a statement: "I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal."
GOVERNMENT DEFEAT FOLLOWS 'NOT GUILTY' VERDICTS
The ban put Palestine Action on a par with Islamic State or al Qaeda and made it a criminal offence to be a member, carrying a maximum 14-year prison sentence.
More than 2,000 people have since been arrested for holding signs in support of the group – though Friday's ruling could lead to any criminal charges being dropped.
London's Metropolitan Police said following the judgment that it would focus on gathering evidence where people expressed support for Palestine Action rather than making arrests.
Civil liberties groups including Amnesty International had called for the ban to be lifted and Irish novelist Sally Rooney said it could even lead to her books being withdrawn from sale due to her public support for Palestine Action.
The British government argued proscription only prevented support for Palestine Action and had not prevented people from protesting in favour of the Palestinian cause.
The High Court, however, said it could cause pro-Palestinian protesters to "exercise self-restraint in terms of what they say and what they do".
The judgment was announced two weeks after six people charged over the 2024 raid on Elbit were all acquitted of aggravated burglary.
Prosecutors have said they will seek a retrial on those counts on which the jury could not reach a verdict, including the alleged assault on a police officer. REUTERS

Merz says Russia must be made to see no advantage in war
During a Q&A session after his speech, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia must be brought to a point where it sees "no further advantage" in continuing its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
In response to a question about why, unlike the Americans, Europeans were not talking directly to Russia, Merz replied: "We are in close contact with those who are talking to Russia."
In an apparent reference to Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, Merz cited the example of an EU prime minister who had "achieved nothing" during a visit to Russia. Shortly afterward, Russia launched a particularly harsh attack on Ukraine, the German chancellor said.
Merz stressed the importance of bringing Russia to a point where waging war is no longer advantageous for Moscow.
"We have to bring them to this point to stop it," the German chancellor said. "We must do everything we can militarily, economically, politically, and diplomatically to achieve this," he added.
US top diplomat Marco Rubio meets China's Wang Yi in Munich
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met and talked on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday but shared no information about the talks with the press.
The Friday meeting was held behind closed doors at a hotel conference room with senior aides from both sides also in attendance. The talks lasted at least an hour, according to Rubio's team.
The US and China are locked in a prolonged standoff over trade and security issues. A deal between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in October averted Washington's threat of escalating tariffs on Chinese imports to 130% and a similar Chinese response, but tensions persist over US arms sales to Taiwan.
This week, Trump confirmed he would be visiting Xi Jinping in April.
"He will be coming to the US later in the year, and I look forward to it," Trump said.
Merz warns Europe's 'freedom' is at stake
Friedrich Merz has warned Germany's partners and allies in Europe that the freedom the continent has enjoyed since World War II "is no longer a given."
The chancellor urged European nations to "show firmness and determination to assert this freedom" amid challenges posed to the world order by China, Russia and the United States.
"This will require a willingness to engage in new beginnings, in change, and yes, also to make sacrifices. Not just some day, but right now," Merz said.
He said Europe's "huge" untapped potential needs to be fully realized if the bloc is to address global challenges.
Merz noted that although the EU's GDP is 10 times higher than Russia's, the bloc's global influence does not reflect that wealth.
"Our military, political, economic and technological potential is huge, but we haven't tapped it to the necessary extent for a very long time. So the most important thing is to turn the switch in our minds now," he said.
'We can shape the new world order,' Merz says
Friedrich Merz said European nations have reached "a different conclusion" on how to address the challenges posed by a new world order driven by big power politics.
While Washington and Donald Trump are pursuing an isolationist, "America First" approach, Europe, Merz said, does not have to accept a new global landscape dominated by major powers "as an inevitable fate."
"We are not at the mercy of this world, we can shape it," Merz said, arguing that Europeans can do so if they "step up together with determination and confidence in our own strengths."
"This way, we will weather the storm and preserve our freedom, we will push open new doors and seize new opportunities, if we get it right, we will emerge even stronger from this testing time," the German leader said.
Merz warns world has entered era of 'big power politics'
Friedrich Merz has warned that the world order is increasingly being defined by a return to power politics and rivalry between superpowers.
Merz said the post-World War II order, which had been shaped by US supremacy and Europe enjoying a "vacation from world history" under Washington's security umbrella, has come to an end.
"The United States' claim to leadership has been challenged, and possibly lost," Merz said, warning of the rise of Russia and China.
The chancellor said this shift was not only "rooted in the rivalry between great powers," but also reflected "restless, agitated societies in a time of revolutionary changes." He added that it expressed "a wish for strong leadership in a globalized world in which especially democratic states are coming close to the limit of their ability to act."
At first glance, "big power politics, it seems, gives strong and easy answers," Merz said — at least to the major powers.
Merz warned that big power politics are "fast, hard and often unpredictable," with natural resources, technologies and supply chains reduced to "bargaining tools in a zero-sum game."
"This is a dangerous game," the chancellor warned.
He said the US was already adapting to this changing world order "at a fast pace" and in a "radical" way that only serves to "accelerate" these changes.
Merz says old world order 'no longer exists'
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has started his opening speech to the Munich Security Conference (MSC) by stressing that the world has entered an era that is "once again marked by power and big power politics."
Merz highlighted Russia's "violent revisionism" and its "brutal war against Ukraine," as well as its attacks on the Western political order and infrastructure as evidence.
Merz also pointed out to China's growth in recent years. Beijing "wants to be a leader in shaping the world, and it has paved the way for that with strategic patience," Merz said.
"In the future, Beijing could be on an equal footing with the US in military terms," Merz added.
But the chancellor warned that China "systematcially uses dependencies of others" and is "redefining the international order in its own favor."

Greenlanders 'not happy' about US pressure, Greenland PM tells DW
A lot of Greenland residents are "scared" by the transatlantic crisis triggered by US President Donald Trump's ambition to annex the Danish territory, Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told DW.
"There live people in Greenland, and they're, of course, not happy with the situation," he said.
Talking to DW chief political correspondent Nina Haase at the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Nielsen emphasized that the dispute "still affects the Greenlandic people a lot, going through all the feelings you can imagine — if the biggest power in the world is talking about annexation and acquiring your country."
The prime minister also said he was due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the security conference.
"We have said from the beginning, if you want to do more on defense, on surveillance, on anything, we can talk about it. We already have a defense agreement," Nielsen said. "But we are ready to talk about anything when it's in mutual respect and in respect for international law and integrity."

Ukraine peace talks move to Geneva next week — Kremlin
While Western and Ukrainian leaders are attending the Munich Security Conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States on ending the war in Ukraine will move to Geneva next week.
According to Russian news agencies, Peskov said that the talks would take place on Tuesday and Wednesday and that Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky would lead the Russian delegation.
The talks in Geneva will follow two rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi. During those negotiations, Russia's team was led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of its military intelligence.
Medinsky's return, after leading the Russian team at earlier talks in Turkey in 2022 and again last year, could signal Russia's expectation that the focus will shift from security issues to the broader points of disagreement between the warring sides.
Meanwhile, Rustem Umerov, the head of Kyiv's delegation, said Ukraine hopes for "serious and responsible" talks with Russia backed by the US in Geneva on February 17-18.
The Ukrainian team remains the same and was "formed taking into account the military, political, and security components of
the process", Umerov wrote on the Telegram app.
NATO chief Rutte lauds 'staggering change' in Europe's defense approach
European members of the NATO military alliance have undergone a profound "shift in mindset" on defense and military spending, the NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Friday.
Rutte was speaking on the opening day of the Munich Security Conference, a day after he met with NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
"I felt a shift in mindset in the room," he said. "We had years, decades, of complaints by the US about the fact that in Europe we were not spending enough on defense. That has changed," the former Dutch prime minister said.
While calls for European NATO members to spend more have sharpened since Donald Trump returned to the White House, they have been a refrain of US administrations, both Republican and Democratic, for decades.
"Europe [is] taking more of a leadership role within NATO. Europe [is] also taking more care of its own defence. And this is really a staggering change," Rutte said.
He made the remarks during an appearance at the Transatlantic Forum, an event hosted by the conservative Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is helmed by Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul — both members of the CDU — also attended the event.
Wadephul told the forum that NATO's European members have the chance to step up and fill the void being created by Washington's increasingly isolationist approach to foreign policy.
"Now is Europe's moment," Wadephul said.
"We will only be able to weather the profound global upheavals we face if we preserve our alliances, if we stand by what has always made us strong and capable of defending ourselves," the German foreign minister said.
Old world order is gone and US-Europe ties face 'defining moment,' Rubio says
Ties between the US and Europe are facing a "defining moment," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned.
Rubio is the most senior US representative attending the Munich Security Conference, which began Friday.
"I think it's at a defining moment ... the world is changing very fast right in front of us," Rubio said Thursday, before leaving for Munich.
"The Old World is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
New era driven by Trump's 'wrecking-ball politics'
Many in Europe have argued that the US under Donald Trump has been the main driver of that changing world order. The head of the MSC, Wolfgang Ischinger, described Trump's approach as "wrecking-ball politics" that prioritises "sweeping destruction — rather than careful reforms and policy corrections."
At the MSC last year, US Vice President JD Vance strongly condemned Washington's European allies, signalling a major shift in the transatlantic relationship that has underpinned global security since World War II.
As part of the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, over the past year, the US has:
- withdrawn from international treaties and climate commitments
- slashed its contributions to global aid programs
- used punitive tariffs to disrupt global trade
- cast doubt over its long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia
Trump has also been pressing for Greenland — a semiautonomous, resource-rich Arctic territory that is part of Denmark — to become part of the US.
While he has since softened his stance following a "framework" agreement between the US and NATO over Greenland, the issue created a serious rift with US allies in Europe.
Washington's approach to diplomacy has forced its traditional European allies to pursue new, more independent policies that are less reliant on the US and its unpredictable leadership.
While acknowledging these changes, Rubio tried to strike a warmer tone than Trump or Vance have. The US top diplomat said his country remains "deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be. So we've just got to talk about what that future looks like."
European leaders are set to meet with Rubio during the conference, which runs until Sunday. Rubio will address the summit on Saturday morning.
The prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, said "several meetings with American politicians, including the secretary of state" will be held, with Greenland also set to be discussed.
At the start of the Munich conference on Friday, Frederiksen reiterated her warning to Denmark's European allies.
"The Americans have been very honest — from Trump's inauguration speech to a new security strategy and a new defence strategy, the threats against Greenland — everything points in one direction, namely that the US, unfortunately, is moving away" from Europe, she said.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is also set to have a private meeting with Rubio, where he's expected to sound out the secretary of state on what kind of policies Europe can expect from the United States.
German and Ukrainian foreign ministers open Ukraine House at MSC
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrij Sybiha, opened the Ukraine House at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday morning.
DW correspondent Michaela Kuefner reported ministers also held a bilateral meeting, adding that both countries have the joint challenge of keeping US President Donald Trump committed to NATO and convincing the US to bring Europe back into the Ukraine talks.
Wadephul said after the meeting that Ukraine is fighting for freedom in Europe and that Russian leader Vladimir Putin shows no willingness to end this war.
"We're working on a strong 20th sanctions package and will keep up the pressure on Russia. You can count on us," he wrote on X.
Meanwhile, Sybiha thanked Germany for its leadership in supporting Ukraine and strengthening the security of Europe.
"This year, German defense support for Ukraine is at record €11.5 billion ($13.6), while its winter energy assistance packages totalled €75 million," he wrote on X.
The Ukrainian minister also mentioned that he and his German counterpart discussed ways to advance Ukraine’s EU accession as part of security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe.
Later, Sybiha said that, after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, he had invited his Chinese counterpart to visit Ukraine and added that Beijing could help end the four-year war with Russia.
Europe is wide awake and evaluating its options
There is a sense of post-Greenland-shock at the Munich Security Conference.
Earlier comments and analyses about a "wake-up call" for Europe are no longer being used in the corridors. Europe is wide awake and clearly signaling that it is now looking in all directions — not just to the United States.
This is also expected to be a key theme of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's speech before he meets US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later today.
EU trade agreements with both the Mercosur group and India are living proof of Europe's newfound self-confidence. But the European security and strategic dependence on the US remains. And so does the commitment of US Congress, which has sent one of the largest delegations in history to the annual conference in Munich.
Germany's foreign minister admits NATO 'irritation' at Trump administration
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said the Munich Security Conference (MSC), which officially opens on Friday afternoon, represents a chance to reset transatlantic ties.
Relations between the United States and its NATO allies have been strained since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year.
Trump's insistence that the US "has to have" Greenland, a semiautonomous territory that is part of Denmark and will acquire it "one way or the other," has caused a serious diplomatic rift between Washington and most of its allies in Europe. Denmark and the US are both members of the NATO military alliance.
Trump and some of the top members of his administration have also been heavily critical of NATO's European members for what Washington says is their failure to spend enough on defense and for their perceived overreliance on the US military.
At the MSC last year, Trump's vice president, JD Vance, alarmed many in Europe when he used his keynote speech to highlight attempts by some countries in Europe to limit the rise of right-wing and far-right populism as proof of the weak state of European democracies and free speech. Vance also warned of the perceived perils of mass migration.
Wadephul acknowledged those tensions in remarks to German public broadcaster ARD on Friday morning in Munich, saying the "alliance is also under pressure."
"There is alienation, there is irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to talk about this here together. We want to define our common denominators and the meaning of NATO," Wadephul said.

Trump admits staffer blamed for racist Obama video hasn’t been fired or disciplined
Donald Trump has tried to distance himself further from the offensive clip posted on his Truth Social account
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The staffer blamed by Donald Trump for posting a racist video about former President Obama has not been disciplined or fired, the president has admitted.
Trump has repeatedly tried to downplay criticism of the video, which was uploaded to his Truth Social account last Thursday and depicted Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.
Amid widespread backlash, the president previously shifted the blame to an as-yet unnamed staffer.
“Have you fired or disciplined that staffer who posted the video from your account that included the Obamas?” a reporter asked the president at a White House event Thursday.
“No, I haven't,” Trump replied. “That was a video on, as you know, voter fraud and...fairly long video...and they had a little piece and had to do with The Lion King.”
Previously, Trump insisted he did not see the whole video before giving it to the people who run his Truth Social account. He also insisted the clip was already “all over the place.”
But, when asked whether he personally would condemn the racist clip, Trump was blunt: “Of course I do.”
At no point has he apologized for the video, although the White House has conceded that it was posted “erroneously.”
Trump’s remarks were in stark contrast to the stance held by the rest of his administration. His vice president JD Vance defended the clip as recently as Wednesday.
“It’s not a real controversy,” Vance told reporters, before boarding Air Force Two. “We have much, much more real problems to focus on.”
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended the clip in a fiery response.
“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” she told journalists.
The video depicted other prominent Democrats as animals, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The clip was accompanied by the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight.
Even members of Trump’s own party have condemned the video, with many slamming the president for allowing the clip to be posted and for failing to apologize.
“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,” Republican Senator Tim Scott wrote on social media. “The President should remove it.”
Days later, Scott endorsed Republican Senator Susan Collins for reelection in Maine, despite Collins being one of Trump’s nemeses in Congress.
Like Scott, she has slammed Trump for allowing the video to be posted to his Truth Social account.
Nebraska Senator Pete Ricketts, Utah Senator John Curtis, Representative Mike Lawler and Nebraska Representative Don Bacon were also amongst those calling for Trump to say sorry.

Heathrow isn’t crowded, it’s travellers walking on the wrong side, boss reveals

Heathrow airport has revealed a crowding problem that a third runway cannot solve: British and foreign travellers walk on different sides, and keep colliding, according to its chief executive.
Thomas Woldbye said that while Heathrow serviced more passengers in a smaller overall area than comparable European hubs, part of the London airport’s trouble was the differing continental sense of direction.
Speaking at an industry event, the Danish boss said one reason people thought Terminal 5, the main terminal used by British Airways, was crowded was that people were “in the wrong place”.
In comments to the Aviation Club UK, he said: “The problem is that all the British people keep to the left and normally Europeans keep to the right. And they do that in both directions.
“So we can be crashing into each other, and I see that from personal experience.”
Woldbye said that while “I have jokes with our people”, it was an issue that could be changed. “We just need to make sure that everybody going this way keeps to the left and this way to the right. I know that’s simplified but that is the sort of thinking that we need,” he said.
Heathrow will build more satellite terminals should it succeed with plans for a third runway, which could add about 40 million extra passengers of varying directional preferences to the mix. The 240,000 extra flights a year will be guided by air traffic control.
Woldbye said even with expansion, backed by the government, rival international hubs would grow faster than Heathrow. “London will lose market share every single year for the next 10 years. I think that should be a serious concern,” he said.
Meanwhile, the airport is attempting to address concerns that a third runway is incompatible with the UK’s 2050 net zero goals by accelerating the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
It has established an £80m pot – paid from landing charges – to subsidise airlines that choose to use more SAF on top of the minimum required under national mandates.
The mix of aviation fuel in the UK must average at least 3.6% SAF over the course of 2026, but Heathrow expects to hit a self-imposed target of 5.6%, helping airlines to cover some of the additional cost of the more expensive cleaner fuel.
Planes running on SAF – so far largely produced from recycled cooking oil – emit equal amounts of CO2 in flight as those using fossil fuels, but the net carbon footprint is calculated as lower because of the “life cycle”, ie how it is produced compared with normal jet fuel. SAF is regarded as a potential solution to significantly decarbonise long-haul aviation, although many remain sceptical.
Matt Gorman, Heathrow’s director of sustainability, said: “We have looked to use our scale and influence to attract SAF and we’ve shown you can get SAF flowing. The next challenge is stimulating domestic production – from a carbon, but also a energy security and growth perspective.”
Duncan McCourt, the chief executive of industry group Sustainable Aviation, said government pledges to start building five UK fuel plants by 2025 had been “optimistic”, with none yet under construction, but added they were making progress. “There is a real economic growth opportunity, for tens of thousands of jobs in the UK by 2050,” McCourt said.
Provisional figures published this week showed that the 2025 supply met the UK’s first annual fuel mandate of 2% SAF, with high uptake in the final months of the year after fears that the industry would miss the target.

Nearly 11,000 North Korean troops stationed in Russia's Kursk Oblast at start of 2026,  media reports

Nearly 11,000 North Korean troops stationed in Russia's Kursk Oblast at start of 2026, media reports
About 11,000 North Korean troops are stationed in Russia's Kursk Oblast as of early 2026 to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, Yonhap reported on Feb. 12, citing South Korea's intelligence.
Since the start of the full-scale invasion, Pyongyang has strengthened its relationship with Moscow, supplying weapons and deploying North Korean troops to support Russia's war in Ukraine in 2024.
About 10,000 North Korean combat troops and 1,000 engineer troops are currently stationed in the front-line Russian region, according to the National Intelligence Service (NIS).
About 1,100 soldiers who returned to North Korea from the front in December 2025 may be sent back to Russia to take part in the war, the report said.
The NIS said North Korea's losses in Kursk Oblast totaled about 6,000 troops, killed or injured. Earlier in June, the U.K. Defense Intelligence also said Pyongyang had suffered more than 6,000 casualties during offensive operations on Russian soil.
"Despite suffering 6,000 casualties, the North Korean military has achieved the results of acquiring modern combat tactics and data on the battlefield, as well as upgrading its weapons systems with technical assistance from Russia," the NIS said.
Russia's Kursk Oblast borders Ukraine's Sumy Oblast to the west and southwest. Ukraine launched the unprecedented incursion in this region in August 2024, advancing into Russian territory and seizing 1,300 square kilometers (500 square miles) within the first months.
The operation, planned by Commander-in-Chief Oleksandr Syrskyi, sought to divert Russian troops from eastern Ukraine and disrupt Moscow's plans to invade Sumy Oblast.
Russia, reinforced by around 12,000 North Korean troops, launched a counter-offensive this spring that later forced Ukraine out of most of the captured Russian territory.
North Korea has emerged as one of Russia's closest military partners during the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, supplying artillery shells, ballistic missiles, and combat personnel.
Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR) previously reported that North Korean troops had carried out attacks in Ukraine's border areas, marking what Kyiv described as direct participation in combat operations.

Rights groups welcome UK High Court ruling that Palestine Action terror ban was unlawful
Campaigners describe judgment as 'vital affirmation of the right to protest'
LONDON
Rights groups and campaigners have welcomed a High Court ruling that found the government’s decision to ban Palestine Action under terrorism legislation was unlawful.
Judges in London said the proscription was “disproportionate” and that “the nature and scale of its activities falling within the definition of terrorism had not yet reached the level, scale and persistence to warrant proscription,” according to a summary published on the court’s website.
However, the group will remain banned for now to allow for further legal arguments.
The case was brought by Huda Ammori, co-founder of Palestine Action. “The High Court ruled the Palestine Action ban is unlawful as it is disproportionate to free speech and the Home Secretary breached her own policy,” Ammori said on US social media company X.
“The court ordered the ban be quashed. Details of lifting the ban will be decided and completed at a later date.”
The group Defend Our Juries, which organized protests against the ban, says 2,787 people have been arrested across the UK since the law came into force on July 5 last year.
'Vital affirmation of the right to protest'
The ruling prompted strong reactions from human rights organizations and protest groups.
Tom Southerden, Amnesty International UK’s law and human rights director, described the judgment as a “vital affirmation of the right to protest.”
In a statement, he said: “The high court’s decision sends a clear message: the government cannot simply reach for sweeping counter-terrorism powers to silence critics or suppress dissent … it draws an important line in the sand against attempts to narrow the democratic space and undermine public confidence in the right to speak out."
Calls for resignation
Greenpeace UK’s co-executive director Areeba Hamid said the government’s decision to ban a protest group “is the stuff of dystopian novels.”
“Arresting thousands of protesters – many of them pensioners who were simply holding signs – is the stuff of satire. Hopefully this ruling will deliver a much-needed reality check,” she said.
Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, called for a “thorough and independent investigation” into the government’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action.
She said the court’s ruling “reinforces what many of us have been saying all along—that the government’s misuse of terrorism legislation was a brazen and gross abuse of power that served to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel and those profiting from its atrocities.”
Stop the War Coalition called on Metropolitan Police Commissioner Mark Rowley and former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to resign following the ruling.
Lindsey German, convener of Stop the War, said: “Now the CPS must drop all the charges against those wrongly arrested and imprisoned without trial for peacefully protesting a genocide.”
The change in the law placed Palestine Action in the same legal category as organizations such as ISIS (Daesh) and al-Qaeda, meaning that belonging to or supporting the group became a criminal offense carrying a potential sentence of up to 14 years in prison.
Displaying the group’s name on a T-shirt or placard could also result in a maximum six-month jail term.
During a three-day hearing at the High Court, lawyers representing Ammori said the ban was without precedent and likened Palestine Action to the suffragette movement.

What is the new gender guidance for schools and colleges in England?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
12:47:01 UTC
21:47:01 KST

What is the updated guidance, and who is it for? It is, officially, just a small part of wider guidance for schools and colleges, titled Keeping Children Safe in Education, which covers everything from the basics of safeguarding, checks on staff and dealing with harassment.
The section on students who might question their gender covers about five of the document’s 201 pages, guiding institutions about what they should do in such circumstances. Unlike the previous guidance it is statutory – it must be followed. It is currently being consulted on, and so will not come into force until September. The DfE says it will then be reviewed annually.
What are the main changes? There are two specific changes. The first is that the new guidance ends the 2023 document’s outright ban on primary school-age children undertaking what is called social transitioning, the process whereby someone who is questioning their gender might change their appearance or dress, or use a different name or pronouns.
The updated version says it can happen, but that this is expected to be very rare, and should take place only after the school or college uses proper procedures, including parental involvement and clinical advice.
The second alteration is that while the 2023 version said parents should always be informed, the new guidance says there could be very rare safeguarding cases “where involving parents or carers would constitute a greater risk to the child than not involving them”.
More widely, officials say this is intended to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach, which, they argue, was partly informed by culture war considerations under the Conservative guidance.
Is the context for the new advice different? Yes, and again, in two ways. The first is that it reflects the findings of the 2024 review into gender transitioning and children led by Dr Hilary Cass, which urged caution over gender transitioning for younger children. The new guidance is publicly backed by Cass.
The second change is last year’s supreme court ruling on gender, which set out the necessity of single-sex spaces. The new guidance says schools should not have mixed toilet facilities or mixed sleeping arrangements on trips beyond the age of eight, and “no child should be made to feel unsafe through inappropriate mixed-sex sport”. For socially transitioning students, it says schools and colleges should “sensitively explain” they will not have access to toilets, changing rooms or residential accommodation designated for the opposite sex.
What has the reaction been? From teaching unions and schools – who have called repeatedly for the guidance to be released – broadly positive. The Association of School and College Leaders said there was a real need for “clear, pragmatic and well-evidenced national guidance”, saying that up until now, schools and colleges had been forced to find their own solutions “amid an often polarised public debate”.
The Conservatives have said it “weakens the role of parents”, and condemned the change over primary-aged children. The party also criticised ministers for releasing it in the afternoon the day before a week-long Commons recess, saying this seemed to be a way to avoid scrutiny.
Why does it only apply to England? Because education is a devolved matter and one of the policy areas that is not run from Westminster for every UK nation.

Bangladesh Nationalist Party to form government by Sunday, implement July Charter 'gradually'

The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has said it would form a new government by Sunday, after winning the first elections since the July 2024 popular uprising that ousted the government of Sheikh Hasina.
"It will be the BNP’s government. The government will be formed by February 15. The BNP will go to parliament with all parties," the party’s Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told reporters on Friday while visiting his constituency in the north-western Thakurgaon district.
“The issues that BNP signed in the July Charter on reforms will be implemented step by step,” he added.
Bangladeshi voters also endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum. The referendum took place alongside parliamentary elections on Thursday.
According to the commission, 60.2 percent of voters backed the reform package.
July Charter
The lengthy document, known as the "July Charter" after the month when the uprising that toppled Hasina began, proposes term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
It also includes increased representation of women in parliament and the election of the deputy speaker and parliamentary committee chairs from the opposition.
The referendum question noted that approval would make the charter "binding on the parties that win" the election, obliging them to endorse it.
Ali Riaz, vice-chairman of the Consensus Commission that led rounds of marathon talks with parties to agree on the charter, welcomed the result.
"Through their 'yes' votes, the people of Bangladesh have clearly expressed their desire for reforms," he told AFP.
"The responsibility now lies with the political parties to implement these reforms. We sincerely hope they will respect the people's mandate and uphold the charter."
BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman is likely the party's prime ministerial candidate.
He became the party head after the death of his mother and Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, in December.
According to the Constitution, a party needs 151 seats in the 300-seat parliament to form a government.
The BNP alone secured 209 seats in Thursday's vote. Its main competitor, the bloc led by Jamaat-e-Islami, won 77 seats.

UK police say will no longer make arrests for supporting Palestine Action after ruling
Officers will 'continue to identify offences where support for Palestine Action is being expressed, but they will focus on gathering evidence,' according to statement
LONDON
London's Metropolitan Police said on Friday that officers will prioritize gathering evidence over making arrests following a High Court ruling that said the UK government's ban on Palestine Action under terrorism legislation was unlawful.
Judges said the proscription was “disproportionate” and “the nature and scale of its activities falling within the definition of terrorism had not yet reached the level, scale and persistence to warrant proscription.”
However, the group will remain banned for now to allow for further legal arguments. The goverment said it will appeal the decision.
In a statement released after the court’s decision, police, however, warned that the ban on the group remains in place and that showing support for Palestine Action is still a criminal offence.
Still, Met Police acknowledged, the “unusual circumstances” may cause confusion among the public about what happens next.
The statement said officers will “continue to identify offences where support for Palestine Action is being expressed, but they will focus on gathering evidence of those offences and the people involved to provide opportunities for enforcement at a later date, rather than making arrests at the time.”
“This is the most proportionate approach we can take, acknowledging the decision reached by the court while recognising that proceedings are not yet fully concluded.
“This approach relates solely to the expression of support for Palestine Action. We will continue to intervene and make arrests where we see people crossing the line from lawful protest to intimidate, to damage property, to use violence, to stir up racial hatred or to commit other offences.”
Palestine Action was banned in July 2025 after members of the group entered a Royal Air Force base and spray painted two aircraft. The ban was challenged by the group's co-founder, Huda Ammori.

Some PR advice for the Andrew-stricken royals – try something that look less like a $12m cover-up | Marina Hyde
Unknown

21:45:53 KST

“I could have worse tags than ‘Air Miles Andy’,” the then Prince Andrew once reflected. “Although I don’t know what they are!” I think it’s safe to say he does now.
Almost all senior members of the royal family are biologically capable of sweating, and what really brought them out in a cold one four years ago was the thought of this honking liability testifying in a New York courtroom. So they paid millions upon millions to make sure it didn’t happen. The late Virginia Giuffre’s civil case alleging that the former prince abused her on three occasions in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands was never heard, because the late queen seems to have decided that it shouldn’t be at almost any cost. (Andrew denied all claims of wrongdoing.) And yet, as many of us predicted at the time, this would never be the end of it, and the royal family are now playing a failing game of catch-up with the institution’s own actions. Andrew’s de-princing – an attempt to keep it all in-house – already hasn’t worked.
The Windsors are incredibly tight with their own money and have spent generations in arguments and internecine sulks about how it is spread around. Before the Duke and Duchess of Sussex stepped away from their roles, money rows were a big part of Harry’s but also William’s friction with their father, now king. The idea that this bunch would fork over a reported $12m, plus seven figures of Andrew’s legal costs, without some fairly frank family discussions is just bollocks. Yet they clung to their public silence. They shielded him from what lesser mortals would know as the consequences of their alleged actions. This is proving to be extremely consequential for them.
Whose were the millions? As of yesterday, the king is letting it be known via courtiers that he didn’t chip in, with the money coming mostly from the late queen and the estate of the Duke of Edinburgh. It is often assumed the late queen paid from her secretive private funds, but others suggest it came from the Duchy of Lancaster, the earnings of which are public money. It would be good to know. In fact, it’s one of many Andrew-related questions that senior royals would surely have got the answer to behind closed doors many, many years ago. It would be good to know, for instance, how come in 2007 a Kazakh oligarch paid our former trade envoy £3m more than the asking price for a mansion the late queen had given Andrew as a wedding present – and an estimated £7m more than the market value – and then was happy to let it go to ruin. Please don’t tell me they never asked the question.
This week, the Windsors’ approach to the gathering peril has shifted. Now, say Charles and William and Kate in statements issued on their behalf, the king and queen “stand ready to support [Thames Valley police] as you would expect”, while the Waleses “remain focused on the victims”.
And yet, some victims are very specifically asking the royal family to focus on how they could help in more active ways than thoughts and prayers. It would, for instance, be a lot more helpful if they focused on security logs at Buckingham Palace and Balmoral, as well as internal household emails, and all the other documentation that could be dredged up. A leaked email last year suggested that in 2011 Andrew had asked one of his taxpayer-funded royal protection officers to dig up dirt on Giuffre. The officer in question reportedly couldn’t remember the events in question, and the Met closed its investigation into the matter. Have police ever even so much as spoken to Andrew about any aspect of this case? We don’t know. We should.
The general approach of the monarchy and the establishment or whatever you want to call it has always been to imply that no one knows whether Andrew, who had 24-hour top-level protection, was where he said he was at any given time. But every now and then, someone refuses to play ball. Take the late Thomas Harris, former British consul general in New York, with whom Andrew claimed to have been staying, meaning he couldn’t have had “activity” with Giuffre at Epstein’s Manhattan house. “It doesn’t sound like he stayed with me,” Harris stated in 2019, saying he had no recollection of the visit and it hadn’t featured in the Court Circular, which would have been standard. What a puzzle. One for Buckingham Palace’s remorselessly dogged internal affairs department, perhaps.
Andrew himself spent years playing a two-faced game, suggesting to Emily Maitlis that he’d certainly help US investigators with their Epstein inquiries if asked. Yet soon after, the then US attorney for the southern district of New York stated for the record that Andrew had offered “zero” cooperation up till that point. A few months later, the situation remained unchanged. “If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation,” the attorney declared, “our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him.”
The trouble comes when that two-faced game is perceived by the public to have spread to those at the top of the institution, who certainly have no part in alleged crimes, but have not dispelled the increasingly noxious impression of the institution having been adjacent to a cover-up.
Statements this week indicate senior royals are still playing this dangerous game of publicly really, really wanting to help, while not revealing anything useful of substance. No doubt they think this is the only game they can play. They are not brilliant strategists – the royal family is, somewhat famously, not a meritocracy. They eventually worked out that doing nothing was not an option; I wonder how soon they’ll clock that doing a bit less than nothing isn’t either?

Moscow House row an ‘embarrassment for entire state’, says Vilnius mayor

The failure to demolish the unfinished Moscow House in central Vilnius has become a “stinking mess” and is an embarrassment for Lithuania as a whole, the city’s mayor has said.
Valdas Benkunskas criticised the State Territorial Planning and Construction Inspectorate for failing to implement a 2022 court ruling ordering the building’s demolition over the past five years.
“It seems to me that this issue has already become a stinking mess and is embarrassing not only for the Inspectorate, but for the entire state, as we have been unable to demolish a single building in five years,” Benkunskas told BNS.
He said only one attempt had been made to announce a tender during that period, which was subsequently challenged by excluded contractors.
“If there is a will, there is always a possibility to supervise the processes properly. I don’t know if this is deliberate, but I can safely say that there is no desire or will to do so,” he added.
In January, the mayor said he had approached prosecutors to enforce the court ruling in the public interest. On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General’s Office told BNS that no decision had yet been made.
Benkunskas emphasised that demolition is the only viable solution for the building.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The number of foreign tourists visiting the Arctic and the Russian North grew by 23.3% in 2025, the Center for Strategic Research reported referring to the national statistics agency, Rosstat.
"The Arctic and the Russian North are becoming more and more attractive for foreign travelers. Their number grew by 23.3% last year, outpacing the national average (+14.9%). Every 50th foreign tourist visiting Russia travels to the Arctic and the Russian North. A record increase in the interest of foreigners was recorded in the Chukotka Autonomous Region - plus 134% year-on-year. The Murmansk Region welcomed 54.5% more foreign visitors, and the Arkhangelsk Region - 44.6% more year-on-year," the report reads.
Last year, the number of tourists visiting Chukotka grew by 59.7%, as well as the Nenets Autonomous Region and the Murmansk Region. A decrease in the number of tourists was recorded in 2025 in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region - minus 28%, and in the Arkhangelsk region - minus 8.5%. The average duration of trips to the Arctic in 2025 made 2.9 nights. In Komi, tourists stayed the longest, average 3.6 nights.
In 2025, 2.7 million trips were made to the Arctic zone and the Russian North - 3% of all tourist trips in Russia. According to the Center for Strategic Research, expert estimates, based on preliminary data from Rosstat, say the number of tourists decreased slightly in 2025, but they expect that by April, after final data are summarized, the number will be reported as similar or even higher year-on-year.
Earlier, press service of the Ministry for Development of the Far East and Arctic forecasted the number of visitors to the Russian Federation's Arctic Zone in 2025 would make about 1.5 million people.

Russia hopes to continue discussions with the US on economic cooperation — Kremlin

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. A Russia-US working group is considering prospects for trade and economic cooperation, and the Kremlin hopes these discussions will continue, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing.
"A group on economic issues is working. On our side, it is headed by my colleague [RDIF head Kirill] Dmitriev. Indeed, issues of trade and economic cooperation - both potential and proposed - are on the agenda, and they are being discussed," he said answering a question about whether the US had responded to the proposal to expand economic cooperation.
"We hope these discussions will continue. At the moment, the de facto situation is such that, in practice, until, let's say, a Ukrainian settlement is reached, it is hardly possible to talk about anything concrete, and for now this is limited to discussions," he said.
"But as we move forward, and if we do make progress toward a peaceful settlement, then this could move into practical applications," Peskov concluded.
At the end of December last year, it was announced that work on a settlement around Ukraine would continue within the framework of two specially created groups: one on security and one on economic issues. In January, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov announced that the bilateral Russian-American working group on economic issues would be headed by Russian Presidential Special Representative Kirill Dmitriev and US Presidential Special Envoy Steven Witkoff.

Anti-terror panel to propose transitional law for 'social integration'
Unknown

21:25:14 KST

Local reports said on Feb. 13 that a parliamentary commission overseeing the government’s "terror-free Türkiye" initiative will propose a transitional law aimed at reintegrating disarmed PKK members into society, according to a draft final report circulated to political parties.
The report, centered on the concept of “social integration,” is expected to expand to over 500 pages once the additional submissions of political parties are incorporated.
The commission envisions a temporary transitional law tailored specifically to the process and applicable only to members of the disbanded organization, daily Hürriyet said. Once the commission’s report is approved, the proposed legislation is expected to be introduced to the parliamentary agenda and could pass next month with the backing of the ruling bloc.
According to the document, any legislative proposal would be brought to parliament only after state institutions confirm that the terror group has fully dissolved and no longer poses a threat. Such verification could come through reports issued by the National Intelligence Organization or relevant security ministries, the report said.
The draft does not explicitly reference the debated “right to hope” concept — a term associated with the possible release of jailed PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan, according to the Hürriyet.
Officials say the law would facilitate the return of PKK members abroad who are Turkish citizens and could enable the release of individuals imprisoned on charges related to PKK membership or propaganda. Some 4,200 inmates are currently incarcerated on such charges.
Momentum behind the initiative increased last year after Öcalan issued a call that prompted PKK to begin disarming. A first batch of members publicly destroyed their weapons in July, and the organization later announced it would withdraw from Turkish territory in October.
The İYİ (Good) Party remains the only major political party boycotting the initiative and has declined to send representatives to the parliamentary commission.

Fire in Crans-Montana has had little effect on Swiss tourism
The fire disaster in Crans-Montana has attracted a great deal of international attention but has so far had little impact on Swiss tourism. According to several tourism organisations, bookings, frequencies and sales have remained stable.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
“The event has received a lot of international attention,” says a spokesperson for Valais Promotion in response to an enquiry from the news agency AWP. However, there were no noticeable changes in bookings for Valais as a whole.
In Crans-Montana itself, there have been individual cancellations, especially for corporate events, but “in several cases, bookings have not been cancelled but postponed”.
The perception abroad is different. While in neighbouring European countries the resort was usually mentioned specifically, in long-distance markets the term “Swiss ski resort” is often only used in general terms. Observers see this as a potential risk for the country’s image, but there have been no concrete effects on booking decisions to date.
On New Year’s Eve a fire in a bar in Crans-Montana killed 41 people and injured more than a hundred.

No shift to the detriment of Valais
Other regions are not reporting any shifts either. A spokesperson for Graubünden Tourism explained that there has been no shift in demand to the detriment of Valais. Although the Graubünden mountain railways registered a slight slowdown in January, this was due to the snow. Catering sales were mostly at the previous year’s level. Cableways Switzerland also noted no fire-related changes in frequencies.
Hotelleriesuisse sees no indication of any structural damage to its image. “We see no reason to assume a widespread or long-term drop in sales for the 2025/26 winter season.” The association pointed to Switzerland’s international image as a safe and professional destination.
At the same time, industry representatives are urging vigilance. Norbert Patt, CEO of Titlis-Bahnen, warned AWP in mid-January of the possible consequences for the overall image and emphasised the importance of strict safety rules. “No tea lights either, really nothing at all,” he said, referring to open flames in mountain stations.
Both Hotelleriesuisse and Valais Promotion emphasised that transparency is now crucial. The events must be “analysed and communicated based on facts” in order to ensure trust. However, it is still too early for a final assessment of possible medium or long-term effects, they added.

Details: Heraskevych said he had been listened to by the court and is now waiting for the final decision.
Quote from Heraskevych: "There were long discussions. We talked for two and a half hours. I'm very grateful to have had the chance to speak out, and we were given a fair hearing. Our arguments were listened to. We are waiting for the decision. As you can see, I'm quite happy. I hope the truth will prevail. I know I did nothing wrong."
More details: Yevhen Pronin, a Ukrainian lawyer representing Heraskevych at the CAS, also commented on the case.
Quote from Pronin: "The fast-track proceedings in Vladyslav Heraskevych's case against the IOC [International Olympic Committee] and the IBSF [International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation] have concluded. They lasted two and a half hours. We laid out all of our legal arguments, in writing and orally. Vladyslav has poured into this case all the energy he should have been able to spend on the track, but he was denied that chance. Now it is for the arbitrator to rule on the case. We await the decision."
Background: Heraskevych had appealed against his suspension from the 2026 Winter Olympics. He has been banned from competing in a "remembrance helmet" featuring portraits of over 20 Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia's war against Ukraine.

Epstein files: Goldman Sachs top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler to step down after email fallout

Top Goldman Sachs lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler said Thursday night that she will leave the investment bank at the end of June, a decision that came after a flurry of news articles highlighting documents detailing the former White House counsel's often chummy email conversations with the notorious sex predator Jeffrey Epstein.
Goldman, for months, has defended Ruemmler after Congress and then the Department of Justice released emails between her and Epstein, as well as other documents related to investigations of him.
Ruemmler, who has been a key advisor to Goldman CEO David Solomon since joining the bank in 2020, told the Financial Times on Thursday, "I made the determination that the media attention on me, relating to my prior work as a defence attorney, was becoming a distraction."
The FT first reported the 54-year-old's decision to leave Goldman.
"Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm's legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do," Ruemmler said in a statement to CNBC.
"My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first," Ruemmler said.
"Earlier today, I regretfully informed David Solomon of my intention to step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026."
Solomon, in a statement, said, "Throughout her tenure, Kathy has been an extraordinary general counsel, and we are grateful for her contributions and sound advice on a wide range of consequential legal matters for the firm."
"As one of the most accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision," Solomon said.
Her announcement that she will leave Goldman comes nearly a week after The Wall Street Journal reported that Ruemmler was one of three people whom Epstein called on July 6, 2019, after being arrested by federal authorities on child sex trafficking charges at an airport in New Jersey.
The Journal's report cites a handwritten set of notes by law enforcement about comments Epstein made inside an FBI vehicle after his arrest.
Those notes are among documents released in late January by the Department of Justice, CNBC has confirmed.
Other news articles detailed emails and documents showing how Epstein had made gifts to Ruemmler that included a Hermes bag, and other luxury items, such as a Fendi purse, spa visits, Bergdorf Goodman gift cards and flowers. On one occasion, she effusively thanked him, calling him "Uncle Jeffrey," one email showed.
Ruemmler was a white-collar criminal defense lawyer at the firm Latham & Watkins during the years she was speaking with Epstein, whom she met in 2014.
An Aug. 14, 2014, email contained in the DOJ's Epstein files shows how he asked her to represent his client, Bank Edmond de Rothschild.
"They have a justice department problem ... like every other swiss bank," Epstein wrote her.
Ruemmler took the bank as a client for Latham.
Ruemmler has said that she never represented Epstein, who killed himself in a New York federal jail weeks after his 2019 arrest.
Ruemmler's spokeswoman, Jennifer Connelly, told the Journal for its story last Friday, "These documents are consistent with what Ms. Ruemmler has repeatedly said: She knew Epstein when she was a criminal defense attorney and shared a client with him."
"She was friendly with him in that context. She had no knowledge of any ongoing criminal conduct on his part," Connelly said.
Ruemmler previously served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama.
She is the latest person to lose a high-profile position because of her prior association with Epstein.
On Sunday, Morgan Sweeney resigned as chief of staff to British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying he took responsibility for advising Starmer to appoint Peter Mandelson as the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States. Starmer fired Mandelson from that post in September over disclosures about his connection to Epstein.
Last week, Brad Karp, chairman of the major corporate law firm Paul Weiss, resigned from that post after fallout over emails between him and Epstein. Karp is staying at the firm.
In response to the Epstein emails, a Paul Weiss spokesman previously said, "Mr. Karp never witnessed or participated in any misconduct. Mr. Karp attended two group dinners in New York City and had a small number of social interactions by email, all of which he regrets."
Karp said he was leaving the chairman's post because of the distraction of the news stories.
In November, after a congressional committee released emails between Ruemmler and Epstein, Goldman Sachs spokesman Tony Fratto told CNBC, "These emails were private correspondence well before Kathy Ruemmler joined Goldman Sachs."
"Kathy is an exceptional general counsel and we benefit from her judgment every day," Fratto said at the time.
Ruemmler has previously told the Journal that she regrets ever knowing Epstein.
Among the new tranche of emails that the DOJ released in late January is one that Ruemmler sent Epstein in March 2019, four months before his arrest.
In that email, she offered advice on how to respond to criticism that he had previously received special treatment and a light punishment in 2008 because of his wealth and political connections when he avoided federal prosecution in exchange for pleading guilty in Florida state court to a charge of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl.
At the time Epstein sought Ruemmler's advice, he had been the subject of a series of articles in the Miami Herald that were critical of the decision by federal prosecutors not to file charges against him in 2008. Epstein ended up serving just 13 months in state prison in Florida, but was allowed out to go to his office during the day for much of that time.
The subject line of the email thread, "From wapo," suggests that Epstein was reaching out to Ruemmler because of an inquiry by The Washington Post about him.
Ruemmler wrote in the email: "Something like: … 'The criticism is wrong and reflects a fundamental [misunderstanding] of both the facts underlying Mr. Epstein's case and how it was [prosecuted] by both local and federal authorities."
"Far from [receiving] a sweetheart deal, Mr. Epstein was subjected to a lengthy, aggressive, [and] highly unusual federal investigation for what were, in essence, local [offenses] of sexual solicitation," Ruemmler wrote. "He accepted responsibility, served [time and] prison, and paid significant monetary settlements to the victims [involved]."
Ruemmler, in a bracketed section, also suggested saying something like, "But for his wealth, it is hard to imagine that Mr. Epstein … would have received the aggressive treatment that he did from [federal] prosecutors, and he certainly would never have been subjected to the [salacious] and malicious treatment by the media that he continues to receive more than 10 years after the case was resolved."

AU Peace, Security Council declares Somaliland recognition invalid

The African Union’s Peace and Security Council on Thursday reaffirmed Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, rejecting any recognition of Somaliland as an independent state and denouncing outside interference in Sudan’s internal conflict.
In a statement issued after a ministerial meeting in Addis Ababa, the council condemned Israel’s unilateral recognition of what it called the “so-called Republic of Somaliland” and demanded that the decision be immediately withdrawn.
The council stressed that no actor has the authority to alter the territorial configuration of an African Union member state, declaring that any such move is null and void and carries no legal effect under international law.
The strongly worded response followed Israel’s Dec. 26 announcement last year that it had formally recognized Somaliland as a sovereign state, becoming the only country to do so. The decision drew sharp criticism across the region.
The council welcomed recent military gains against the al-Shabab extremist group and encouraged Somali security forces, supported by the AU mission in Somalia, known as AUSSOM, and partners, to sustain operations to “more effectively degrade and ultimately defeat al-Shabab and other terrorist groups.”
It urged Somalia’s federal government to intensify inclusive dialogue with federal member states and other stakeholders, noting that “divisions in the governance of the country complicate the fight against al-Shabab and prolong efforts aimed at stabilization and state-building.”
The council also stressed the need for rapid force generation and for “sustainable, predictable, flexible and multiyear financing” for AUSSOM.
The council strongly condemned external interference in Sudan’s internal affairs and urged outside actors to refrain from “actions that will continue to fuel conflict,” as fighting persists across parts of the country.
It expressed deep concern about the continued conflict, citing widespread civilian casualties, destruction of infrastructure and a deepening humanitarian crisis, including reports of famine in several areas.
The council condemned violations against civilians and called for accountability for those responsible.
It demanded unhindered humanitarian access and protection for aid workers and urged an immediate humanitarian truce leading to a ceasefire, saying there is no viable military solution to the conflict.
It called for an inclusive, Sudanese-led political process to address the root causes of the crisis and restore constitutional order.

Imran Khan loses 85% vision in right eye, lawyer tells Supreme Court

Pakistan’s imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan has lost 85% of the vision in his right eye, his lawyer told the Supreme Court, compounding the legal and political turmoil that has defined his time behind bars.
Khan, 73, has been jailed since August 2023 and is serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges. He faces dozens of other cases that he says were fabricated to sideline him from politics, an allegation the military strongly rejects.
“He has been left with only 15% vision in his right eye,” Khan’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, said in a report submitted Thursday and seen by Reuters, quoting the former cricket star turned politician.
The fact-finding report cited Khan as saying he had been complaining since October 2025 of “persistent blurred and hazy vision,” but that jail authorities took no action.
Safdar submitted the report after a two-hour meeting with Khan ordered by the Supreme Court, which set a Feb. 16 deadline for authorities to allow Khan access to his personal physician for an assessment of his condition.
Khan was taken to a hospital this month for a 20-minute eye procedure, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar has said.
“We demand immediate and transparent implementation of the court’s order, unrestricted access to qualified specialists of his choice, and an end to tactics that risk his life in custody,” Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party said in a statement.
The party, which faced a crackdown after Khan’s May 2023 arrest sparked nationwide protests against the military, emerged as the single largest party in the 2024 election.
But it said rigging cost it seats and helped other parties form a coalition government under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, allegations Sharif and his allies deny.

Amazon's Ring cancels Flock partnership amid Super Bowl ad backlash

Ring is terminating its partnership with police tech provider Flock Safety, the Amazon-owned company announced Thursday.
The partnership between Flock and Ring came under scrutiny after the Amazon doorbell company ran an ad during the Super Bowl that touted a "Search Party" feature that uses AI to help locate lost pets. When a user initiates the feature, it activates a network of participating Ring cameras, which scan footage for images resembling the missing dog. The Electronic Frontier Foundation called the feature a "surveillance nightmare."
Flock, meanwhile, operates a network of automated license plate readers, and sells access to that software to customers that include law enforcement agencies.
Ring's decision to cancel its partnership with Flock comes as tech companies face growing pressure to reexamine their work with federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Earlier this week, Salesforce employees pressed CEO Marc Benioff to cancel "ICE opportunities," CNBC reported. More than 900 Google employees also asked their company to divest itself from ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
Privacy and civil liberties advocates called on Ring to drop its partnership with Flock. A protest calling on the e-commerce company to cut its ties with Flock, ICE and CBP is scheduled for Friday, outside of Amazon's Seattle headquarters.
"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated," Ring wrote in a blog post. "As a result, we have made the joint decision to cancel the planned integration."
Flock representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Amazon acquired Ring for $839 million in 2018. The home security company is primarily known for its connected doorbell devices, which can record footage and alert users to activity around their home or business via an app.
Ring has long sparked controversy about privacy due to its partnerships with police. In recent years, the company had adopted a softer image, positioning its devices as a tool to capture porch pirates and family-friendly hijinks. After founder Jamie Siminoff returned as CEO last year, the company has re-embraced its original mission of fighting crime.
The Amazon company announced its partnership with Flock last October, giving owners of its video doorbells the option to share footage with law enforcement agencies that use the startup's software to assist with their "evidence collection and investigative work."
Flock's systems have been adopted by thousands of communities and law enforcement agencies across the country, and both ICE and CBP have reportedly accessed Flock's data as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Flock has denied that it shares data with ICE or any "sub-agency" of the Department of Homeland Security.
Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels said in a statement that the Flock partnership was never active, and the companies never announced a date for it to go live.
"No videos were ever shared between these services," Daniels said.
In response to the scrutiny of its Search Party tool, Daniels said Ring built the feature "with strong privacy protections from the start." Ring users can decide on a case-by-case basis whether they want to share videos with a pet owner who initiates a Search Party, she said.
The news was earlier reported by The Verge.
