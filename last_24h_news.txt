Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time at a pace that crushes its 1994 medal count
Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time and its medal count continues to climb at the Milan Cortina Games

It’s official: Host nation Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time.
Italy picked up four medals in quick succession on Sunday — two golds, a silver and a bronze — to reach 22 and surpass its previous best medal haul of 20, set more than 30 years ago at the Lillehammer Games in 1994.
And there are still seven days left of competition at the Milan Cortina Games.
Italy's cross-country team set the day off with bronze in the men's 4 x 7.5-kilometer relay, and then came a flurry of three medals in less than an hour.
Federica Brignone won an incredible second gold medal with a victory in the giant slalom, barely a month after returning to racing following a horrific injury last year.
Half an hour later, Michela Moioli and Lorenzo Sommariva finished second in the mixed team snowboard cross to pick up Italy’s 21st medal. Shortly after that, Lisa Vittozzi won gold in the 10-kilometer pursuit biathlon race.
“We are witnessing something historic, for our talented and extraordinary athletes,” local organizing committee president Giovanni Malagò said. "But this success makes us so happy also because we are reaping the fruits of years and years of hard work.”
The total is more than the target of 19 medals set by Italian Olympic Committee president Luciano Buonfiglio before the Games began.
The breakdown so far? Eight gold medals, four silver and 10 bronze.
In Lillehammer, Italy finished fourth in the final medal table — behind Russia, host nation Norway and Germany. At Milan Cortina, the Italians have consistently been in the top two, trailing Norway (24 medals) early on Sunday.
At the last Winter Olympics, in Beijing, Italy won 17 medals. It fared worse the last time it hosted the Games, collecting 11 in Turin in 2006.
The signs that Italy could do something special at its home games were there right from Day 3, when it had a record-breaking day on home snow and ice with a haul of six medals, the most the nation had ever won in a single day at the Winter Olympics.
“What an incredible day: Six medals in 24 hours at the Winter Olympics will go down in history,” Malagò said. “And what’s also incredible is the multidisciplinary nature of the medals. We have become a country that is capable of being competitive in sports where we have never been.
“That is fundamental in the Olympic program and in the final medal table. … I have always been of the opinion that the strength of a country can be seen in how many medals in different sports you manage to earn, not necessarily the number of golds.”
The stories behind some of the medals have added to the feel-good moment sweeping the country.
The 35-year-old Brignone skied through the pain to win gold in the women’s super-G on Thursday, following a year spent largely in rehab after breaking multiple bones in her leg.
Arianna Fontana, the most decorated short track speedskater of all time, won her 12th and 13th medals, equaling fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti’s record for most Olympic medals by an Italian athlete — a mark that has stood since 1960.
“We’re getting to see the Italian team do incredibly well. … I’ve been very fortunate to have gotten to witness Federica’s and Arianna’s golds, which were just incredible,” International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry said on Friday. “Their stories of resilience and fight and everything good in humanity was really showcased.
“Both athletes I have so much respect for … Arianna is now the most decorated Italian athlete, summer or winter Olympian. And to do that at home, it’s so cool. I’m so excited for her. And you could feel in the stadium yesterday, last night, just the passion and the love and the respect.”

Tops Swiss diplomat says sure Russia wants to make step toward peace in Ukraine

GENEVA, February 15. /TASS/. Russia really wants to take a step toward peace in Ukraine, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said, commenting on his talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow a week ago.
"After these talks, I got the impression that Russia really wants to take a step toward peace. The question is not whether it wants this, but at what price," he said in an interview with the SRF television channel.
"I think that if I had not visited Moscow a week ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that this meeting would now take place in Geneva," he said, referring to another round of talks on the Ukrainian settlement due to be held in Geneva on February 17 and 18.
On February 6, Lavrov held talks with Cassis, who arrived in Moscow in the capacity of Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) along with OSCE Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu. The talks focused on ways to get out of the current profound crisis of the organization. The OSCE officials also raised the issue of the organization’s role in promoting dialogue on the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.
On January 23, the first day of trilateral security consultations took place in Abu Dhabi. A second meeting was held on January 24. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff. The Ukrainian part of the trilateral working group was headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov. The second round of trilateral talks were also held in Abu Dhabi on February 4 and 5. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov announced another round of trilateral talks on Ukraine in Geneva on February 17 and 18. The Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Police in Italy have arrested an Israeli woman at Milan’s airport at Russia’s request over a role she allegedly held during the country’s 2018 elections, according to Russian independent media and her husband.
The independent Russian outlet SVTV reported Saturday that security services at Milan’s airport confirmed the arrest.
In an anonymous Facebook post seeking legal and diplomatic assistance, the woman’s husband described the case as political persecution. He said Russian authorities declared her wanted over her role on a local election commission during the 2018 vote.
“We knew a criminal case had been opened against her after she left Russia in 2022 and that she had been placed on an international wanted list,” he wrote.
According to the husband, she was declared wanted after failing to appear for a court hearing. After she left Russia and moved with him to Israel, where the couple obtained citizenship, an international arrest warrant was issued, he said.
“I desperately need assistance on this matter — who to contact and what to do in this situation?” he wrote.
He said the couple had traveled to Europe twice since leaving Russia without incident. The situation changed during a visit to Lithuania, where customs officials informed the woman that Russia was seeking her and warned the couple. However, he said, they were reassured that they could move freely within Europe without fear.
She was later detained at Milan’s airport, he said.
Human rights activists condemned the arrest, calling it political persecution. Activists who spoke to the independent outlet Port said they had attempted to contact officials at Milan’s airport but were refused information about the reasons for the detention and were referred instead to the Russian consulate.

Alcaraz and Sinner set for Doha showdown as Qatar ExxonMobil Open returns

Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner headline the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha, recently voted ATP 500 Tournament of the Year. With Novak Djokovic withdrawing, the spotlight shifts firmly to tennis’s new generation.
The world’s top two men’s players are set to clash in Doha this week as the Qatar ExxonMobil Open gets underway.
One of just two ATP Tour events in the Middle East, the competition was voted the 2025 ATP 500 Tournament of the Year by the players themselves, a reflection of how highly it is regarded on the circuit.
With more than 2.3 million euros in prize money at stake, World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz leads a field packed with elite talent. The 22-year-old Spaniard arrives full of confidence and says he has a clear plan for the week ahead as he looks to build momentum early in the season.
“A lot of players i know are trying to catch me up, in terms of they study my game, they study how I play, trying to beat me. Trying to challenge me and i have to be ready for them to see where my level is, where my tennis is. And try to put myself in their minds and think what they could do playing against me.”
For Alcaraz, being the top-ranked player is not just about lifting trophies, it is about staying one step ahead. He is still beaming from his Australian Open title, but knows tennis rarely allows time to linger on achievements.
“Obviously, what I did in Australia was incredible for me and I’m still thinking a little about it. But you know, tennis is just about keep going, tournament after tournament. Every tournament is a good tournament, special. You want to give your 100%. So right now, I’m focused on trying to play my best, trying to improve, doing good things on the court.”
But World No. 2 Jannik Sinner is also chasing the trophy, and for him, this tournament carries a personal touch.
Speaking to Euronews, the 24-year-old reflected on returning to a city he first visited as a junior. “First of all great to play here, you know, for the first time I do remember I was here some years ago because of a junior tournament, so I have great memories in a way and I'm looking forward to it,” he said.
“We try to get the rhythm back from Australia, heading also into the Sunshine Double after in the US, and then we'll see. Of course, we are here trying to perform in the best possible way, and we'll then see how it goes.”
“You know, you have small feedback from training sessions of course you need to play matches trying to understand what works best so let's see what's coming.”
Defending champion Andrey Rublev returns hoping to make it back-to-back titles in Doha.
However, there will be one notable absentee. World No. 3 Novak Djokovic, a two-time champion in Doha, has withdrawn from the tournament citing fatigue.
But with Alcaraz and Sinner leading the charge, Doha feels like a glimpse into the sport's present and future.

UK's new ammunition factory for Ukraine unable to start operations for over six months

UK's new ammunition factory for Ukraine unable to start operations for over six months
According to Ukrinform, The Guardian stated this in an article.
The new plant in Wales, considered crucial for increasing the UK's ammunition production, has not been operational for over half a year after its planned launch date. The explosives factory in Glascoed, South Wales, was expected to increase the UK's artillery shell production capacity sixteenfold, replenishing domestic stocks and boosting supplies for Ukraine.
The Guardian found that production was supposed to begin last summer but has still not started. BAE Systems, the company operating the plant, confirmed the delay, explaining that it was caused by a 2025 mid-construction decision to double the factory's production capacity.
The UK aims to sharply expand its domestic explosives production to reduce reliance on other countries for ammunition. Previously, BAE Systems imported RDX explosives, used in artillery shells, from the U.S. and France.
The delay is also linked to government hesitations over increasing defense spending amid warnings that the British Armed Forces could face a GBP 28 billion funding shortfall over the next four years.
As previously reported, defense companies worldwide have increased weapons production due to Russia's war against Ukraine, but shortages of raw materials and long manufacturing cycles continue to limit the replenishment of stockpiles and meeting Ukraine's needs.

Europe aims to rely less on US defence after Trump's Greenland push
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH, Feb 15 - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reflected a feeling of profound change among European leaders at this weekend's Munich Security Conference when she said: "Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed anymore".
Transatlantic ties have already been strained over the past year by Donald Trump’s return to the White House. But the U.S. president’s push to annex Greenland dramatically increased European doubts about Washington’s commitment to protect the continent through the NATO alliance.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered limited reassurance to Europeans in his conference speech. Rubio said the U.S. wanted to work with Europe and used a warmer tone than Vice President JD Vance last year. But he was critical of Europe's recent political course and did not mention NATO, Russia or Moscow’s war in Ukraine - issues on which a gulf has emerged between the U.S. and its partners in the alliance.
With the war about to enter its fifth year and Moscow viewed as an increasing threat by its European neighbours, leaders from the continent declared they would accelerate efforts to boost their own defences and rely less on the U.S.
That, in theory, puts them on the same page as Trump. His administration says it expects Europe to take primary responsibility for the conventional defence of the continent in the coming years. In return, Washington will keep its nuclear umbrella over Europe and uphold NATO’s mutual defence pact.
A 'EUROPEAN PILLAR' OF NATO
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged their commitment in Munich to a stronger “European pillar” within NATO. But a stronger home-grown defence is also a hedge against Trump or a future U.S. leader deciding not to defend Europe.
“This new beginning is right under all circumstances. It is right if the United States continues to distance itself. It is right as long as we cannot guarantee our own security on our own,” Merz told the conference on Friday.
In another sign of the nervousness surrounding U.S. security commitments, Merz said he had begun talks with Macron about a European nuclear deterrence.
France holds the only truly independent nuclear deterrent in Europe since Britain's Trident nuclear missiles are made and maintained by the United States.
WILL DEEDS MATCH WORDS?
The big question for Europe and its leaders is whether they can match their words with deeds – to buy and develop new weapons systems, to fill gaps in their arsenals in areas such as long-range missiles and to coordinate their work.
The signs so far are mixed.
Driven by fears of Russia and exhortations from Trump, European countries have boosted defence spending. NATO members agreed last year to raise spending on core defence from 2% of GDP to 3.5% of GDP, with a further 1.5% to be spent on other security-related investments.
European defence spending has risen nearly 80% since before the war in Ukraine began, von der Leyen told the Munich conference.
European countries are forming consortia to build complex weapons systems. Defence ministers from France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden signed a letter of intent on Thursday to advance work on European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA), a project to develop “deep strike” missiles.
On the sidelines of a NATO defence ministers’ meeting on Thursday, coalitions of European countries agreed to work together on four projects, including ballistic missile defence and air-launched munitions.
PROJECTS STRUGGLE DUE TO SQUABBLES
But some high-profile pan-European projects have struggled to get off the ground. The future of the FCAS French-German-Spanish fighter jet project has been in the balance for months, with the partners unable to agree on the share of work for the companies involved.
Debates on European Union defence projects have been accompanied by wrangling over whether they should be limited to EU companies or open to others.
France has been the strongest advocate to “buy European” provisions while the likes of Germany and The Netherlands argue for a more open approach.
Amid the debates in the swanky Bayerischer Hof hotel, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy brought home the reality of modern war, surrounded by giant screens showing images and statistics of Russian attacks. Last month alone, Ukraine was attacked by more than 6,000 drones and 150 missiles.
“During this war, weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them,” he told the delegates. REUTERS

Abuse survivor Pelicot says mindsets need to change in fight against sexual violence
Gisele Pelicot, who was repeatedly drugged by her then husband and offered to strangers for rape, is releasing a book about her experiences
Mindsets need to change in the fight against sexual violence, according to Gisele Pelicot, who was repeatedly drugged, abused and offered to strangers for rape by her then husband over nearly 10 years.
“I believe this can only be achieved through education and through respect and empathy for one another,” the 73-year-old French woman told the news portal of German public broadcaster ZDF in an interview published on Sunday. “We must continue this fight. We must not relent.”
Pelicot became a feminist icon in France due to her resolute stance and her decision not to conduct the trial behind closed doors.
“I believe that this trial has heightened society’s awareness of how men treat women,” Pelicot told ZDF. She said it brought many things to light.
“This continues to this day, as every day we see the tragedies associated with chemical submission.”
The term “chemical submission” in French refers to the malicious drugging with medication or drugs.

Off-trail avalanche kills 2 and injures 1 in northern Italy
Italian officials say an off-trail avalanche has killed two skiers and injured another on Italy's side of Mont Blanc
- Bookmark
An off-trail avalanche killed two skiers and injured another on Sunday on the Italian side of the Mont Blanc massif, near the border between France and Switzerland, officials said.
At least three skiers were caught up in Sunday morning’s avalanche in the Couloir Vesses, a well-known freeride route in Courmayeur, in the upper Val Veny, according to Italy's Alpine Rescue.
One of the victims was taken to a hospital in serious condition but later died, the agency said. Fifteen rescuers, three canine units and two helicopters took part in the search and rescue efforts.
Courmayeur, a town with about 2,900 inhabitants, is some 200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of Milan, one of the venues hosting the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.
Another person was partially buried by an avalanche in Trentino, but was rescued by his companions, authorities reported Sunday.
A record 13 backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers died in the Italian mountains over a week ending Feb. 8, Alpine Rescue said last Monday, including 10 in avalanches triggered by an exceptionally unstable snowpack.
Fresh snowfall during recent storms and wind-swept snowcaps on weak internal layers have created especially risky conditions along the entire Alpine crescent bordering France, Switzerland and Austria, Alpine Rescue said.

Powered by women, ‘Wuthering Heights’ digs up $34.8 million at the box office for a No. 1 debut
Emerald Fennell’s new “Wuthering Heights” has opened in first place at the North American box office
- Bookmark
Emerald Fennell’s bold reimagining of “Wuthering Heights” brought crowds of women to movie theaters this weekend. The Warner Bros. release topped the box office charts and nabbed the title for the year’s biggest opening with $34.8 million in ticket sales in its first three days in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. According to PostTrak polling, an estimated 76% of those ticket buyers were women. By the end of Monday's Presidents Day holiday, the total could rise to $40 million from its 3,682 locations.
The romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the star-crossed Catherine and Heathcliff, won out over the weekend’s other newcomers, including the animated “GOAT” and the heist thriller “Crime 101.” “Wuthering Heights” is also performing even better internationally, where it’s expecting to rake in an additional $42 million from 76 territories.
The Warner Bros./MRC production cost a reported $80 million to produce, not accounting for the millions spent on marketing and promotion. If the four-day totals match the estimates, that makes for a strong $82 million global debut. And the film still has several big openings on the horizon, in Japan and Vietnam on Feb. 27, and in China on March 13.
Fennell’s version of “Wuthering Heights,” which takes many liberties with Emily Brontë’s novel, largely divided critics. It’s currently sitting at a mixed 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. While that didn’t dissuade audiences from buying tickets, only 51% of the opening weekend audience said that they would “definitely recommend” the film to friends. Moviegoers also gave it a less-than-stellar B CinemaScore.
The mid-February weekend has hosted big superhero movies on occasion, including “Black Panther” and “Deadpool,” but a more relevant comparison is “Fifty Shades of Grey” and its two sequels. The first movie opened to over $85 million, the third to $38.6 million.
“GOAT,” an animated Sony release produced by basketball star Stephen Curry, landed in second place with an estimated $26 million from 3,863 locations. It's projected to bring in another $6 million on Monday, which would bring its four day total to $32 million — the biggest animated debut since “Elemental” in 2023. It also pulled in $15.6 million internationally, bringing its global total to $47.6 million.
The family-friendly film was the only new opener of the weekend to get an A CinemaScore. Sony Pictures Animation was also behind “KPop Demon Hunters.”
“Crime 101” made an estimated $15.1 million in its first three days. Amazon MGM Studios opened the Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo led Los Angeles-set thriller in 3,161 theaters. It’s expected to pull in about $17.8 million by the end of Monday, but the movie has a long way to go to even hit its production budget, which reportedly exceeded $90 million. Audiences, who were 56% men, also gave “Crime 101” a B CinemaScore.
Further down the charts was Briarcliff Entertainment’s sci-fi comedy “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” starring Sam Rockwell and Haley Lu Richardson. It made an estimated $3.6 million from 1,610 locations.
The Walt Disney Studios also celebrated a milestone this weekend, becoming the first studio to cross $1 billion at the global box office in 2026, driven almost entirely by “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” but also helped by the continued success of “Zootopia 2,” which remains in the top 10 after twelve weekends in theaters.

The UN says al-Hol camp population has dropped sharply as Syria moves to relocate remaining families
The U.N. refugee agency says residents are leaving Syria’s al-Hol camp in large numbers, and Syrian authorities plan to relocate those who remain
- Bookmark
The U.N. refugee agency said Sunday that a large number of residents of a camp housing family members of suspected Islamic State group militants have left and the Syrian government plans to relocate those who remain.
Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, UNHCR's representative in Syria, said in a statement that the agency “has observed a significant decrease in the number of residents in Al-Hol camp in recent weeks."
“Syrian authorities have informed UNHCR of their plan to relocate the remaining families to Akhtarin camp in Aleppo Governorate (province) and have requested UNHCR’s support to assist the population in the new camp, which we stand ready to provide,” he said.
He added that UNHCR “will continue to support the return and reintegration of Syrians who have departed Al-Hol, as well as those who remain.”
The statement did not say how residents had left the camp or how many remain. Many families are believed to have escaped either during the chaos when government forces captured the camp from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces last month or afterward.
There was no immediate statement from the Syrian government and a government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
At its peak after the defeat of IS in Syria in 2019, around 73,000 people were living at al-Hol. Since then, the number has declined with some countries repatriating their citizens. The camp’s residents are mostly children and women, including many wives or widows of IS members.
The camp’s residents are not technically prisoners and most have not been accused of crimes, but they have been held in de facto detention at the heavily guarded facility.
Forces of Syria’s central government captured the al-Hol camp on Jan. 21 during a weekslong offensive against the SDF, which had been running the camp near the border with Iraq for a decade. A ceasefire deal has since ended the fighting.
Separately, thousands of accused IS militants who were held in detention centers in northeastern Syria have been transferred to Iraq to stand trial under an agreement with the U.S.
The U.S. military said Friday that it had completed the transfer of more than 5,700 adult male IS suspects from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody.
Iraq’s National Center for International Judicial Cooperation said a total of 5,704 suspects from 61 countries who were affiliated with IS — most of them Syrian and Iraqi — were transferred from prisons in Syria. They are now being interrogated in Iraq.

Mikaela Shiffrin's giant slalom at Milan Cortina ended without a medal but plenty of optimism
Mikaela Shiffrin sees her 11th-place giant slalom at the Milan Cortina Olympics as proof she is back in the fight
- Bookmark
Mikaela Shiffrin stood at the start gate atop the giant slalom course at sun-splashed Tofane and made a promise to herself.
“I’m going to do this whole thing here,” she said.
Considering the path the American star has taken to reach the Milan Cortina Olympics, and to this event in particular, that was enough.
So while the leaderboard near the finish line during Sunday's GS needed to flip to the second page before Shiffrin's name appeared in 11th, the most decorated skier in the history of the sport didn't view her finish as a disappointment.
Disappointment is washing out, which she did four years ago in Beijing. Disappointment is wondering if the speed that once came so easily would ever return while recovering from a harrowing crash during a World Cup start in Killington, Vermont, in late 2024 that left her abdomen punctured and her confidence shaken.
What happened during what Shiffrin called “the greatest show of GS skiing we've had in a really long time” was not disappointment. If anything, it was the opposite.
Yes, Shiffrin finished outside the top 10. The way the snow felt underneath her skis and the razor-thin margin that separated the silver medalists from the chasing pack — there was no catching Italy's Federica Brignone on this day — offered evidence she's trending in the right direction heading into slalom, her best event, on Wednesday.
“To be here now like within touch of the fastest women, that’s huge for me,” Shiffrin said. “So I’m proud of that.”
The gap between Shiffrin and co-runners-up Sara Hector of Sweden and Thea Louise Stjernesund was an impossibly tight 0.3 seconds in a discipline that requires skiers to make two runs.
When Shiffrin won gold in the GS in Pyeongchang eight years ago, the gap between silver and 11th was around 1.4 seconds. Four years ago in Beijing, it was nearly 2 seconds. Three weeks ago at a World Cup event in Czechia, where Shiffrin earned her first podium in the GS in two years, it was over 3 1/2 seconds.
On Sunday, Shiffrin was right there. A turn here. A turn there. On a course that was a little flatter and a little less technically demanding that what Shiffrin and the rest of the best skiers in the world usually see — one almost explicitly designed to create a safe and ultracompetitive race — the difference between a medal and the middle was nearly imperceptible.
Shiffrin promised to “learn” after slogging down through the slalom in the women's combined last week, when her skis couldn't seem to “go.” Perhaps too aware of the perception of an Olympic slump — the Games are the only place she hasn't won in the last eight years — she did her best to refocus and block out the noise.
In her mind, she did just that. She could feel herself taking power from the course. As “Killing In The Name Of” by Rage Against the Machine blasted over the speakers during her second run, Shiffrin felt like she was in the moment and not in her head.
“It felt good to push, which was amazing,” she said, later adding: “It felt really good to ski high intensity.”
Shiffrin's intensity feels as if it is slowly but steadily ramping up. She wore bib No. 3, a nod to the fact she's back in the top 7 in the world in the GS, something she considered a “challenging task” when the season began. It's become doable, but Shiffrin has learned progress isn't linear.
While she continues to dominate slalom — in which she's already clinched her ninth World Cup series title with two races to go — GS is another matter. Sure, Shiffrin's 22 career GS victories are a record. But she hasn't won a GS race since late 2023.
Her climb back up the GS rankings has been fueled by consistency. The “lights-out speed” she knows is required to finish atop the podium doesn't come quite as easily as it did when she was at the peak of her powers. That's fine.
“The task ahead of me for the coming months (and) in the coming years is to try to bring that kind of intensity and fire and to continue to work with the team to find those hundredths (of a second) that it takes to actually win races,” she said.
That didn't happen under the snowcapped peaks of the Dolomites on Sunday. Maybe on another course, one with a more difficult setup that would allow her to lean in to her experience, things may have played out differently.
It's not a conversation Shiffrin seems particularly interested in having. The layout allowed for competitive racing. And she pointed to the medal stand — where the 35-year-old Brignone won her second gold in four days and Hector added silver to go with the gold she captured in Beijing in 2022 — as proof the results were not fluky.
“It wasn’t like somebody won who wasn’t supposed to win,” Shiffrin said.
Brignone emerged as a deserving champion. Behind her, however, was chaos. Shiffrin doesn't think that's a bad thing.
“(We were all) close and that’s how that’s how high the competition level, is I think,” she said. “That’s a beautiful show of our sport on an Olympic stage.”

US forces board second Venezuela‑linked oil tanker in Indian Ocean

US military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an effort to target illicit oil connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said on Sunday.
Venezuela had faced US sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. President Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure then president Nicolás Maduro before Maduro was apprehended in January during an American military operation.
Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The defense department said in a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding”.
“The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away,” the Pentagon said. “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.”
Video posted by the Pentagon shows US troops boarding the tanker.
The Veronica III is a Panamanian-flagged vessel under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the website of the Treasury department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on 3 January, the same day as Maduro’s capture, with nearly 2m barrels of crude and fuel oil, TankerTrackers.com posted Sunday on X.
“Since 2023, she’s been involved with Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil,” the organisation said.
Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, told The Associated Press in January that his organisation used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers left the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of Venezuela’s oil. The Pentagon did not say in the post whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under US control, and later told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond that post.
Last week, the US military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II. The ship was being held while its ultimate fate was decided by the United States, according to a defence official who spoke last week on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing decision-making.

UK considers new Russia sanctions after Navalny frog toxin finding

The UK is mulling fresh sanctions against Moscow after pinning blame on the Kremlin for the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Yvette Cooper has suggested.
The Foreign Office and four of the UK’s allies – Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands – announced on Saturday they had determined that Navalny’s death was most likely the result of poisoning using dart frog toxin arranged by the Russian state.
The Russian embassy in London has denied Moscow was involved in Navalny’s death two years ago in a Siberian penal colony and described the announcement as illustrating the “feeblemindedness of western fabulists”.
In a rebuke on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Cooper, the foreign secretary, said the accusation against Russia was “deeply serious” and a product of two years of evidence gathering.
She said: “Only the Russian regime had the means, the motive and the opportunity to administer this poison while he was in a Russian prison.”
Analysis of samples from Navalny’s body revealed the presence of a toxin called epibatidine, which is produced by dart frogs in South America. The UK and its allies said Navalny could not have ingested the poison accidentally as it is not found in Russia and is generally produced only by the frogs in the wild.
The five European nations have reported the Kremlin to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons after accusing Moscow of breaching its conventions.
Cooper said the incident showed that “the cold war peace dividend we all believed in and hoped for has gone, and we need to be ready for Russian aggression continuing towards Europe”.
She suggested further sanctions could follow, telling the BBC: “We continue to look at coordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime. As you know, we have been pursuing this as part of our response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, where we are also coming up to the fourth anniversary of that invasion as well.
“We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime.”
Noting that the government would also continue to provide military support to Ukraine and remain vigilant towards other different, hybrid threats, Cooper added: “The other thing that I would say, specifically about Alexei Navalny, is one of the things he said was ‘tell the truth, spread the truth’, because that is the most dangerous weapon of all.”
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Sunday that Washington had no reason to question the “troubling” conclusions of the five European allies.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” Rubio told reporters at a news conference in Bratislava during a visit to Slovakia.
When asked why the US had not joined the five countries in making a statement on their findings, Rubio said this was an endeavour by them. “Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. We chose – doesn’t mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn’t our endeavour. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing based on the intelligence they’ve gathered.”
He added: “We’re not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there.”
Elsewhere, the shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, warned of an “axis of authoritarianism” comprising Russia, China, North Korea and Iran faced by the UK and other western nations.
Speaking on Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme ahead of making a speech at the Munich Security Conference, the senior Conservative said the US remained a “natural ally” and partner for European powers.
A statement from the Russian embassy in London denied any involvement in Navalny’s death. It said: “There is no reason whatsoever to credit such ‘findings’ by western ‘experts’. As with the Skripal case, there are strident accusations, media hysteria, zero evidence, and a host of questions the accusers would rather ignore. So what was it in the end – poison derived from the skin of a South American frog or novichok?
“We have become accustomed to the feeblemindedness of western fabulists. One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog. Yet what truly shocks is the method now favoured by western politicians – necro-propaganda. This is not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace – a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign.”

Palestine: Israeli plan to register West Bank lands as 'state property' is 'de facto annexation'

The Palestinian Authority on Sunday warned that an Israeli government decision to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” amounts to a “de facto annexation” of the occupied territory and a violation of international law.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Wafa, the Authority said the Israeli move constitutes “a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions” and poses a threat to security and stability.
It described the measure as a “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian land” and an official launch of annexation plans aimed at consolidating the occupation through illegal settlement expansion.
It also constitutes “a termination of the signed agreements and clearly contradicts the resolutions of the UN Security Council, especially Resolution 2334, which considers all settlement activity in the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal.”
The Authority stressed that unilateral Israeli actions “would not confer legitimacy over Palestinian land and would not change the legal and historical status of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza as occupied territory under international law.”
It called on the international community, particularly the UN Security Council and the US administration, to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli measures and compel Tel Aviv to comply with international law to prevent further escalation.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61 percent of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its genocidal war in Gaza on October 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Israel approves new West Bank land policy, Palestinians decry ‘de-facto annexation’

The Israeli government on Sunday approved a new proposal to tighten Israeli control over the occupied West Bank and register large areas there as "state property," for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in a move Palestinians called "a de-facto annexation".
The public broadcaster KAN said the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
"The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030," Israel Hayom newspaper commented ahead of the government decision.
Palestinian Authority (PA) presidency rejected the cabinet's decision, saying it constitutes "a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity."
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
According to the paper, the main implication of the government decision is "the conversion of very large areas into state land, provided that no other ownership is proven."
"In this sense, even in the absence of a political decision to apply the law, Israel significantly strengthens its hold on the land by registering plots that are not owned by other parties in the land registry," it added.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
If approved, the Israeli government's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) will be responsible for organizing and registering land ownership in Area C.
The process includes issuing sale permits, collecting fees, and overseeing registration procedures, while preventing the Palestinian Authority from carrying out such tasks in those areas.
The move is part of a series of measures approved by Israel's Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv's control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel's civil administration.

Lindsey Vonn preparing to leave Italy after Olympics crash, says ski team chief

Lindsey Vonn is preparing to leave Italy one week after Winter Olympics crash, says U.S. Ski Team chief
Lindsey Vonn is preparing to return to the United States, the U.S. Ski Team's chief told The Associated Press on Sunday, saying the champion skier was getting ready to fly back home for further treatment after wiping out in the women's Olympic downhill competition last weekend.
Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, told the AP the team's medical staff has been coordinating Vonn's recovery since the crash and subsequent helicopter evacuation at the Milan Cortina Games and would try to accompany her home. Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
"We're working through all of that at the moment," Goldschmidt said. "We've got a great team around helping her and she'll go back to the U.S. for further surgeries."
Spectators tuning in to see Vonn attempt to win a medal at age 41 with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were thrown into shock when the American standout got hooked on a gate 13 seconds into her run — resulting in a spinning, air-born crash that sent her careening down the Dolomite mountain.
"The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury," said Goldschmidt, who was in attendance for the fall. "There's a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.
"I mean, putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes, actually on the broadcast, it's really hard to get that across," Goldschmidt added. "Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won't have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports."
Vonn said on Friday that she was expecting to have another surgery for the leg injury, which was slated to happen on Saturday. In a video shared to social media, Vonn told her followers that she could potentially return to the U.S. after that surgery if it went well. At that point, she had already undergone three surgeries since her crash.
But Vonn has no regrets about skiing in the 2026 Olympics.
"When I think back on my crash, I didn't stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences," Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. "I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.
"But just because I was ready, that didn't guarantee me anything. Nothing in life is guaranteed. That's the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don't try you'll never know," Vonn added.
Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, "She's not in pain. She's in a stable condition."
"She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way," Goldschmidt said. "But what she's done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they're winning."

Trump says Board of Peace members pledge $6b for Gaza, calls for ‘full and immediate’ disarmament of Hamas
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WEST PALM BEACH, Florida - US President Donald Trump on Feb 15 urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza, and said members of his so-called “Board of Peace”
“Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarisation,” Mr Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a Feb 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
Disarmament is a key part in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire plan sealed in October between Israel and the Palestinian militant group to end the war triggered by Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023.
The United Nations endorsed the plan in November.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilisation force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Both sides accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Although originally intended to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding, the charter for the “Board of Peace” does not seem to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
“The Board of Peace has unlimited potential,” Mr Trump said on Feb 15 in his post.
After an initial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
Countries have been asked to pay US$1 billion for permanent membership of the board, and the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine in 2022, has drawn criticism.
Key US allies including France and Britain have expressed doubts.
Mr Trump said the US$5 billion in pledges by member states would be formally announced then, and that members also “have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.”
Mr Trump has said the organisation will work “in conjunction” with the United Nations.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History,” he said.
Under the ceasefire plan, a Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up with a goal of taking over governance in the battered Gaza Strip. AFP

Gaza Board of Peace member nations "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force," United States President Donald Trump confirmed in a Truth Social post on Sunday.
The personnel are set to participate in a local police force that will, in collaboration with the International Stabilization Force, maintain security and peace for Gazans, he added.
In addition to personnel, board members have pledged over $5 billion to humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Gaza, Trump announced.
An official announcement regarding personnel and funding will be made during a board meeting scheduled for Thursday at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, he said.
The board, which Trump is chairman of, "has unlimited potential" and "will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History," he claimed.
Trump calls for Hamas disarmament
Trump added a call for Hamas to uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization.
Hamas's disarmament and demilitarization may begin as early as March, two sources involved in the board told KAN News on Saturday.
The implementation of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, a technocratic body tasked with governing the Gaza Strip, will kick off the disarmament process.

Criticism without a platform, the problem with Bennett’s return - opinion
Unknown

01:12:32 KST

As Israel moves toward elections that could shape the country’s trajectory for years to come, one striking feature of the political landscape stands out: not the intensity of debate, but the absence of substantive policy discussion at its center. This void is especially evident in the emerging campaign of former prime minister Naftali Bennett.
No one doubts that Bennett is an intelligent and accomplished individual. He has succeeded in business and worked his way, impressively, through the political system. Yet his political re-entry has been framed almost entirely around opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the man, rather than to his policies. While Bennett has criticized the lack of a State Commission of Inquiry and the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) draft issue, substantive policy proposals have largely been absent.
Criticism of a sitting prime minister can be legitimate and even necessary. But criticism alone is not a governing platform. Leadership begins where critique ends and responsibility begins. To date, Bennett has offered little clarity about what he would actually do if entrusted once again with power.
Rather than advancing a coherent agenda on security, the economy, housing, judicial reform, or governance, Bennett’s campaign has leaned heavily on sharp rhetoric and personal attacks. This approach may generate attention, but it does not amount to a serious roadmap for Israel’s future. A public grappling with war, economic pressure, and deep social strain deserves more than slogans and rhetorical flourishes.
That tone was on full display in early February, when Bennett mocked Netanyahu’s response to the state comptroller, likening the prime minister to “Forrest Gump.” However biting such metaphors may be, ridicule is not a substitute for strategy: It offers no answers to the complex challenges Israel faces. For someone who openly broke a major public campaign promise in the past, it is striking that attacks on character and truthfulness would be the strategy he now chooses to pursue.
Bennett’s policy ambiguity, opportunistic alliances
More revealing than the rhetoric is what remains unsaid. Bennett has yet to articulate clear positions on several of the most consequential issues confronting the country. There is no detailed proposal for post-war governance in Gaza, no articulated framework for long-term security control, and no clear vision for rebuilding deterrence while managing international pressure.
On the economic front, he has offered little guidance on tax reform, cost-of-living relief, or how to address the growing burden on Israel’s productive middle class, including the hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers who dropped everything over the past two years to fight for their country. Similarly absent is a concrete plan for Judea and Samaria, an area that once stood at the core of his political identity.
This lack of policy definition has been accompanied by an increasing willingness to engage in ad hoc political alliances. Once regarded as a consistent figure within the national camp, Bennett now signals openness to partnerships that appear driven more by coalition arithmetic than by shared principles. Tactical pragmatism, untethered from a clearly articulated worldview, risks sliding into opportunism.
His repeated overtures toward figures such as Yair Golan underscore this concern. Golan represents an ideological outlook fundamentally at odds with Bennett’s past positions. He continues to champion a two-state solution rooted in the Oslo framework, has publicly disparaged residents of Judea and Samaria, and has made controversial statements regarding Israel’s soldiers and the role of religion in Israeli society. These views stand in sharp contrast to the values Bennett once championed, yet they no longer appear to pose a barrier to political cooperation.
This approach is not merely theoretical. Bennett has even floated the idea of appointing Golan as energy minister in a future government. The remark, delivered casually, suggested a view of governance in which ministerial portfolios are treated as bargaining chips rather than as serious responsibilities. Israel’s political history offers ample evidence of the costs of appointments driven by coalition convenience rather than merit. The Energy Ministry oversees strategic assets central to Israel’s economic strength and geopolitical standing. It is not a portfolio for improvisation.
The same standard applies across government. Finance, defense, health, and internal security are not ceremonial roles. They demand leadership grounded in knowledge, experience, and judgment. A campaign that treats these responsibilities lightly offers a preview of how its candidate would govern.
At its core, Bennett’s challenge is not stylistic but structural. A campaign defined primarily by negation leaves little room for coherent policy development. In the absence of clear principles, alliances become transactional and governance risks becoming reactive rather than strategic.
Many Israelis recognize that the country must move forward from the current government and its divisive model. They are seeking an alternative that places at its center those who work, serve, pay taxes, and shoulder shared national responsibility.
But Israel deserves better than a campaign built on negation. It deserves a leadership conversation focused on real choices: security doctrine, economic reform, governance, and national resilience. The question voters must ask is not whether Naftali Bennett can criticize Benjamin Netanyahu – we already know he can. The real question is whether he has demonstrated the clarity, competence, and governing vision required to lead a country facing historic challenges.
So far, that answer remains absent.

Religious Zionism is under attack in Israel - opinion
Unknown

Anybody reading the secular or the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) press in recent months knows that the Religious Zionist sector is under attack from both opposing sides of the political spectrum. And anybody reading the religious and right-wing press in recent months knows that the Religious Zionist sector is also tearing itself apart.
The issue at hand is the draft exemption law for the haredi world, which is being debated in the Knesset.
Obviously, the Religious Zionist public and political and rabbinic figures associated with it are broadly supportive of efforts to draw haredi men into national and military service. The debate is over how demanding to be in the intent to draft haredi men, how fierce a draft law – or how weak a draft exemption law – to pass, and whether to risk the current and possibly future nationalist-haredi coalition governments over this matter.
I am strongly in favor of forcing real societal change through tough sanctions on the haredi world, which refuses to participate in the privilege of national security service – although I understand those who fear the shattering of the political Right if haredi leaders are pushed harder.
What I cannot tolerate is the demonizing of the Religious Zionist public in this debate – especially the savaging of brave Religious Zionist women, wives, and mothers of courageous soldiers – who have led campaigns for the passage of an effective and enforceable haredi draft law.
Devoted military service
No sector in Israeli society has “carried the burden” of the past two years of war with more devoted military service, and alas with more casualties, than the Religious Zionists.
This assessment was borne out in a first-of-its-kind detailed academic study published last month. Writing in The Israeli Journal of Society, Military, and National Security (published by the Maarachot think-tank of the Defense Ministry and The Association of Civil-Military Studies in Israel), Dr. Roe Naon and Prof. Uzi Ben-Shalom assert that the Religious Zionist sector suffered four times the losses of any other in Israel.
The authors studied the conscript and reserve units serving in the Israel-Hamas War (Swords of Iron) as well as the rolls of wounded and fallen soldiers.
They found that 257 fallen soldiers, equaling 34 percent of all soldiers killed in the war, were “religious” Israelis; way beyond the less-than-10% of the overall public that identifies as “dati.” Again, the losses among the religious soldiers are four times larger than the size of this community within the broader Israeli public, and 2.5 times larger than the size of this community in relation to men of draft age.
Among reserve soldiers, religious men account for a whopping 45% of the casualties in this war. They are 29% of the casualties among soldiers in the standing army, and 27% of those in the professional army ranks.
Among junior officers in the military, religious soldiers account for 43% of the fallen. Among non-commissioned officers (NCOs), religious soldiers are 41% of the fallen. Among infantry-based NCOs, religious soldiers make up 30% of the fallen.
In the units most implicated in frontline, heavy combat, namely in the engineering, armored, and infantry corps, over one-third of the fallen are religious soldiers.
Additionally, a preponderance of these fallen religious soldiers hail from Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, and peripheral towns in Israel – where many religious Jews live – as well as from the lower socioeconomic strata of Israeli society.
In summary, the authors of the study note the high degree of ideological, communal, familial, and national commitment of the Religious Zionist sector to the military defense of Israel, and the great emphasis on “national unity” and the “privilege” of serving the country that marks this sector.
All of this accounts for the disproportionate share of fallen and wounded soldiers in this sector of Israeli society.
What Naon and Ben-Shalom have not yet studied are the large families that these religious soldiers often have – especially reservists – and the deep, disrupting, and traumatizing impact that long military service, wounding, and death have had on very many religious families.
All the more ugly
This reality, both heroic and bone-chilling, makes the current attacks on Religious Zionists all the more ugly.
It is bad enough that some radical secular leftists accuse Religious Zionists of uber-nationalism (calling them “messianic” or “bloodthirsty”), while the defeatist policies of the Left ever since Oslo have led Israel to disaster.
And it is bad enough that haredi leaders accuse Religious Zionists of “abandoning Torah values,” while haredi indifference to the suffering and national burden of all other Israelis is the very opposite of Torah values.
But it is outrageous and infuriating to witness the savage attacks on brave women like Noa Mevorah and Shvut Raanan of Shutafim LaSheirut (Partners in Service: Religious Women in Favor of IDF Service).
They are being called “traitors” and “useful idiots of the Left” for their outspoken, principled advocacy of strong haredi draft legislation.
These are women whose husbands and sons have collectively served thousands of days of tough military duty, and they have every right to demand a sea change in the “contract” between the serving Israeli public and the mostly non-serving haredi public.
They are now facing an avalanche of delegitimizing ads and digital posts across a broad swath of right-wing and religious newspapers (such as B’Sheva), magazines circulated in synagogues (like Olam Katan and dozens of other haredi publications), and broadcast platforms, notably Channel 14.
The attacks have broadened to include assaults on all religious women who do “only” national service and on religious men who do “only” hesder service (program for religious men, alternating yeshiva study with active IDF service and long and intensive years of frontline reserve duty).
Netanyahu’s coalition
Alas, the unifying theme behind these attacks appears to be slavish devotion to the principle of “Thou shalt not harm Netanyahu’s coalition,” while downplaying the overarching moral demand for equalizing military service responsibilities at the historic inflexion point now before Israeli society.
Unfortunately, a “hardal” coalition of 40 rabbis (composed of community rabbis and yeshiva deans within Religious Zionism who tend toward haredi ideology and religious practice) this week joined the fracas against Shutafim LaSheirut and in support of Religious Zionist Party leader Betzalel Smotrich – who is leaning toward adoption of the current draft evasion law concocted by Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chair Boaz Bismuth.
They bury the real ideological and political questions of the day under a blanket of smarmy niceties about “brotherly love” for the haredi public. They glibly term opposition to draft-evasion legislation as a “trap” caused by “troublemakers” meant to bring down the current right-wing government.
They furthermore make the nonsensical assertion that the proposed legislation will indeed help draft many haredi soldiers – “three times as many haredi soldiers.” (Three times what? The current number of near-zero.)
And, in a further insult to our intelligence, these narrow-minded rabbis aver that the Bismuth bill will “ease the burden on reservists,” including, supposedly, the many Religious Zionist reservists whose communities they helm – although even the most ardent advocates of the bill do not make this ridiculous claim.
It will take decades of effective haredi draft until a mass of combat soldiers is sufficiently absorbed and trained enough to lead to a real easing of the reservist burden.
As a deeply religious Zionist myself, even an unabashed “messianist,” I too seek brotherly love and unity but not at the expense of ideological distortions, false narratives, and malicious defamation.

Reform by-election candidate described Nigel Farage’s economic plans as ‘utterly toxic combination’
Exclusive: It comes after The Independent revealed that Matt Goodwin called for ‘young girls’ to be given ‘biological reality’ check

The Reform candidate in an upcoming Westminster by-election once described his party’s economic plans as an “utterly toxic combination”.
Matt Goodwin said that he “cannot stress enough how UNPOPULAR slashing taxes and cutting spending on public services is” in a post on LinkedIn three years ago.
The former academic was pointing to polling from the highly-respected British Social Attitudes survey that showed that reducing both was backed by just 6 per cent of the public as he denounced it as an “utterly toxic combination”.
In November, Nigel Farage said his party “will cut spending” and “we want to cut taxes”. Last month he doubled down, saying: “We are going to reduce excessive government spending”.
Mr Goodwin hit the headlines last week after The Independent revealed he had called for women and young girls to be given a “biological reality” check as he warned of an impending “fertility crisis”.
This publication also revealed that he had previously suggested people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment and warned that “many women in Britain are having children much too late in life”.
The polling cited by Mr Goodwin, who is standing for Reform UK in the Gorton and Denton by-election at the end of this month, also showed more than 50 per cent of the public wanted taxes and spending to increase, while 40 per cent wanted them to remain the same.
In a speech last year, Mr Farage said “substantial tax cuts” were not realistic at the current moment “given the dire state” of the country’s finances but said that his party would raise the threshold at which workers start to pay tax and scrap Labour’s ‘family farm’ inheritance tax changes.
However, he rowed back from his party’s 2024 election promise to cut £90bn of taxes, which the leading economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Reform had failed to set out how they would achieve.
Last month Mr Farage also told an event in Davos that he thought “the one big lesson of the Liz Truss- Kwasi Kwarteng Budget is that they did not propose to cut spending. So for our programme to work, what we absolutely have to tell people that we are going to reduce welfare spending, we are going to reduce excessive government spending.”
A Labour party spokesperson said: “Matt Goodwin’s comments show that it’s not just Labour saying Reform’s economic plans are ludicrous – their own candidate thinks so too.
“Reform UK offers nothing but a return to austerity, enacted by a party stuffed full of the same Tories that broke our public services in the first place.”
A Reform spokesman told The Independent: “Labour’s campaign in Gorton and Denton truly must be on the ropes if they have had to resort to polling analysis by Matt from three years ago when the economy was in a much different place.
“We will take no lectures from a party under whose watch the economy has tanked. By voting Reform the voters of Gorton and Denton can get Keir Starmer out and help bring an end to this failed Labour government.”

Israel resumes contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
Israel is resuming a land registration process in the occupied West Bank that critics say can shift large areas into state control
- Bookmark
Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in the country gaining control over wide swaths of the area for future development, according to a government decision on Sunday.
The decision paves the way for the resumption of “settlement of land title” processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Mideast War in 1967. It means that when Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership.
“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. Area C refers to the 60 per cent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians.
The decision is the latest step to deepen Israeli control over the West Bank. In recent months, Israel has greatly expanded construction of Jewish settlements, legalised outposts and made significant bureaucratic changes to its policies in the territory to strengthen its hold and weaken the Palestinian Authority.
Sunday’s decision was first announced last May but required further development before it was approved in this week’s Cabinet meeting.
Under the decision, Israeli authorities will announce certain areas to undergo registration, which will force anyone who has a claim to the land to prove their ownership.
Ms Ofran said the process for proving ownership can be “draconian” and is rarely transparent, meaning any land that undergoes the registration process in areas currently owned by Palestinians is likely to revert to Israeli state control.
“Palestinians will be sent to prove ownership in a way that they will never be able to do,” Ms Ofran told The Associated Press. “And this way Israel might take over 83 per cent of Area C, which is about half of the West Bank.”
The registration process could start as soon as this year, she said.
The proposal had been put forward by some of Israel’s far-right members of the ruling coalition, including the justice minister Yariv Levin. “The government of Israel is committed to strengthening its grip on all its parts, and this decision is an expression of that commitment,” he said.
Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas’ office in a statement called the decision “a grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law”, which amounts to “de facto annexation.” It called on the international community, especially the UN Security Council and the United States, to intervene immediately.
Previous US administrations have sharply condemned an expansion of Israeli activity and control in the West Bank, but prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a particularly close relationship with Donald Trump. The two met last week in Washington, their seventh meeting in the past year.
And yet Mr Trump has opposed annexation, Ms Ofran noted.
Palestinians are not permitted to sell land privately to Israelis, though measures announced last week aim to nullify this. Currently, settlers can buy homes on land controlled by Israel’s government. Last week's decision also aimed to expand Israeli enforcement of several aspects of in the West Bank, including environmental and archaeological matters in Palestinian-administered areas.
More than 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 from Jordan and sought by the Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Over 300,000 Palestinians are estimated to live in Area C of the West Bank, with many more in surrounding communities dependent on its agricultural and grazing lands, including plots for which families retain land deeds or tax records dating back decades.

Offer to join Trump’s new era is met with growing sense of European steeliness

If JD Vance’s thuggish speech last year to the Munich Security Conference directed at the solar plexus of Europe marked the moment when a transatlantic break up started, this weekend’s subsequent event, in a rainy and cold Bavaria, was where the debate about the terms of the divorce settlement got under way.
Marco Rubio, the chosen Washington representative this year, is a diplomat, so he softened the Trumpian tone with references to German beer, the Beatles, Dante and the Mayflower. But his speech remained a stern warning that if Europe wanted to continue on its path of civilisational decline, as this US administration sees it, America will not be interested and has different hemispheres on which to focus.
“Yesterday is over”, he said, and then spelt out what yesterday meant. Mass migration threatening the civilisational erasure and the continuity of Christian culture, unfettered trade, massive welfare states, weak defences, climate cults, the outsourcing of sovereignty to international institutions, the rationalisation of a broken status quo by people “shackled with guilt and shame”. Unlike Vance, he did not laud rightwing European populist parties, but he nonetheless wrapped himself in their ideology. His next stop after Munich was Budapest where Viktor Orbán faces a battle in April to remain in power.
And yet there were some, like the organiser of the conference, the distinguished German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, that claimed to be reassured by the conditional offer to join this journey into a new era with Donald Trump. If Europeans were reassured by Rubio, it was, as Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, observed, “a classic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations”. One reference by the US secretary of state to his country being “a child of Europe” and the older romantics of transatlanticism melted.
But that was not the dominant European mood at this sprawling conference. An iron has entered the European soul about Trump, egged on by the many Democrats attending, and there is a willingness if not to confront him then at least to end the dependence and learn the lessons of the standoff over Greenland.
Talk of a stronger independent European pillar of Nato was heard repeatedly, and even adopted by Keir Starmer in his speech pledging greater integration on defence with Europe. His Valentine’s Day speech to Europe was remarkable for two other reasons. He declared the Brexit era was over and, unlike Rubio, he praised societal diversity and a Britain where “people who look different to each other can live peacefully together”. So much for Rubio’s risk of civilisational erasure.
But the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz – who is due to go to China in April – said the era of US hegemony was coming to an end, and more quickly than many thought if the US believed it could act alone. “We don’t believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. And we stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we are convinced that we can only solve global challenges together,” he said.
Merz signalled Berlin is already preparing for a smaller American footprint in Europe, and that Germany may at times diverge from the US. “We Europeans are taking precautions. In doing so, we arrive at different conclusions than the administration in Washington,” he said.
The dispute over Ukraine and Trump’s leniency towards Vladimir Putin still appals much of Europe and is at the centre of what is driving Trump and leaders on the continent apart. It was an American, Hillary Clinton, who expressed the anger best: “The effort that Putin and Trump are making to profit off the misery and death of the Ukrainian people is a historic error and corrupt to the nth degree … He’s betrayed the west. He’s betrayed human values.”
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, now a leading contributor to European defence technology, said, “war reveals forms of evil we did not expect” and asked why he felt it was Ukraine and not Russia being asked by Trump to make the concessions. He admitted he felt keenly the mistake of Europe’s absence at the negotiating table.
Radoslaw Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, further made the point. He said it was natural for the US to take the lead in the negotiations when it was providing the bulk of the military assistance. “But we are now paying for this war. The US outlay for the war last year was close to zero. We are buying the weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. There is no prospect of a package in Congress. If we are paying, and it is affecting our security and not just Ukraine’s, we deserve a seat at the table.”
Ursula von der Leyen, the EU Commission president rebuked the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, for telling Europe to dream on if it thought it could defend itself without the US.
At one level, the US and Europe vehemently agree that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own conventional defence. Elbridge Colby, the deputy secretary for war, and the nearest thing the Trump administration has to a theoretician, said: “People get it, 2025 was the year to reframe and reorient, and now we have a lot of buy-in. Look at what Germany has been doing with a massive increase in spending.”
But what the US and Europe have only started to debate is what this more independent Europe will be permitted to do by the US. For the moment an interregnum exists.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in a speech that lost some impact owing to its late scheduling, was the one who spelt out the wider consequences of Europe becoming its own protector. With new responsibilities came new rights, some of which Trump may dislike.
Not only did Europe deserve a place at the Ukraine negotiating table, since it was Europe’s existential challenge, it had a right to speak to Putin directly apart from the US. Ideally, the US should be weaned off its belief that a just deal is acceptable in the short term.
In any negotiations about what may replace the collapsed arms control agreements with Russia, Europe could not again be a bystander while the US unilaterally withdrew from agreements such as the INF treaty. He learned of the US withdrawal from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in the newspapers, as did all allies, Macron complained.
He argued that, to be credible at such a negotiation, Europe needed better deep strike capacities to match those of Russia. European defence firms should not be brow beaten into buying US military hardware. “We will be credible only if we are able to procure and produce what we need, without foreign strings attached.”
Europe could strengthen its own rules on tech and AI. It would be “crazy” if free speech meant giving “the mind, the brain, the heart of my teenagers to the algorithm of big guys with whom I’m not totally sure I share their values”.
Above all, Macron, Merz and Starmer referenced the deeply sensitive discussions on which they are to embark as to how France and the UK could make their nuclear deterrents available to Europe, thus reducing the need for the US nuclear umbrella. It is a hugely expensive and politically fraught undertaking.
Merz made a brief but deliberate reference to the initial talks he had held with Macron, and in an article for Foreign Affairs said he hoped to agree the first concrete steps this year. Macron was also an enthusiast, pointing to the cooperation with Britain. If European sovereignty ever extends this far it will make the US uncomfortable. But it is a sign of the times that it is on the agenda. Yesterday is truly over.

Group of European countries express support for talks on joint nuclear deterrent – Politico
According to Ukrinform, Politico stated this in an article.
Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said that Riga is ready to participate in such discussions. She stated that nuclear deterrence could provide new opportunities and asked, "Why not?" while warning that any steps must comply with "our international commitments."
Estonia's Deputy Minister of Defense Tuuli Duneton indicated that her country does not rule out joining early-stage negotiations on a European joint nuclear deterrent.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron addressed European nuclear deterrence in speeches at the Munich Security Conference. Macron emphasized the need to rearticulate nuclear deterrence, taking into account the use of conventional weapons such as long-range missiles.
Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze stated that "Nuclear deterrence is a prominent subject" at this year's conference.
Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken also participated in a closed discussion on the subject during the conference.
According to two European officials, European countries could theoretically help support France's nuclear capability by providing conventional military assets such as submarines. Sources added that Paris may also consider expanding its nuclear arsenal with subsidies from other countries.
As previously reported, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius believes that Europe must assume significantly greater responsibility for the conventional defense of the continent while maintaining U.S. strategic and nuclear support.

Polish president speaks in favor of Poland having nuclear weapons

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Polish President Karol Nawrotski has said that Poland should seek to possess nuclear weapons.
"I am an advocate of Poland joining the nuclear project. This path, taking into account all international rule, is the oath we should opt for," he said in an interview with the Polsat television channel.
He stressed that he supports any strengthening of Poland’s security, "even on the basis of nuclear capacities."
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said earlier that the Polish government is not discussing stationing nuclear weapons on the country's territory. The country’s former President (2015-2025) Andrzej Duda repeatedly advocated for deploying American nuclear weapons in Poland.
In the spring of 2025, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that Poland would strive to gain access to the most modern types of weapons, including nuclear weapons, backing French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea to extend the French "nuclear umbrella" to other European countries.

Israeli cabinet approves West Bank land registration, Palestinians condemn 'de-facto annexation'
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
JERUSALEM, Feb 15 - Israel's cabinet on Sunday approved further measures to tighten Israel's control over the occupied West Bank and make it easier for settlers to buy land, in a move Palestinians called "a de-facto annexation".
The West Bank is among the territories that the Palestinians seek for a future independent state. Much of it is under Israeli military control, with limited Palestinian self-rule in some areas run by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA).
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing an election later this year, deems the establishment of any Palestinian state a security threat.
His ruling coalition includes many pro-settler members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, land captured in the 1967 Middle East war to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties.
Ministers voted in favour of beginning a process of land registration for the first time since 1967.
"We are continuing the revolution of settlement and strengthening our hold across all parts of our land," said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right member of Netanyahu's government.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said land registration was a vital security measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for Israel in the area to protect its citizens and safeguard national interests.
The cabinet said in a statement registration was an "appropriate response to illegal land registration processes promoted by the Palestinian Authority," and would end disputes.
The PA presidency rejected the cabinet's decision, saying it constitutes "a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity."
U.S. President Donald Trump has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but his administration has not sought to curb Israel's accelerated settlement building, which the Palestinians say denies them a potential state by eating away at its territory.
The United Nations' highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible. Israel disputes this view, saying it has historical and biblical ties to the land.
The land registration adds to a series of measures taken earlier this month to expand control. REUTERS

US not leaving NATO, stronger European defence makes alliance more powerful: Rubio

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed speculation about Washington leaving NATO, arguing stronger European defence capabilities would enhance rather than weaken the alliance.
"We're not leaving NATO. We're not leaving ... We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," Rubio told reporters on Sunday alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.
He criticised narratives suggesting that asking European allies to contribute more equates to American abandonment of the alliance.
"Every time we say this, people go crazy. They think that means you're going to abandon NATO, you're going to abandon your allies," Rubio said, clarifying: "The point we're making is that the stronger our allies are, the stronger we are collectively."
He emphasised Washington does not view increased European military capability as threatening to US influence but rather as a necessary partnership evolution.
"We are not threatened or feel that it's hostile to see NATO grow in its own capabilities, not independent of the United States, in conjunction with the United States," he said.
‘US wants to be Europe’s partner’
He rejected the notion that Europe should remain dependent on American protection, saying: "We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner."
"We don't think it's a negative thing that other countries have more influence in NATO," Rubio added.
He also emphasised the Trump administration's focus on Central Europe. "We are going to show in the weeks and months and years to come that under President (Donald) Trump, this administration is going to make not just Slovakia but Central Europe a key component of how we engage the continent and the world," he said.
"When the national interest of the United States, for example, and the national interest of Slovakia are aligned, this is an extraordinary opportunity for cooperation," he said, noting the US is "very happy" with Slovakia's selection of the F-16 program to strengthen its air force. "We hope you'll consider some others as well ... that we can work together on."

‘Adopt a Statue’ program for Milan’s iconic Duomo restores centuries-old marbles
A restored 15th-century Duomo statue is now on public display in Milan through a donor-backed loan program
- Bookmark
A 15th-century statue that once stood outside Milan’s iconic Duomo has found a new home.
The Bearded Saint with Book was recently restored under the “Adopt a Statue” program, launched in 2020 by the centuries-old institution that oversees the cathedral’s conservation. As of Feb. 13, it is on display at Piazzale Cadorna, behind a glass window at the headquarters of FNM, a Lombardy-based transport company.
The program recruits donors — either companies or individuals — to fund restoration of a statue under a loan agreement that allows it to occasionally be displayed outside the Duomo.
“The uniqueness of this project is that statues that would otherwise remain in our deposits are restored and brought back to their original beauty,” the program’s project manager, Elisa Mantia, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “In that way, they can continue to tell the story of the Duomo even in places that are far from the monument.”
These agreements are in some cases granted for an initial one-year term and may be renewed. The initiative follows previous fundraising campaigns in which donors could adopt gargoyles or spires in exchange for inclusion in the Duomo’s donor register, where contributors’ names are recorded as part of the cathedral’s long history of support.
From storage to public display
The construction of the Duomo began in 1386, under the rule of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then lord of Milan, in collaboration with the city’s archbishop. The cathedral was built on the site of two preexisting basilicas and its completion took more than five centuries. One of its bronze doors was not installed until 1965.
Because construction spanned centuries, the Duomo’s statues were carved by artists from different regions and periods, resulting in a monument that reads as a timeline of evolving artistic styles.
The Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which oversees the cathedral’s conservation, has sought funding to restore statues removed over the centuries for maintenance or safety reasons.
“Culture can save the world,” Andrea Gibelli, president of FNM, said during a press conference on Feb. 13 to mark the unveiling of Bearded Saint with Book. “We want to spread the cultural riches we are fortunate to have, which are often overlooked or not fully appreciated."
Other sculptures adopted under the program by different sponsors have included a 16th-century David, a depiction of Samson and the Lion, and a statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle.
While the number of adopted statues isn't disclosed and not all are displayed in public spaces, Mantia said that her institution has preselected around 30 sculptures as eligible for restoration. Each case must be authorized by Italy’s cultural heritage authorities, as the process involves a formal loan agreement subject to conservation, insurance and transport regulations.
“We usually select them because they are very beautiful and not so damaged that they would be unsafe to loan,” Mantia said.
Once a donor reaches out, experts like Mantia accompany them to the Duomo’s storage facilities to choose a sculpture. After it is selected, restoration typically takes between one and three months.
Centuries-old marble
Bearded Saint with a Book was originally displayed outdoors. Aside from a black crust from air pollution on its surface, it had no structural damages preventing its loan.
“This often involves only surface finishing or an intervention with compresses or mechanical cleaning,” Mantia said.
The marble used for both the statues and the Duomo itself comes from the quarries of Candoglia in Italy’s Piedmont region. The same stone has been used since the late 14th century, under the supervision of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo.
“Beyond being the symbol of Milan, the Duomo is also a symbol of its history,” Mantia said. “It is a monument that grew together with the city, that tells within itself, in its statues and in the style with which it is decorated, the entire history of the city.”

In another ceasefire violation, Israeli soldiers cross UN-demarcated border into Lebanon
Israeli drone crashes near town of Houla, says Lebanese media
BEIRUT, Lebanon / ISTANBUL
Israeli army soldiers crossed the border into southern Lebanon on Sunday, marking a new violation of a ceasefire agreement in place since November 2024, local media reported.
The state-run National News Agency said two Israeli military vehicles stopped at the southern border, with several soldiers crossing the UN-demarcated Blue Line, a de facto border, into the area of Darb al-Hawrat, southeast of the town of Mays al-Jabal, before withdrawing to the other side of the border.
In a separate development, an Israeli drone crashed near the town of Houla in southern Lebanon, with no further details given.
Israeli ceasefire violations have killed and wounded hundreds of Lebanese, while Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
Israel began military operations against Lebanon in October 2023 against the backdrop of the Gaza war and escalated them into a full-scale war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people and wounding about 17,000 others.
Lebanese officials have repeatedly called for pressure on Tel Aviv to halt its attacks and abide by the ceasefire, while Hezbollah has affirmed on more than one occasion its commitment to the truce, calling for withdrawal from the areas occupied by Israel during the last war.

Rubio visits central Europe to bolster ties with pro-Trump leaders

BUDAPEST, Feb 15 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio vowed to deepen cooperation with central Europe on Sunday as he kicked off a trip to Slovakia and Hungary, whose conservative leaders have warm ties with President Donald Trump.
In Slovakia, which, like Hungary, relies on Russian oil and gas and has uneasy relations with the rest of the European Union, Rubio discussed energy and defence with Prime Minister Robert Fico and President Peter Pellegrini.
It was the first visit in seven years by a U.S. secretary of state to the country of 5.5 million people that borders Ukraine.
"Under President Trump, this administration is going to make not just Slovakia but central Europe a key component of how we engage the continent and the world," Rubio said.
"We are not just going to engage in meetings and pleasantries, but in concrete actions that we will take together in ways that are beneficial to your people and our people."
RUBIO COMBINED CRITICISM OF EUROPE WITH MESSAGE OF UNITY
On Saturday Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, delivered a message of unity at the Munich Security Conference while maintaining the administration's criticism of Europe following a scarring year for Transatlantic ties.
Trump's criticism of Europe, imposition of tariffs on EU countries and his ambition to acquire Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark have prompted Western European leaders to increasingly look at carving an independent path.
"We expect every country in the world to act in their national interest. That is what countries are supposed to do," Rubio said. "When our national interests are aligned ... this is an extraordinary opportunity for cooperation and partnership."
Fico, who has said the European Union is in "deep crisis", visited Trump last month in Florida and showered the Republican president with praise, saying he would bring peace.
Both Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom Rubio will meet on Monday in the second leg of his trip, have been accused by EU institutions of weakening the judiciary, media and anti-corruption enforcement.
They have also maintained ties with Moscow, criticised and at times delayed the imposition of EU sanctions on Russia and opposed sending military aid to Ukraine.
ORBAN MEETING ON MONDAY
In remarks before departing Washington on Thursday, Rubio said Trump is very supportive of Orban, who is trailing in most polls ahead of an election in April when he could be voted out of power.
Orban, one of Trump's closest allies in Europe, is considered by many on the American hard-right as a model for the U.S. president's tough policies on immigration and support for Christian conservatism.
Budapest has repeatedly hosted Conservative Political Action Conference events, which bring together conservative activists and leaders, with another due in March.
While other European Union countries secured alternative energy supplies after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, including by buying U.S. natural gas, Slovakia and Hungary have continued to buy Russian gas and oil, a practice the U.S. has criticised. Rubio said this would be discussed during his brief tour.
On nuclear cooperation, Slovakia signed an agreement with the United States last month.
Fico said he hoped an agreement with U.S.-based Westinghouse could be signed by next year that would lead to a consortium that will build a new nuclear power plant in Slovakia by 2040. He added that Slovakia wants to buy four more F-16 fighter jets.
Hungary and Slovakia have raised defence spending to 2% of GDP, less than some others and still far off the 5% of GDP by 2035 agreed by NATO last year after pressure from Trump. Fico said Bratislava was aware it needed to raise its military capabilities and was working on it.
Fico has diverged from Washington in one area, when he criticised the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early January. When asked about the issue at the news conference, Rubio shrugged off the difference of opinion.
"A lot of countries didn't like what we did in Venezuela. That's okay. That was in our national interest ... So what? That doesn't mean we're not going to be friends," Rubio said. REUTERS

Nature reconsidered: why it's making us anxious

Nature reconsidered: why it's making us anxious
February 15, 2026Strolling in a forest, nurturing a garden or even just looking at rolling green hills are interactions with nature that are often seen as a balm for the soul.
There is even a word for the love of nature: biophilia. At the other end of the spectrum is biophobia — the fear of nature.
It might traditionally be used to describe fear of large predators or phobias of spiders, snakes and other poisonous or dangerous creatures.
But in recent years, researchers have been observing biophobia of entirely different proportions.
A team at Sweden's Lund University analyzed almost 200 studies on the relationship between humans and nature.
The result: our relationship with nature seems to be deteriorating.
Many humans no longer have everyday contact with nature
Johan Kjellberg Jensen from Lund University, who led the overview study, said it reveals a clear link between a negative relationship with nature and a growing trend toward urban living.
And that could have impacts down the line, according to Jensen.
"Today, the majority of the world's population lives in cities, which means that future generations could be at increased risk of biophobia," he told DW.
Science has been observing people's alienation from nature since the late 1970s. That's according to Berlin psychologist Dirk Stemper, whose research interests include anxiety management and personal development.
This applies mainly to industrialized nations.
"Children are increasingly growing up in highly sealed, non-natural environments and spend most of their time indoors and in digital environments," he said. "There is a lack of physical and sensory experiences, such as climbing, getting dirty or observing animals."
What happens when nature becomes unfamiliar?
But it is precisely these kinds of experiences that build familiarity with nature — familiarity that psychologist Lea Dohm says is important in terms of planetary stewardship.
"The willingness to stand up for environmental, nature and climate protection is greater when we experience ourselves as connected to nature," said Dohm, who is a member of the German Alliance for Climate Change and Health (KLUG).
Jensen added that the idea of soil being "dirty" and earthworms being "disgusting" can be passed down from one generation to the next.
"If parents have negative attitudes towards nature, that can influence their children, which can then lead to a downward spiral of [less and less] closeness to nature," he said.
Stemper adds that when children are repeatedly told to "be careful of ticks" or not to touch certain things, they are likely to view nature as a place of danger.
Helping people to reconnect with nature
Environmental educator Susanne Sigl has also experienced this.
She works at Querwaldein, a non-profit organization in the German city of Cologne aimed at instilling a positive relationship with nature in people, especially children.
"When we ask children to collect long branches in the forest, some only touch them reluctantly, others even use a handkerchief and some don't touch them at all and don't bring any," she says.
According to Sigl, many children won't touch pinecones or chestnuts, prefering to just look at them. They are even less likely to touch earthworms or harmless insects such as small beetles.
The Lund University team also found that a fear of nature can even turn into hostility. There is research to back up the connection between biophobia and calls for the killing of certain predators such as bears, wolves or sharks.
How stories shape our view of the natural world
Our relationship with nature is also strongly determined by our culture and the stories we have heard about it.
"In Central Europe, the forest used to be seen as a place of danger, wild animals, starvation, predators and magical threats," the psychologist Stemper pointed out.
It was only with the cultural movement of Romanticism in the early 19th century that woodlands became places of longing in Germany.
In the Romantic period — in the late 18th century to mid-19th century — many artists and writers focused on the individual's search for magical, supernatural or miraculous phenomena as a reaction to the rapid technological progress of the time.
"Today, we are experiencing a kind of return of the fear of nature: not due to predators and wild animals, but to alienation, media frames and digital distraction," Stemper said.
He added that digital media often portrays a distorted image of nature, a kind of "hyperreality" that blurs the boundaries between the original and the — mostly filtered — copy.
As a result, "virtual nature experiences such as Instagram feeds or computer games have a more intense and 'real' effect than actual encounters with forests, meadows or animals," he explained.
Too little contact with nature harms our health
So why go into the real woods when the "safe" forest on Instagram looks so much nicer?
Because it's good for us. "When we spend time in nature, it promotes our mental health," Dohm said.
"Studies show that forests and nature alleviate ADHD symptoms, improve attention and concentration, reduce sensory problems and promote emotional regulation," Stemper added.
But because biophobic people avoid nature, they miss out on all these health benefits. So what to do?
Jensen says knowledge can help: the more people know about plants and animals and understand how nature works, the more they can appreciate them. And if the fear of natural hazards is actually justified, it helps to avoid risks, for example by protecting livestock from predators.
Susanne Sigl says the best way to help children reestablish contact with nature is through play: "If children fall down while playing tag in the forest, hide behind a tree or crouch in the bushes, then touching branches is usually no longer a problem."

Starmer facing calls for inquiry into Labour thinktank’s investigation of journalists

Keir Starmer is facing calls by MPs for an inquiry into the commissioning of a report that made “baseless claims” about journalists who were investigating a thinktank linked to the prime minister.
The calls add to pressure on the Cabinet Office minister Josh Simons, who commissioned a report in 2023 on journalists investigating Labour Together, the thinktank that would help propel Starmer to power.
The research was paid for and subsequently reviewed by Simons when he was director of Labour Together, according to sources and documents seen by the Guardian.
In an agreement addressed to Simons, drawn up by Apco Worldwide, the PR consultancy agreed to “investigate the sourcing, funding and origins” of a November 2023 Sunday Times report about the thinktank, in addition to other journalistic investigations into the group.
The Sunday Times reported that the contents of Apco’s investigation were informally shared with Labour figures in 2024, including present cabinet ministers and special advisers. The report contained allegations about Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, journalists at the paper, which then spread around Westminster.
The paper reported that Tom Harper, Apco’s senior director and a former Sunday Times employee, wrote that he had examined the “sourcing, funding and origins of the Sunday Times story” using documents and “discreet human source enquiries”.
Harper was said to have made “baseless claims” that the emails underpinning the published story were likely to have come from a suspected Kremlin hack of the Electoral Commission.
“The likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state,” he reportedly wrote. Apco’s report was also said to have referred to Pogrund’s Jewish background and made baseless allegations about his faith, upbringing and personal and professional relationships.
Simons was close to the prime minister’s recently departed chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who previously ran Labour Together and whose own role in the operation to gather material on journalists is under scrutiny.
An investigation into Apco’s research has been launched by the Public Relations and Communications Association’s standards committee, and this has been welcomed by Simons.
He said in a statement: “I was surprised and shocked to read the report extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information on Gabriel Pogrund.”
Simons said he had asked for the information to be removed before passing the report to the intelligence agency GCHQ. No other British journalists were investigated in any document he or Labour Together ever received, Simons said.
John McDonnell, the veteran Labour backbencher and former chancellor, said on Saturday he had written three times in recent weeks to the general secretary of the Labour party to call for an independent inquiry into the affair.
“I copied Keir Starmer into each request,” McDonnell said. “Clear to me as secretary of the NUJ’s parliamentary group if true this is unacceptable.”
Another Labour MP, Karl Turner, said the prime minister needed to look into the affair himself and should meet McDonnell to discuss it.
The contract showed that Simons asked for information specifically on the sources for a book by Paul Holden about McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s rise, as well as related articles by the US journalist Matt Taibbi.

U.S. President Donald Trump said the Board of Peace will announce this week that member states have pledged more than $5 billion toward humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Gaza and committed thousands of personnel to an international stabilization force and local police in the territory.
In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the announcement will be made Feb. 19, 2026, at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, where he will be joined by member states of the organization, which he chairs.
Trump wrote that member states have pledged more than $5 billion toward Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts and have committed thousands of personnel to an international stabilization force and local police to maintain security and peace for residents of the enclave.
He also said Hamas “must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization.”
Trump described the Board of Peace as having “unlimited potential” and said it would prove to be “the most consequential international body in history,” adding that it is his honor to serve as its chairman.

Zelenskyy: Putin not being in prison is the largest compromise the world has made
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that the world has made its biggest concession regarding Russia, as Vladimir Putin and his inner circle are still not in prison.
Source: European Pravda, citing Zelenskyy in an interview with Politico
Details: Zelenskyy said he is receiving signals from the United States and President Donald Trump about the need for a compromise with Russia.
Quote: "There are some signals from the American side, from President Trump. They say, 'Look, this is the time for compromises, you can make some steps forward.'
We made a lot of compromises. Putin and his friends, they are not in prison. This is the biggest compromise that the world has made already."
Details: Zelenskyy also said Trump has proposed that a truce be established and the war be temporarily frozen, which Putin has refused despite Ukraine's agreement to a ceasefire.
The Ukrainian leader believes this will persist until the Kremlin leader is under real pressure.
Quote: "Yeah, of course he will refuse… Today one reason, tomorrow another reason, etc. We need pressure on him… Putin will stop this war if real pressure is on him."
Background:
- On 14 February, Zelenskyy stated that proposals for Ukraine to leave Donetsk Oblast without a fight are perilous, stressing that Russia's ambitions go beyond the eastern region.
- He also said he hopes that the negotiation process involving the US and Russia on a potential end to the war will not slow down due to changes in the Russian negotiating team.
- New talks on ending the war in Ukraine are planned on 17-18 February in Geneva, with Russia expected to be represented by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin.
- Recently, Rustem Umierov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, revealed the names of the delegates Ukraine plans to send to the meeting.

Türkiye condemns Israel's land registration move in West Bank

Türkiye condemns Israel's land registration move in West Bank
Ankara says Israel has no sovereignty over occupied Palestinian territories, calling decision ‘null and void’
ISTANBUL
Türkiye on Sunday strongly condemned Israel's new decision on land registration in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of international law.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move aims to impose Israel’s “authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities."
"This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel's unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void," the ministry said.
"Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories," the ministry added, saying that the expansionist policies pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government undermine peace efforts and damage prospects for a two-state solution.
Türkiye called on the international community to take a firm stance against Israeli attempts to create facts on the ground.
The ministry said Türkiye will continue to support efforts to "establish an independent, sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” daily Israel Hayom said ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation – including killings, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion – as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

'Washington does not need vassals, but strong partners,' Rubio tells Europe

The top US diplomat says Washington wants stronger allies in Europe who take more responsibility, as he met Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava on Sunday. Slovakia is the first stop of his two-nation tour of central Europe, which will also feature a visit to Hungary.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said America is not asking European allies to be vassals, but they need to be less dependent on Washington. Rubio made the remarks in a joint press conference in Bratislava after holding talks with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Slovakia is the first stop on Rubio's two-state tour of central Europe, which he began on Sunday after attending the Munich Security Conference the last few days.
He is set to travel to Hungary after Slovakia, where he will meet with Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, to discuss bilateral relations and bolster ties with Trump allies in the region.
Both Fico and Orbán are key allies of the Trump administration in Europe, aligning with the anti-immigration policies of Washington and sharing Trump's vision to end the war in Ukraine.
Rubio downplays troop redeployment concerns
Answering a reporter's question, the top US diplomat played down the recent US decision to pull back a limited number of US troops from the continent.
"We're not leaving NATO, we may move a couple of thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," Rubio told reporters.
"We don't want Europe to be dependent on us, we're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. And our point is: the stronger you are, the stronger the members of NATO are, the stronger NATO is."
On Saturday, in his address to the Munich Security Conference, Rubio said the US and Europe share a common destiny but warned that Europe's cultural and economic decline must be reversed and that mass migration must be stopped.
In January, many EU leaders expressed concern that US President Donald Trump's ambitions to seize Greenland could undermine NATO. This week, the EU Defence Commissioner said that Brussels should prepare to replace US troops on the continent.
Rubio refused to discuss in detail his recent negotiations with Denmark about Greenland. He also played down Slovak criticism of the US military raid in Venezuela that led to the arrest of Nicolás Maduro.
In January, Robert Fico said the raid was a violation of sovereignty and international law.
"A lot of countries didn't like what we did in Venezuela. That's okay. That was in our national interest. I'm sure there's something he'll do one day that we don't like, and we'll say, hey, we didn't like what you did. So what? That doesn't mean we're not going to be friends," said the US Secretary of State.
Rubio also stressed that central Europe will be a key region for the incumbent administration's engagement with Europe, during Trump's second presidency.
Fico criticises EU support for Ukraine
Fico and Rubio discussed nuclear and military cooperation and ongoing peace efforts to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, which reaches its fourth anniversary later this month.
The Slovak premier criticised the EU's approach, as it continues to financially and militarily support Ukraine.
Fico recalled that at the December EU summit, Slovakia, Hungary and the Czech Republic abstained when the EU approved a €90 billion support package for Ukraine.
"The EU grants a loan of €90 billion for Ukraine, and €60 billion is spent on weapons, and €30 billion is so that Ukraine can operate on its own," he said.
"I am proud that we did not participate in this at the European Council," Fico added, noting that continuing to financially support Kyiv will only prolong the war and increase the death toll on both sides.
"Do you know what will happen? In December, we will count the next 100,000 dead on the side of Russia and Ukraine. The only result will be that Russia will be deeper into Ukraine," stressed the Slovak leader.
Fico also harshly criticised the European Union's decision to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027, saying it carries disastrous consequences for his country and others.
"This will create great trouble, as we do not have any LNG terminals."
Fico also discussed Ukraine's EU ambitions and praised Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orbán for speaking clearly about his rejection.
"We say that Ukraine can join the EU on the assumption they will meet all the necessary criteria. We cannot lie now to Serbia, Montenegro or Albania. Those countries are 100 times better prepared for accession than Ukraine," said Fico.
The Slovak premier also slammed Kyiv for weaponising the issue of oil transfers to Hungary and his country for political blackmail.
Rubio to meet Orbán in Hungary
Marco Rubio continues his central European tour in Hungary, where he meets Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.
According to the US State Department, the talks will focus on "the peace process to resolve global conflicts" and on the US-Hungary energy partnership.
Orbán, also an outspoken critic of the European Union and a staunch Trump supporter, was the first European leader to declare his country's membership in Trump's Board of Peace initiative, which many have doubted is an attempt at replacing the UN and its role.
The US late last year gave Hungary a one-year exemption from secondary tariffs targeting countries importing Russian oil.
In December, Hungary signed a deal with the US energy giant, Chevron, to import 2 billion cubic metres of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Washington.
Trump is also endorsing Prime Minister Orbán in Hungary's general elections, where the incumbent premier faces his most difficult election in mid-April.
The opposition Tisza Party, led by centre-right Péter Magyar, is leading in opinion polls.

Nepal: Watch cannabis rituals unfold during Shivaratri in Kathmandu

Crowds thronged Kathmandu’s Pashupatinath Temple for Shivaratri, where worship, music and a rare legal tolerance of marijuana marked the festival.
Nepal marked Shivaratri on Sunday as crowds filled Kathmandu and queued for hours at Pashupatinath Temple. Tens of thousands came to pray, sing and dance in honour of Shiva. Although marijuana is banned most of the year, police allow limited use during the festival, reflecting Shiva’s long link to cannabis.
Across the Bagmati river, ash-covered holy men and mostly young devotees smoked openly on nearby hills. Visitors also travelled from India to join the rituals.
Nepal outlawed marijuana in 1976, after decades of legal sales, and recent efforts to decriminalise it remain stalled. For one day at least, tradition takes priority over the law.

Spike Lee brings Palestine message to NBA All-Star Weekend
Oscar-winning filmmaker Spike Lee made a clear show of solidarity with Palestine during an NBA game over All-Star Weekend, appearing with a prominent accessory featuring the Palestinian flag.
The acclaimed director - best known for films such as Malcolm X and Da 5 Bloods - was seen courtside at the game in Los Angeles carrying a bag adorned with the Palestinian flag and a traditional keffiyeh. He also wore a hoodie marking US Black History Month.
As one of the most widely watched events in American basketball, NBA All-Star Weekend ensured Lee’s attire drew significant attention, both in the arena and online, highlighting his long-standing advocacy for human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
"Spike Lee with the Palestine flag on All Star weekend that’s that legendary sh*t in a weekend where the league is trying they’re hardest to push Israel" one user wrote on social media platform X.
Others, however, expressed concern that Lee’s visible pro-Palestine stance could prompt repercussions.
"Spike Lee with the Palestine flag and keffiyeh on his bag for All Star Weekend they’re [about to] ban him from ever being courtside again," another user posted.
Lee’s latest symbolic gesture comes amid his continued public support for Palestine.
He has repeatedly used his social media platforms to draw attention to the suffering of Palestinians, particularly in Gaza, since the outbreak of Israel's war in 2023, including sharing images of the Palestinian flag.
The director also served as an executive producer on the Oscar-nominated film The Voice of Hind Rajab, which centres on the killing of five-year-old Gaza resident Hind Rajab by Israeli forces in 2024.
His high-profile appearance at All-Star Weekend follows growing criticism from basketball fans over what they see as a lack of acknowledgement by the NBA’s biggest stars of Israel’s two-year genocidal war on the Strip.
This stands in contrast to prominent athletes in other sports- including footballer Mohamed Salah and NFL player Azeez Al-Shaair- who have spoken out publicly about the conflict.
In December 2023, former NBA player and activist Etan Thomas addressed the issue in an op-ed published on his website, writing that after commenting publicly on Gaza he received "over a dozen messages from different active NBA players and even more from retired NBA players thanking me".
While many NBA stars have remained silent, some players have openly expressed solidarity with Gaza, including WNBA guard Natasha Cloud and NBA star Kyrie Irving.

Trump says Board of Peace members to pledge over $5B for Gaza reconstruction on Thursday
US president announces thousands of personnel also committed to planned international stabilization force, local police in Gaza Strip
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump said Sunday that member states of the new Board of Peace will announce pledges exceeding $5 billion for Gaza reconstruction and thousands of personnel for a planned international stabilization force during a Thursday gathering in Washington.
"On February 19th, 2026, I will again be joined by Board of Peace members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where we will announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion dollars toward the Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts," Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.
Member states have also "committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and local police to maintain security and peace for Gazans," he added.
The White House last month announced the formation of a "technocratic" National Committee for the Administration of Gaza to oversee the transition of power as part of Trump's 20-point plan for the war-battered enclave.

The top 3 affordable cities for retirement with low-cost, high-quality healthcare access
Award-winning hospitals, affordable healthcare and cost of living are the sweet spot for retirees

Medical costs can make up a chunk of retirement expenses - but where a retiree chooses to live can have a significant impact on that spending.
Most adults 65 or older will rely on the government’s Medicare program for health insurance when they retire. On average, a retiree would need up to $428,000 saved to cover Medicare premiums, deductibles and prescription drugs in their golden years, according to a 2025 study from nonpartisan benefits and public policy research firm Employee Benefit Research Institute. Yet, the average retiree has just under $290,000 saved for retirement.
Therefore, finding a city that has affordable and high-quality healthcare is as important as ever for those getting ready to exit the world of work.
The Independent analyzed all 50 states based on three categories: overall cost of living, state Medicare performance and average annual medical expenses.
In the three states that came out on top, these cities beat the national average for cost of living and had hospitals recognized for outstanding care.
Steeltown savings
Pittsburgh’s blue-collar reputation belies the city’s rise over the past decade as a hot spot for culture, according to tourism publication VisitPITTSBURGH. Overall, Pennsylvania offers a solid trio of affordable cost of living, top-20 Medicare performance, and top-15 health cost of living:
- Overall cost of living: No. 25
- Medicare performance: No. 16
- Health cost of living: No. 12
Pittsburgh’s overall cost of living is 2 percent below the national average, according to workplace compensation firm Payscale.

Family Guy hits huge milestone tonight: How to watch
Hit animated series will air its 450th episode Sunday night
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Family Guy is slated to hit a major milestone when it returns to television tonight.
The season 24 premiere of Fox’s hit animated series — airing Sunday night at 9:30 p.m. ET — will also mark its 450th episode.
“Season 24 will continue to push comedy boundaries, providing an unexpected take on current events, pop culture and family itself,” an official description of the premiere episode read. “The season premieres with its landmark 450th episode, when for the first time in the show's history, Lois and Stewie finally understand each other -- thanks to Brian's edibles — and explore and try to explain their complicated relationship.”
“Also this season Peter and the guys get shipwrecked on Fire Island, Chris and Brian perform a lobotomy on a social-media-crazed Stewie, and Lois and Meg take their love for pumpkin spice latte to criminal extremes.”
Created by Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy premiered in 1999 and centers around the Griffin family. In addition to MacFarlane, the cast features the voices of Alex Borstein, Seth Green, Mila Kunis, and Arif Zahir.
The show has a history of controversial jokes and rarely holds back when choosing to mock certain celebrities. Still, it has retained somewhat of a loyal following — enough to keep it on the air for well over two decades.
Taking a look at how the animated series survived 20 seasons in the era of political correctness, The Independent’s Louis Chilton wrote in 2021: “Family Guy’s enduring survival could be down to a gradual maturation in other areas. The animation, a full-blown eyesore in its early days, has improved ten-fold.
“Increasingly, the humor has scaled back the frenzied, puerile cutaway gags, and increasingly takes a more self-aware tone. More risks are taken, too, with its format, such as an entire episode devoted to a fake in-universe DVD commentary, or a triptych emulating the filmmaking aesthetics of Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson and Michael Bay.
“This long-term creative stamina is nothing to be scoffed at: by its own 20th season, The Simpsons was over a decade past its peak and had already lost all trace of what made it such a monumental piece of TV. Regardless, Family Guy’s viewing figures have declined substantially over the years, at least on traditional TV. In 2000, and 2002, Family Guy was twice cancelled by Fox for low viewership ratings, before being revived due to high DVD sales and the popularity of Adult Swim re-runs.
“Now, it draws less than half of what it did at its lowest pre-cancellation ebb. Maybe there just aren’t enough people still watching to really cultivate much offence.”
Season 24 of Family Guy premieres February 15 at 9:30 p.m. ET on Fox. Streaming will be available the next day on Hulu.

Renderings show most detailed vision for Trump’s White House ballroom

New renderings released this week provide the most detailed vision yet of Donald Trump’s proposed $400m White House ballroom addition.
The renderings, submitted by the project’s architects and released on Friday by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), depict a vast sprawling structure, expected to be around 90,000sq ft, from multiple angles.
In the images, the proposed building stands level with the White House mansion.
The renderings appear in a 28-page document titled “East Wing Modernization” and is dated 11 February. It was submitted ahead of a 5 March NCPC hearing, when board members are scheduled discuss the proposal.
Trump has appointed several allies to the NCPC commission and he has installed loyalists at the Commission of Fine Arts, which is also tasked with reviewing the ballroom plans.
According to CNN, the renderings were removed from the NCPC website shortly after being uploaded on Friday. The commission did not respond to requests for comment from CNN about the removal.
The ballroom project has generated headlines and outcry from the outset. In October, Trump sparked public backlash when he abruptly began demolishing the East Wing, to clear space for his ballroom, before construction plans had been submitted to oversight bodies.
At the time, White House officials said that demolition did not require the commission’s approval, and said that they would present plans for any construction to the proper commissions.
In December, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a federal lawsuit, seeking to block the construction of the new ballroom, arguing that the administration violated multiple laws by tearing parts of the White House “without any review whatsoever”.
Also in December, Trump replaced the architect originally selected to design the gilded ballroom, following reports of disagreements. The White House subsequently chose Shalom Baranes Associates to lead the project.
The most recently reported cost estimate for the ballroom stands at $400m. The project is being financed by private donors and large corporations including Meta, Apple, Amazon, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Google and Comcast.
Earlier this week, Trump shared two renderings of the ballroom on social media.
“It is on budget, and ahead of schedule!” Trump wrote. “When completed, it will be the finest Ballroom ever built anywhere in the World, one that has been sought by Presidents for over 150 years – and now they are getting THE BEST!”.
“Because of its unprecedented structural, safety, and security features, it will also be used for future Presidential Inaugurations” he added.
In a 5 February memo to the NCPC, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, defended the administration’s decision to demolish the East Wing.
“Based on analysis, demolition of the existing East Wing structure and reconstruction of a new East Wing provided the most effective solution to many longstanding issues affecting the White House and delivered the best long-term risk reduction” he wrote.
Fisher said that that preservationists from the National Park Service and General Services Administration “advised on and documented the removal of historical elements of the building and oversaw the manner in which the removals took place” and that “significant historical items associated with the buildings have been meticulously preserved”.
Some of the preserved features include the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and more, he said.
“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure” he added.
Fisher also stated that “all heavy equipment has been kept at a safe distance from the White House mansion as based on industry standards to prevent inadvertent damage to the structure” and said that “to date, the government evaluation following the removal of the East Colonnade and the East Wing buildings is that the condition of the east façade of the White House Mansion is excellently preserved.”
Later in the memo, Fisher said that beyond the ballroom, the administration has plans “for beautifying the visitor experience” including in areas such as Lafayette Park, Sherman Park, First Division Park, and the Ellipse, and said that they are also working to establish a “superior, more efficient, White House visitor security screening center”.

Thousands of Western nationals fought Israel’s war on Gaza: What to know
Thousands of Western nationals joined the Israeli military in its genocidal war on Gaza that killed over 72,000 Palestinians.
Thousands of Western nationals joined the Israeli military amid its genocidal war in Gaza, raising questions over international legal accountability for foreign nationals implicated in alleged war crimes against Palestinians.
More than 50,000 soldiers in the Israeli military hold at least one other citizenship, with a majority of them holding US or European passports, information obtained by the Israeli NGO Hatzlacha through Israel’s Freedom of Information Law has revealed.
Recommended Stories

- list 3 of 4Ex-Biden official says ‘without doubt’ Israel committed war crimes in Gaza
- list 4 of 4How did Israel kill the Red Crescent medics in Gaza?
Since October 7, 2023, Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 72,061 people in military actions that have been dubbed war crimes and crimes against humanity by rights groups.
Rights organisations around the world have been trying to identify and prosecute foreign nationals, many of whom have posted videos of their abuse on social media, for their involvement in war crimes, particularly in Gaza.
So, what does the first such data reveal about the Israeli military? And what could be the legal implications for dual-national soldiers?
Which foreign nationals enlist most in the Israeli military?
At least 12,135 soldiers enlisted in the Israeli military hold United States passports, topping the list by a huge margin. That is in addition to 1,207 soldiers who possess another passport in addition to their US and Israeli ones.
The data – shared with Al Jazeera by Israeli lawyer Elad Man, who serves as the legal counsel for Hatzlacha – shows that 6,127 French nationals serve in the Israeli military.
The Israeli military, which shared such data for the first time, noted that soldiers holding multiple citizenships are counted more than once in the breakdown.
The numbers show service members enlisted in the military as of March 2025, 17 months into Israel’s devastating war in Gaza.
Russia stands at third, with 5,067 nationals serving in the Israeli military, followed by 3,901 Ukrainians and 1,668 Germans.
The data revealed that 1,686 soldiers in the military held dual British-Israeli citizenship, in addition to 383 other soldiers who held another passport in addition to their British and Israeli ones.
South Africa, which brought a case of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also had 589 of its citizens serving in the Israeli military ranks.
Furthermore, 1,686 soldiers hold Brazilian citizenship, 609 Argentine, 505 Canadian, 112 Colombian, and 181 Mexican, in addition to their Israeli nationality.
Israel’s military comprises an estimated 169,000 active personnel and 465,000 reservists – of whom nearly eight percent hold dual or multiple citizenships.
Can dual nationals be tried for war crimes in Gaza?
Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that “war crimes incur criminal liability under international law, irrespective of what the law of nationality says”.
Otherwise, Nazi Germans, whose law allowed and obliged them to commit atrocities, would incur no liability, Bantekas added. “Dual nationality is immaterial to criminal liability,” he said.
However, the major issue in prosecuting the accused “is getting [them] on your territory and putting them before a court”, he noted.
Bantekas also added that there is no difference in the question of liability between native soldiers and those of dual nationalities.
Dual nationals, in fact, “may in addition be liable under laws that prevent military service in foreign conflicts or joining armies of other nations”, the professor said.
Prosecuting foreign nationals has been “pretty much the norm”, he noted.
“Think of Nazi Germans tried by Allied war crimes tribunals after World War II, Japanese officers tried by US military courts, and crimes committed during the Bosnian conflict where alleged offenders were tried by various courts in Europe,” Bantekas told Al Jazeera.
Last May, the United Kingdom’s Foreign Office said that allegations of war crimes should be submitted to the Metropolitan Police.
“The UK recognises the right of British dual nationals to serve in the legitimately recognised armed forces of the country of their other nationality,” it said. “Allegations of war crimes should be submitted to the Met Police for investigation.”
Have foreign nationals been tried for Gaza war crimes?
Nationals with dual or multiple citizenships have not yet been arrested for committing war crimes in Gaza. But rights groups, including lawyers, are trying to get them prosecuted.
In the UK last April, the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and the UK-based Public Interest Law Centre (PILC) filed a 240-page report to the Metropolitan Police.
Accusations against the 10 British individuals, whose names have not been publicly disclosed, include murder, forcible transfer of people, and attacks on humanitarian personnel, between October 2023 and May 2024.
In September last year, a case was filed in Germany against a 25-year-old soldier, born and raised in Munich, for participating in the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, by PCHR, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), Al-Haq, and the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights.
The sniper, with shootings documented near Gaza’s al-Quds and Nasser hospitals between November 2023 and March 2024, was a member of a unit known as “Refaim”, “ghost” in Hebrew.
Legal proceedings against members of the same unit are also under way in France, Italy, South Africa, and Belgium.
The Belgian public prosecutor’s office also opened a judicial investigation last October into a 21-year-old Belgian-Israeli citizen, a member of Refaim.
The mandatory military service law in Israel exempts dual nationals residing abroad, making the enlistment a voluntary act, an important distinction when such crimes are tried in foreign courts. Lawyers have reportedly noted that the voluntary nature of the soldiers’ service makes them more liable for alleged crimes.
What does international law say about soldiers in foreign wars?
South Africa brought its case to the ICJ in December 2023, arguing that Israel’s war in Gaza violates the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
While a final ruling could take years, the ICJ issued provisional measures in January 2024 ordering Israel to take steps to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and to allow unimpeded access for humanitarian aid. But Israel has continued curb the supply of aid into Gaza in violation of the ICJ interim order.
Under the 1948 Genocide Convention, countries that are party to the treaty have a binding obligation to prevent and punish genocide. Countries can investigate and prosecute individuals who may have committed or been complicit in this crime.
In March last year, the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) announced the “Global 195” campaign to hold Israeli and dual-national individuals accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.
The coalition aims to work simultaneously within multiple jurisdictions to apply for private arrest warrants and initiate legal proceedings against those implicated, including the Israeli military members and the entire Israeli military and political command in its scope.
For countries that are parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), there is an additional layer, where the ICC can assert its jurisdiction. Palestine has been a state party since 2015.
The State of Palestine is recognised as a sovereign nation by 157 of the 193 UN member states, representing 81 percent of the international community. Most recently, it has been recognised by France, Belgium, Canada, Australia, and the UK.
A foreign national, whose country considers Palestine a “friendly state”, would also be vulnerable to prosecution for participating in the Israeli military’s war crimes in Gaza.
How is the Hind Rajab Foundation tracking alleged war criminals?
The Hind Rajab Foundation – named to honour a five-year-old Palestinian girl whose killing by Israeli soldiers on January 29, 2024 became emblematic of Israel’s genocide in Gaza – has been amassing troves of data with identifiable information about Israeli soldiers.
The Belgium-based foundation is the force behind an international effort for accountability over war crimes in Gaza – and has since filed several cases, including a landmark challenge targeting 1,000 Israeli soldiers.
The foundation identified numerous individuals with dual citizenship, including 12 from France, 12 from the US, four from Canada, three from the UK, and two from the Netherlands, in the complaint.
The foundation has scoured TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, where the Israeli soldiers boast about atrocities in Gaza, to collect information on the soldiers. It has been using those pieces of evidence to pursue the trail of the accused for war crimes.
“We are in possession of many more profiles of dual nationals beyond the 1,000 soldiers named in our complaint to the ICC. We will be pursuing legal action against all of them in the national courts of their respective countries,” the foundation had said in October 2024. “Impunity must end, everywhere.”
The Hind Rajab Foundation says it pursues criminal accountability for Israeli war criminals, from those who planned and ordered operations to those who executed them, including foreign nationals who have participated in or financed these crimes.
Its founder, Dyab Abou Jahjah, was also threatened by Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli, who told him to “watch your pager” in a post on X, an allusion to deadly attacks on Hezbollah members’ communication systems in September 2024. At least 12 people were killed and more than 3,000 people were wounded when thousands of pagers were detonated by Israeli operatives during those attacks.
In January last year, a complaint filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation led to a Brazilian judge ordering an investigation into an Israeli soldier vacationing in the country. The soldier had to flee, prompting the Israeli military to order all troops who participated in combat to conceal their identities.
“Criminal liability under international law cannot be dissolved by time bars. It extends forever, and no statute of limitations is applicable,” said Bantekas of Hamad Bin Khalifa University.
However, prosecuting Israeli military members “is practically difficult for two reasons”, he said, noting the difficulty of obtaining firsthand evidence and the wariness of national prosecutors who may fear political or other repercussions.
“If public opinion and political opinion in Europe shifts far more in favour of Palestine than it is now, then national prosecutions will feel more at ease to initiate prosecutions,” he told Al Jazeera.

Jonathan Powell rejects overtures to replace McSweeney as Starmer’s chief of staff

Jonathan Powell, Keir Starmer’s national security adviser (NSA), has rejected overtures to become the prime minister’s chief of staff after the resignation of Morgan McSweeney, the Guardian has been told.
Powell’s allies say his decision not to take forward discussions about the job – the same role he undertook under Tony Blair’s premiership from 1997 to 2007 – was largely motivated by an intention to return to the mediation consultancy that he set up in 2011, with little interest in returning to a job he has already done.
He is said to be weighing a departure from Downing Street at the end of the year, in what would represent another significant departure from the prime minister’s senior team.
Downing Street sources firmly denied that Jonathan Powell had any plans to step down from his role, adding that he was not leaving Downing Street and would continue as NSA. They said any suggestion Powell had been offered the role of chief of staff was untrue.
Powell is credited with playing a key role in shaping Starmer’s policies on the world stage. The prime minister’s efforts to build a relationship with Donald Trump and act as a self-styled bridge between the US and Europe are seen as one of the more successful elements of his tenure at No 10.
In a continued Downing Street clear-out after the controversy over the decision to make Peter Mandelson the ambassador to Washington, it was announced on Thursday that Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, was stepping down “by mutual consent” after just more than a year in the job.
It is also understood that Powell very strongly advised Starmer not to appoint Mandelson as British ambassador to Washington, an opinion that could emerge in the publication of internal government memos due to be published after a Commons vote earlier this month.
Downing Street sources said they would not comment on advice given to the prime minister.
The mass of documentation, which ministers agreed to release after the controversy over Mandelson’s long-term links to the child sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, will be released after sensitive items are filtered by parliament’s intelligence and security committee.
Powell’s recommendation was not owing to any special knowledge of Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein, but because he felt from his personal experience during the Blair government that Mandelson courted controversy and would represent trouble for the prime minister.
As Blair’s chief of staff, Powell had to handle two cabinet resignations by Mandelson and on both occasions felt Mandelson did not handle the controversy as well as he could have. His opposition to Mandelson underlines the extent to which Starmer and McSweeney ignored top-level foreign policy advice from inside No 10 and the Foreign Office over the appointment.
David Lammy, who was foreign secretary at the time of the appointment, has also let it be known that he opposed the plan, but he may have been reflecting a Foreign Office view that such a high-level diplomatic appointment should go to a professional diplomat and not a former Labour minister.
Powell has been regarded as a highly effective national security adviser, acting as a key liaison between No 10 and the European “coalition of the willing” built to support Ukraine. He has also been at the centre of the controversy over the decision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.
His consultancy, Inter-Mediate, specialises in working behind the scenes to bring together parties in a conflict. Powell always regarded the highly demanding national security job as a fixed-term appointment.
At Inter-Mediate, Powell – considered to have been one of the key architects of the 1999 Good Friday agreement – played a role in supporting negotiations to end the Basque conflict and demobilise the Eta separatist group. In addition, he served as a peace adviser to the former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos on his Nobel prize-winning settlement with the Farc rebels.
Powell also worked alongside Mozambique’s former president Filipe Nyusi to end the country’s long civil war through a landmark agreement signed in summer 2019.

22 arrested in Bnei Brak riots; female IDF soldiers say they hid in dumpsters

Two female IDF soldiers rescued by police from violent unrest in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak said they had asked their commanders not to enter the area but were instructed to proceed.
“We hid inside dumpsters,” one of the soldiers said in testimony. “I wasn’t carrying a weapon, and that’s fortunate, because in any case I wouldn’t have been able to use it against them.”
The unrest erupted after word spread that the soldiers had arrived to distribute military draft notices. The IDF said the soldiers were in fact conducting a welfare visit as part of their duties.
According to one of the soldiers, a woman who saw them entering a building warned them to hide and told them they were not allowed to be there. “I even wore a skirt in advance to avoid this,” she said.
Tel Aviv District Police Commander Haim Sargarof criticized the lack of coordination with the military.
“The army must coordinate entry into the city with us,” he said at the scene. “When they enter without coordinating with us, we are left to respond.”
He said police are using camera footage to identify those involved in the violence. “We have reached the person who set the motorcycle on fire. We need to make the arrests and restore quiet for residents who need to know there will be zero tolerance for disorder,” he said.
Sargarof said there was no immediate expectation of further unrest but that police were prepared for road closures and additional disturbances. “The incident went from zero to 100,” he said. “We are not updated when soldiers enter for activity, it is not coordinated with us, and we are surprised. Had we been informed, we would have escorted and supported them and would not have allowed them to enter the heart of Bnei Brak, the center of the Jerusalem Faction, without accompaniment.”
Police Commissioner Danny Levy said officers would restore order and arrest everyone involved. “In the State of Israel there is law and it must be respected,” he said. “Anyone who raises a hand against soldiers or police officers, or overturns patrol cars, has a personal problem with me and with my organization.”
Police said 22 people were arrested during the unrest. According to a statement, rioters threw stones at officers, overturned a patrol car and set a police motorcycle on fire, along with tefillin that were on it. Two officers were injured. Stun grenades were used to disperse the crowd, and a helicopter was deployed to the area.
Video from the scene showed hundreds of ultra-Orthodox men surrounding the soldiers as garbage bins were overturned and scattered across the street. In one instance, a man pushing a baby stroller was seen walking near officers as stun grenades were thrown, shouting at them to stop.
Police declared a district-wide emergency protocol, mobilizing forces from stations across the Tel Aviv District, and officers extracted the soldiers from the crowd.
IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir condemned the attack. “I view with severity and strongly condemn the attack on IDF soldiers who carried out a military mission earlier today in Bnei Brak,” he said. “Any harm to IDF soldiers by civilians is a serious crossing of a red line and the attackers must be dealt with firmly. I expect the law to be fully enforced.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the violence, calling it the actions of “an extreme minority” that does not represent the broader ultra-Orthodox community. “We will not allow anarchy, and we will not tolerate any harm to IDF servicemembers and security forces personnel who carry out their duties with dedication and determination,” he said.
Chief Rabbi Kalman Meir Bar denounced the violence, saying Jewish law strictly forbids raising a hand against another person and that the Torah’s ways are “ways of pleasantness and peace.”
Opposition leaders also sharply criticized the events. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the attack “anarchy” and said a “bright red line” had been crossed. He later visited Bnei Brak and said those responsible should be jailed as quickly as possible.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for immediate arrests, saying it was unacceptable for soldiers and police officers to be attacked and that those involved “must find themselves in prison today.”

Transcript: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 15, 2025
The following is the transcript of the interview with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 15, 2026.
ED O'KEEFE: We turn now to House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who joins us this morning from New York City. Leader Jeffries, thank you for being here.
DEMOCRATIC LEADER HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be with you.
ED O'KEEFE: So as this shutdown continues, I want to remind our viewers what it is, exactly, congressional Democrats are seeking to reopen the Department of Homeland Security. You want immigration agents to show IDs, to wear body cameras, take off their masks, stop racial profiling and seek judicial warrants to enter private property. Talks between the White House and congressional Democrats are continuing. Are you willing to compromise, to let any of these go, to get the government reopened?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, our value proposition is simple, taxpayer dollars should be used to make life more affordable for the American people, not brutalize or kill them, as we horrifically saw in Minneapolis with the cold blooded killings of Rene Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. We know, and the American people clearly know, that ICE is totally out of control and they need to be reined in. Because the American people deserve immigration enforcement that is fair, that is just, and that is humane. And so, we need dramatic change at ICE, including, but not limited to, the types of things that you laid out before any DHS funding bill moves forward.
ED O'KEEFE: With the exception of some flexibility on body cameras, because they're starting to spend some money to get those out there, some Republicans have rejected this list of policy reform proposals. You guys still seem miles apart. So when, conceivably, will we see this resolved? And again, I ask you, if- are there any of these points that you're willing to let go in order to get the government reopened?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we're willing to have a good faith conversation about everything, but fundamentally we need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational. And these are common sense things. For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes. We need to make sure that there are actual independent investigations, so that if state and local laws are violated, in many cases, violently violated, that state and local authorities have the ability to criminally investigate and criminally prosecute anyone who has violated the law. Because we cannot trust Kristi Noem or Pam Bondi to conduct an independent investigation. We believe that sensitive locations should be off limits, sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, hospitals or polling sites, and that fundamentally ICE should be targeting violent felons who are here unlawfully, as opposed to violently targeting law abiding immigrant families, which is completely inconsistent with what Donald Trump promised the American people he would do.
ED O'KEEFE: Right. And we, of course, this past week reported that about 14% of those detained had violent criminal records. About 60% of them were wanted on criminal records overall. But it was that 14%, violent criminals. Again, I just- it sounds like this is going to go on a while, because Tom Homan wasn't terribly flexible on anything, especially on the issue of warrants and masks. You're not ceding any ground. So there's a few things coming up here. For example, State of the Union is scheduled for a week from Tuesday. Should it be held if the Department of Homeland Security is shut down?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. It is certainly my hope--
ED O'KEEFE: --Sounds like you're going to get to it, though. I mean--
REP. JEFFRIES:--we can come to a resolution in advance of it. Well, here's the thing, the administration and Republicans have made a clear decision that they would rather shut down FEMA, shut down the Coast Guard and shut down TSA, than enact the type of dramatic reforms necessary so that ICE and other DHS law enforcement agencies are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement professional in the country. For instance, police officers don't use masks. County Sheriffs don't use masks. State troopers don't use masks. Why is it that ICE agents who are untrained, are being unleashed on American communities with this type of lawlessness, violence and brutality. Unacceptable, unconscionable, and it's un-American.
ED O'KEEFE: Yeah, and we went over this with Tom Homan a little earlier. Of course, they point out that assaults against ICE officers have gone up over 1,300% this past year, from about 275 compared to 19 the year before. So there are some legitimate concerns about those agents being targeted, but your broader point about--
REP. JEFFRIES: --We're going to- yeah--
ED O'KEEFE:-- whether or not law enforcement should behave the same as our law enforcement is heard.
REP. JEFFRIES: Yes, and we're going to continue, of course, to encourage the American people to exercise their constitutional rights, their freedom of assembly and their freedom of speech and their freedom of expression peacefully, as we saw overwhelmingly done in Minneapolis.
ED O'KEEFE: All right, well we'll stay tuned on the shutdown and the negotiations. Let me ask you a few other things while we have you. First of all, you're a member of the Gang of Eight who gets briefed on national security matters. The Pentagon is reportedly planning for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if diplomacy fails and the president opts to attack. What do you know about those plans? Or what would you want to learn as a member of the Gang of Eight?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, the administration, as has been the case since the very beginning of this presidency, has been slow to provide information both to the Gang of Eight members of Congress, the legislative leadership and the top Democrats and Republicans on the Intel Committee and certainly hasn't provided a significant amount of information to Congress in general. These people within the administration, the extremists, they don't seem to believe that Congress is a separate and co-equal branch of government. We are. In fact, the power to declare war is exclusively given to Congress in Article I of the United States Constitution. Now, the American people want Donald Trump and Republicans to actually keep their promise and focus on driving down the high cost of living and fixing our broken health care system. It was Donald Trump, who promised, in fact, that costs will go down on day one. Costs haven't gone down. We're in the midst of an affordability crisis that hasn't been resolved. Perhaps the president should focus on making life better for the American people. Period. Full stop.
ED O'KEEFE: I hear you on that. I want to remind our viewers of the current tick tock tight margins in the House. You've got to net at least three seats to take the majority at this point. I want to play for you part of what you had to say about the 2026 elections when you were asked this past Thursday. Take a listen.
(BEGIN TAPE)
REP. JEFFRIES: We only need to net three. It's happening. Democrats are going to take back control of the House, and the only question is, what's the margin?
(END TAPE)
ED O'KEEFE: Right now, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee considers 44 of the 435 seats in the House in play, including, you just added five new ones this past week, South Central Virginia, a district in South Carolina, southern Minnesota, central Colorado and the at-large seat in Montana. Parts of the country where Democrats don't normally win elections, we should point out. So if the election were held today, at minimum, at minimum, how many seats do you see Democrats winning?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, if the election were held today, we're taking back control of the House of Representatives, and I'm not convinced that it would necessarily be close. But these are battles that are going to be waged, district by district by district, we know we're winning seats now in deep red territory. We saw that in Miami in December, where we won the mayor's race for the first time in 30 years by 20 points. And then in January, of course, we flipped a seat in the Texas State Senate that Donald Trump had just won by 17 points. The Democratic candidate won it by 14. That was a 31 point over performance. And then just last weekend in Louisiana, we flipped the House seat that Trump had won by 14. We won that- or 13--
ED O'KEEFE: So you won it–
REP. JEFFRIES: --by 24 points. That was a 37 point over performance. My point is we're winning across the country, in blue states and purple states and red states, because the American people know we're the only ones focused on driving down the high cost of living, fixing our broken health care system and making sure that immigration enforcement is fair and just.
ED O'KEEFE: You've got to get at least three. Twenty to 25 seats, all 44 seats. What do you think right now? Give me a number.
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, I'm not in the prediction business. I'm in the let's win on behalf of the American people so we can end this national nightmare business.
ED O'KEEFE: All right. Leader Jeffries, to be continued on the shutdown and on the midterms. We appreciate you spending some time with us this morning. We'll talk to you soon, and we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.

US Navy intercepts Iran-linked tanker in high seas operation

ALBAWABA - On Sunday, the U.S. Department of Defense said that American military forces had tracked a sanctioned oil tanker from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, where they boarded it. Officials said this was part of a larger effort to stop illegal oil shipments linked to Venezuela.
The Pentagon says that U.S. forces boarded the ship Veronica 3 at night and followed what it called standard procedures for maritime visits, inspections, interdictions, and boarding. Officials said that the tanker tried to avoid being detained by orders from President Donald Trump.
"The vessel tried to defy the detention order, hoping to escape," the Pentagon said in a statement posted on X. It went on to say that U.S. forces followed the tanker as it moved through several maritime zones before intercepting it and stopping it in the Indian Ocean.
For years, the U.S. has put sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. Allegedly, Venezuela has used a network of ships with fake flags, known as a "shadow fleet," to move crude oil into international markets.
In December, President Trump ordered the detention of sanctioned tankers to put more pressure on Nicolás Maduro, who was then President. Maduro was later arrested in January during a U.S. military operation.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says that the Veronica 3, which flies the Panamanian flag, is subject to U.S. sanctions because of Iran.
The Pentagon has released video of American soldiers getting on the tanker. But defense officials didn't say for sure if the ship has been formally taken or put under U.S. control. The Pentagon told the Associated Press in a follow-up email that it had no more information than what was already in its public statement.
The interception is part of a larger plan by the U.S. to stop the flow of oil that is not allowed and make enforcement stricter in international waters.

DOJ memo with list of names further muddies water in Epstein case

A Justice Department letter explaining redactions in newly released files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has put a spotlight on an extensive list of public figures named in the documents, intensifying criticism from lawmakers who say the approach obscures rather than clarifies accountability.
The six-page letter, first reported by Politico and later detailed by The Hill, was sent to the leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees as required by law.
It outlines the categories of redactions applied to the Epstein files and includes a compilation of “government officials and politically exposed persons” referenced anywhere in the materials.
According to the Justice Department, the list encompasses individuals mentioned in a wide range of contexts, from direct communications with Epstein or his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell to indirect references such as media clippings or third-party reporting.
The letter does not specify how or why each name appears, nor does it distinguish between substantive involvement and incidental mention.
That lack of context has fueled bipartisan frustration. Lawmakers argue that placing well-known figures on a single list – without explanation – risks conflating people connected to criminal conduct with those named only tangentially.
The list includes numerous high-profile names, including President Donald Trump, despite no accompanying details about the nature of their appearance in the files.
Rep. Ro Khanna said the department was “purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email,” criticizing the decision to group unrelated figures together without clarification. He urged the department to release the full records while redacting only survivors’ identities.
"To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files, is absurd," he added.
He urged officials to "Release the full files. Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor's names."
The controversy follows complaints from members of Congress who reviewed unredacted materials at a Justice Department facility this week and said large portions were masked unnecessarily.
Department officials have defended the redactions as necessary to protect victims and sensitive information, while acknowledging that the list was intended to provide transparency about who is referenced in the files.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche criticized lawmakers who publicly disclosed some previously concealed names, arguing that doing so “forced the unmasking of completely random people” with no meaningful connection to Epstein or Maxwell. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon echoed that view, accusing critics of elevating political considerations over due process.
Separately, Rep. Nancy Mace challenged the department’s legal justification for withholding additional details, questioning whether claims of work product privilege would withstand judicial scrutiny.

US plans to stay in NATO, Rubio says
According to Ukrinform, he said this at a press conference with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.
"As for NATO, I don't understand – the United States has thousands and thousands of troops deployed to the NATO mission. And we've made very clear, I think it was made very clear at the summit just a few days ago or at the meeting of the defense minister level. We are not leaving NATO. We are not leaving," Rubio said.
He noted that the redeployment of troops from one country to another has always taken place.
Rubio added that there is no more important duty for any state than the ability to defend its people and its country.
Rubio said that that was why they talked about the importance of NATO partners having the appropriate capabilities. He added that the stronger their allies are, the stronger they all are together.
As previously reported, Volodymyr Zelensky and Marco Rubio discussed strengthening Ukraine's air defense and the next steps in negotiations in a trilateral format during talks in Munich.

The findings from five European governments that Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was killed with poison are “troubling,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday.
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday that Russia poisoned Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, leading to his death in a penal colony two years ago. Moscow dismissed the accusation.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” news agency Reuters quoted Rubio as telling reporters at a press conference in Slovakia on Sunday.

Türkiye sends drillship to Somalia for first overseas mission
Energy minister calls deployment historic step in offshore push
MERSIN, Türkiye
Türkiye on Sunday dispatched its deep-sea drillship Cagri Bey to Somalia for its first mission abroad, a move Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar called a historic step in the country’s offshore energy drive.
Speaking at a ceremony at Tasucu Port in Mersin, Bayraktar said the vessel is expected to reach Mogadishu in about 45 days and begin drilling in April at the Curad-1 well.
Türkiye and Somalia signed agreements in 2024 covering onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration. The seismic vessel Oruc Reis previously completed surveys in three offshore blocks.
With the addition of Cagri Bey and Yildirim, the number of drillships in Türkiye’s fleet has risen to six, Bayraktar said. Together with the seismic vessels Oruc Reis and Barbaros Hayrettin Pasa, Türkiye now has the world’s fourth-largest offshore exploration fleet, he said.
Since the beginning of the year, Türkiye has signed strategic agreements with US-based ExxonMobil and Chevron and UK-based BP in oil and gas exploration, Bayraktar said. Another overseas offshore partnership agreement with an international company is planned for next week, he added.
Bayraktar said Türkiye aims for its national oil company to reach production of around 500,000 barrels of oil and gas per day by 2028, with a longer-term goal of increasing capacity to 1 million barrels per day.
“I firmly believe that Cagri Bey, which we are assigning to search for oil outside our territorial waters for the first time, will elevate Türkiye-Somalia relations to a higher level,” Bayraktar said, wishing the crew a safe and successful mission.

WASHINGTON, February 15. /TASS/. The United States has intercepted another tanker in the Indian Ocean that was sailing from the Caribbean, the Pentagon said.
"Overnight, U.S. forces conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding of the Veronica III without incident in the INDOPACOM (the United States Indo-Pacific Command - TASS) area of responsibility," the US Department of War wrote on its X page. "The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine —hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
No further details were provided.
On February 9, the Pentagon reported the interception of the Aquila II tanker in the Indian Ocean that was allegedly operating in violation of Washington's sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Pentagon used Anthropic’s AI model, Claude, as part of its operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
The newspaper cites people familiar with the matter, saying the Department of War leveraged Claude in last month's raid as part of a technology suite provided by Palantir, another American technology company used extensively by the United States government.
Both the Wall Street Journal and Axios report that someone at Anthropic asked someone at Palantir how exactly Claude was used in the operation.
Technology correspondent Peter O'Brien breaks down what it means for the company that positions itself as a champion of AI safety.

Syria heading in 'positive direction,' trajectory must be maintained: US Secretary of State Rubio
'No one here has ever disputed that the challenge of Syria were going to be a very significant one,' says Marco Rubio
ISTANBUL
Syria is moving in a positive direction despite significant challenges, and the current trajectory must be maintained, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday, defending the Trump administration's decision to work with the new administration.
"No one here has ever disputed that the challenge of Syria were going to be a very significant one," Rubio told reporters alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. He was addressing Republican congressional concerns about Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, who took charge after the 2024 ouster of Bashar al-Assad, potentially moving "backwards."
US Special Envoy for Syria Tom Barrack briefed congressional committees last week with transparency about the difficulties involved, Rubio said, adding: "But we think it's headed in a positive direction, even though it's been tested."
"Is it going to be easy? No. Is it going to be difficult? Absolutely. Is it going to have ups and downs and good days and bad days? No doubt about it," he said, noting there have been some difficult days. "We like the trajectory. We have to keep it on that trajectory."
Rubio outlined two options the US administration faced regarding Syria: allowing the country to fragment into chaos with mass migration, terrorism and Iranian influence, or working with Syrian authorities.
"Guess what? We chose number two," he said, arguing the current outcome "is far better than a Syria that would have been broken up ... with all kinds of fighting going on."
He detailed actions taken to prevent ISIS (Daesh) prisoners from escaping, crediting US President Donald Trump's personal engagement with his Syrian counterpart.
Rubio said Trump urged a halt to fighting to enable transfer of thousands of ISIS prisoners who "could have broken out and created havoc and chaos."
"Al-Sharaa did it. He's kept his word up to this point," Rubio said, noting prisoners have been moved to Iraq, preventing them "running crazy all over the place and threatening us in the future."
ISIS detainees had been released by the YPG/SDF terror group from the al-Shaddadi prison in northeastern Hasakah province in January, according to the Syrian Interior Ministry, which held the terror organization responsible. The Syrian government recaptured all prisoners.

Lindsey Vonn is preparing to fly back to the US with more surgeries to come, team official tells AP
The chief of the U.S. Ski Team says Lindsey Vonn is preparing to fly back to her home country a week after her terrifying head-over-heels crash in the Olympic downhill
- Bookmark
Lindsey Vonn was preparing to fly back to her home country on Sunday after her terrifying head-over-heels crash in the Olympic downhill, the U.S. Ski Team's chief told The Associated Press.
Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, told the AP the team’s medical staff has been coordinating Vonn’s recovery since the crash and subsequent helicopter evacuation at the Milan Cortina Games and would try to accompany her home. Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
“We’re working through all of that at the moment,” Goldschmidt said. “We’ve got a great team around helping her and she’ll go back to the U.S. for further surgeries.”
Spectators tuning in to see Vonn attempt to win a medal at age 41 with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were thrown into shock when the American standout got hooked on a gate 13 seconds into her run – resulting in a spinning, air-born crash that sent her careening down the Dolomite mountain.
“The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury,” said Goldschmidt, who was in attendance for the fall. “There’s a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.
“I mean putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes actually on the broadcast it’s really hard to get that across,” Goldschmidt added. “Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won’t have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports.”
Vonn herself has no regrets.
“When I think back on my crash, I didn’t stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences,” Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. “I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.
“But just because I was ready, that didn’t guarantee me anything. Nothing in life is guaranteed. That’s the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don’t try you’ll never know,” Vonn added.
Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, “She’s not in pain. She’s in a stable condition.
“She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way,” Goldschmidt said. “But what she’s done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they’re winning.”

Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass says 'cinema is a political act' after Berlin festival row
The start of this year's Berlin Film Festival was marked by a row over how far film should venture into politics but for prominent French-Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass, "everything we do is a political act".
Abbass is starring in two films being presented at this year's Berlinale festival and in an AFP interview she emphasised the importance of a politically engaged approach to cinema.
At Thursday's opening press conference jury president Wim Wenders sparked controversy by saying "we cannot really enter the field of politics", in response to a question about Germany's support for Gaza.
"I don't agree," Abbass told AFP.
"There's a lack of courage among people in the film world - among some, not all," said Abbass, who gained global attention for her role as Marcia Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.
She recognised that Wenders's remarks were "taken out of context", as he did talk about cinema's capacity to "change the world", albeit in a different way from party politics.
Nevertheless, Abbass said she was glad to see filmmakers at this year's festival "commit to amplifying stories and voices of minorities, oppressed people, people experiencing bombardment, genocides".
"Today more than ever, if we don't tackle these subjects, we're making art for art's sake, and that's something that doesn't interest me."
'Act of resistance'
Abbass, who was born in Nazareth, l but has been living in France for 37 years, stars in two films at the festival with striking political messages.
"In a Whisper" by Tunisian director Leyla Bouzid addresses the issue of LGBTQ life in Tunisia, where same-sex relationships are illegal.
"In some Arab countries, it's really a very sensitive subject and we need to talk about it," says Abbass, while noting that homophobia is by no means confined to that part of the world.
In "Only Rebels Win" by Lebanese filmmaker Danielle Arbid, Abbass plays a Christian Palestinian living in Beirut who faces a backlash from those around her because of her relationship with a South Sudanese Muslim migrant 40 years her junior.
Israeli bombardments between September and November 2024 forced the production to relocate from Beirut to a studio near Paris, where the team deployed creative solutions to recreate the Lebanese capital.
Abbass said the circumstances turned the film into "an act of resistance".
When the bombardment of Beirut began, "I told Danielle: 'Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll follow you, because this film has to get made'."
Academy's 'open-mindedness'
Before starting on "Only Rebels Win", Abbass had just finished working on "Palestine 36" by Annemarie Jacir, a depiction of the Palestinian uprising against the British Mandate in 1936.
That film almost did not happen because of the war in Gaza, which has killed over 72,000 Palestinians according to the health ministry in the enclave. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has been labelled as genocidal by the UN, experts and several world leaders.
Abbass said that the "the film waited eight months so that it could be shot," with production forced to move to Jordan instead of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Abbass said that the team decided that "at a certain point, we couldn't keep being subject to" the decisions of the Israeli government.
She also welcomed the Academy's decision to include three films highlighting the Palestinian experience in its shortlist for best international feature film: "Palestine 36", Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab" and Cherien Dabis's "All That's Left of You".
Only Kaouther Ben Hania's film ultimately made the final list of five nominees.
But Abbass praised the "open-mindedness" of the Academy to bring these films "almost to the final stages of the Oscars" after Israel's miliary onslaught in Gaza.

Iran’s top general warns Trump new war would be 'lesson'

Iran’s top military commander warned Sunday that any US war against Tehran would serve as “a lesson” for President Donald Trump, as tensions continue to simmer in the region.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said that the US president should understand he would be entering “a lesson-giving battle.”
Trump said on Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen,” as tensions escalate amid the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
He announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, would soon head to the region in case ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran fail.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” he said. “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
Rising tensions
The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the Gulf region, having been dispatched last month amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Mousavi described Trump’s comments as “unworthy of a president” and “reckless.”
He said that if Trump intends to wage war, he should not speak of “negotiations,” referring to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy between the two sides that resumed earlier this month.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on February 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Diplomatic channels
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, according to Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who confirmed the meeting in an interview on Sunday.
He said Washington must demonstrate its commitment to reaching an agreement aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said. “If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”

ALBAWABA - The head of Iran's military has given U.S. President Donald Trump a stern warning, saying that any military action against Tehran would hurt Washington's position as the world's most powerful country. Iran is getting ready for another round of talks with the US about nuclear issues in Geneva.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, the head of Iran's armed forces, said that any fight with Iran would teach Trump what he called a "historic lesson." He said that a war would effectively end America's ability to control the world. Mousavi also asked why Trump talks about negotiations if he wants to start a fight.

Iranian officials, on the other hand, have lowered expectations for the talks that are coming up. Ebrahim Rezaei, who is on the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said that Tehran isn't too hopeful about how the talks in Geneva will go.
Rezaei says that the Iranian delegation has come up with a list of proposals for the talks. He did, however, stress that Iran will not agree to stop enriching uranium during this round or send its stockpile of enriched uranium to other countries. He went on to say that the United States has accepted these limits and made it clear that the talks in Geneva will not be about Iran's missile program or its policies in the region.
Continued Diplomatic Efforts
On Tuesday, Oman will lead talks in Geneva about Iran's nuclear program and other ways to lower tensions. Oman hosted indirect talks between the two sides earlier this month, on February 6. On the same day, President Trump said that more talks would happen "early next week," but he didn't say when or where.
Washington and Israel keep saying that Iran is trying to get nuclear weapons, but Tehran says that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful purposes, like making electricity.
Iran has said many times that it would respond strongly to any military action and that Western sanctions must be lifted in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.

US not planning to leave NATO — Rubio

BRATISLAVA, February 15. /TASS/. The United States is not going to withdraw from NATO, with thousands of American soldiers taking part in the alliance’s mission, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
"We're not leaving NATO. We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," he told a news conference after talks with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, when asked to comment on the United States’ status within NATO amid reports on the reduction of US forces deployed to Europe.
According to Rubio, Washington does not view European countries’ bigger influence within NATO as a negative thing and wants to see Europe as a partner rather than its subordinate. "We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. We want to work with our allies. We want to work in cooperation with you," he said.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said earlier this week that it would take time to reduce the number of US troops stationed in Europe. In his words, Washington wants to "pivot more towards Asia."
In 2025, the Pentagon redeployed a brigade from the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army from Romania back to its home base in the state of Kentucky.
Late in 2025, the US Congress approved a defense budget that explicitly barred the Pentagon from reducing the number of American troops stationed in Europe below 76,000 for more than 45 days.

BRATISLAVA, February 15. /TASS/. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has spoken in favor of dialogue between the West and Russia.
"We must engage in dialogue with Russia. We must engage in dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin," he said at a joint news conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as quoted by the TA-3 television channel.
According to Fico, a direct dialogue with the Russian leadership will promote the soonest settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. The crisis could have been ended three months after its outbreak but "some Western politicians" hampered this, he recalled.
He slammed the European Union’s decision to issue a 90-billion-euro loan to Ukraine, with 60 billion of this sum to be spent to purchase weapons. Sanctions, in his words, will not be able to stop the advance of Russian forces. He also said that the European Union is now in a profound crisis.

President Herzog to press for anti-gun legislation, meets with Arab victims of violent crime

President Isaac Herzog announced on Sunday that he will press for anti-gun legislation.
Contrary to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who advocates that security can be better assured if more civilians have gun permits, Herzog believes that the more guns there are in civilian hands, the greater the security risk.
The president made this point repeatedly on Sunday, when addressing a delegation of bereaved Arab parents, grandparents, siblings, and other relatives whose loved ones were murdered over the past two to three years.
Herzog said that every local authority should make the banning of guns and violence of any kind a top priority. It is a terrible thing, he said, when one human being shoots another for the purpose of killing them.
The delegation, comprising mostly women, included three men and was led by Qasem Awad, a former mayor of Tamra whose son, Dr. Abdullah Awad, was brutally murdered while treating patients at a health clinic in Kfar Yasif.
Awad previously met with Herzog when the president, alarmed by the escalation of violence in Arab society, visited Sakhnin on January 29.
“We Arabs love you because you tell the truth and we need people to listen to you and to listen to us,” Awad told Herzog when they met again on Sunday.
'We are all law-abiding citizens - help us'
Awad reiterated what other prominent Arab citizens have said: they cannot fight this battle alone.
“We need the help of the Jewish people,” the former mayor said, adding that many Jews are already supporting the struggle against violence in the Arab sector.
Speaking primarily of his own family, but also in reference to the families of the delegation, Awad said, “We are all law-abiding citizens. Help us. Tell us what to do.” The meeting as such was extremely emotional as each member of the delegation told the story of a close relative whose needless death had created an extreme void within the family.
One of the most touching of these stories was of a woman whose abusive husband kept telling her that he was going to throw her out. The woman reported him to the police, who took no action. Two days later, she was dead, leaving behind three children aged 15, seven, and nine months. This was one of the rare cases in which the police later apprehended the perpetrator, said the dead woman’s sister, “But now there are three orphans without a mother or a father.”
Herzog was visibly upset by this information, instructing his staff to obtain full details so the story could be widely published.
One of the delegates told Herzog that in Arab society, when a woman is killed, it is usually because she is perceived as having besmirched the family’s honor. Nevertheless, none of the murdered females related to members of that specific delegation were victims of honor killings; none had done anything that could have invited malice or embarrassed their families.
Herzog was asked throughout the morning to help do away with violence. Members of the delegation refused to accept that his position is merely ceremonial and not executive, telling him he has the influence to effect change.
Almost every speaker reported police inaction, saying law enforcement showed little if any interest in any case involving Arab victims, and failed to provide information.
Due to the frequency of violent killings, children panic in fear whenever they hear gunfire, said one of the delegates.
There was also an inference to racism. More than one delegate noted that “Arab blood is no less important than Jewish blood.”
Herzog said that the violence and killing in Arab society are a stain on both the government and the nation. The president pledged to do his utmost to make legislators aware that what has evolved is not just an Arab problem, but a national issue that affects all sectors of Israeli society.

Turkey opens three mosques in Gaza as Ankara expands religious influence

Turkey’s Diyanet Foundation has opened three mosques in Gaza, according to Turkish state-run broadcaster TRT. A video online showed members of the Turkish charity in blue vests assisting in refurbishing and reopening the mosques.
The report said that the work is designed to enable suitable places for worship during Ramadan. This is part of Ankara’s efforts to increase its influence in Gaza.
According to the report, the organization opened the Abdullah Azzam Mosque in the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza, the Huda Mosque in Jabalya’s refugee camp, and the al-Isra Mosque in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood. These areas were heavily damaged during the Israel-Hamas War.
Regarding the name given to the first mosque listed, Abdullah Yusuf Azzam was an Islamist jihadist of Palestinian and Jordanian background. Although this was not made clear in the broadcast, it appears that the mosque was indeed named after him.
According to a paper by the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, “While al-Qaeda and Hamas have become household terms, far less familiar is the man behind the idea of al-Qaeda, the Palestinian Sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, who also did much to support the establishment and entrenchment of Hamas.”
A mosque with a similar name is also located in Nuseirat in central Gaza.
The mosques serve as a foundation of 'brotherhood'
The Diyanet Foundation states on its website that it has conducted work on nine mosques in “Palestine,” but does not mention the three most recent ones. The organization said that it works to build mosques that serve as a foundation of “brotherhood.”
It also noted that “today, mosques are rising with the efforts of the Presidency of Religious Affairs and our foundation to deliver the Adhans [the mosque’s calls to prayer] to every corner of our country and every continent of the earth with the donations made by our beloved nation.”
The work is clearly government-backed and part of Ankara’s mission to engage with Islamic communities worldwide.
To this end, Turkey is working to grow its influence in Gaza. One way it does this is via religious charities. The organization noted that the “Diyanet Foundation, which was established to support the activities of the Presidency of Religious Affairs, delivering religious services to a wider audience and raising the next generation who will take part in religious services, has become a significant civil society movement in our country today.”
The foundation has “1,003 branches and a wide range of activities and international aid activities in 149 countries around the world, from education to culture, social and charitable services to supporting religious services.”
Fidan met with Ali Shaath
In another sign of Ankara’s growing involvement, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also met with Ali Shaath of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). This is the technocratic Palestinian organization that the Board of Peace backs to transition governance in Gaza away from Hamas.
In the past, Ankara has hosted Hamas leaders for meetings and backed Hamas. It is unclear whether this meeting represents a change.
Citing diplomatic sources, Turkey’s state-run media reported that Fidan received Shaath in the Turkish capital.
TRT went on to say, “The NCAG, formed after the October ceasefire in Gaza, is a Palestinian governance body under recent peace efforts to oversee Gaza’s civil administration and reconstruction, with Turkey offering diplomatic backing and humanitarian support to help stabilize and rebuild the besieged enclave.”
Further, “The NCAG said on Saturday that preparations for handing over the institutions of the sector pave the way for its management during the transitional phase.”
Per that same report, “Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the removal of obstacles” to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, and the NCAG “considered that the statements issued from within the sector regarding the readiness to hand over all public institutions pave the way for enabling the committee to fully assume its responsibilities in managing the transitional phase.”
The meeting with Shaath and the support for mosques in Gaza are part of the multi-pronged efforts by Ankara to increase its influence and also maintain its current level of control in Gaza.

IDF links Hamas command activity to Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza

The Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, which Doctors Without Borders has left, is not just a weapons storage spot for terror, but a full-fledged Hamas headquarters, the IDF said on Sunday.
"For over two years, the IDF and the defense establishment have warned about the cynical use by terrorist organizations in Gaza of hospitals and humanitarian shelters as human shields to conceal terrorist activity," stated the military.
Following the statement made by Doctors Without Borders, "regarding the reduction of its operations due to the presence of armed individuals, the IDF indeed possesses intelligence indicating that Nasser Hospital is being used as a headquarters and military post for senior Hamas commanders and operatives in southern Gaza."
"This is an important decision, but one that comes too late. This is further proof that reinforces the necessity for the disarmament of the Hamas terror organization," concluded the IDF.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Saturday announced the suspension of all noncritical medical operations in Nasser Hospital after reports emerged of armed men using the facility to move weapons and interrogate patients.
“In recent months, in Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital,” the nonprofit organization said in a statement published on its website.
It also specified that these situations occurred in parts of the medical compound where the MSF is not conducting activities.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts – including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” MSF said, adding that “these incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
The organization said that “MSF formally expressed our strong concern to the relevant authorities, and emphasized the incompatibility of such violations with MSF’s medical mission. Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity, to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care.”
According to a Reuters report, this directive was also applied to several other hospitals in southern Gaza where armed men were spotted.
The Post visits Shifa Hospital
In November 2023, The Jerusalem Post visited Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza up close and saw the extensive, heavy, and regular weapons Hamas had been hiding there.
The stash included rocket-propelled grenades, large offensive drones capable of dropping grenades on soldiers, heavy rifles, and other weapons.
In addition, the Post entered the tunnel network Hamas had been using under Shifa Hospital, which included extensive rooms for various functions and branched in multiple directions to connect the area to other parts of northern Gaza and southern Gaza.

Rubio says US does not dispute Navalny poisoning assessment by Europeans

United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio called "troubling" a report by five European allies blaming Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs, adding that Washington had no reason to question it on Sunday.
"We obviously are aware of the report. It's a troubling report. We're aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly... we don't have any reason to question it," Rubio told reporters at a news conference in Brastislava during a visit to Slovakia.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands on Saturday said analyses of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
Russia decries 'Western propaganda hoax'
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to Russia's state news agency TASS.
When asked why the United States did not join the statement, Rubio said this was an endeavor by them.
"Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. We chose - Doesn't mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn't our endeavor. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing with based on the intelligence they've gathered." Rubio said.
"We're not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there," he added.
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.

MSC: With Iran in crisis, is Europe just a spectator?
February 15, 2026Ongoing tensions in Iran featured prominently at this year's Munich Security Conference (MSC), coming after the Islamist regime's deadly crackdown on protesters, and with US President Donald Trump continuing to put pressure on Tehran to end its nuclear program.
As Iran's hardline rulers hang on to power after the largest anti-regime protests in decades, Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late Iranian king and a political activist-in-exile, was active at the conference, pleading his case for regime change in Iran.
At a panel about Iran's future on Friday, as well as at a press conference on Saturday, Pahlavi called out the Iranian regime's suppression of human rights, especially the brutal crackdown on citizens during the anti-regime protests in January, which rights groups say killed thousands of people.
Pahlavi, who many Iranians think can unite the nation against 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's government, even presented a roadmap at the MSC for Iran's political future and a "transitional government."
After a call to action from Pahlavi, some 250,000 people took part in a demonstration in Munich on Saturday against the Iranian regime and in support of a Pahlavi-led opposition.
"I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future," he said in a speech during the rally.
"I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box."
But the creation of any transitional government depends on the collapse of the current regime.
Despite the current unprecedented challenges to its power, the regime is carrying on and has also reportedly intensified its domestic oppression.
Still, there were extensive discussions at the MSC about the possibility of regime change in Iran.
Will the US strike Iran?
The Iranian opposition-in-exile has signaled that it expects the United States to launch strikes that would eventually result in the dismantling of the fundamentalist regime.
During the anti-regime protests, US President Donald Trump famously claimed that help was coming for Iranians.
Now the Trump administration is engaged in negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program, something which analysts say is unlikely to yield a clear result.
"I think a lot of Iranians inside and outside hope that an intervention that will neutralize the regime's instrument of repression will finally give us an opportunity for a final solution," Pahlavi said at an MSC panel, arguing that he was asking for a "humanitarian intervention" to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process.
After Trump stepped back from threats of military intervention over protest deaths, he returned to threats of force if the Iranian regime did not negotiate a new "deal" with the US on its nuclear program.
Last week, the US sent a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Arabian Sea, with Trump warning on Friday that it would be a "very bad day" for Iran if the regime does not make a deal.
Pahlavi admitted that the US president needs to give diplomacy a chance before opting for a military solution. He maintains that President Trump knows the Iranian people still believe in the president's promise made during the height of the demonstrations in January.
However, Karim Sadjadpour, a policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said regime change is easier said than done.
"Everybody in Washington, including President Trump, thinks that if they could push a button and get rid of the Iranian regime, they absolutely would," he told an MSC panel, adding that the Trump administration is possibly concerned about fallout such as that seen after US military intervention in Iraq and Libya.
However, Sadjadpour didn't rule out the possibility of a US strike on Iran.
"In 2018, Trump left the [2015] nuclear deal. In 2020, he assassinated Qassem Soleimani [military leader and Khamenei's close aide]. Last summer, he dropped 14 bunker-busters on Iran's nuclear facilities," Sadjadpour said, adding he believes that the chances of Trump striking Iran are higher than the two sides reaching a nuclear deal.
Europe prefers diplomacy to force
As the US continues to put pressure on the Iranian regime with the threat of force, the EU has urged deescalation, and has shown preference towards using sanctions and offering support for civil society within Iran.
In January, when the Trump administration seemed close to striking Iran, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told a press conference alongside EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas that the Iranian people "don't want regime change forced by external powers" and warned of unforeseen consequences.
Kallas said history is "full of examples" where regimes have been toppled, "but the question is what comes after."
"You need the alternatives, really from inside, to have a functioning state."
For Iran's exiled crown prince Pahlavi, the Europeans holding off on endorsing US military action against the regime could be seen as equivalent to doing nothing to help force the regime out.
Although Europe plays a major role in sanctioning Iran over its nuclear program, should the US strike the regime, statements at the MSC offered no clarity on what stance Europe would take, as officials have continued to emphasize diplomacy over use of force.
In 2015, major European powers helped broker a landmark agreement aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program, particularly uranium enrichment, in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in July 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 countries (US, UK, France, China, Russia, plus Germany).
It was dubbed as "horrible" and "one sided" by Trump, who pulled the US out of the deal in 2018 during his first term as president, much to the consternation of Washington's European partners.
As Trump pushes for a new nuclear deal with Iran, with a military option on the table, the Europeans may be forced to wait and see.
"The starting point must be the Iranian people demanding freedom, and Europe must align its actions with that reality," said European Parliament President Roberta Metsola at the MSC.
She argued that the EU's decision to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization marks a turning point, adding that the time for "routine diplomacy" was over.
"Europe must send a clear signal to those risking their lives in protest: We stand with you," she stressed.
No more business as usual with Iran?
Last year, Europe also reimposed UN sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's violations of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear agreement, piling more financial pressure on the regime. The protests in January were partly driven by economic grievances including high unemployment and inflation.
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has admitted that business as usual with Iran might not be possible anymore. After the US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in July 2025, Tehran stopped cooperating with the IAEA.
"This cannot go on forever. There is a political situation here … on our part, we have been making some progress, but these [nuclear] facilities are there, nuclear material is there — notably highly enriched uranium, which we must continue to monitor. So everything goes in parallel," Grossi underlined.
Another round of nuclear talks between US and Iranian representatives is due in Geneva next week with Oman again serving as mediator.

Jess Phillips calls for Epstein files to be catalyst for long-term legislative change

Institutions can be persuaded to take action on violence against women and girls only when some sort of “calamity” or “political scandal” hits the headlines, Jess Phillips has said.
Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said she wanted to use the momentum from the Epstein files to push for long-term legislative change and greater support for survivors, rather than quick-fix reactive policy announcements.
Writing for the Guardian, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley said: “If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims we will have failed, change is all that will suffice.
“The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term. I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the [violence against women and girls] strategy with investment and system change at its heart, but we mustn’t let even that stand still, it must stretch when ambitions are met and it must never only be pulled out and waved around or cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.”
But she added that she felt “weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress”, and criticised an attitude of “bleed first and act second”.
Phillips said Epstein’s victims deserved for the government ensure that “those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again”. She called for investment in prevention so there was “less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today”.
“I have worked on this issue under many governments, it always felt a bit one tone, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment to halve violence against women and children,” she wrote.
There needs to be more than a “commitment”, and instead an aim that is “actually achievable and practically measurable” in order to hold the government to account and create a sense of focus, she added.
To achieve this, Phillips suggested that the NHS should prioritise abuse in the same way as diabetes; schools should be given tools to deal with how abuses affect their pupils to prevent them growing up as perpetrators of abuse or survivors; and addressing the £13bn lost annually in economic output to domestic abuse as a key component of improving economic growth and productivity.
On the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, said halving violence against women and girls over the next 10 years was “a priority and a mission” for Labour and across governmental departments.
“The real focus should be on Epstein’s victims, and also the work that this Labour government has been doing to tackle violence against women and girls,” Cooper said. “So that has to be about listening to women. It also has to be listening to survivors of violence.”

It always takes a calamity – a dreadful murder that reaches every front page, a mass paedophile ring being uncovered, or a political scandal unfolding – to make institutions sit up and act on violence against women and children. These windows of potential energy are never wasted by women’s rights activists. Historically, they have used them to build the #MeToo movement, to fight for legislation change and to push for greater resources for victims.
I’ve done it, many times – “never waste a crisis” is my mantra. In the past few weeks, while the nation’s attention has been on the political fallout from the Epstein files, I have seen the opportunity to push for more, for better. To move beyond the throwaway line about the victims being the most important thing – and to actually make them just that. Deeds not words are what matter. If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims, we will have failed; change is all that will suffice.
That said, I am weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress. I wish that systems and institutions didn’t need us to bleed first and act second. Women ask for this at times of calm, we shouldn’t have to scream.
When we were writing Labour’s violence against women and girls strategy, this was always at the forefront of my mind. The fact that we couldn’t once again just have some nice prepackaged policy that we could pull off a shelf when the going got tough. It had to be long-term, systemic change in our police, in our courts, in our health services, our armed forces, our housing, our schools. We had to start really focusing on preventing the terrible harm from happening in the first place, not just trying to make nicer plasters to cover up the cuts and bruises. We had to get other government departments to realise that the safety, security and wellbeing of half the population wasn’t just a Home Office issue.
I have worked on this issue under many governments – it always felt a bit one note, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment to halve violence against women and children. Of course, I want to end all violence against women and girls, just like I want world peace, but committing to that would be nothing more than a throwaway line, an aspiration, a pipe dream. Our aim had to be actually achievable and practically measurable.
No UK government has ever dared or cared to put a number on the problem before, because this issue has always been seen as too big to deal with or too likely to fail. Our target of halving violence against women and girls within a decade matters to me – it holds us to account, it focuses the minds of those with levers of power and demands that they pull them. Long-term, persistent, consistent, backaching and heartbreaking work is the only thing that is even going to remotely shift the dial on this issue.
The NHS has to take responsibility for the consequences of this abuse just as it would with diabetes. Schools must be given the tools to deal with how these incidents affect their pupils. If children grow up to be perpetrators of abuse or end up as victims, that will ruin their life chances and ability to function in the workplace more completely than not being good at maths. It’s no good having an engineering degree if you end up on the sex offender register – and the growing number of young people becoming perpetrators of these crimes should frighten us all.
Want to tackle growth and productivity? Well, the annual socioeconomic cost for domestic abuse alone is estimated to be £89bn, without even including, rape, sexual harassment, stalking and other abuses. I could go on and cover every area of policy in every government department that would fail if it didn’t stop and think about how this issue will undermine its progress. This is what this government is seeking to do, to really change this thing once and for all – to change the system, not just react.
Epstein’s victims don’t just need me to make sure no UK airport could ever be used to traffic them again. That loophole has been closed, and we will, of course, close any others we need to – but that isn’t enough. They need me to make sure that those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again. They need me to make it so there is less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today; they need me to make sure legislation stops abusers who use naked images and online hideaways to groom them in the first place. They need me to make sure that when they say that they have suffered, not only do they have recourse in the law – but also that their mental health is cared for with therapeutic and social support so that they can recover and live prosperous lives.
I will use the momentum of the current political attention on this subject to get more; I always do and always will. It’s how I have been trained to operate over decades, like the scrappy kid at the dinner table of a large family that I am. But I am damned if I will let these pinch-point moments be the only time those calls are heard. The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term.
I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the strategy with investment and system change at its heart; but even that we must stretch to meet our ambitions, and it must never only be cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.

‘I was so scared’: US trial witnesses allege Alexander brothers worked together to rape women

In their time as real estate brokers, the Israeli-American Alexander brothers – twins Alon and Oren and older brother Tal – were known as “closers”, the salesmen who could a get a sale over finish line, often to wealthy hedge funders who were then making hay in aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
Their technique, one real estate expert explained outside the 26th floor of the federal court house in lower Manhattan last week, was based on the sense that the property salesman “were just like their clients” – young, eager and successful. Kim Kardashian and then-husband Kanye West, Jared and Ivanka Trump were clients.
And like many, they were party animals. Nightclubs in Manhattan, the Hamptons, Miami, Aspen, Tulum and Ibiza were seasonal stops. Tal and Oren, 38, were profiled in the New York Times on “How Two Luxury Real Estate Agents Spend Their Sundays”. The Wall Street Journal followed on the family’s $31m sale of their Miami beach home. US Vogue featured Oren’s wedding to a Brazilian model.
But a far nastier picture of their high life has been on display in court for the past few weeks, where the three brothers are on trial for sex trafficking. Prosecutors have accused each of the three brothers of violent, forcible rape of at least 10 women each and in some cases of threatening them if they spoke of their experiences.
The accomplished real estate “closers”, according to prosecutors, took no chances when it came to their pursuit of sex, and worked together in a conspiracy to lure, incapacitate and attack women.
The three brothers have pleaded not guilty and deny the allegations.
The civil case against Oren and his twin began in March 2024 when they were sued by Kate Whiteman, a woman who said she had met at a Manhattan nightclub in 2012. She claimed they had forced her into an SUV as she was leaving and drove her to the Hamptons, where she was assaulted at a party mansion called Sir Ivan’s Castle. A flood of similar allegations followed.
But Whiteman is not in court to testify. It was reported last month that she was found dead near Sydney late last year. Authorities in New South Wales have said the circumstances of Whiteman’s death “were found to be non-suspicious”.
As the trial entered its third week, the court heard from Abusshan Bodjnoud, a woman who testified that she witnessed an unidentified woman being raped by Tal, 39, and one of the twins in the Hamptons in May 2009. Bodjnoud told jurors she was in the house when a party of men returned and she saw Tal “dragging” a woman who “was not walking on her own” to the pool.
“Then the next thing I heard was a woman screaming and just asking people to stop,” she testified. She said she witnessed Tal and the twin “moaning” as they raped the woman in the hot tub.
Bodjnoud, who said she was “terrified” to intervene, acknowledged she had written “rapist” and “you need to apologize” on the brother’s door before she left the house but acknowledged she had not call 911 and was warned that the Alexander brothers “were very powerful”.
A day earlier, jurors were shown text exchanges the government says showed that the brothers coordinated to secure drugs, including ketamine, Xanax, Ambien and GHB, they allegedly used to incapacitate women, lured using the promise of luxury travel and exclusive experiences.
In one exchange from September 2011, Alon tested about an upcoming party, telling the recipient to “throw some panty dropper pills in the dishes sent to our table”. Attorneys for the defendants have suggested the described some of the references as “crude jokes.”
Maylen Gehret, who is suing Alon and Oren for sexual assault, told the court that Alon raped her in Aspen, Colorado, in 2017 when she was 17. She said she was at a club with two friends when Alon gave her a vodka cranberry. After the second, her head began to feel “really heavy” and she could “barely hold it up”.
The twin took the girls to an empty hotel room and raped her in the bathroom. “It really hurt, and I was so scared,” Gehret testified.
In this, the prosecution phase of the case, other accounts have followed a similar path. But when the defense takes its turn, attorneys are set to argue that both the civil lawsuits and criminal allegations against the brothers are an intertwined conspiracy led by women seeking to extort them.
Outside court last week, their father Shlomi Alexander, who emigrated from Israel to the US to start a successful security company before branching into Miami real estate, claimed the cases had began with a $35m effort to extort him.
Under cross-examination, defense attorneys have pressed witnesses on changes to their testimony, timelines, and claimed that prior statements that don’t align with what the jury heard. Juda Engelmayer, a crisis PR consultant for the defendants, said the challenges to witnesses rarely make the headlines.
“The coverage often highlights the most sensational passages from direct, or the one line on cross where a witness confidently insists they ‘remember’ the single detail anchoring the allegation, while leaving out the broader credibility challenges unfolding in real time”, Engelmayer said.
In opening arguments last month, defense attorney Teny Geragos said the brothers were successful, arrogant young men “who liked and pursued women”, adding “that’s not trafficking. That’s dating. That’s hooking up.”
But she acknowledged the jury might frown upon of their lifestyle and vulgar communications. “Two things can be true at once – you can disapprove of their lifestyle and still find them not guilty”, Geragos said before a courtroom packed with family and supporters of the brothers.

Progressive Texas organizers hail shock win as far-right Republicans left reeling

Chris Tackett started tracking extremism in Texas politics about a decade ago, whenever his schedule as a Little League coach and school board member would allow. At the time, he lived in Granbury, 40 minutes west of Fort Worth. He’d noticed that a local member of the state legislature, Mike Lang, had become a vocal advocate for using public money for private schools – despite the fact that Lang campaigned as a supporter of public education.
With a little research, Tackett found that Lang had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from the Wilks brothers and Tim Dunn, billionaire megadonors whose deep pockets and Christian nationalist views have consumed the Texas GOP. Tackett published his findings on social media, and soon enough, people started asking him to create pie charts of their representatives’ campaign funds. These charts evolved into the organisation See It. Name It. Fight It.
“There’s so many people out there that are so busy with their daily lives, they’re walking past and not even seeing some of these bad things going on,” he says. “So that’s the first step: you have to see this thing.”
Tackett and his wife Mendi, the organisation’s sole members, now live in Fort Worth, where they’re part of a scrappy community of progressives and anti-extremist organizers who are building momentum amid their town’s deeply embedded Christian nationalism. Tarrant county, in which Fort Worth is the largest city, provided a chilling preview of Texas’s gerrymandering efforts, and the county is widely regarded as a hotbed for far-right actors. But most recently, the county was the site of a Democratic victory that sent the Texas Republican party reeling.
Taylor Rehmet, a Democrat and local union leader, won a runoff for a state Senate seat that’s been held by Republicans since 1992. What’s more, he bested Republican Leigh Wambsganss despite having one-tenth as much money. Much of Wambsganss’s funding came from Dunn and the Wilks brothers.
Republicans blamed low turnout for Rehmet’s victory, while pundits opined that the Trump administration’s unpopularity was to blame. But people in Fort Worth say local organizing was central to the upset – and it will be key to any future victories in Texas, too.
Alexander Montalvo, a longtime grassroots organizer in Tarrant county, points to several examples where local advocates have successfully rallied for causes they believe. There was the pushback against a proposal to split a local school district. Then there were the school board elections last May, where every candidate endorsed by the Christian nationalist cellphone carrier Patriot Mobile lost their election. Patriot Mobile – where Wambsganss works as an executive – had previously racked up several wins across Tarrant county, effectively taking over multiple boards.
Now, after those May losses and Rehmet’s win, the company’s political influence is in doubt.
“There is something very local here in Tarrant county that is happening and that has been happening,” he says. “There is a collective groundswell that’s been building.”
Tackett says he’s in close contact with organizers like Montalvo and other Tarrant County residents who meet up for what’s called the “817 Gather”: a monthly meeting of people activated by the extremism that’s run rampant in their area.
“It’s a bunch of folks that are Black, brown, white, mostly progressive, but we’ve got a few folks that play into that former Republican space, as well,” he says. “It’s not about Republican versus Democrat. It’s really all about what we stand for, because we can agree that public education is foundational to the success of our democracy. We can agree that a person should have rights over their own body, and it should be easier to vote, not harder to vote.”
People have found their roles within this community, and in one way or another, their efforts always lead back to voting. Montalvo and fellow organizer EJ Carrion, one of the hosts of the local podcast the 817 Pod, frequently inspire large crowds for local city council and county commissioner meetings. The Tacketts publish social media videos spotlighting their concerned neighbors – often as they speak at those local meetings – and putting local extremists on display.
Before Rehmet’s victory, their organisation shared a video of Wambsganss appearing on the podcast of former Trump consigliere Steve Bannon. After the election, the Tacketts published a video breaking down how local Republicans reacted to the Rehmet victory at a meeting held the day after Rehmet’s win.
In the video, a candidate for Texas agriculture commissioner claimed Texas was at risk of falling under Sharia law. Others framed politics as a spiritual battle that will determine whether the US remains a Christian nation. That meeting was hosted by For Liberty & Justice, a local political organisation affiliated with a Fort Worth church called Mercy Culture which is seeking actively encourage conservative Christians to run for office and break down barriers between church and state in the US.
When it comes to Christian nationalism in Tarrant County, multiple people interviewed for this story say no institution looms larger than Mercy Culture.
“Mercy Culture is not just a church,” says Wesley Kirk, a lifelong Fort Worthian and one of the hosts of the 817 Pod. “It’s a political machine. They are organizing people. They are endorsing candidates.”
Chanin Scanlon, a former Fort Worth resident who recently moved to San Antonio, puts it bluntly.
“This is Christian nationalism,” she says. “It’s not subtle. They are very clear about what they want. They want to take over institutions.”
The Tacketts have used their popular social media presence to chronicle Mercy Culture’s rising influence. But Chris Tackett is also still making pie charts. After the Rehmet victory, he dove deep into the data to see if the narrative about low turnout was true. Turnout was down across the board, he found, which undermined the local GOP’s narrative that Republicans who stayed home were the ones to blame.
Using a voter score analysis, Tackett also found that 57% of runoff voters fell into one of two groups: true independents, or “Democratic-leaning voters who regularly vote in Republican primaries because, in ‘deep-red’ Texas, the GOP primary is the only election that matters in most cycles.” (Fifty-seven percent is the total percentage of the electorate that Rehmet won.)
“What we saw wasn’t massive Republican crossover,” he wrote. “It was Democrats – many of whom have been forced to play in GOP primaries for years – finally getting a meaningful choice and showing up.”
Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor, agrees with the idea that Democrats had a strong candidate to back in the runoff.
“I think they figured out the secret sauce to candidate recruitment,” he says of the Democratic party. “Being an authentic person goes a long way for voters these days.”
Montalvo, meanwhile, finds himself motivated by Tackett’s pie chart.
“There’s actually a big enough and a diverse enough base amongst Democratic voters in Tarrant county that if we actually invest in those communities, we have the votes to be able to win,” he says.

Even amid rising economic uncertainty, now is not the time to hug your job

After all the employee protests over the past few years – the “great resignations”, the “quiet quittings”, the “bare-minimum Mondays” and “coffee badgings” – we have finally arrived at “job hugging”.
Amid all the economic uncertainty and the rising costs of everything, people aren’t feeling as confident as they once were. Instead of slacking off while you hunt for something better, everyone’s scared about losing their jobs. With all the news about big corporate layoffs and the ominous and still-undefined threat of AI, it’s understandable that people are hugging their jobs.
A recent report from job search site Monster.com found that nearly half of employed workers say they’re currently staying in their roles longer than they otherwise might, for comfort, security or stability, with three-quarters expecting to remain in the same job for at least two more years.
“Workers are holding on tighter than ever, but not because they’re complacent,” said Vicki Salemi, a career expert at Monster. “It’s because they’re cautious. Job security and stability have become emotional safety nets. The new loyalty is about survival, not necessarily satisfaction.”
If you’re one of these job huggers, then take it from me: you’re killing your future.
I’m not saying you should leave your current job. If you really like the company you’re working at and the work that you’re doing and the people you’re working with, then good for you. But don’t just hug your job. Because – unless what you do doesn’t involve a computer – your job isn’t going to be the same in a very short period of time. It may not even exist at all. Tech companies are rolling out AI-based agents, bots and software that will – in the not-too-distant future – do everything from write press releases, answer customer questions, place orders and reconcile bank accounts. Hugging your existing job is like hugging your sick dog who’s about to be put down. There is no miracle that’s going to save either.
The good news is that your employer is just as confused as you. I’d love to make time stand still. But I see big changes coming for my business too, and I don’t have all the answers. My business depends on my people. I want them to come to me with solutions. I want them to have my back just as much they want me to have theirs. Hugging their existing job may prove their loyalty. But it’s not helping my business. I know that my business will have to adapt to the technology wave that’s fast coming. I’ll be loyal to any worker who is willing to step up and adapt along with me.
Which is why a job hugger hurts employers like me. People are so concerned about losing their job that they only think about what they can do for themselves and not my company. They make decisions to protect what they do. They don’t take risks. They avoid additional work. They are averse to taking chances. They’ll shun responsibility. This can only last for so long.
Business owners like myself are never “hugging” our jobs. We’re constantly looking for new ways to make money. Or cut costs. Or run more efficiently. Job hugging is a form of suicide. If we stay still, we die. It’s no different if you’re an employee.
If you’re not a big fan of the company, don’t just sit there. Look for something else while you still have your existing job. You’re much more marketable (and have a stronger negotiating position) when you’re still employed.
It may seem that clinging to stability is the safe way to go. But it’s a perilous long-term strategy. You’re not learning new skills. You’re not adapting. You’re not taking strategic risks. Job hugging is a losing strategy. Now is not the time to stand still.

Mexico’s Cuba Obsession Puts Its President in a Bind With Trump

Who truly benefits from the delay with Iran?

The standoff with the Islamic Republic of Iran has entered its sixth consecutive week of escalating rhetoric, mutual threats and visible shows of force. The US has continued what officials describe as an unprecedented military buildup in the region, led by the deployment of the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. The move is expected to last at least three weeks.
Iran, for its part, has pressed ahead with propaganda videos and public displays of its military capabilities. At the same time, indirect negotiations are ostensarily underway, with a second round set to take place in Switzerland in midweek. Once again, there is a vast gap between the combative public declarations and rigid opening positions on both sides and the very fact of their meeting.
A key question is whether these talks are merely a tactic to buy time. Each side has its own interest in delay. For Washington, additional time allows for further force accumulation and the completion of operational planning. Tehran, meanwhile, appears to be betting that the longer the crisis drags on, the weaker the international legitimacy for a US strike will become. From the regime's perspective, the further events recede from the recent wave of domestic protests, the greater its chances of survival.
In my assessment, the American explanation appears more realistic, especially given the slim prospects of reaching even a minimal agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Such a baseline deal would require "zero enrichment" and the transfer of enriched material to a third country, let alone the far more complex issue of restricting and enforcing limits on Iran's ballistic missile arsenal.
Countdown to a decision
Public discourse in recent weeks has focused largely on one question: When will the US strike? As time passes and developments unfold, the possibility of defusing tensions without some form of military action, whether limited or extensive, seems to be fading.
Recent signals suggest that a countdown has begun toward the moment Trump decides to authorize that operation. While such a decision would not come as a surprise, its timing carries strategic significance. In June 2025, an Israeli strike carried out in full coordination with Washington took place just one day before scheduled talks between Iran and the US in Vienna, beyond the two-month ultimatum Trump had previously set.
Will history repeat itself, with another round of talks collapsing at the last minute due to military action? An answer may come as early as this week, possibly before the weekend, a time when Trump has often chosen to greenlight military operations over the past year.
Meanwhile, Iran continues to conduct itself as though the recent "12-day war" and the latest wave of protests never occurred, seemingly unaware that its current situation is the most precarious it has faced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Whatever the timing of a potential strike, it will immediately shift attention to the "day after" and to a range of pressing short-term and long-term questions. In the immediate aftermath, how will Iran respond, and how broad will the confrontation become as a result? What targets will be hit, and how will those choices affect the duration of the conflict?
Over the longer term, equally weighty issues loom. Could military action trigger a renewed wave of protests leading to regime change, or to some other form of political transformation? Might the confrontation significantly alter the balance of power in the Middle East? From Israel's national security perspective, would the immediate threat posed by thousands of ballistic missiles, alongside the potential nuclear threat, truly be removed from the table?
Those who believed the central question was merely when the Americans would strike may soon find themselves disappointed. The day after a decision on military action, whenever it comes, will usher in a series of profound questions that are likely to linger for weeks to come.

National Museum of History of Ukraine calls on UNESCO to cancel Mendeleev Prize funded by Russia
According to Ukrinform, the corresponding statement was published on the museum's website.
"Ukrainian social media was stirred by a call for nominations for the UNESCO award, which carries the loud name 'The UNESCO-Russia Mendeleev International Prize in the Basic Sciences.' However, the announcement was published on the institution's website on January 7, 2026," the statement says.
The prize was initiated and is financed by the Russian government. It consists of a monetary award of $250,000 for each of the two winners. Each laureate also receives a gold medal and a diploma.
The decision to establish the prize was adopted by UNESCO in 2019.
So far, it has been awarded only twice, in 2021 and 2023, although it is presented as an annual prize.
Each time, one of the two awardees was a Russian scientist.
The international jury includes scientists from Spain, Germany, Russia, Mexico, India, Kenya, and Morocco.
According to the official information about the prize, "it also commemorates the remarkable scientific heritage of D. I. Mendeleev, father of the Periodic Table, whose work played a fundamental role in the future of chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy and geochemistry – but also in what is now termed sustainable development."
Particularly cynical in the eyes of Ukrainians is the following sentence from the prize's official page: "The prize was created to raise awareness of their role in creating peaceful and prosperous societies."
The National Museum of the History of Ukraine, as an institution that studies the methods Russia has used for centuries to promote narratives of its greatness, calls on UNESCO to cancel the prize and not contribute to the spread of Russian narratives.
Under the cover of the slogan "science beyond politics" and the name of a scientist who lived more than a century ago, Russia is now attempting to whitewash its crimes against humanity and numerous war crimes.
"While Ukrainian scientists are dying from shelling in Ukrainian cities, in Russian captivity, or defending Ukraine from Russian soldiers, one of the world's most influential organisations is awarding scientists with money from the bloody Russian government," the museum emphasized.
As previously reported, due to Russian aggression, 1,685 cultural heritage sites and 2,483 cultural infrastructure facilities have been destroyed or damaged in Ukraine.

UK far right lines up behind Rupert Lowe in challenge to Reform

23:58:52 KST

On a cold night in a dilapidated theatre tucked away at the end of Great Yarmouth’s Britannia Pier, Rupert Lowe was launching a far-right revolution. “Millions will have to go,” the MP said as he pledged a policy of mass deportations to rapturous applause and foot stamping from the hundreds of people gathered for what had been billed as the launch of a local “Great Yarmouth First” party.
But after introducing five councillors who will stand at the next Norfolk county council elections under that banner, the former Reform UK figure went further by announcing that his Restore Britain movement would become a national party.
In an electoral battlefield littered with failed startups, Lowe’s new party is, for now, little more than a pebble in the shoe of Nigel Farage’s Reform, from which he parted ways last year after a bitter falling out.
However, over the weekend other parties and figures to the right of Reform quickly rallied behind the new party. Advance UK, led by the former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by the far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson, said it would consider a merger.
Such a force could cost Reform a number of seats – and potentially even power, in a wafer-thin general election result – by splitting support among those drawn to hard-right anti-immigration populism.
One seasoned Tory strategist said: “We’ve had a general election with a big Labour win but where a lot of their MPs had margins of around 1,000 votes, so you could see small challengers on the right disrupting Reform’s attempts to follow that.” In 2024, 46 seats were won with a margin of less than 2%.
While Reform has placed great store in social media, Habib and, in particular, Lowe have significant presences on X, where each have been amplified by Elon Musk, who funded Robinson’s legal bills last year.
Musk, who has taken a dislike to Farage in favour of Lowe, retweeted the latter on Saturday, saying: “Join Rupert Lowe in Restore Britain, because he is the only one who will actually do it!”
A cohort of young rightwing would-be influencers pushing a more exclusive, ethnically nationalistic view of British identity have flocked to Lowe, who had attained a cult appeal among many Reform members.
Among those at his event in Great Yarmouth was Lucy White, an activist and sometime GB News contributor accused of racist tweets. Steve Laws, a prominent activist and “ethnonationalist” influencer, tweeted: “Rupert Lowe is our leader. GET IN LINE.”
Other figures such as the millionaire businessman Duncan Bannatyne and the actor John Cleese have also given approving signals.
Advance UK, meanwhile, has cultivated street protest. Large numbers of its flags – in some cases handed out to people unaware of the group – were prominent among the thousands of people who marched through the town of Crowborough last month against the use of a former military base to house asylum seekers.
“Reform are vacating the part of the political spectrum on which it was founded. We’re the old Reform, and Reform is becoming the Tories 2.0,” Habib said ahead of the launch of Advance’s first policies at the Emmanuel Centre, a Westminster venue let out by an evangelical church. The former Brexit party MEP says he has put £100,000 into the party and it has raised £600,000 from other sources.
“We have people joining us because they’re fed up with the way Reform is run, or because they have an ideological conviction and see Farage changing the message,” he said. “Our original Reform manifesto had rejected the World Economic Forum and yet there was Farage taking an Iranian billionaire’s money to go to Davos.”
An early indication will come later this month in the Gorton and Denton byelection where Advance is standing Nick Buckley, who received an MBE for his charity work but who has since become known for his extreme language on race and Islam.
Lowe’s party, meanwhile, has adopted a decentralised structure that is likely to show up the top-down approach of Farage’s party. The newly launched Great Yarmouth First party is aiming to win all of the nine seats in the borough whenever postponed county council elections take place. This will be a pilot for Restore Britain, which will act as an umbrella for others.
Separated from Reform, Lowe has proven himself able to attract attention. A self-styled “inquiry” that he set up into the grooming gangs scandal attracted the involvement of Tory MPs including Nick Timothy, Esther McVey and Gavin Williamson.
In Great Yarmouth, one of the English coastal towns with the high levels of deprivation, which Reform used as a springboard for its 2024 breakthrough, a clash between Lowe and his old party looms at the next general election. “We won it last time and we will win again,” Reform sources said.
But Lowe remains a rallying point for others. Rightwing activists and former Reform supporters had travelled from as far away as Scotland to attend the event. They included Maria Bowtell, an East Riding of Yorkshire councillor and single mother who was once regarded as a Reform rising star and who had driven down with her young son.
“Reform used to stand for something hopeful but it’s clear they won’t really change anything, plus people like me just weren’t supported,” Bowtell said. “I went on Woman’s Hour and was hung out to dry. I’m attracted now to the idea of independents getting together.”

Slovak prime minister says Ukraine war has ‘no military solution,’ urges dialogue with Russia
'Only result will be hundreds of thousands of deaths and a stronger position of Russian Federation,' says Robert Fico
ISTANBUL
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Sunday that the war in Ukraine “has no military solution,” calling for dialogue with Russia to end the armed conflict continuing since 2022.
In a press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Bratislava, Fico said Slovakia faces pressure whenever it pursues policies others dislike. “When someone doesn't like this sovereign independent behavior of Slovakia, they are always automatically trying to create obstacles to this sovereign, independent behavior.”
He reiterated his position that continued fighting will not resolve the conflict.
“The conflict in Ukraine has no military solution. It has no military solution,” he said, warning that if hostilities persist, “the only result will be hundreds of thousands of deaths and a stronger position of Russian Federation.”
Fico questioned the effectiveness of sanctions on Moscow, saying the “20th sanctioned packages are getting ready, how many of them do we need so that we could stop the progress of Russian Army?”
He added that European countries should prioritize diplomacy instead. “We should have come up with 20 peace initiatives.”
On energy disputes, he said Slovakia lost significant income after gas transit changes and accused Kyiv of politicizing supplies.
“We made 500 million euros per year just on transit fees,” he said, adding that “supplies of gas, of oil from Ukrainian side towards Hungary and Slovakia have become an instrument of political, political blackmail and pressure on Slovakia and Hungary.”
Fico also voiced criticism of the EU’s economic direction, saying: “The EU is economically in a deep crisis,” and warned that “if we will not admit that we passed senseless, ideological, climatic goals, we will not get out of this crisis.”
Despite his criticism, he said Slovakia supports Ukraine’s EU aspirations if conditions are met.
"We say that Ukraine can join the EU under the assumption they will meet all the necessary criteria,” he said, adding that Western Balkan candidates were “100 times better prepared for accession than Ukraine.”
Calling for engagement with Moscow, Fico stressed the importance of communication even with adversaries. “We have to lead discussion with Russian Federation. We have to lead dialog. We have to have a dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin,” he said.

Welsh charity buys more than 405 hectares for rewilding

A Welsh charity has bought more than 405 hectares (1,000 acres) in Ceredigion to establish Cymru’s “flagship” rewilding project, helping the country catch up with large-scale nature recovery projects under way elsewhere in the UK.
Tir Natur (Nature’s Land), founded in 2022, announced it had acquired the site at Cwm Doethie in Elenydd, or the Cambrian mountains, after a fundraising drive launched last year raised 50% of the £2.2m purchase price. A philanthropic bridging loan enabled the sale.
Fundraising efforts to begin early restoration work and community activities on the rewilding site – Wales’s largest – are ongoing.
The naturalist and broadcaster Iolo Williams, an ambassador for the charity, said: “I am hugely excited by their efforts to purchase land and showcase the benefits of rewilding, not only to wildlife and the physical environment, but to farming, Welsh communities and culture. Nature needs this.”
Tash Reilly, Tir Natur’s chair, said: “This site will demonstrate what’s possible when we allow nature to take the lead and work for people again. It’s a hopeful, practical vision anyone can contribute to.”
Tir Natur says the project will restore Cwm Doethie’s natural landscape, which includes rivers, peat bogs and ancient woodland, acting as a carbon sink and reducing the risk of flooding downstream. It aims to encourage the return of red squirrels, pine martens, polecats, curlews and hen harriers, and create new nature corridors and habitats for beavers and butterflies.
The charity also plans to use a wild grazing system involving traditional cattle, pony and pig breeds to act as “ecosystem architects” that kickstart natural regeneration by turning over soil.
The site had previously been considered poor for grazing and unsuitable for commercial forestry owing to its location in a site of special scientific interest (SSSI). However, Ian Rickman, president of the Farmers’ Union of Wales (FUW), told Cambrian News the union has concerns over “the scale and transparency of this project”.
“While it is positive that the role of livestock has been acknowledged, questions remain over how such a large area of land will be managed and funded in practice,” he said.
FUW will seek to work with the charity “to ensure the voices of local farmers and rural communities are properly heard and considered”, he added.
Reilly said Tir Natur was seeking a long-term approach and “keen to engage with farmers and their representatives as the project moves forward”.
“We respect that there are different views about rewilding,” she said. “The recent Natural Resources Wales and Welsh government reports show nature in Wales is continuing to decline, which is our motivation… We will improve this site’s ecological health while ensuring it is a working rural landscape.”
The valley in the Cambrian mountains is set to become Wales’s largest rewilding site by far: some of the biggest in the UK are Cairngorms Connect at 60,703 hectares (150,000 acres), Rewilding Affric Highlands, currently 8,094 hectares (20,000 acres) in Scotland and the Lake District’s Wild Ennerdale, which is 4,452 hectares (11,000 acres).
The UK ranks 229th out of 240 nations, with an averaged score of 50%, in the Natural History Museum’s Biodiversity Intactness Index.
In 2017, another major rewilding project in Wales, Summit to Sea, aimed to establish a protection area stretching from the Pumlumon massif in Elenydd to Cardigan Bay, encompassing 10,117 hectares (25,000 acres) of land and a 28,328 hectare (70,000 acre) marine zone, but faced criticism from the local community.
It was re-established as Tir Canol (Middle Ground) in 2020 and is now focused on a smaller area of mountainous Elenydd.

Fettuccine Alfredo: A recipe for La Dolce Vita

Fettuccine Alfredo: A recipe for La Dolce Vita
Alfredo alla Scrofa isn't just a restaurant; it's a time machine. The walls of this Rome establishment are covered with pictures of stars like John Wayne, Tony Curtis, Kirk Douglas, Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck.
"This was La Dolce Vita," said owner Mario Mozzetti.
And when the movie stars weren't on set, they were eating Fettuccine Alfredo, born right here more than a century ago.
Mozzetti is a third-generation mantecatore, or "creamer," the one who whips up the noodles inside the dish. It all started, he says, when the wife of the original owner, Alfredo Di Lellio, had a baby, then got sick and lost her appetite. Alfredo found the cure in this kitchen: fresh egg pasta so thin, it takes longer to cut it than to cook it.
The secret, said Mozzetti, is cooking time: "More or less, 30 seconds, instead of three, four, five minutes, which is the normal cooking time of egg pasta."
It's then placed in a dish, along with some pasta water, just a touch of butter, and grated parmesan, aged 24 months. Mozzetti then dramatically mixes the ingredients, almost like weaving. "This is a dance!" he said. "This is the waltz that Alfredo dedicated to his wife. It's simple, but very, extremely simple and complicated at the same time."
That complicated simplicity eventually caught the taste buds of Hollywood's original power couple. The year was 1920, and Mary Pickford had just married Douglas Fairbanks – a global sensation covered breathlessly by the press. After falling in love with each other, they fell in love with Fettuccine Alfredo on their honeymoon in Rome.
And Mozzetti showed us a message Pickford wrote in 1951: "'Alfredo the great, yesterday, today, tomorrow, and for always, Alfredo.' She was in love with this place," he said.
In a sign of gratitude, Fairbanks and Pickford gave Alfredo a golden fork and spoon. But the originals, Mozzetti said, are long gone: "In the '40s and during the second war, unfortunately, the Nazis took the original ones."
For more than a century, anyone who was anyone in show business just had to make the pilgrimage, including playwright Arthur Miller: "Arthur Miller was a shock for me," said Mozzetti. "I said, 'Let me touch you. Let me touch.' 'Why?' 'Because you were the husband of Marilyn Monroe. Come on. I can't resist!'"
With that kind of folklore, it's no wonder how this pasta made its way into cookbooks and restaurants across America. And like a Hollywood script, this tale has more twists and turns than a pasta dish.
Just a short walk away from Alfredo alla Scrofa, there's another restaurant with a rival claim. It's called Il Vero Alfredo. [Translation: The REAL Alfredo.] It's run by Chiara Cuomo (great-granddaughter of the Alfredo De Lelio), and her mother, Ines de Lelio. And it serves what Cuomo calls "the real Fettuccine Alfredo."
And there are even more celebrities on their wall – names like Ava Gardner, Walt Disney, Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Sylvester Stallone and Ronald Reagan.
And even its own golden fork and spoon!
Asked about the story that the Nazis stole them, Cuomo replied, "It's not true. Fake!"
Here's where things get complicated: During World War II, the dish's creator, Alfredo de Lelio, sold the first restaurant to one of his waiters – Mario Mozzetti's uncle. Then, after the war, Alfredo de Lelio decided to open another restaurant.
Ever since, the two have coexisted, begrudgingly – each a mecca for royalty, from Hollywood to Washington. Ines de Lelio said the Kennedys enjoyed Fettuccine Alfredo there. "My grandfather said to Kennedy that they will bring luck and health," Ines de Lelio said.
Despite their differences, both restaurants can agree on at least one thing: In America, we're often doing Fettuccine Alfredo wrong. "With the shrimps, with cream, I don't like it," said Cuomo.
By Mozzetti's count, there are more than 50 brands of Alfredo Sauce for sale on the U.S. market. How does he feel about other people getting rich off of Fettuccine Alfredo? "It's very painful. And nobody knows, at least, they don't know about this place, this location," he said.
Or, rather, both locations. Two pillars, either in spite of, or thanks to a rivalry that created and maintained an Italian-American classic.

US forces intercept sanctioned oil tanker tied to Venezuela in Indian Ocean
‘Vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine,’ says Pentagon as military forces boarded the Veronica III overnight
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
US military forces have boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean, having tracked the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an operation targeting illicit oil linked to Venezuela, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.
Venezuela has been subject to US oil sanctions for several years, leading to its reliance on a 'shadow fleet' of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to exert pressure on then-President Nicolás Maduro, who was later apprehended in January during an American military operation.
The Defense Department confirmed via a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III overnight, executing "a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding."
The Pentagon stated: "The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
The Veronica III, a Panamanian-flagged vessel, is listed under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control website. Video released by the Pentagon depicted US troops boarding the tanker.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its wider efforts to take control of Venezuela's oil. However, the Pentagon's post did not specify whether the Veronica III had been formally seized and placed under US control.
This incident follows another boarding last week, when the US military intercepted the Aquila II, a different tanker, also in the Indian Ocean. That vessel is currently being held while its ultimate fate is determined by the United States, a defence official stated last week on condition of anonymity.
The Aquila II was one of at least 16 tankers that departed the Venezuelan coast last month after US forces captured President Nicolás Maduro, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com. He said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship's movements.
The Aquila II is a Panamanian-flagged tanker under US sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil. Owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship tracking data shows it has spent much of the last year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location.

In Rome, two restaurants vie for supremacy in preparing Fettuccine Alfredo – egg pasta with butter and parmesan cheese – a dish that has entranced Hollywood and Washington royalty since the earliest days of La Dolce Vita. Chris Livesay visits Alfredo alla Scrofa and Il Vero Alfredo, where rival families prepare one of the most popular Italian recipes.

French 'ultra-left' behind killing of right-wing youth, says justice minister Darmanin
France

23:49:27 KST

The "ultra-left" in France was behind the deadly beating of a French youth aligned with the far right whose death has inflamed political tensions in the country, the justice minister said on Sunday, February 15. Gérald Darmanin also accused hard-left politicians, including from the La France Insoumise (LFI) party, the largest left-wing faction in parliament, of fueling violence with their language.
The victim, identified only as Quentin, aged 23, had been hospitalized and placed into a coma on Thursday after being attacked in the southeastern city of Lyon. Supporters said he was providing security at a protest against an appearance by Rima Hassan, an LFI member of the European Parliament, at the Lyon branch of the Sciences Po university when he was assaulted by a gang of rival activists.
The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it added.
"It was clearly the ultra left that killed him," Darmanin told RTL television. "There are indeed speeches, particularly from La France Insoumise and the ultra-left, which unfortunately lead to unbridled violence on social networks and then in the physical world," he said. "Words can kill," Darmanin added, accusing Hassan and LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon of "not having a word to say for the family of the young man."
Calls for calm
Lyon prosecutors have yet to give details on the circumstances of the killing. According to the Nemesis collective, which is close to the far right, Quentin was providing security for its protesters and was assaulted by "anti-fascist" activists.
The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organized and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked."
LFI lawmaker Eric Coquerel, speaking to Franceinfo, condemned "all political violence" but said the activists responsible for Hassan's security "were in no way involved in what happened." He pointed instead to a particular "context" in the southeastern city marked by violence from "far-right groups."
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.
With tensions between France's far right and radical left intensifying ahead of the 2027 presidential election, centrist President Emmanuel Macron has called for "calm" and "restraint."

Polish President Karol Nawrocki thinks his country should start developing nuclear defenses, given the threat from Moscow.
In an interview with Polsat television on Sunday, Nawrocki described himself as "a great supporter of Poland joining the nuclear project" and argued that the country should develop its security strategy "based on nuclear potential."
He added: "This path, with respect for all international regulations, is the path we should take. ... We must work towards this goal so that we can begin the work. We are a country right on the border of an armed conflict. The aggressive, imperial attitude of Russia toward Poland is well known."

Did Hong Kong souvenir shop tread on IP rights with viral ‘MTR station’ wall?
Wall featured signs nearly identical to ones found in rail stations before workers took down lettering
A souvenir shop in Hong Kong has taken down lettering from its viral wall featuring designs nearly identical to MTR station signage amid concerns over possible trademark and copyright infringement.
The MTR Corporation on Sunday declined to say whether the move by the Causeway Bay store was done at its request.
The company “attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property, which is safeguarded under the law of Hong Kong, and we shall act accordingly in the event of suspected infringement,” a spokesman for the rail operator told the South China Morning Post.
Earlier this month, the wall next to the storefront belonging to Hong Kong Souvenir on Kai Chiu Road in Causeway Bay was transformed into a “check-in” spot that soon attracted photo-snapping crowds.

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’
Palestinian Authority says Israel's move constitutes ‘termination of signed agreements,’ urges UN Security Council and US to intervene
ISTANBUL
The Palestinian Authority on Sunday warned that an Israeli government decision to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” amounts to a “de facto annexation” of the occupied territory and a violation of international law.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Wafa, the Authority said the Israeli move constitutes “a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions” and poses a threat to security and stability.
It described the measure as a “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian land” and an official launch of annexation plans aimed at consolidating the occupation through illegal settlement expansion.
It also constitutes “a termination of the signed agreements and clearly contradicts the resolutions of the UN Security Council, especially Resolution 2334, which considers all settlement activity in the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal.”
The Authority stressed that unilateral Israeli actions “would not confer legitimacy over Palestinian land and would not change the legal and historical status of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as occupied territory under international law.”
It called on the international community, particularly the UN Security Council and the US administration, to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli measures and compel Tel Aviv to comply with international law to prevent further escalation.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Israel’s public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” the Israel Hayom newspaper commented ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Gisèle Pelicot speaks

Gisèle Pelicot speaks
WARNING: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse.
For 50 years, Gisèle Pelicot lived with her husband, Dominique Pelicot, whom she described as "a kind man, a devoted family man. It was a beautiful love story, until the day I found myself facing the horror of the facts."
Those facts shattered Gisèle's seemingly normal life, and put her at the center of a mass rape trial – an unthinkable crime that gripped France and received worldwide attention. But it was her response that would be defining.
She sat down with "CBS Sunday Morning," for what she said was her first-ever interview: "Yes, it's a first," she said through an interpreter. "I'm not used to speaking in front of cameras. I used to be a very discreet woman."
It all unravelled in 2020, inside a supermarket in Mazan, France, when what seemed like a small crime uncovered a far greater one. Dominique Pelicot was caught taking video up women's skirts. His arrest led to the discovery of disturbing footage taken inside their home of Gisèle Pelicot unconscious.
"My world collapsed"
At a local police station, an investigator told Gisèle what they found: "He said, 'Mrs. Pelicot, do you recognize yourself in these photos?'" she recalled. "And I said, 'No, it's not me.' Then he said, 'This is your bedroom.' And I see a woman I don't recognize at all, completely asleep with a man beside her. I don't know this man. And then he says, 'I'm going to tell you something shocking: You were raped by 53 individuals.' My world collapsed."
She described the woman in the video as looking like a rag doll. That woman was her. "Yes, it was me, but this woman was lifeless," she said. "She looked dead."
Her response? "I could not speak. I was in such a state of shock. All I wanted was to go home, to get my life back as it was before."
But that life was gone. The man she knew as a loving father to their three children, and a doting grandfather, had been drugging her with sleeping pills and muscle relaxants, then inviting men he met online to abuse her.
Her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, said it represented hundreds of rapes over at least 10 years. He and Gisèle started to grasp the scale of the crimes as they prepared for trial – "In the range of hundreds, if not thousands" of photos, he said. "And for videos, definitely hundreds."
Among the evidence: messages Dominque Pelicot posted online ("I'm looking for a pervert accomplice to abuse my sleeping wife..."), and text messages ("I'm about to dose her... We have to wait at least one hour to abuse").
"It's been a real journey into the darkness," said Babonneau. He described the images as "scenes of torture. There is no other word for that. … On this video we see a human being, being treated as an object. We see men who desecrate a human body, who desecrates someone, Gisèle, who is in profound distress, because her life was at risk at every moment where she was drugged and abused."
Victims of sexual abuse can remain anonymous in France. So up until the trial in 2024, Gisèle Pelicot's name was not known. But then she made a bold decision: to demand an open trial, allowing the public and the press into the courtroom.
Revealing her identity to the world, she said, was difficult: "It was very hard. I didn't want anybody to discover and know about this woman who had experienced all this violence. Because, in truth, victims always feel shame about what happened to them. I told myself that if I opened the closed-door proceedings, the shame would change sides."
The words "Shame Has to Change Sides" are the subtitle of her intimate account of the ordeal, "A Hymn to Life" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).
Babonneau said he was worried when he heard that she wanted to have an open trial: "Because we knew that there would be a tremendous pressure on her," he said.
"Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy"
At trial, the accused hid their faces as they filed into court. They ranged in age from 26 to 74. Among them: a firefighter, a soldier, and a nurse. In court, many claimed Gisèle Pelicot must have known, must have been complicit.
But Dominique Pelicot admitted everything, testifying, "It was always against her knowledge," adding he drugged her two to three times a week. "I had an addiction," he said.
Looking back, Gisèle said, there were warning signs: "I only knew I had blackouts, and I had health problems," she said. There were also periods where her memory was affected. "I couldn't remember that I'd been to the hairdresser; it was only the next day that I realized I had," she said. "And when I called my children, it was the same – I didn't remember our conversations.
"I thought I was seriously ill. I consulted neurologists, I had a CT scan – nothing was found," she said.
Even recounting her horrifying ordeal to "Sunday Morning," Gisèle Pelicot maintained her poise. "I've always been this way," she said. "Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy. And I didn't want to go down that path."
The trial made headlines worldwide, and drew huge crowds of supporters, who praised Gisèle Pelicot for her bravery, holding her up as a feminist hero. Seeing those supporters, she said, made her feel that she was not alone: "It was an incredible source of strength for me."
All of the 51 men eventually put on trial were convicted. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to the maximum of 20 years.
He has asked for his (now ex-)wife's forgiveness. But Gisèle Pelicot says, "No. Forgiveness is extremely difficult. But I don't want to live in hatred. I do need to speak with him – and it will also be to say goodbye."
But she does want to see him again. "Yes," she said. "I need answers. I may never get them. But that's also part of my journey."
During our interview, just off camera, was Gisèle's new partner, Jean-Loup, who was also by her side during the trial, along with her children.
"I never thought I'd fall in love, or even want to," she said. "It's a beautiful story. As for the rest, it belongs to us, and I keep that to myself."
But you're in love? "Indeed. You can fall in love at any age. Everything is possible. That, too, is a message of hope, to tell yourself that nothing is lost in life."
Despite the details of her ordeal, by the end of the book, her story is, miraculously, uplifting. "I was always wondering what my mission on Earth was, why I had been born," she said. "Some are painters, some are poets, others are writers. I think my mission was to give others hope, that even after hardship, you can rise again and choose happiness. I think that was my mission."

Iran says energy, mining and aircraft deals on table in talks as US prepares for next round

Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the U.S. that would deliver economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington.
Iran and the U.S. resumed negotiations earlier this month aimed at resolving their decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear program and averting a new military confrontation. The U.S. has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks fail, U.S. officials told Reuters.
“For the sake of an agreement’s durability, it is essential that the U.S. also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,” Foreign Ministry Deputy Director for Economic Diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
Iran has threatened retaliation against any U.S. attack but struck a conciliatory tone Sunday.
“Common interests in oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,” Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers did not secure U.S. economic interests.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made clear he prefers diplomacy and a negotiated settlement.
“No one’s ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran but we’re going to try,” Rubio said.
In 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact, which had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program, and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on Tehran.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that a U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday. A senior Iranian official confirmed the meeting Sunday.
“Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be traveling, I think they are traveling right now, to have important meetings and we’ll see how that turns out,” Rubio said, without elaborating.
While the talks that led to the 2015 agreement were multilateral, the current negotiations are limited to Iran and the U.S., with Oman serving as mediator.
Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled Iran’s readiness to compromise on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal.”
He cited a statement earlier this week by Iran’s atomic chief that Tehran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for sanctions relief as evidence of flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Iran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in previous negotiations. Washington views enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran denies.
In June, the U.S. joined Israel in a series of airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear sites.
The U.S. is also increasing economic pressure on Tehran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the U.S. would work to reduce Iran’s oil exports to China, Axios reported Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80% of Iran’s oil exports, meaning any reduction in that trade would significantly cut Tehran’s oil revenue.

Mikaela Shiffrin finishes 11th in giant slalom, continuing Olympic drought

Mikaela Shiffrin fails to make the podium in women's giant slalom as Olympic drought continues
Mikaela Shiffrin's Olympic drought continues after she missed the podium of the Milano Cortina Games women's giant slalom on Sunday, finishing in 11th place.
The U.S. standout had a combined time of 2:14.42. Her runs were clean but just not quick enough to challenge for a podium spot. She didn't show any outward signs of disappointment after her second run, blowing out her cheeks and waving to the fans in the grandstand with both hands.
The 30-year-old, who is the winningest athlete on the World Cup circuit, has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic events since the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang.
Italy's Federica Brignone took home the top prize, her second gold medal of these Games and her fifth medal overall. Remarkably, it was a split silver medal after Sweden's Sara Hector and Norway's Thea Stjernesund posted the same time in both the first and second runs.
After Brignone crossed the line to loud cheers from the home crowd, Hector and Stjernesund ran into the finish area and bowed down to the champion to a backdrop of chants of "Fede" from fans.
"That was, like, the greatest show of GS skiing that we've had in a really long time," Shiffrin said. "And to do it, you know, at the Olympics where people actually have eyes on the sport. Federica skied incredible. That was so cool to watch."
Redemption for Shiffrin, who came in fourth place with teammate Breezy Johnston in the women's team combined event on Thursday, could come at her best event — the slalom — on Wednesday.

ROME – Two off-piste skiers were killed on Feb 15 and another was in serious condition after an avalanche struck a slope near Courmayeur, Italy’s alpine rescue said.
Italy’s central alpine rescue service (CNSAS) said the two victims and injured person were a woman and two men, and were “probably” French.
The avalanche hit a stretch of the Canale dei Vesses, known for steep passages popular with off-piste skiers, west of Courmayeur in the Val Veny area at the foot of the Mont Blanc.
Fifteen rescuers participated in the search, along with search-and-rescue dogs and two helicopters, the CNSAS said.
One person died on site and the other after being transported to the emergency room, rescuers said. The injured person was in hospital in Turin. AFP

War update: 129 attacks since morning, Pokrovsk sector remains most active
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated this on Facebook, publishing operational information as of 16:00 on Sunday, February 15, Ukrinform reports.
The enemy continues attempts to advance deeper into Ukrainian territory. The Defense Forces are holding them back, inflicting significant losses along various sections of the front line and exhausting them along the entire line of contact and in the rear.
Today, Russian forces once again shelled Ukraine's border areas. Rogizne, Ryzhivka, Prohres, Bachivsk, Iskryskivshchyna, Budky, Kucherivka, Kruzhok, and Novovasylivka in the Sumy region, as well as Mykhalchyna Sloboda, Buchky, Lyskivshchyna, Plokhiv, and Yasna Poliana in the Chernihiv region, came under enemy fire.

In the Southern Slobozhanshchyna sector, Russian troops carried out two attacks toward Veterynarne and Vovchanski Khutory but made no new attempts to improve their positions.
In the Kupiansk sector, the enemy attempted once to advance near Pishchane.
In the Lyman sector, Ukrainian defenders repelled two attempts by Russian forces to advance toward Stavky and Drobysheve.
In the Sloviansk sector, Russian troops tried four times to advance toward Yampil, Zakitne, Kryva Luka, and Rai-Oleksandrivka. Two clashes are ongoing.
In the Kramatorsk sector, the invaders have not attempted any offensives so far today.
In the Kostiantynivka sector, Russian forces carried out 26 assault actions near Kostiantynivka, Pleshchiivka, Shcherbynivka, Ivanopillia, Illinivka, Rusyn Yar, Mykolaipillia, Novopavlivka, Stepanivka, and Sofiivka. One attack is ongoing.

Iran’s top general warns new war will be ‘lesson’ for Trump ahead of next round of talks

Iran’s top general warns new war will be ‘lesson’ for Trump ahead of next round of talks
Next round of US-Iran nuclear talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva
By Syed Zafar Mehdi
TEHRAN, Iran (AA) - Iran’s top military commander warned Sunday that any US war against Tehran would serve as “a lesson” for President Donald Trump, as tensions continue to simmer in the region.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said that the US president should understand he would be entering “a lesson-giving battle.”
Trump said on Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen,” as tensions escalate amid the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
He announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, would soon head to the region in case ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran fail.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” he said. “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the Persian Gulf region, having been dispatched last month amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Mousavi described Trump’s comments as “unworthy of a president” and “reckless.”
He said that if Trump intends to wage war, he should not speak of “negotiations,” referring to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy between the two sides that resumed earlier this month.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on Feb. 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, according to Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who confirmed the meeting in an interview on Sunday.
He said Washington must demonstrate its commitment to reaching an agreement aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said. “If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”

Woman who filmed Snapchat videos while speeding jailed after killing two
A woman jailed after overtaking on the wrong side of the road and causing a fatal collision had repeatedly posted videos of herself speeding while using her mobile phone to social media.
Taxi driver Octavian Codreanu was killed at the scene on the B4425 near Aldsworth in December 2022, and his passenger, schoolteacher Moyra Whelan, later died from her injuries.
Liberty Michell, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and two counts of causing death by driving whilst uninsured.
Mitchell had passed her driving test just three weeks before the crash.
Gloucestershire Police said footage from Mitchell’s Snapchat account showed her driving on narrow roads at speeds of up to 100mph.
Mitchell, 21, of Chipping Norton, was sentenced to six years and eight months at Gloucester Crown Court on Friday (13 February) and banned from driving for more than eight years.

As Sudanese city returns to life after two-year siege, drone threat lingers
Markets reopen in Dilling, South Kordofan’s second largest city. Yet residents face critical medical shortages and persistent aerial attacks.
Life is cautiously returning to the streets of Dilling, the second largest city in South Kordofan state, after the Sudanese army broke a suffocating siege that had isolated the area for more than two years.
For months, the city had been encircled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), cutting off vital supply lines and trapping civilians in a severe humanitarian crisis.

While the lifting of the blockade has allowed goods to flow again, local authorities and residents said the city remains under the threat of drone attacks.
Al Jazeera Arabic’s Hisham Uweit, reporting from Dilling, described a city “recovering slowly” from the economic strangulation.
“For over two years, heavy siege conditions were imposed on the city. Movement disappeared, goods vanished and livelihoods narrowed,” Uweit said.
“Now the eyes of buyers pick through the few available goods … as if the market itself is announcing its recovery at a leisurely pace, drawing determination from the patience of its residents.”
Markets return to life
The immediate impact of the army’s advance is visible in the local markets, which were largely shuttered during the blockade. Fresh produce, absent for months, has begun to reappear in stalls.
“The market and vegetables have all returned,” a local trader told Al Jazeera. “Before, the market didn’t exist. Now we have okra, potatoes, sweet potatoes, chillies and lemons. Everything is with us, and the market has returned to normal.”
However, the resumption of trade masks deep scars left by the isolation. The blockade devastated the local economy, stripping residents of their savings and leaving infrastructure in disrepair.
‘The price of isolation’
While food supplies are improving, Dilling’s health sector remains in critical condition. The city’s main hospital is struggling with a severe lack of equipment and essential medicines, a shortage that has had life-altering consequences for the most vulnerable.
Abdelrahman, a local resident suffering from diabetes, paid a heavy price for the siege. During the months of encirclement, insulin supplies ran dry. His condition deteriorated rapidly, ultimately leading to the amputation of both his legs.
“He had a medical appointment after a month, but the month closed off his check-ups,” a relative of Abdelrahman said. “He is suffering severely. He is missing his insulin. There is a shortage of food, and he is tired. His health has declined sharply.”
‘Chased like locusts’
Despite the Sudanese army asserting control over access routes, the security situation in Dilling remains precarious. Authorities said the city is subjected to almost daily drone strikes launched by the RSF and SPLM-N, targeting infrastructure and residential areas.
For Maryam, a mother displaced multiple times by the conflict, the breaking of the siege has not brought peace. She described the terror of the unmanned aerial vehicles that hover over their homes.
“Now the drones bombard and chase us. They chase us like locusts,” Maryam said. “When they come, we just run to hide. When they hover over us, they burn the thatch [roofs], start fires and force you to leave your home.”
She added that the constant threat of aerial bombardment makes normal life impossible: “If you are having a meal, like porridge, … the moment you see them, you leave it.”
Uweit said that while the lifting of the siege is a “glimmer of hope” and a first step towards recovery, the dual challenge of rebuilding a shattered health system and fending off persistent military attacks means Dilling’s ordeal is far from over.

After Munich Speech, Rubio Visits Trump’s Allies in Slovakia and Hungary

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Slovakia on Sunday, continuing his European tour with visits to countries led by right-wing allies of President Donald Trump, with the next stop Hungary.
The visits come a day after Rubio called on Europeans to defend “Western civilisation” in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, urging them to rally behind the US president’s vision of a “renewal” of the world order.

During a visit of several hours in Bratislava, Rubio is scheduled to meet Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, a nationalist leader who has positioned himself as an ally to Trump.
During a recent visit to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Fico reportedly expressed concern about the US president’s mental state, according to Politico, citing anonymous European diplomats.
Both Washington and Bratislava have vehemently denied this.
The Slovak leader said after the Mar-a-Lago meeting that he and Trump had had “extremely important” discussions on nuclear energy.
The US Secretary of State will then travel to Budapest for meetings on Monday with Hungarian officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Trump makes no secret of his support for the right-wing Hungarian nationalist leader, whom he describes as a “strong and powerful man,” ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April 12.
Orban faces the toughest challenge to his grip on power since returning to office in 2010, as his Fidesz party trails opposition leader Peter Magyar’s TISZA party in the polls before the election.
Zelensky Pokes Fun at Orban’s ‘Belly’ at Munich
- Friend of MAGA movement -
In a speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to continue his fight against “bought pseudo-civil organisations, journalists, judges and politicians”.
Orban’s rhetoric and politics often echo those of Trump, and he has cast himself as a European friend of Trump’s MAGA movement.
Many American conservatives admire Orban for his hardline anti-immigration stance, resistance to LGBTQ rights and war against “gender ideology”.
Orban has also announced plans to travel to Washington next week to attend the inaugural meeting of Trump’s “Board of Peace”.
Orban also managed to secure Hungary an exemption from US sanctions on importing Russian oil and gas during a visit to the White House last year.
Former Democratic president Joe Biden had a much more hostile relationship with Orban, whom he accused of “looking for a dictatorship” in Hungary, including by muzzling independent media.
Energy is expected to be a major topic of discussion for Rubio in both Bratislava and Budapest, US officials indicated ahead of the trip.
These two nations are landlocked Central European countries that have sought to keep warm ties to the Kremlin despite the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Both also depend heavily on Russian fossil fuels, and both countries have found themselves locked in a standoff with the European Union over the decision to end imports of Russian gas.
US officials said Washington intends to strengthen energy ties with its two right-wing European allies.

The Smoke-and-Mirrors Rhetoric Shielding Georgia’s Outcast Autocracy

This week, US Vice President JD Vance paid visit to two capitals in the South Caucasus while snubbing a third. Nikol Pashinyan and Ilham Aliyev, the respective leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, welcomed Vance amid a thaw in relations between their countries. For both states, this marks the highest-level visit of a US official to date.
“You know what the context of Georgian-American relations is. This context is very difficult,” admitted the prime minister of neighboring Georgia, Irakli Kobakhidze, during a press conference following the announcement of Vance’s visit.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Two decades ago, Georgia’s capital Tbilisi hosted then President George W. Bush with great ceremony, but as of late the only procession seen on its main thoroughfare, Rustaveli avenue, has been that of the anti-government protests that have continued for over a year.
The Trump administration, of course, is not averse to making overtures to autocrats, as Baku’s presence on Vance’s tour attests. But Georgia’s authoritarian course has seen the country become particularly isolated on the world stage.
“It’s not only the US, it’s the whole West,” says Giga Bokeria, co-leader of the Federalists opposition party. In another political life, Bokeria had a prominent role in Georgia’s previous pro-Western government – the same that hosted Bush – and so feels keenly the country’s current ostracization under the ruling Georgian Dream party.
European Debate Over Nuclear Weapons Gains Pace
“What does it mean for us that they are isolated fundamentally from the UK, from the EU, from the US, all the important allies...? It’s a very dangerous thing – to be left alone vis-à-vis Russia in this region,” he told Kyiv Post.
Georgia’s government has been routinely accused of courting Russia, which invaded the country in 2008 and continues to occupy approximately 20 percent of its internationally recognized territory, during its drift away from the West.
But this alignment cannot be trumpeted. While the Kremlin has made some quietly complimentary gestures in Georgia’s direction – Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised its avoidance of a “Ukrainian or Moldovan scenario” in March – Georgian Dream must still pay lip service to a largely pro-European, anti-Russia population in order to survive politically.
The government continually relies on an arsenal of warped foreign policy talking points to shrug off their lost friendships, conceal their appeasement of their northern neighbor, and to maintain their grip on power.
“Immense gaslighting” over Europe
Despite doing everything it can to tarnish its relationship with the EU, Georgian Dream rarely pillory the bloc directly, opting instead for what George Melashvili, a Georgian civic activist and political sciences scholar, calls “rhetorical shenanigans.”
“One of the major pillars of Georgian Dream’s ability to control the country is immense gaslighting,” he told Kyiv Post. This includes an insistence that Georgia can still join the EU at the end of the decade, “a notion that simply does not stand against any critique.”
The period following the government’s suspension of EU accession talks in November 2024 – ostensibly a temporary measure – has seen violent crackdowns on protests, government critics imprisoned, and major opposition parties threatened with bans.
In recent months, Kobakhidze has given a series of interviews to pro-government media where he has claimed openness to cooperation with Europe while expressing concern, of all things, for the state of its democracy – a tactic that Melashvili calls “mirroring.”
“We sometimes joke that whatever Georgian Dream actually is itself, they’re trying to project on others,” he adds.
For an insight into Georgian Dream’s unfiltered feelings about Europe, Melashvili considers its satellite parties an “excellent place” to look. Last week one of these, United Neutral Georgia, called for pro-government broadcasters to host debates on the “harmful process of EU integration.”
Russia’s “natural ally”
Following Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia and subsequent recognition of its two breakaway regions – Abkhazia and South Ossetia – as independent states, Georgia severed and has not renewed diplomatic relations with its neighbor. Critics argue, however, that an under-the-table relationship has taken root under Georgian Dream.
Much of the blame for this is directed at one man: while Kobakhidze heads the government officially, billionaire oligarch and Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili is widely regarded as Georgia’s de-facto ruler. He made his fortune in Russia in the years after the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Melashvili is convinced that Ivanishvili’s Russia alignment, if not projected openly, is clear in substance: “I cannot say whether or not Ivanishvili or Kobakhidze are receiving folders with orders from the Kremlin or the [FSB headquarters] Lubyanka, but what we can do is evaluate the results... Georgia’s economic dependency on Russia has increased. Georgia’s political dependency on Russia has also increased.”
Bokeria agrees that the presence or absence of direct Russian orders is beside the point: “The nature of [Ivanishvili’s] rule, his regime, the instincts he plays on... make him a natural ally of Russia.”
“He’s a guy from the 90s in Moscow,” he told Kyiv Post, “that’s where his mentality was shaped and formed.”
The rhetoric this produces, again, is indirect. “The main purpose of GD [Georgian Dream] propaganda is not to portray Russia as the good guys. They know it is impossible,” says Melashvili, instead they “gaslight the Georgian public into believing that the European Union is equally [as bad] or even worse than Russia.”
Russia’s war on Ukraine, Bokeria notes, has gifted Georgian Dream further rhetorical cover for its Kremlin appeasement. “Fear of change is connected with the fear of war in the propaganda of GD,” he explains.
Last year Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned a Georgian Dream campaign ad that placed images of Russia’s war alongside the slogan “Choose peace!”
A bad balancing act
For all its multifarious duplicity, this foreign policy rhetoric is less a masterplan than a desperate gambit.
“All that they care about... it’s not Georgia’s long-term interest or strategy, it’s to sustain the absolute power that they have right now,” Melashvili affirms.
This tunnel vision seems to blind the government to its mounting ostracization. Before Vance landed in Armenia, there were no invites for Georgia to the WEF meeting in Davos, nor to Trump’s recently conceived “Board of Peace.”
Moreover, the president’s “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” set to commercially reconcile Armenia and Azerbaijan, threatens to harm Georgia’s strategic importance in the so-called “Middle Corridor.”
“Georgian Dream would absolutely love to be participating in all those meetings and events,” says Melashvili, but “if the cost is to give away even small parts of their power, they will never concede such actions.”
Georgian Dream’s appeals to the Trump administration, both in professed ideological kinship and in calls to lift Biden-era sanctions on government officials, have gone unanswered.
While Georgia’s president Mikheil Kavelashvili claimed Vance expressed a desire for renewed relations when they met at the Winter Olympics in Milan last week, any significant practical steps in this regard are yet to be taken.
If Trump provides a model for playing both sides of the divide between Europe and Russia, then Georgian Dream has been thus far incapable of emulating it. “If we’re talking about a balancing act, then Georgian Dream is doing a horrible job,” says Melashvili. “[They have] not been able to balance Russia with the West or with China or with the United States. They have simply been putting more and more coins on the scales of Russia.”
But the Georgian people have proved more difficult to back into a corner than their government. “We’re not yet in the situation of Belarus, even though we’re getting very close to it,” Melashvili says. “The Georgian public continues to fight.”
Georgian Dream’s press officer did not respond to a request for comment.

Ukrainian freestyle skier Kateryna Kotsar had a Valentine’s Day to remember, clinching a spot in the Winter Olympics big air medals contest and receiving a marriage proposal on the slopes.
Kotsar landed two strong jumps in Monday’s qualifying round, securing 11th place – just above the cutoff of 12 skiers advancing to the final.

Minutes after her final run, her boyfriend, Bohdan Fashtryha, surprised her by getting down on one knee at the side of the Alpine slope. She said yes.
“I think he was nervous. It was so cute, to be honest,” the 25-year-old Kotsar told reporters.
Fashtryha told Suspilne Sport that he had been planning the proposal for two years. When their relationship began, Kotsar had been considering whether to continue her sports career.
With support from her parents, Fashtryha convinced her to stay in the sport.
“She was really thinking about whether to continue her athletic career. I, along with her parents, encouraged her to go on, because the chance to go to the Olympics is unique and can’t be missed. I imagined this moment even back then – two years ago. Since then, so many things have happened, and now Katya is at the Olympics. The brave find happiness. It just so happened that I could be here,” he said.
Earlier in the day, Kotsar had a hard crash on her third run, sending both skis and goggles flying – but her strong first two jumps secured her place in the final. After the proposal, she removed her ski glove to show off her engagement ring.
Kotsar also revealed a message on her glove that read “Freedom of memory”, a gesture of solidarity with skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was disqualified by the IOC for wearing a “memory helmet” honoring fallen Ukrainian defenders and athletes.
“I still am excited and can’t understand what happened tonight because it’s two really huge things for me,” Kotsar said.
Her final Olympic performance is scheduled for Monday, Feb. 16, at 8:30 p.m. Kyiv time.

IDF strikes continue as key meetings loom over Hezbollah disarmament in Lebanon

The IDF continued overnight Sunday to strike sites in Lebanon used for storing weapons and operating launchers belonging to Hezbollah, as daily attacks target what officials describe as the terrorist organization’s efforts to rebuild its capabilities.
Strikes have been carried out by fighter jets, drones targeting vehicles carrying Hezbollah terrorists, as well as artillery and machine gun fire. Despite the sustained military activity, there has been no significant diplomatic breakthrough, and the situation along the northern front appears to be in a holding pattern pending broader regional developments, particularly involving Iran.
Three upcoming meetings are expected to clarify or potentially advance developments.
The first is a Lebanese government session scheduled for Monday. Lebanese Army Commander Rodolphe Haykal provides monthly updates to the cabinet on progress in implementing a plan to consolidate weapons under state control. According to recent reports, he is expected to present the second phase of that plan, covering areas north of the Litani River.
Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to the area south of the Litani. The terrorist organization maintains that instead of pressuring it, the Lebanese government should focus on securing the withdrawal of remaining forces from southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem is also expected to deliver a speech Monday at a memorial event for leaders of the terrorist organization, and is anticipated to address developments in Lebanon and the wider region.
Another key meeting, set for the 25th of the month, involves the ceasefire monitoring mechanism committee, which has convened 13 times in 2025. The body was initially limited to military representatives but was later expanded to include Simon Karam, a former Lebanese ambassador to the United States, as the civilian head of the Lebanese delegation.
Senior Hezbollah officials opposed Karam’s inclusion, describing it as a “second mistake,” following what they called the first error — the plan to consolidate weapons — undertaken “under continued occupation of Lebanese territory and daily attacks.”
From Hezbollah’s perspective, any discussion of its weapons must take place solely within the framework of a domestic Lebanese national defense strategy, free of external pressure and only after several conditions are met: a halt to attacks, the return of Lebanese prisoners and a full withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
The terrorist organization views the ceasefire monitoring committee as having a strictly technical mandate limited to implementing commitments under the agreement, which it says applies only to areas south of the Litani River. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Mousawi reiterated that position earlier this month.
Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper affiliated with Hezbollah, published an article Friday titled: “What if the state dared to withdraw from the mechanism?” The piece argued that as long as attacks, destruction and killings continue following the 2024 ceasefire declaration, and as international promises remain unfulfilled, reconsidering cooperation with the mechanism becomes a legitimate question.
The article outlined potential advantages and disadvantages of suspending cooperation, concluding that such a move would restore Lebanon’s national dignity and its right to defend itself “by all means,” asserting that the world respects only those who respect themselves.
A further significant date for Lebanon is March 5, when a conference in France is scheduled to support the Lebanese Army and security forces. A preparatory meeting is expected beforehand. Earlier this month, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called on Arab states to participate in the conference, saying, “We need your help.”
Lebanese leadership, including President Joseph Aoun, Salam and Haykal, has emphasized in meetings abroad that the army requires substantial assistance to carry out its missions. Haykal recently returned from a visit to the United States, where he met with political and military officials to discuss ways to enhance military cooperation and support the army’s capabilities.
In a statement, the Lebanese Army said American officials praised its performance and operations south of the Litani River.

Lions lived in Japan thousands of years ago: Study
Study says lions reached Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago when lower sea levels connected it to Eurasia
ISTANBUL
Lions once roamed much of Japan tens of thousands of years ago, researchers said, after fossils long thought to be tiger remains were identified as belonging to an extinct species of lion.
A study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that DNA and protein analysis of fossils previously attributed to tigers showed they were from cave lions, Kyodo News reported Sunday.
Scientists collected organic material from 26 subfossils across Japan. By comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and proteins from five samples with global data, they determined that all belonged to cave lions.
“Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period,” researchers from institutions including the Graduate University for Advanced Studies and Peking University said.
Lions left Africa about 1 million years ago and spread across Eurasia, reaching Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago, when lower sea levels connected the archipelago to the continent.
Fossil evidence from Yamaguchi prefecture suggests they reached western Japan. Humans arrived around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago, and cave lions likely went extinct about 10,000 years ago.
“The findings are significant in terms of studying interaction between lions and tigers and their influence on ecosystems,” said Takumi Tsutaya, an assistant professor at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies.
Large feline fossils have been discovered across Japan, from Aomori Prefecture to Oita Prefecture, and were long assumed to be tiger remains because of the country’s warm, humid climate.

Iran seeks to get out of FATF blacklist amid domestic political divisions

Iran seeks to get out of FATF blacklist amid domestic political divisions
North Korea and Myanmar are the other two countries on the global financial blacklist as Tehran promises to continue efforts to get out of it.
Tehran, Iran – Iran says it will continue efforts to get out of a blacklist of a prominent global watchdog on money laundering and “terrorism” financing despite “20 years of obstruction” from domestic opponents.
The statement by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Iran’s Ministry of Economic Affairs on Sunday came two days after the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) renewed its years-long blacklisting of Iran, according to a report by the official IRNA news agency.

The FATF also ramped up measures aimed at isolating Iran from global financial markets with a particular focus on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and cryptocurrencies.
It recommended member states and financial institutions around the world to:
- Refuse to establish representative offices of Iranian financial institutions and VASPs or consider the noncompliance risks involved.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing offices in Iran.
- On a risk basis, limit business relationships or financial transactions, including virtual asset transactions, with Iran or people inside the country.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing new correspondent banking relationships and require them to undertake a risk-based review of existing ties.
Even the flow of funds involving humanitarian assistance, food and health supplies as well as diplomatic operating costs and personal remittances are recommended to be handled “on a risk basis considering the “terrorist” financing or proliferation financing risks emanating from Iran”.
What does the FATF move mean?
Iran has been blacklisted by the FATF for years and is currently on the list in the company of just two other countries: North Korea and Myanmar.
Since October 2019, Iran has had “heightened measures” like supervisory examination and external audit requirements recommended against it and has been subject to “effective countermeasures” since February 2020.
This contributed to making access to international transactions increasingly difficult or impossible for Iranian banks and nationals and made the country more dependent on costlier shadowy third-party intermediaries for transactions.
The new countermeasures emphasise existing frameworks but also specifically cite virtual assets, signalling an increased focus.
The fact that the FATF also urges countries and global institutions to remain wary of risks of having any dealings with Iran may mean even more limited transaction opportunities for Iranian entities and nationals.
Small banks maintaining old correspondent relations with Iranian counterparts may also reconsider after being recommended to re-evaluate existing links.
The isolation has hobbled state-run or private income streams and contributed to the continuous depreciation of the Iranian rial over the years.
Links with Iran’s nuclear dilemmas
The FATF, formerly known by its French name, was established by the Group of Seven (G7) countries in 1989 to combat money laundering but later had its mandate expanded to countering financing of “terrorism” and weapons of mass destruction.
It has been formally raising concerns about Iran since the late 2000s, which is also when it started calling for countermeasures as international tensions grew over Iran’s nuclear programme and the country was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.
But a year after Iran signed a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that lifted the sanctions, the FATF also acknowledged a “high-level political commitment” from Iran and agreed to an action plan for the country to address its compliance requirements.
The centrist government of President Hassan Rouhani, who had clinched the deals, pressed ahead with ratifying several laws needed to fulfil the action plan despite opposition from hardliners who were firmly against the increased financial transparency and international supervision.
But United States President Donald Trump unilaterally reneged on the nuclear deal in 2018, imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign that has remained in effect until today. The move empowered the argument from the hardliners in Tehran, who succeeded in blocking the ratification of the rest of the FATF-linked legislation, leaving the issue dormant for years.
Washington has retained the sanctions over the years with some of the latest – including the blacklisting in January of two United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchanges – allegedly connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The UN Security Council sanctions were also reinstated against Iran in September when Western powers triggered the “snapback” mechanism of the nuclear accord. They include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans as well as nuclear, missile and banking sanctions that are binding for all UN member states.
Support for ‘axis of resistance’
The Iranian hardliners railing against any progress on FATF-related legislation have presented two main concerns.
They assert that fully adhering to the watchdog’s guidelines would curb Tehran’s ability to back its “axis of resistance” of aligned armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine. The axis lost its base in Syria with the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
Hardliners have also suggested that Iran’s ability to circumvent US sanctions may be significantly compromised by disclosing all the information required by the FATF.
Iran has been selling most of its oil to China at hefty discounts, using a shadow fleet of ships that turn their transponders off to avoid detection in international waters. The country has also for years been forced to rely on a capillary network of currency exchanges and intermediaries, some of them based in neighbouring countries, such as Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.
To assuage some of the domestic concerns, two FATF-related laws ratified by Iran in 2025 were passed with special “conditions” and reservations infused in the text.
One of the main conditions was that the ratified regulations must not “prejudice the legitimate right of peoples or groups under colonial domination and/or foreign occupation to fight against aggression and occupation and to exercise their right to self-determination” and “shall not be construed in any manner as recognition of the Zionist occupying regime”, a reference to Israel.
Iran also said it would not accept any referral to the International Court of Justice and asserted that its own Supreme National Security Council would determine which groups qualify as “terrorist” outfits.
Those conditions were rejected by the FATF, leading to the increased countermeasures.
The watchdog also said it expects Iran to identify and freeze “terrorist assets” in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Some of Iran’s nuclear and military authorities are among individuals sanctioned by those resolutions.

Hiam Abbass: Silence is not neutral

The start of this year's Berlin Film Festival was marked by a row over how far film should venture into politics but for prominent French-Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass, "everything we do is a political act".
Abbass is starring in two films being presented at this year's Berlinale festival and in an AFP interview she emphasised the importance of a politically engaged approach to cinema.
At Thursday's opening press conference jury president Wim Wenders sparked controversy by saying "we cannot really enter the field of politics", in response to a question about Germany's support for Gaza.
"I don't agree," Abbass told AFP.
"There's a lack of courage among people in the film world -- among some, not all," said Abbass, who gained global attention for her role as Marcia Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.
She recognised that Wenders's remarks were "taken out of context", as he did talk about cinema's capacity to "change the world", albeit in a different way from party politics.
Nevertheless, Abbass said she was glad to see filmmakers at this year's festival "commit to amplifying stories and voices of minorities, oppressed people, people experiencing bombardment, genocides".
"Today more than ever, if we don't tackle these subjects, we're making art for art's sake, and that's something that doesn't interest me."
'Act of resistance'
In "Only Rebels Win" by Lebanese filmmaker Danielle Arbid, Abbass plays a Christian Palestinian living in Beirut who faces a backlash from those around her because of her relationship with a South Sudanese Muslim migrant 40 years her junior.
Israeli bombardments between September and November 2024 forced the production to relocate from Beirut to a studio near Paris, where the team deployed creative solutions to recreate the Lebanese capital.
Abbass said the circumstances turned the film into "an act of resistance".
When the bombardment of Beirut began, "I told Danielle: 'Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll follow you, because this film has to get made'."
Academy's 'open-mindedness'
Before starting on "Only Rebels Win", Abbass had just finished working on "Palestine 36" by Annemarie Jacir, a depiction of the Palestinian uprising against the British Mandate in 1936.
Abbass said that the "the film waited eight months so that it could be shot," with production forced to move to Jordan instead of the occupied West Bank.
Abbass said that the team decided that "at a certain point, we couldn't keep being subject to" the decisions of the Israeli government.
She also welcomed the Academy's decision to include three films highlighting the Palestinian experience in its shortlist for best international feature film: "Palestine 36", Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab" and Cherien Dabis's "All That's Left of You".
Only Kaouther Ben Hania's film ultimately made the final list of five nominees.
But Abbass praised the "open-mindedness" of the Academy to bring these films "almost to the final stages of the Oscars" after what she said Israel's genocide in Gaza.

Increased US military presence in Middle East aims to defend forces: Rubio
Secretary of state emphasizes diplomacy with Iran as Witkoff, Kushner travel for negotiations
ISTANBUL
The US’ increased military presence in the Middle East is intended to defend American forces from potential threats rather than signal an imminent attack on Iran, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday.
"We are postured in the region for one simple reason, and that is that we understand that there could be threats to our forces in the region," Rubio told reporters alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Washington wants to ensure "sufficient capacity to defend them, if, God forbid, that were to happen," he added.
Asked whether the Trump administration would consult and inform Congress before attacking Iran or removing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rubio said US President Donald Trump "prefers diplomacy and an outcome of negotiated settlement."
"We're dealing with people who make political, geopolitical decisions on the basis of pure theology, and it's a complicated thing," Rubio said, adding "No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we're going to try."
The US attacks on Iran last June were carried out without congressional approval or notification of top Democratic leaders in Congress. Some lawmakers objected, saying the attacks took place despite there being no imminent threat to the United States.
Rubio also said special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who have been active in the Middle East, are currently traveling for "important meetings," adding: "We'll see how that turns out."
The secretary of state pledged to "always comply with the applicable laws of the United States in terms of involving Congress" in any decisions, adding: "But right now, we're not talking about any of that. We're talking about negotiations."
"The president made that clear: If that changes, it'll be obvious to everyone, and obviously whatever the law requires us to do, we'll do," Rubio said.
The US has significantly increased its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with reports of plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier amid heightened tensions with Tehran.

Iran’s Araghchi slams European powers for ‘irrelevance’ in nuclear talks
Foreign minister says regional powers have been ‘far more effective’ than the European countries.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has derided the Munich Security Conference as a “circus”, accusing European powers of “paralysis and irrelevance” in efforts to revive nuclear negotiations with the United States.
Iranian officials were not invited to the annual security meeting in the German city, and the top Iranian diplomat made the remarks in a post on X on Sunday, two days before Iranian and US officials are to hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland.

“Sad to see the usually serious Munich Security Conference turned into the ‘Munich Circus’ when it comes to Iran,” Araghchi wrote on X. “The paralysis and irrelevance of the EU/E3 is displayed in the dynamics surrounding the current talks over Iran’s nuclear program. … Once a key interlocutor, Europe is now nowhere to be seen. Instead, our friends in the region [the Gulf] are far more effective and helpful than an empty-handed and peripheral E3.”
The E3 – which included France, the United Kingdom and Germany – were key players in the previous round of nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran. That process culminated in 2015 with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a landmark agreement aimed at limiting the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
The US under the first administration of President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and ramped up sanctions on Iran. Since then, the process has largely stalled. Still, the E3 maintained a role as a go-between with Tehran and Washington.
But since negotiations resumed last year, Gulf countries, such as Oman and Qatar, have taken the lead in facilitating talks between the US and Iran.
Araghchi’s comments “indicate a policy shift from the Iranian side that the E3 mechanism … is no longer a valid channel for resolution”, said Abas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies. “This nuclear mediation has moved from Europe to the region, and now the heavy lifting in diplomacy is done by regional players.”
On Tuesday, Oman is to host talks between the US and Iran in Geneva after previous indirect negotiations in Muscat on February 6. Those talks were attended by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
US and Iranian officials previously held several rounds of talks in the Omani capital to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme last year. But that process was halted as Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined by bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities.
The new rounds of negotiations come as tensions in the region remain high with Trump moving more US military assets to the Middle East. On Friday, Trump said he was sending a second aircraft carrier to the region while openly talking about a change in Iran’s government.
Despite the new push for diplomacy, the two sides have maintained their positions. Iran has shown flexibility in discussing its nuclear programme, but the US wants to widen the talks to include Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support for regional armed groups – two issues that Tehran says are nonnegotiable.

Poll: Around 62% of Czechs want Prague-led ammunition initiative for Ukraine to keep going
Around 62% of Czech citizens support the continuation of a Prague-led initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine.
Source: České noviny, a Czech news outlet, as reported by European Pravda
Details: A poll conducted in January found that 62% of Czechs back the continuation of the Czech-led initiative, while 36% are against it.
Another 3% of respondents were undecided.
Pavel Ranocha, an analyst at Kantar CZ, the Czech branch of the global market research firm Kantar, says almost 100% of opposition party voters back the continuation of the initiative to supply ammunition to Ukraine.
Among supporters of ruling parties, two-thirds of Motorists voters would approve such a decision. Half of ANO supporters and one-fifth of SDP supporters gave the same response.
Background:
- Before taking office as Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš promised to scrap the Czech-led initiative that helps supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition.
- After a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris, Babiš said the initiative on ammunition for Ukraine can continue if it is financed by other states.
- A senior NATO official recently said the Czech-led initiative has found significantly more shells than expected.
