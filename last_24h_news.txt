US forces intercept sanctioned oil tanker tied to Venezuela in Indian Ocean
‘Vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine,’ says Pentagon as military forces boarded the Veronica III overnight

US military forces have boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean, having tracked the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an operation targeting illicit oil linked to Venezuela, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.
Venezuela has been subject to US oil sanctions for several years, leading to its reliance on a 'shadow fleet' of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to exert pressure on then-President Nicolás Maduro, who was later apprehended in January during an American military operation.
The Defense Department confirmed via a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III overnight, executing "a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding."
The Pentagon stated: "The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
The Veronica III, a Panamanian-flagged vessel, is listed under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control website. Video released by the Pentagon depicted US troops boarding the tanker.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its wider efforts to take control of Venezuela's oil. However, the Pentagon's post did not specify whether the Veronica III had been formally seized and placed under US control.
This incident follows another boarding last week, when the US military intercepted the Aquila II, a different tanker, also in the Indian Ocean. That vessel is currently being held while its ultimate fate is determined by the United States, a defence official stated last week on condition of anonymity.
The Aquila II was one of at least 16 tankers that departed the Venezuelan coast last month after US forces captured President Nicolás Maduro, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com. He said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship's movements.
The Aquila II is a Panamanian-flagged tanker under US sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil. Owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship tracking data shows it has spent much of the last year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location.

French 'ultra-left' behind killing of right-wing youth, says justice minister Darmanin
France

The "ultra-left" in France was behind the deadly beating of a French youth aligned with the far right whose death has inflamed political tensions in the country, the justice minister said on Sunday, February 15. Gérald Darmanin also accused hard-left politicians, including from the La France Insoumise (LFI) party, the largest left-wing faction in parliament, of fueling violence with their language.
The victim, identified only as Quentin, aged 23, had been hospitalized and placed into a coma on Thursday after being attacked in the southeastern city of Lyon. Supporters said he was providing security at a protest against an appearance by Rima Hassan, an LFI member of the European Parliament, at the Lyon branch of the Sciences Po university when he was assaulted by a gang of rival activists.
The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it added.
"It was clearly the ultra left that killed him," Darmanin told RTL television. "There are indeed speeches, particularly from La France Insoumise and the ultra-left, which unfortunately lead to unbridled violence on social networks and then in the physical world," he said. "Words can kill," Darmanin added, accusing Hassan and LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon of "not having a word to say for the family of the young man."
Calls for calm
Lyon prosecutors have yet to give details on the circumstances of the killing. According to the Nemesis collective, which is close to the far right, Quentin was providing security for its protesters and was assaulted by "anti-fascist" activists.
The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organized and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked."
LFI lawmaker Eric Coquerel, speaking to Franceinfo, condemned "all political violence" but said the activists responsible for Hassan's security "were in no way involved in what happened." He pointed instead to a particular "context" in the southeastern city marked by violence from "far-right groups."
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.
With tensions between France's far right and radical left intensifying ahead of the 2027 presidential election, centrist President Emmanuel Macron has called for "calm" and "restraint."

Polish President Karol Nawrocki thinks his country should start developing nuclear defenses, given the threat from Moscow.
In an interview with Polsat television on Sunday, Nawrocki described himself as "a great supporter of Poland joining the nuclear project" and argued that the country should develop its security strategy "based on nuclear potential."
He added: "This path, with respect for all international regulations, is the path we should take. ... We must work towards this goal so that we can begin the work. We are a country right on the border of an armed conflict. The aggressive, imperial attitude of Russia toward Poland is well known."

Did Hong Kong souvenir shop tread on IP rights with viral ‘MTR station’ wall?
Wall featured signs nearly identical to ones found in rail stations before workers took down lettering
A souvenir shop in Hong Kong has taken down lettering from its viral wall featuring designs nearly identical to MTR station signage amid concerns over possible trademark and copyright infringement.
The MTR Corporation on Sunday declined to say whether the move by the Causeway Bay store was done at its request.
The company “attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property, which is safeguarded under the law of Hong Kong, and we shall act accordingly in the event of suspected infringement,” a spokesman for the rail operator told the South China Morning Post.
Earlier this month, the wall next to the storefront belonging to Hong Kong Souvenir on Kai Chiu Road in Causeway Bay was transformed into a “check-in” spot that soon attracted photo-snapping crowds.

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’
Palestinian Authority says Israel's move constitutes ‘termination of signed agreements,’ urges UN Security Council and US to intervene
ISTANBUL
The Palestinian Authority on Sunday warned that an Israeli government decision to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” amounts to a “de facto annexation” of the occupied territory and a violation of international law.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Wafa, the Authority said the Israeli move constitutes “a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions” and poses a threat to security and stability.
It described the measure as a “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian land” and an official launch of annexation plans aimed at consolidating the occupation through illegal settlement expansion.
It also constitutes “a termination of the signed agreements and clearly contradicts the resolutions of the UN Security Council, especially Resolution 2334, which considers all settlement activity in the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal.”
The Authority stressed that unilateral Israeli actions “would not confer legitimacy over Palestinian land and would not change the legal and historical status of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as occupied territory under international law.”
It called on the international community, particularly the UN Security Council and the US administration, to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli measures and compel Tel Aviv to comply with international law to prevent further escalation.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Israel’s public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” the Israel Hayom newspaper commented ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Gisèle Pelicot speaks

Gisèle Pelicot speaks
WARNING: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse.
For 50 years, Gisèle Pelicot lived with her husband, Dominique Pelicot, whom she described as "a kind man, a devoted family man. It was a beautiful love story, until the day I found myself facing the horror of the facts."
Those facts shattered Gisèle's seemingly normal life, and put her at the center of a mass rape trial – an unthinkable crime that gripped France and received worldwide attention. But it was her response that would be defining.
She sat down with "CBS Sunday Morning," for what she said was her first-ever interview: "Yes, it's a first," she said through an interpreter. "I'm not used to speaking in front of cameras. I used to be a very discreet woman."
It all unravelled in 2020, inside a supermarket in Mazan, France, when what seemed like a small crime uncovered a far greater one. Dominique Pelicot was caught taking video up women's skirts. His arrest led to the discovery of disturbing footage taken inside their home of Gisèle Pelicot unconscious.
"My world collapsed"
At a local police station, an investigator told Gisèle what they found: "He said, 'Mrs. Pelicot, do you recognize yourself in these photos?'" she recalled. "And I said, 'No, it's not me.' Then he said, 'This is your bedroom.' And I see a woman I don't recognize at all, completely asleep with a man beside her. I don't know this man. And then he says, 'I'm going to tell you something shocking: You were raped by 53 individuals.' My world collapsed."
She described the woman in the video as looking like a rag doll. That woman was her. "Yes, it was me, but this woman was lifeless," she said. "She looked dead."
Her response? "I could not speak. I was in such a state of shock. All I wanted was to go home, to get my life back as it was before."
But that life was gone. The man she knew as a loving father to their three children, and a doting grandfather, had been drugging her with sleeping pills and muscle relaxants, then inviting men he met online to abuse her.
Her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, said it represented hundreds of rapes over at least 10 years. He and Gisèle started to grasp the scale of the crimes as they prepared for trial – "In the range of hundreds, if not thousands" of photos, he said. "And for videos, definitely hundreds."
Among the evidence: messages Dominque Pelicot posted online ("I'm looking for a pervert accomplice to abuse my sleeping wife..."), and text messages ("I'm about to dose her... We have to wait at least one hour to abuse").
"It's been a real journey into the darkness," said Babonneau. He described the images as "scenes of torture. There is no other word for that. … On this video we see a human being, being treated as an object. We see men who desecrate a human body, who desecrates someone, Gisèle, who is in profound distress, because her life was at risk at every moment where she was drugged and abused."
Victims of sexual abuse can remain anonymous in France. So up until the trial in 2024, Gisèle Pelicot's name was not known. But then she made a bold decision: to demand an open trial, allowing the public and the press into the courtroom.
Revealing her identity to the world, she said, was difficult: "It was very hard. I didn't want anybody to discover and know about this woman who had experienced all this violence. Because, in truth, victims always feel shame about what happened to them. I told myself that if I opened the closed-door proceedings, the shame would change sides."
The words "Shame Has to Change Sides" are the subtitle of her intimate account of the ordeal, "A Hymn to Life" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).
Babonneau said he was worried when he heard that she wanted to have an open trial: "Because we knew that there would be a tremendous pressure on her," he said.
"Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy"
At trial, the accused hid their faces as they filed into court. They ranged in age from 26 to 74. Among them: a firefighter, a soldier, and a nurse. In court, many claimed Gisèle Pelicot must have known, must have been complicit.
But Dominique Pelicot admitted everything, testifying, "It was always against her knowledge," adding he drugged her two to three times a week. "I had an addiction," he said.
Looking back, Gisèle said, there were warning signs: "I only knew I had blackouts, and I had health problems," she said. There were also periods where her memory was affected. "I couldn't remember that I'd been to the hairdresser; it was only the next day that I realized I had," she said. "And when I called my children, it was the same – I didn't remember our conversations.
"I thought I was seriously ill. I consulted neurologists, I had a CT scan – nothing was found," she said.
Even recounting her horrifying ordeal to "Sunday Morning," Gisèle Pelicot maintained her poise. "I've always been this way," she said. "Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy. And I didn't want to go down that path."
The trial made headlines worldwide, and drew huge crowds of supporters, who praised Gisèle Pelicot for her bravery, holding her up as a feminist hero. Seeing those supporters, she said, made her feel that she was not alone: "It was an incredible source of strength for me."
All of the 51 men eventually put on trial were convicted. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to the maximum of 20 years.
He has asked for his (now ex-)wife's forgiveness. But Gisèle Pelicot says, "No. Forgiveness is extremely difficult. But I don't want to live in hatred. I do need to speak with him – and it will also be to say goodbye."
But she does want to see him again. "Yes," she said. "I need answers. I may never get them. But that's also part of my journey."
During our interview, just off camera, was Gisèle's new partner, Jean-Loup, who was also by her side during the trial, along with her children.
"I never thought I'd fall in love, or even want to," she said. "It's a beautiful story. As for the rest, it belongs to us, and I keep that to myself."
But you're in love? "Indeed. You can fall in love at any age. Everything is possible. That, too, is a message of hope, to tell yourself that nothing is lost in life."
Despite the details of her ordeal, by the end of the book, her story is, miraculously, uplifting. "I was always wondering what my mission on Earth was, why I had been born," she said. "Some are painters, some are poets, others are writers. I think my mission was to give others hope, that even after hardship, you can rise again and choose happiness. I think that was my mission."

Mikaela Shiffrin fails to make the podium in women's giant slalom as Olympic drought continues
Mikaela Shiffrin's Olympic drought continues after she missed the podium of the Milano Cortina Games women's giant slalom on Sunday, finishing in 11th place.
The U.S. standout had a combined time of 2:14.42. Her runs were clean but just not quick enough to challenge for a podium spot. She didn't show any outward signs of disappointment after her second run, blowing out her cheeks and waving to the fans in the grandstand with both hands.
The 30-year-old, who is the winningest athlete on the World Cup circuit, has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic events since the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang.
Italy's Federica Brignone took home the top prize, her second gold medal of these Games and her fifth medal overall. Remarkably, it was a split silver medal after Sweden's Sara Hector and Norway's Thea Stjernesund posted the same time in both the first and second runs.
After Brignone crossed the line to loud cheers from the home crowd, Hector and Stjernesund ran into the finish area and bowed down to the champion to a backdrop of chants of "Fede" from fans.
"That was, like, the greatest show of GS skiing that we've had in a really long time," Shiffrin said. "And to do it, you know, at the Olympics where people actually have eyes on the sport. Federica skied incredible. That was so cool to watch."
Redemption for Shiffrin, who came in fourth place with teammate Breezy Johnston in the women's team combined event on Thursday, could come at her best event — the slalom — on Wednesday.

Iran’s top general warns new war will be ‘lesson’ for Trump ahead of next round of talks
Next round of US-Iran nuclear talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva
By Syed Zafar Mehdi
TEHRAN, Iran (AA) - Iran’s top military commander warned Sunday that any US war against Tehran would serve as “a lesson” for President Donald Trump, as tensions continue to simmer in the region.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said that the US president should understand he would be entering “a lesson-giving battle.”
Trump said on Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen,” as tensions escalate amid the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
He announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, would soon head to the region in case ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran fail.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” he said. “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the Persian Gulf region, having been dispatched last month amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Mousavi described Trump’s comments as “unworthy of a president” and “reckless.”
He said that if Trump intends to wage war, he should not speak of “negotiations,” referring to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy between the two sides that resumed earlier this month.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on Feb. 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, according to Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who confirmed the meeting in an interview on Sunday.
He said Washington must demonstrate its commitment to reaching an agreement aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said. “If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”

Woman who filmed Snapchat videos while speeding jailed after killing two
A woman jailed after overtaking on the wrong side of the road and causing a fatal collision had repeatedly posted videos of herself speeding while using her mobile phone to social media.
Taxi driver Octavian Codreanu was killed at the scene on the B4425 near Aldsworth in December 2022, and his passenger, schoolteacher Moyra Whelan, later died from her injuries.
Liberty Michell, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and two counts of causing death by driving whilst uninsured.
Mitchell had passed her driving test just three weeks before the crash.
Gloucestershire Police said footage from Mitchell’s Snapchat account showed her driving on narrow roads at speeds of up to 100mph.
Mitchell, 21, of Chipping Norton, was sentenced to six years and eight months at Gloucester Crown Court on Friday (13 February) and banned from driving for more than eight years.

After Munich Speech, Rubio Visits Trump’s Allies in Slovakia and Hungary

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Slovakia on Sunday, continuing his European tour with visits to countries led by right-wing allies of President Donald Trump, with the next stop Hungary.
The visits come a day after Rubio called on Europeans to defend “Western civilisation” in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, urging them to rally behind the US president’s vision of a “renewal” of the world order.

During a visit of several hours in Bratislava, Rubio is scheduled to meet Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, a nationalist leader who has positioned himself as an ally to Trump.
During a recent visit to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Fico reportedly expressed concern about the US president’s mental state, according to Politico, citing anonymous European diplomats.
Both Washington and Bratislava have vehemently denied this.
The Slovak leader said after the Mar-a-Lago meeting that he and Trump had had “extremely important” discussions on nuclear energy.
The US Secretary of State will then travel to Budapest for meetings on Monday with Hungarian officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Trump makes no secret of his support for the right-wing Hungarian nationalist leader, whom he describes as a “strong and powerful man,” ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April 12.
Orban faces the toughest challenge to his grip on power since returning to office in 2010, as his Fidesz party trails opposition leader Peter Magyar’s TISZA party in the polls before the election.
Zelensky Pokes Fun at Orban’s ‘Belly’ at Munich
- Friend of MAGA movement -
In a speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to continue his fight against “bought pseudo-civil organisations, journalists, judges and politicians”.
Orban’s rhetoric and politics often echo those of Trump, and he has cast himself as a European friend of Trump’s MAGA movement.
Many American conservatives admire Orban for his hardline anti-immigration stance, resistance to LGBTQ rights and war against “gender ideology”.
Orban has also announced plans to travel to Washington next week to attend the inaugural meeting of Trump’s “Board of Peace”.
Orban also managed to secure Hungary an exemption from US sanctions on importing Russian oil and gas during a visit to the White House last year.
Former Democratic president Joe Biden had a much more hostile relationship with Orban, whom he accused of “looking for a dictatorship” in Hungary, including by muzzling independent media.
Energy is expected to be a major topic of discussion for Rubio in both Bratislava and Budapest, US officials indicated ahead of the trip.
These two nations are landlocked Central European countries that have sought to keep warm ties to the Kremlin despite the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Both also depend heavily on Russian fossil fuels, and both countries have found themselves locked in a standoff with the European Union over the decision to end imports of Russian gas.
US officials said Washington intends to strengthen energy ties with its two right-wing European allies.

The Smoke-and-Mirrors Rhetoric Shielding Georgia’s Outcast Autocracy

This week, US Vice President JD Vance paid visit to two capitals in the South Caucasus while snubbing a third. Nikol Pashinyan and Ilham Aliyev, the respective leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, welcomed Vance amid a thaw in relations between their countries. For both states, this marks the highest-level visit of a US official to date.
“You know what the context of Georgian-American relations is. This context is very difficult,” admitted the prime minister of neighboring Georgia, Irakli Kobakhidze, during a press conference following the announcement of Vance’s visit.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Two decades ago, Georgia’s capital Tbilisi hosted then President George W. Bush with great ceremony, but as of late the only procession seen on its main thoroughfare, Rustaveli avenue, has been that of the anti-government protests that have continued for over a year.
The Trump administration, of course, is not averse to making overtures to autocrats, as Baku’s presence on Vance’s tour attests. But Georgia’s authoritarian course has seen the country become particularly isolated on the world stage.
“It’s not only the US, it’s the whole West,” says Giga Bokeria, co-leader of the Federalists opposition party. In another political life, Bokeria had a prominent role in Georgia’s previous pro-Western government – the same that hosted Bush – and so feels keenly the country’s current ostracization under the ruling Georgian Dream party.
European Debate Over Nuclear Weapons Gains Pace
“What does it mean for us that they are isolated fundamentally from the UK, from the EU, from the US, all the important allies...? It’s a very dangerous thing – to be left alone vis-à-vis Russia in this region,” he told Kyiv Post.
Georgia’s government has been routinely accused of courting Russia, which invaded the country in 2008 and continues to occupy approximately 20 percent of its internationally recognized territory, during its drift away from the West.
But this alignment cannot be trumpeted. While the Kremlin has made some quietly complimentary gestures in Georgia’s direction – Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised its avoidance of a “Ukrainian or Moldovan scenario” in March – Georgian Dream must still pay lip service to a largely pro-European, anti-Russia population in order to survive politically.
The government continually relies on an arsenal of warped foreign policy talking points to shrug off their lost friendships, conceal their appeasement of their northern neighbor, and to maintain their grip on power.
“Immense gaslighting” over Europe
Despite doing everything it can to tarnish its relationship with the EU, Georgian Dream rarely pillory the bloc directly, opting instead for what George Melashvili, a Georgian civic activist and political sciences scholar, calls “rhetorical shenanigans.”
“One of the major pillars of Georgian Dream’s ability to control the country is immense gaslighting,” he told Kyiv Post. This includes an insistence that Georgia can still join the EU at the end of the decade, “a notion that simply does not stand against any critique.”
The period following the government’s suspension of EU accession talks in November 2024 – ostensibly a temporary measure – has seen violent crackdowns on protests, government critics imprisoned, and major opposition parties threatened with bans.
In recent months, Kobakhidze has given a series of interviews to pro-government media where he has claimed openness to cooperation with Europe while expressing concern, of all things, for the state of its democracy – a tactic that Melashvili calls “mirroring.”
“We sometimes joke that whatever Georgian Dream actually is itself, they’re trying to project on others,” he adds.
For an insight into Georgian Dream’s unfiltered feelings about Europe, Melashvili considers its satellite parties an “excellent place” to look. Last week one of these, United Neutral Georgia, called for pro-government broadcasters to host debates on the “harmful process of EU integration.”
Russia’s “natural ally”
Following Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia and subsequent recognition of its two breakaway regions – Abkhazia and South Ossetia – as independent states, Georgia severed and has not renewed diplomatic relations with its neighbor. Critics argue, however, that an under-the-table relationship has taken root under Georgian Dream.
Much of the blame for this is directed at one man: while Kobakhidze heads the government officially, billionaire oligarch and Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili is widely regarded as Georgia’s de-facto ruler. He made his fortune in Russia in the years after the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Melashvili is convinced that Ivanishvili’s Russia alignment, if not projected openly, is clear in substance: “I cannot say whether or not Ivanishvili or Kobakhidze are receiving folders with orders from the Kremlin or the [FSB headquarters] Lubyanka, but what we can do is evaluate the results... Georgia’s economic dependency on Russia has increased. Georgia’s political dependency on Russia has also increased.”
Bokeria agrees that the presence or absence of direct Russian orders is beside the point: “The nature of [Ivanishvili’s] rule, his regime, the instincts he plays on... make him a natural ally of Russia.”
“He’s a guy from the 90s in Moscow,” he told Kyiv Post, “that’s where his mentality was shaped and formed.”
The rhetoric this produces, again, is indirect. “The main purpose of GD [Georgian Dream] propaganda is not to portray Russia as the good guys. They know it is impossible,” says Melashvili, instead they “gaslight the Georgian public into believing that the European Union is equally [as bad] or even worse than Russia.”
Russia’s war on Ukraine, Bokeria notes, has gifted Georgian Dream further rhetorical cover for its Kremlin appeasement. “Fear of change is connected with the fear of war in the propaganda of GD,” he explains.
Last year Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned a Georgian Dream campaign ad that placed images of Russia’s war alongside the slogan “Choose peace!”
A bad balancing act
For all its multifarious duplicity, this foreign policy rhetoric is less a masterplan than a desperate gambit.
“All that they care about... it’s not Georgia’s long-term interest or strategy, it’s to sustain the absolute power that they have right now,” Melashvili affirms.
This tunnel vision seems to blind the government to its mounting ostracization. Before Vance landed in Armenia, there were no invites for Georgia to the WEF meeting in Davos, nor to Trump’s recently conceived “Board of Peace.”
Moreover, the president’s “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” set to commercially reconcile Armenia and Azerbaijan, threatens to harm Georgia’s strategic importance in the so-called “Middle Corridor.”
“Georgian Dream would absolutely love to be participating in all those meetings and events,” says Melashvili, but “if the cost is to give away even small parts of their power, they will never concede such actions.”
Georgian Dream’s appeals to the Trump administration, both in professed ideological kinship and in calls to lift Biden-era sanctions on government officials, have gone unanswered.
While Georgia’s president Mikheil Kavelashvili claimed Vance expressed a desire for renewed relations when they met at the Winter Olympics in Milan last week, any significant practical steps in this regard are yet to be taken.
If Trump provides a model for playing both sides of the divide between Europe and Russia, then Georgian Dream has been thus far incapable of emulating it. “If we’re talking about a balancing act, then Georgian Dream is doing a horrible job,” says Melashvili. “[They have] not been able to balance Russia with the West or with China or with the United States. They have simply been putting more and more coins on the scales of Russia.”
But the Georgian people have proved more difficult to back into a corner than their government. “We’re not yet in the situation of Belarus, even though we’re getting very close to it,” Melashvili says. “The Georgian public continues to fight.”
Georgian Dream’s press officer did not respond to a request for comment.

Ukrainian freestyle skier Kateryna Kotsar had a Valentine’s Day to remember, clinching a spot in the Winter Olympics big air medals contest and receiving a marriage proposal on the slopes.
Kotsar landed two strong jumps in Monday’s qualifying round, securing 11th place – just above the cutoff of 12 skiers advancing to the final.

Minutes after her final run, her boyfriend, Bohdan Fashtryha, surprised her by getting down on one knee at the side of the Alpine slope. She said yes.
“I think he was nervous. It was so cute, to be honest,” the 25-year-old Kotsar told reporters.
Fashtryha told Suspilne Sport that he had been planning the proposal for two years. When their relationship began, Kotsar had been considering whether to continue her sports career.
With support from her parents, Fashtryha convinced her to stay in the sport.
“She was really thinking about whether to continue her athletic career. I, along with her parents, encouraged her to go on, because the chance to go to the Olympics is unique and can’t be missed. I imagined this moment even back then – two years ago. Since then, so many things have happened, and now Katya is at the Olympics. The brave find happiness. It just so happened that I could be here,” he said.
Earlier in the day, Kotsar had a hard crash on her third run, sending both skis and goggles flying – but her strong first two jumps secured her place in the final. After the proposal, she removed her ski glove to show off her engagement ring.
Kotsar also revealed a message on her glove that read “Freedom of memory”, a gesture of solidarity with skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was disqualified by the IOC for wearing a “memory helmet” honoring fallen Ukrainian defenders and athletes.
“I still am excited and can’t understand what happened tonight because it’s two really huge things for me,” Kotsar said.
Her final Olympic performance is scheduled for Monday, Feb. 16, at 8:30 p.m. Kyiv time.

IDF strikes continue as key meetings loom over Hezbollah disarmament in Lebanon

The IDF continued overnight Sunday to strike sites in Lebanon used for storing weapons and operating launchers belonging to Hezbollah, as daily attacks target what officials describe as the terrorist organization’s efforts to rebuild its capabilities.
Strikes have been carried out by fighter jets, drones targeting vehicles carrying Hezbollah terrorists, as well as artillery and machine gun fire. Despite the sustained military activity, there has been no significant diplomatic breakthrough, and the situation along the northern front appears to be in a holding pattern pending broader regional developments, particularly involving Iran.
Three upcoming meetings are expected to clarify or potentially advance developments.
The first is a Lebanese government session scheduled for Monday. Lebanese Army Commander Rodolphe Haykal provides monthly updates to the cabinet on progress in implementing a plan to consolidate weapons under state control. According to recent reports, he is expected to present the second phase of that plan, covering areas north of the Litani River.
Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to the area south of the Litani. The terrorist organization maintains that instead of pressuring it, the Lebanese government should focus on securing the withdrawal of remaining forces from southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem is also expected to deliver a speech Monday at a memorial event for leaders of the terrorist organization, and is anticipated to address developments in Lebanon and the wider region.
Another key meeting, set for the 25th of the month, involves the ceasefire monitoring mechanism committee, which has convened 13 times in 2025. The body was initially limited to military representatives but was later expanded to include Simon Karam, a former Lebanese ambassador to the United States, as the civilian head of the Lebanese delegation.
Senior Hezbollah officials opposed Karam’s inclusion, describing it as a “second mistake,” following what they called the first error — the plan to consolidate weapons — undertaken “under continued occupation of Lebanese territory and daily attacks.”
From Hezbollah’s perspective, any discussion of its weapons must take place solely within the framework of a domestic Lebanese national defense strategy, free of external pressure and only after several conditions are met: a halt to attacks, the return of Lebanese prisoners and a full withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
The terrorist organization views the ceasefire monitoring committee as having a strictly technical mandate limited to implementing commitments under the agreement, which it says applies only to areas south of the Litani River. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Mousawi reiterated that position earlier this month.
Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper affiliated with Hezbollah, published an article Friday titled: “What if the state dared to withdraw from the mechanism?” The piece argued that as long as attacks, destruction and killings continue following the 2024 ceasefire declaration, and as international promises remain unfulfilled, reconsidering cooperation with the mechanism becomes a legitimate question.
The article outlined potential advantages and disadvantages of suspending cooperation, concluding that such a move would restore Lebanon’s national dignity and its right to defend itself “by all means,” asserting that the world respects only those who respect themselves.
A further significant date for Lebanon is March 5, when a conference in France is scheduled to support the Lebanese Army and security forces. A preparatory meeting is expected beforehand. Earlier this month, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called on Arab states to participate in the conference, saying, “We need your help.”
Lebanese leadership, including President Joseph Aoun, Salam and Haykal, has emphasized in meetings abroad that the army requires substantial assistance to carry out its missions. Haykal recently returned from a visit to the United States, where he met with political and military officials to discuss ways to enhance military cooperation and support the army’s capabilities.
In a statement, the Lebanese Army said American officials praised its performance and operations south of the Litani River.

Lions lived in Japan thousands of years ago: Study
Study says lions reached Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago when lower sea levels connected it to Eurasia
ISTANBUL
Lions once roamed much of Japan tens of thousands of years ago, researchers said, after fossils long thought to be tiger remains were identified as belonging to an extinct species of lion.
A study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that DNA and protein analysis of fossils previously attributed to tigers showed they were from cave lions, Kyodo News reported Sunday.
Scientists collected organic material from 26 subfossils across Japan. By comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and proteins from five samples with global data, they determined that all belonged to cave lions.
“Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period,” researchers from institutions including the Graduate University for Advanced Studies and Peking University said.
Lions left Africa about 1 million years ago and spread across Eurasia, reaching Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago, when lower sea levels connected the archipelago to the continent.
Fossil evidence from Yamaguchi prefecture suggests they reached western Japan. Humans arrived around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago, and cave lions likely went extinct about 10,000 years ago.
“The findings are significant in terms of studying interaction between lions and tigers and their influence on ecosystems,” said Takumi Tsutaya, an assistant professor at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies.
Large feline fossils have been discovered across Japan, from Aomori Prefecture to Oita Prefecture, and were long assumed to be tiger remains because of the country’s warm, humid climate.

Iran seeks to get out of FATF blacklist amid domestic political divisions

Iran seeks to get out of FATF blacklist amid domestic political divisions
North Korea and Myanmar are the other two countries on the global financial blacklist as Tehran promises to continue efforts to get out of it.
Tehran, Iran – Iran says it will continue efforts to get out of a blacklist of a prominent global watchdog on money laundering and “terrorism” financing despite “20 years of obstruction” from domestic opponents.
The statement by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Iran’s Ministry of Economic Affairs on Sunday came two days after the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) renewed its years-long blacklisting of Iran, according to a report by the official IRNA news agency.

- list 4 of 4Iran’s Larijani accuses Israel of trying to sabotage US negotiations
The FATF also ramped up measures aimed at isolating Iran from global financial markets with a particular focus on virtual asset service providers (VASPs) and cryptocurrencies.
It recommended member states and financial institutions around the world to:
- Refuse to establish representative offices of Iranian financial institutions and VASPs or consider the noncompliance risks involved.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing offices in Iran.
- On a risk basis, limit business relationships or financial transactions, including virtual asset transactions, with Iran or people inside the country.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing new correspondent banking relationships and require them to undertake a risk-based review of existing ties.
Even the flow of funds involving humanitarian assistance, food and health supplies as well as diplomatic operating costs and personal remittances are recommended to be handled “on a risk basis considering the “terrorist” financing or proliferation financing risks emanating from Iran”.
What does the FATF move mean?
Iran has been blacklisted by the FATF for years and is currently on the list in the company of just two other countries: North Korea and Myanmar.
Since October 2019, Iran has had “heightened measures” like supervisory examination and external audit requirements recommended against it and has been subject to “effective countermeasures” since February 2020.
This contributed to making access to international transactions increasingly difficult or impossible for Iranian banks and nationals and made the country more dependent on costlier shadowy third-party intermediaries for transactions.
The new countermeasures emphasise existing frameworks but also specifically cite virtual assets, signalling an increased focus.
The fact that the FATF also urges countries and global institutions to remain wary of risks of having any dealings with Iran may mean even more limited transaction opportunities for Iranian entities and nationals.
Small banks maintaining old correspondent relations with Iranian counterparts may also reconsider after being recommended to re-evaluate existing links.
The isolation has hobbled state-run or private income streams and contributed to the continuous depreciation of the Iranian rial over the years.
Links with Iran’s nuclear dilemmas
The FATF, formerly known by its French name, was established by the Group of Seven (G7) countries in 1989 to combat money laundering but later had its mandate expanded to countering financing of “terrorism” and weapons of mass destruction.
It has been formally raising concerns about Iran since the late 2000s, which is also when it started calling for countermeasures as international tensions grew over Iran’s nuclear programme and the country was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.
But a year after Iran signed a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that lifted the sanctions, the FATF also acknowledged a “high-level political commitment” from Iran and agreed to an action plan for the country to address its compliance requirements.
The centrist government of President Hassan Rouhani, who had clinched the deals, pressed ahead with ratifying several laws needed to fulfil the action plan despite opposition from hardliners who were firmly against the increased financial transparency and international supervision.
But United States President Donald Trump unilaterally reneged on the nuclear deal in 2018, imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign that has remained in effect until today. The move empowered the argument from the hardliners in Tehran, who succeeded in blocking the ratification of the rest of the FATF-linked legislation, leaving the issue dormant for years.
Washington has retained the sanctions over the years with some of the latest – including the blacklisting in January of two United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchanges – allegedly connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The UN Security Council sanctions were also reinstated against Iran in September when Western powers triggered the “snapback” mechanism of the nuclear accord. They include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans as well as nuclear, missile and banking sanctions that are binding for all UN member states.
Support for ‘axis of resistance’
The Iranian hardliners railing against any progress on FATF-related legislation have presented two main concerns.
They assert that fully adhering to the watchdog’s guidelines would curb Tehran’s ability to back its “axis of resistance” of aligned armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine. The axis lost its base in Syria with the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
Hardliners have also suggested that Iran’s ability to circumvent US sanctions may be significantly compromised by disclosing all the information required by the FATF.
Iran has been selling most of its oil to China at hefty discounts, using a shadow fleet of ships that turn their transponders off to avoid detection in international waters. The country has also for years been forced to rely on a capillary network of currency exchanges and intermediaries, some of them based in neighbouring countries, such as Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.
To assuage some of the domestic concerns, two FATF-related laws ratified by Iran in 2025 were passed with special “conditions” and reservations infused in the text.
One of the main conditions was that the ratified regulations must not “prejudice the legitimate right of peoples or groups under colonial domination and/or foreign occupation to fight against aggression and occupation and to exercise their right to self-determination” and “shall not be construed in any manner as recognition of the Zionist occupying regime”, a reference to Israel.
Iran also said it would not accept any referral to the International Court of Justice and asserted that its own Supreme National Security Council would determine which groups qualify as “terrorist” outfits.
Those conditions were rejected by the FATF, leading to the increased countermeasures.
The watchdog also said it expects Iran to identify and freeze “terrorist assets” in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Some of Iran’s nuclear and military authorities are among individuals sanctioned by those resolutions.

Hiam Abbass: Silence is not neutral

The start of this year's Berlin Film Festival was marked by a row over how far film should venture into politics but for prominent French-Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass, "everything we do is a political act".
Abbass is starring in two films being presented at this year's Berlinale festival and in an AFP interview she emphasised the importance of a politically engaged approach to cinema.
At Thursday's opening press conference jury president Wim Wenders sparked controversy by saying "we cannot really enter the field of politics", in response to a question about Germany's support for Gaza.
"I don't agree," Abbass told AFP.
"There's a lack of courage among people in the film world -- among some, not all," said Abbass, who gained global attention for her role as Marcia Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.
She recognised that Wenders's remarks were "taken out of context", as he did talk about cinema's capacity to "change the world", albeit in a different way from party politics.
Nevertheless, Abbass said she was glad to see filmmakers at this year's festival "commit to amplifying stories and voices of minorities, oppressed people, people experiencing bombardment, genocides".
"Today more than ever, if we don't tackle these subjects, we're making art for art's sake, and that's something that doesn't interest me."
'Act of resistance'
In "Only Rebels Win" by Lebanese filmmaker Danielle Arbid, Abbass plays a Christian Palestinian living in Beirut who faces a backlash from those around her because of her relationship with a South Sudanese Muslim migrant 40 years her junior.
Israeli bombardments between September and November 2024 forced the production to relocate from Beirut to a studio near Paris, where the team deployed creative solutions to recreate the Lebanese capital.
Abbass said the circumstances turned the film into "an act of resistance".
When the bombardment of Beirut began, "I told Danielle: 'Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll follow you, because this film has to get made'."
Academy's 'open-mindedness'
Before starting on "Only Rebels Win", Abbass had just finished working on "Palestine 36" by Annemarie Jacir, a depiction of the Palestinian uprising against the British Mandate in 1936.
Abbass said that the "the film waited eight months so that it could be shot," with production forced to move to Jordan instead of the occupied West Bank.
Abbass said that the team decided that "at a certain point, we couldn't keep being subject to" the decisions of the Israeli government.
She also welcomed the Academy's decision to include three films highlighting the Palestinian experience in its shortlist for best international feature film: "Palestine 36", Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab" and Cherien Dabis's "All That's Left of You".
Only Kaouther Ben Hania's film ultimately made the final list of five nominees.
But Abbass praised the "open-mindedness" of the Academy to bring these films "almost to the final stages of the Oscars" after what she said Israel's genocide in Gaza.

Increased US military presence in Middle East aims to defend forces: Rubio
Secretary of state emphasizes diplomacy with Iran as Witkoff, Kushner travel for negotiations
ISTANBUL
The US’ increased military presence in the Middle East is intended to defend American forces from potential threats rather than signal an imminent attack on Iran, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday.
"We are postured in the region for one simple reason, and that is that we understand that there could be threats to our forces in the region," Rubio told reporters alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Washington wants to ensure "sufficient capacity to defend them, if, God forbid, that were to happen," he added.
Asked whether the Trump administration would consult and inform Congress before attacking Iran or removing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rubio said US President Donald Trump "prefers diplomacy and an outcome of negotiated settlement."
"We're dealing with people who make political, geopolitical decisions on the basis of pure theology, and it's a complicated thing," Rubio said, adding "No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we're going to try."
The US attacks on Iran last June were carried out without congressional approval or notification of top Democratic leaders in Congress. Some lawmakers objected, saying the attacks took place despite there being no imminent threat to the United States.
Rubio also said special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who have been active in the Middle East, are currently traveling for "important meetings," adding: "We'll see how that turns out."
The secretary of state pledged to "always comply with the applicable laws of the United States in terms of involving Congress" in any decisions, adding: "But right now, we're not talking about any of that. We're talking about negotiations."
"The president made that clear: If that changes, it'll be obvious to everyone, and obviously whatever the law requires us to do, we'll do," Rubio said.
The US has significantly increased its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with reports of plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier amid heightened tensions with Tehran.

Iran’s Araghchi slams European powers for ‘irrelevance’ in nuclear talks
Foreign minister says regional powers have been ‘far more effective’ than the European countries.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has derided the Munich Security Conference as a “circus”, accusing European powers of “paralysis and irrelevance” in efforts to revive nuclear negotiations with the United States.
Iranian officials were not invited to the annual security meeting in the German city, and the top Iranian diplomat made the remarks in a post on X on Sunday, two days before Iranian and US officials are to hold talks in Geneva, Switzerland.

“Sad to see the usually serious Munich Security Conference turned into the ‘Munich Circus’ when it comes to Iran,” Araghchi wrote on X. “The paralysis and irrelevance of the EU/E3 is displayed in the dynamics surrounding the current talks over Iran’s nuclear program. … Once a key interlocutor, Europe is now nowhere to be seen. Instead, our friends in the region [the Gulf] are far more effective and helpful than an empty-handed and peripheral E3.”
The E3 – which included France, the United Kingdom and Germany – were key players in the previous round of nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran. That process culminated in 2015 with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a landmark agreement aimed at limiting the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
The US under the first administration of President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and ramped up sanctions on Iran. Since then, the process has largely stalled. Still, the E3 maintained a role as a go-between with Tehran and Washington.
But since negotiations resumed last year, Gulf countries, such as Oman and Qatar, have taken the lead in facilitating talks between the US and Iran.
Araghchi’s comments “indicate a policy shift from the Iranian side that the E3 mechanism … is no longer a valid channel for resolution”, said Abas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies. “This nuclear mediation has moved from Europe to the region, and now the heavy lifting in diplomacy is done by regional players.”
On Tuesday, Oman is to host talks between the US and Iran in Geneva after previous indirect negotiations in Muscat on February 6. Those talks were attended by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
US and Iranian officials previously held several rounds of talks in the Omani capital to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme last year. But that process was halted as Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined by bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities.
The new rounds of negotiations come as tensions in the region remain high with Trump moving more US military assets to the Middle East. On Friday, Trump said he was sending a second aircraft carrier to the region while openly talking about a change in Iran’s government.
Despite the new push for diplomacy, the two sides have maintained their positions. Iran has shown flexibility in discussing its nuclear programme, but the US wants to widen the talks to include Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support for regional armed groups – two issues that Tehran says are nonnegotiable.

Poll: Around 62% of Czechs want Prague-led ammunition initiative for Ukraine to keep going
Around 62% of Czech citizens support the continuation of a Prague-led initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine.
Source: České noviny, a Czech news outlet, as reported by European Pravda
Details: A poll conducted in January found that 62% of Czechs back the continuation of the Czech-led initiative, while 36% are against it.
Another 3% of respondents were undecided.
Pavel Ranocha, an analyst at Kantar CZ, the Czech branch of the global market research firm Kantar, says almost 100% of opposition party voters back the continuation of the initiative to supply ammunition to Ukraine.
Among supporters of ruling parties, two-thirds of Motorists voters would approve such a decision. Half of ANO supporters and one-fifth of SDP supporters gave the same response.
Background:
- Before taking office as Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš promised to scrap the Czech-led initiative that helps supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition.
- After a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris, Babiš said the initiative on ammunition for Ukraine can continue if it is financed by other states.
- A senior NATO official recently said the Czech-led initiative has found significantly more shells than expected.
