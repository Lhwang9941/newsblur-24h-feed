China woman quits teaching to sell coffins to Europe, generating US$6 million sales annually
29-year-old whose hometown is known for its lightweight wood says she has no business fears because ‘people die every day’
In China, death is traditionally seen as a taboo and often tied to bad luck.
But in Heze, a city in eastern China’s Shandong province, this cultural barrier has given rise to a booming industry.
According to Personage magazine, Lisa Liu, 29, from Heze was once a teacher. Exhausted and hoarse from the pressure of work, Liu switched careers in July 2023.
After a chance interview, she went into coffin sales, focusing on the European market, particularly Italy.
Her boss took her on a tour of the factory, where she saw the entire coffin production process, from log cutting to carving and assembly.
To the workers, a coffin was just a wooden object. Some even used empty urns as storage boxes at home.
This helped Liu overcome her superstitions about coffins being “inauspicious”.
Unlike heavy, dark-coloured Chinese coffins, Italian ones are lighter and often feature religious carvings.

UBS China venture faces wrath of silver investors after valuation change increases losses
More than 200,000 people file complaints as UBS SDIC’s attempted remedy for sudden change of fund’s price benchmark falls flat with some
Thousands of Chinese retail investors spent the last day of the Year of the Snake on Monday filing complaints against UBS SDIC Fund Management for an overnight valuation change that caused steep losses for holders of its silver fund, even after the firm offered remedies.
More than 200,000 people lodged complaints against the operator of the country’s only silver fund after the controversial change on February 2, according to Xiaofei Bao, an online Chinese consumer protection platform.
The switch came amid a silver crash on January 30, when global prices plunged more than 30 per cent from around US$121 per ounce. Shanghai futures contracts, capped by a 17 per cent daily price limit, could not keep pace with the rout on overseas exchanges, expanding the gap between domestic and international prices.
After trading closed on February 2, UBS SDIC, a joint venture between Swiss bank UBS and a unit of state-owned SDIC Group, switched the valuation benchmark for its listed open-ended fund (LOF), called UBS SDIC Silver Futures Fund LOF, from Shanghai Futures Exchange settlement prices to international market prices without prior notice.
The move turned what investors thought would be a loss capped at about 17 per cent into a 31.5 per cent drop.
After setting up a task force on February 6 to mitigate the impact of the revaluation on retail investors, the fund manager unveiled a tiered compensation plan for investors who redeemed on February 2.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Russia is losing between 7,000 and 8,000 soldiers every week in its war against Ukraine, stressing that neither side can claim victory as casualties and destruction continue to mount.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Rubio described the conflict as “a difficult war to say anyone is winning,” pointing to massive Russian losses alongside what he called extraordinary damage to Ukraine, particularly to its energy infrastructure.

“I think that’s a difficult war to say anyone is winning. The Russians are losing 7,000-8,000 soldiers a week. A week. Not wounded, dead,” he said.
Rubio said rebuilding Ukraine would take “billions of dollars,” adding that both countries are suffering severe harm.
“Ukraine has suffered extraordinary damage to its energy infrastructure, and it will take billions of dollars and years and years to rebuild that country. So, I don’t think anyone can claim to be winning it,” he said.
“I think that both sides are suffering tremendous damage, and we’d like to see the war come to an end. It’s a senseless war, in our view,” Rubio added.
He credited Ukrainian forces for their resilience, saying they have fought bravely and received extensive US support.
Rubio also revealed that early American assistance - including anti-tank weapons delivered before Russia’s full-scale invasion - played a critical role in helping Ukraine withstand the initial assault.
After Munich Speech, Rubio Visits Trump’s Allies in Slovakia and Hungary
Notably, UK Defense Secretary John Healey said at the Munich Security Conference that Russia is increasingly relying on foreign fighters as battlefield losses outpace recruitment.
Healey told Bloomberg that Ukraine has inflicted more casualties over the past two months than Moscow has been able to replace, citing briefings from Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
As a result, Russia is turning to recruits from countries including India, Nepal, Cuba, Nigeria and Senegal, as well as roughly 17,000 North Korean troops.
“They are often recruited under false pretenses and press-ganged under pressure without necessarily realizing that they’re destined for the Russian meat machine on the front line of Ukraine,” Healey said.
Fedorov has outlined an ambition to drive Russian losses to 50,000 a month by summer - a level Western officials say could force Russian President Vladimir Putin to consider another unpopular mobilization.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia lost about 30,000 troops in January alone, adding:
“Putin is not concerned about this now, but there is a level at which he’ll start to care.”
Western estimates put Russian casualties - killed and wounded - at more than 1.2 million since the start of the war, with drone operations increasingly driving losses.
Despite this, Russian forces have continued limited advances in eastern Ukraine while intensifying missile and drone strikes on civilian infrastructure.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that even a peace deal would likely accelerate Russia’s rearmament, increasing the threat to Europe.
Ukraine’s top commander, Oleksandr Syrsky, said drones have expanded the active battle zone by up to 20 kilometers.
“This is an important reminder for us all that Ukraine is under huge pressure,” Healey said, adding that on some parts of the front line casualty ratios have risen to as high as 25 Russian losses for every Ukrainian.
“Putin likes to give the impression that they’re making relentless and inevitable progress,” Healey concluded. “But he’s weaker than he’s been and more reliant than he’s been on foreign fighters.”

Hong Kong court orders scandal-hit Christian Zheng Sheng Association to be liquidated
Judge rules in government’s favour after charity failed to repay HK$61 million to public fund in the wake of a fraud scandal in 2024
The association is known for previously operating Christian Zheng Sheng College at Ha Keng on Lantau Island to help teenagers struggling with drug addiction or on probation orders.
Established in 1985, the college for recovering drug addicts ceased operations in July 2024 after police arrested four directors and froze the non-profit association’s assets over the alleged misappropriation of HK$50 million in donations.
Three other wanted directors – principal Alman Chan Siu-cheuk, founder Lam Hay-sing and Chan Yau-chi – have fled the city.
The association replaced all of its directors after the police operation, violating a clause in a 2017 funding agreement for the college’s renovation that required the charity’s leadership to remain unchanged from the time it received financial assistance from the Beat Drugs Fund Association, a non-profit company governed by the Security Bureau.
The fund demanded that the charity repay HK$59.25 million in public money, which amounted to HK$61.4 million, including interest, but the NGO ignored the repeated requests.

China’s Xi prioritises ‘AI-plus’ and consumer spending to counter economic headwinds
Previously unreleased comments by Xi urge income growth and tech breakthroughs, potentially setting stage for measures ahead of March’s parliamentary meetings
President Xi Jinping has deemed the acceleration of consumption and innovation, particularly in artificial intelligence, an essential task as the world’s second-largest economy seeks to overcome challenges in 2026.
The president’s priorities, officially laid out before the year began, were revealed to the public in a speech excerpt published on Monday by the ruling Communist Party’s leading theoretical journal.
Xi emphasised the need to boost domestic demand, giving it the lion’s share of attention as an economic anchor that is central to stability, in line with Beijing’s pivot to unleash domestic dynamism in its economic policymaking.
“We shall grow incomes for urban and rural residents, expand the supply of quality goods and services, eliminate unreasonable restrictions on consumption and tap potential in culture and tourism,” the Qiushi Journal quoted Xi as saying.
He also called for optimising schemes for consumer goods trade-in and equipment upgrades, and he emphasised the immense potential and key advantage of China’s “ultra-large market”.

Average house price dip in February after £10,000 January surge
- The average asking price for a home in Britain experienced a marginal decrease of £12 in February, reaching £368,019, after a significant £10,000 surge in January.
- Despite February's slight dip, the strong start to the year marks the best opening for asking prices since 2020, with a 2.8 per cent increase since December.
- Rightmove attributes this early year growth to renewed confidence following the autumn budget, though sellers are now taking a more cautious approach due to high competition and price sensitivity.
- Market conditions are becoming more favourable for buyers, as average wages have significantly outpaced property price growth over the last three years, complemented by improved mortgage rates and lending options.
- The total value of UK homes is estimated at £9.18 trillion, with the North of England and devolved nations contributing 60 per cent of the growth since 2022, despite accounting for only 27 per cent of the total value.

Charli xcx's 'The Moment', the early drawings of Lucian Freud, and a murder mystery series set during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here's what to look out for this week.
This week's digest has got it all: Beauty, brats and big lemon floats.
Indeed, while February might be a short month, no one could accuse it of being a boring one. New exhibitions explore everything from Renaissance beauty standards to rebellious Welsh artists, while Charli xcx's highly-anticipated mockumentary revives the spirit of Brat summer - then shoves a spear through its slime green superficialities.
Not included below, but also worth keeping on your radar, are a Louise Bourgeois exhibition in Trondheim, and Casa Batlló's ongoing celebrationsin Barcelona to mark the centenary of Antoni Gaudí's death.
Until next time, have fun - and go easy on the lemons.
Exhibitions
Beauty and Ugliness in the Renaissance (Bellezza e Bruttezza)
When: 20 February - 14 June 2026
Where: Bozar (Brussels, Belgium)
In an age of Instagram filters, Brazilian butt lifts and AI actresses, our perceptions of beauty have never been more skewed. But how did we reach this point? Forever shifting depending on cultural and societal values, beauty standards notably gained importance in the 15th and 16th centuries. Brussels' Bozar marks this key shift through artists like Botticelli, Titian, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, whose works reveal the evolving distinctions between beauty and ugliness. A fascinating and timely exhibition that spotlights the malleability of perception, it also allows visitors to see some of the world's greatest masterpieces up close.
Lucian Freud: Drawing into Painting
When: Until 4 May 2026
Where: National Portrait Gallery (London, UK)
A foundational figurative artist of the 20th century, Lucian Freud remains best known for his intimate portraits of friends and family. Spontaneously captured and richly detailed, his textured paintings revealed the raw inner worlds of strangers, a practice he honed from etching hyper-realistic drawings. A rarely-seen collection of these are now on display at London's National Portrait Gallery; dynamically displayed in dialogue with Freud's later works to capture the evolution of his artistic processes.
Bonus highlight: The rebellious, freedom-chasing Welsh artist Gwen John is finally getting the attention she deserves at the National Museum of Cardiff’s ‘Strange Beauties’ exhibit - on until 28 June 2026.
Events
‘Fête du Citron’ (Lemon Festival)
When: Until 1 March 2026
Where: Menton, France
When life gives you a lemon festival, make haste to attend!
In case you weren't aware, the southern French coastal town of Menton is famous for its luminous lemons. It first organised a festival dedicated to them in 1934, hoping to encourage tourism and cement its standing as a leading European producer of the fruit. Since then it's become a cultural tradition - one of many strange but sweet (or in this case, bitter) events across the continent that brings communities together and celebrates local heritage. Expect spectacular floats decked out in oranges and lemons, lots of juice to quench your thirst, and a vibrant atmosphere that's certain to inspire more zest for life.
Space by Luxmuralis
When: 17 - 21 February
Where: St Martin-in-the-Fields (London, UK)
A spectacular celebration of light and sound, this immersive installation at London St Martin-in-the-Fields Church will transport you to galaxies far, far away. Stars, planets and solar systems swirl against their historic setting, detailing a mesmerising journey through time and space. Created by British artist and sculptor Peter Walker, he hoped to create a "modern day stained glass window" that's educational and accessible to everyone.
Movies
The Moment
Where: UK and Ireland cinemas
When: 20 February
Following the release of Wuthering Heights, Brat winter continues with Charli xcx's zeitgeist-capturing mockumentary, The Moment. A snapshot of the star at the height of her fame during 2024's Brat Summer, it's a timely commentary on the ephemeral nature of cultural trends and capitalistic 'enshittification'. As xcx battles narcissistic filmmakers, snarky dermatologists and online backlash, the slime green sheen of her success starts to slip, revealing the precariousness of building a persona that's reliant on remaining relevant.
Bonus highlight: Gore Verbinski's world-saving adventure Good Luck, Have Fun, Don't Die is out at select cinemas from 20 February.
TV series
56 Days
Where: Prime Video
When: 18 February
The COVID-19 pandemic has proven to be an endless source of inspiration for psychological thrillers, but in 56 Days, it's merely a foundation from which a murder mystery arises. Based on Catherine Ryan Howard's novel of the same name, it follows Ciara (Dove Cameron) and Oliver (Avan Jogia), a couple who meet shortly before the first lockdown and hurriedly move in together. Cut to 56 days later and there's a decomposing body in their apartment. What happened? How did it get there? The series cuts between perspectives to pick up the pieces, exposing the dark depths of their relationship along the way.
Bonus highlight: Season 2 of Apple TV+'s thriller series The Last Thing He Told Me, about a woman searching for her missing husband, is available to stream from 20 February.
Music
Moby: Future Quiet
When: 20 February
American musician Moby is back with his 23rd - yes, you read that right - studio album. Instrumental to the electronic music scene, his genre-defying sounds and ambient sampling (especially on 'Play') once defined 90s and early 2000s dancehalls. While this influence has since dwindled, Moby's prolificness - and dedication to trialling new styles - certainly hasn't. Featuring sombre singles like 'Future Quiet' (which was also used in the final series of Stranger Things), the album prioritises gentle instrumentals to create an ethereal-feeling escape from life's loudness.
Bonus highlight: After more than a decade's hiatus, Canadian musician Peaches is releasing her seventh studio album, **'**No Lube So Rude', on 20 Feb.

Between analysis and instinct: why intuition is reappearing in decision-making during prolonged uncertainty

Between analysis and instinct: why intuition is reappearing in decision-making during prolonged uncertainty
Europe and Uncertainty
All throughout Europe and other places in the world, uncertainty is a constant situation. With political changes, economic uproars, migration pressures, and the quick changes in technology, it has made long-term forecasting hard. People rely on data, expert analysis, and scenario planning, but many people acknowledge that the best way to make decisions is something that comes from inside.
Intuition, which is often called inner judgment or instinct, is becoming more popular as a decision-making tool. This doesn't mean that people are rejecting data or expertise, but that they have a growing recognition that data alone cannot always give them the clarity that they need when the conditions are changing faster than the models can accept.
On top of the growth of intuition, people more than ever are seeking psychic guidance, which has also changed. Where once it used to be in a traditional shop or an informal setting, these services are being accessed online, not as a way of prediction but as a reflective tool.
People who are used to weighing the evidence carefully, this allows them to ask why intuition remains and how it's being reinterpreted in this high information society.
Living Life Through Uncertainty
For years in Eastern Europe, uncertainty wasn't just something temporary, but with security concerns, inflation pressures, shifting trade relationships, and political realignments, the environments where these people are have produced a stability that can't be taken for granted. Businesses change their strategies, professionals think of new career paths, while families decide about relocating, investing, and educating.
Forecasting is still important, but people know that it has limitations. Economic indicators can change reality, while political developments can change conditions even as soon as overnight. Even structures that are well thought out can become useless quickly.
Because of this, decision-making often happens when there is not enough information, and this is when confidence matters just as much as accuracy does.
Psychology and Unpredictability
When you're constantly living with uncertainty, it can affect how you process information. When looking at psychology, it shows that when outcomes are unpredictable, people rely more on internal cues such as emotional signals, experience, and instinct.
This doesn't mean that people are irrational, but it means that they're adapting to responses that are complex, where intuition helps to look at action when certainty is not there.
Intuition in Everyday Life
In European societies, intuition has often been used with rational planning. People often talk about feeling that something is wrong or having a strange sense of timing without really being able to put it into language. This idea shows a cultural understanding that not all knowledge can be measured.
History shows us that people have used guided decisions in trade, agriculture, and community leadership, especially in places where external conditions were unstable. Even though things became modern, it didn't eliminate this kind of reliance, but it just changed the way that people see it.
Scientific Reasoning and Data
Education systems show that people rely on scientific reasoning and analytical skills, but intuition can play a role in people's professional and personal lives. Managers, medical professionals, and engineers often talk about times when their instincts guided them to make critical choices, especially when they were under pressure.
By using logic and intuition together, it shows that intuition wasn't replaced by modern systems, but that it helped to complement them.
Recognizing Patterns and Replacing Superstition
Psychology describes intuition as rapid pattern recognition. This is how the brain is able to process subtle cues based on past experiences and contextual awareness, which gives a sense of alignment or a warning before the conscious thought is able to catch up. People often describe intuitive signs as:
- Taking a pause causes them to reflect on the situation more.
- Having calmness in stressful situations.
- Having discomfort when the data is reassuring.
By understanding this, it shows how intuition is used as a cognitive processing tool and not just by belief.
Intuition and Emotions
One concern where there's so much information is separating intuition from emotions. Stress, fear, and biases can change how someone judges something. Using intuition responsibly means that you look at it as a sign and not as a conclusion. People who rely on intuition in a positive way will usually:
- Avoid being impulsive.
- Seek logical information.
- Resist intuitive impressions.
This allows intuition to complement rational thinking and not to replace it.
Signals and Time Pressures
People who make decisions today often face times when data points go in different directions. An economic forecast might conflict with expert opinions. Time constraints can limit further research that's needed.
When this happens, intuition can be used as a reference point to help people know what course of action to take instead of staying where they are.
Having Confidence in Decision Making
Confidence plays an important role when making a decision. Research shows us that people who feel internally aligned with the choices that they make are more likely to follow through with their choices even when they're uncertain.
Intuition allows this alignment by addressing emotional and ethical ideas that data alone cannot solve.
Online Platforms and Traditional Guidance
When people use traditional intuitive guidance, it is from people who were trusted within the community. With the change in the digital world, digital platforms have become accessible beyond location and social boundaries. Online services allow people to get psychic guidance on their own terms and discreetly. This change has happened to bring:
- More privacy.
- Better flexibility in the world.
- More diverse reading style.
For many people, online access has gotten rid of stigma and social pressures.
Changing Ideas
People today use intuitive services with caution. They don't accept authority without questioning it, and they are more likely to use guidance as input and not decision-making.
This shift shows that people are more about critical engagement than unquestioned beliefs.
Reflection Over Predictions
Online psychic services today show how important conversation and interpretation are over future forecasts. Online platforms such as PsychicOz are used by people who are looking for new perspectives when their life feels uncertain and are not looking for guaranteed outcomes. They usually focus their questions on things like:
- Having more confidence.
- Looking at internal conflict.
- Understanding recurring patterns.
This is about reflection and not about instruction.
Emotional Clarity and Outcomes
Societies often discuss doubt openly, but in some situations, this can feel risky. Psychic conversations give a safe place where users can talk about their concerns without having social or professional consequences.
This works great in the rise of counseling, coaching, and other reflective practices that are all there to support clarity instead of decision-making.
Career Uncertainty
People who have to relocate or change their careers often feel torn between the opportunities and the risks. Data can inform with numbers, but intuition can help a person to know if they're ready and if the situation brings alignment.
Intuitive guidance can show if hesitation comes from fear, timing, or more misalignment.
Family and Other Life Decisions
Decisions that families have to make about housing or other long-term commitments can have a strong emotional weight. When this happens, common intuitive guidance can bring reassurance over direction, which helps people to feel grounded before they make a big decision.
Anxiety and Instability
When there are times of instability, it can create anxiety. By getting psychic insight, when used responsibly, it can bring emotional grounding, which allows the person to move forward with more confidence.
Real-Life Examples
Real-life examples of dealing with intuition versus uncertainty:
Job Uncertainty
A professional might consider relocating for work after looking at economic data and employment prospects that seem to favor their life. Even though this seems great, they still remain uneasy. By getting intuitive reflection and guidance, the person sees that the concerns are more about a supportive network than the opportunities.
This leads the person to delay their relocation plans and allows them to address more practical and emotional factors first.
Using Timing to Make Decisions
A business owner might look at launching a new venture when market conditions are high. The financial models show that there's potential, but the timing feels uncertain. By getting intuitive guidance, they're able to look beyond fear, which allows them to approach the idea instead of abandoning it.
In both of these scenarios, the decisions are being supported by intuition with confidence instead of promising certain outcomes.
Having Smart Skepticism
People who are used to evaluating evidence look at psychic insight skeptically. They reject exaggerated claims, and this skepticism has changed the way that they engage with psychic insight instead of getting rid of it completely. Those who are responsible usually:
- Avoid becoming dependent on readings.
- Question the interpretations.
- Use intuition and data together.
This approach helps to reduce risks.
Intuition and Accountability
Intuition doesn't get rid of responsibility, and the decisions should stay grounded with evidence, planning, and consequence management. Intuition just helps to show how choices can be framed and felt, but not to make the decisions themselves.
Boundaries and Ethics
When there are times of crisis, it can make people vulnerable. Having Ethical Intuitive Services shows transparency, avoids fear-based messages, and doesn't use deterministic language. Setting clear bounties protects the users and keeps trust and credibility.
Restraint Equals Trust
Services that point out that uncertainty happens give more trust in those who claim that certainty is there. Restraint shows responsibility, not weakness.
Decision Fatigue and Information Overload
As more and more information comes, so does cognitive load. Intuition helps to give attention to what needs attention when everything appears so urgent. This is all about adaptation.
How Humans Respond to Complex Situations
No matter how much data there is, it doesn't get rid of ambiguity. Intuition lasts because it addresses meaning with confidence when life is uncertain. Intuition changes with technology instead of just disappearing.
Final Thoughts: Intuition in Times of Uncertainty
When there is prolonged uncertainty, intuition can be used to complement data. It gives context where data gives structure, and it gives confidence where forecasts give probability. Psychic guidance that is used thoughtfully shows resilience in inner judgment. It should never replace evidence or expertise, but should help people to look at things with more clarity.
As societies change and there's more unpredictability than ever before, using logic with intuition is important, and it's a human response instead of getting rid of logic.

Teen who campaigned for father detained by ICE dies from cancer
- Ofelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, a 16-year-old Chicago teenager, has died from stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive form of cancer.
- Her death occurred just three days after an immigration judge ruled that her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was conditionally entitled to a “cancellation of removal”.
- Ofelia had actively campaigned for her father's release from immigration detention, where he was held following a crackdown dubbed Operation Midway Blitz.
- The judge's decision acknowledged the severe hardship Mr Torres Maldonado's deportation would inflict on his US-born children, paving the way for him to become a lawful permanent resident.
- Mr Torres Maldonado's attorney praised Ofelia as “heroic and brave” for her efforts in fighting for her father's right to remain in the US.

Japan avoids recession with weak return to growth – business live

Competition among UK house sellers at 11-year high
Competition among UK house sellers is running at an eleven-year high, giving buyers more opportunities and keeping prices pegged this month.
Property portal Rightmove is reporting this morning that the average asking price for a newly listed homes dipped by just £12 this month, to £368,019.
And with more houses on the marker – after a record number of early-bird new sellers coming to market sinceBoxing Day and in January – potential buyers have plenty of choice.
Rightmove says the high number of homes for sale is continuing to benefit buyers, giving them more choice and more power to negotiate.
And with last November’s budget behind us, net confidence among buyers and sellers in January has risen back to its highest level since September 2025, Rightmove reports.
Should the Bank of England cut interest rates at its next meeting, in March, that could give borrowers another lift, as the peak spring selling season approaches.
According to Rightmove, the average asking price is the same as a year ago, after that £12 shuffle lower.
That’s despite a record asking price increase for the time of year in January, which means prices are up by 2.8% since December
As the market is “still very price-sensitive,” sellers need to pitch their properties realistically, says Colleen Babcock, property expert at Rightmove:
“Virtually flat prices in February really needs to be viewed alongside what happened in January.
After the prolonged uncertainty in the run up to the late November Budget, plus the usual Christmas slowdown, we saw activity pick up again from Boxing Day. Many sellers, some of whom had been holding back because of the Budget, came to market in early 2026 with renewed confidence, which helped to drive that bumper January price rise.
But the market fundamentals haven’t changed. There are still lots of homes for sale, and buying activity isn’t as strong as this time last year, when many buyers were rushing to move before the stamp duty increase in England. So in February, sellers have taken a more cautious approach by holding onto January’s gains rather than pushing prices higher, at a time when competition is high and the market is still very price-sensitive.”
Introduction: Japan avoids recession with weak return to growth
Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy.
Japan has escaped falling into recession, just, with a weak return to growth that highlights the need for punchy measures from its new government to spur the economy on.
Japanese GDP expanded by just 0.1% in October-December, fresh data from Japan’s Cabinet Office shows, missing forecasts of 0.4% growth.
That follows a contraction of 0.7% in July-September, and means Japan has avoided a technical recession – two negative quarters of growth in a row.
Private consumption drove the expansion, while exports and public spending were weak.
Shinichiro Kobayashi, chief economist at MitsubishiUFJResearchandConsulting, explained:
“Personal consumption showed resilience, but whether this resilience can be sustained will depend on whether price relief measures will make an impact and whether real wages will turn positive.”
Japan’s economy has been hurt by Donald Trump’s trade war, which increased tariffs on Japanese goods entering the US.
The diplomatic row between Beijing and Tokyo over the security of Taiwan also weighed on the economy, with Chinese tourism to Japan almost halving.
The data comes just a week after prime minister SanaeTakaichi won a landslide election victory, having promised “responsible and proactive fiscal policies”.
Takaichi was due to meet with Bank of Japan governor KazuoUeda, in their first bilateral meeting since the election.
Last November, Takaichi unveiled a massive ¥21.3tn (£100bn) stimulus package in an effort to spur economic growth and protect households from the rising cost of living. Further measures may be needed….

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has confirmed that charges have been brought against former Energy and Justice Minister German Galushchenko in the case involving businessman Timur Mindich.
"NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) have expanded the list of suspects in the Midas case. The former energy minister (2021-2025) has been charged with money laundering and involvement in a criminal organization," the agency said on its Telegram channel. Although the suspect’s name was not disclosed, Galushchenko held the post during the mentioned period. NABU specified that the charges were filed under articles on participation in a criminal organization and on laundering particularly large amounts of income obtained by criminal means.
On February 15, NABU reported that the former minister had been detained while attempting to leave the country.
According to the publication Ukrainska Pravda, Galushchenko was removed from a train at night. Verkhovna Rada lawmaker Alexey Goncharenko, who is on Russia’s list of terrorists and extremists, later said that Galushchenko had been formally charged. Previously, he had been a witness in the case.

BISHKEK, February 16. /TASS/. There are no grounds for a coup in Kyrgyzstan, President Sadyr Japarov said in Bishkek in an interview with the Kabar state news agency.
"There will be no uprising or anything of the sort. First, the law does not allow it, and second, no such situation exists," he said.
On February 10, the Kyrgyz president dismissed his longtime close ally Kamchybek Tashiev from his post as deputy Cabinet chairman and head of the State Committee for National Security. Following the move, the speaker of Kyrgyzstan's Parliament resigned, and several ministers were also relieved of their duties.

ByteDance pledges fixes to Seedance 2.0 after Hollywood copyright claims
Hollywood groups say the AI video tool uses the likeness of actors and others without permission.
China’s ByteDance has pledged to address concerns over its new artificial intelligence video generator, after Hollywood groups claimed Seedance 2.0 “blatantly” violates copyright and uses the likenesses of actors and others without permission.
The company, which owns TikTok, told The Associated Press news agency on Sunday that it respects intellectual property rights and pledged action to strengthen safeguards.

The tool, called Seedance 2.0, is available only in China for now and lets users generate high-quality AI videos using simple text prompts.
The Motion Picture Association (MPA) said last week that Seedance 2.0 “has engaged in unauthorized use of US copyrighted works on a massive scale”.
“By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,” Charles Rivkin, chairman and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement on February 10.
Screenwriter Rhett Reese, who wrote the Deadpool movies, said on X last week, “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.”
His post was in response to Irish director Ruairi Robinson’s post of a Seedance 2.0 video that went viral and shows AI versions of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
Actors union SAG-AFTRA said on Friday it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement” enabled by Seedance 2.0.
“The infringement includes the unauthorized use of our members’ voices and likenesses. This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement.
“Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here.”
ByteDance said in response that it has heard the concerns regarding Seedance 2.0.
“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” it told the AP.
Jonathan Handel, an entertainment journalist and lawyer, told Al Jazeera the developments mark “the beginning of a difficult road” for the film industry.
Until courts make a significant ruling, AI-generated videos will have major implications on the film industry,” he said.
“Digital technology moves a lot quicker, and we are going to see in several years full-length movies that are AI-generated,” he said.
These tools are trained primarily on unlicensed data, Handel said, and the output could resemble faces and scenes from famous movies, “and so you’ve got copyrights, trademarks, all of those rights are implicated here”.

Medical evacuations stall as Rafah limits deepen Gaza’s health crisis

More than 20,000 sick and wounded Palestinians in Gaza are waiting for permission to travel abroad for medical care as Israel maintains tight controls over the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday.
In a statement, the ministry said it is monitoring the limited operation of the crossing as health conditions across Gaza continue to deteriorate.
Israel reopened the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing on Feb. 2 after occupying it in May 2024, but movement remains heavily restricted.
According to the ministry, more than 20,000 patients are registered on travel lists, including people with advanced cancer, severe heart disease and kidney failure, many of whom require urgent specialized treatment unavailable in Gaza.
Many of the injured also need advanced surgical procedures that cannot be performed in Gaza because of the blockade and repeated strikes on the health care system, the ministry said.
Although Israel announced the reopening of the crossing, the number of people allowed to travel remains limited and disproportionate to the scale of the health crisis, it said.
The ministry said it has received “harrowing testimony” from patients who managed to leave for treatment abroad, describing restrictive measures and what it called unjustified complications imposed by Israel that compounded their psychological and physical suffering.
On Feb. 5, the U.N. Human Rights Office in the occupied Palestinian territory said returnees reported that after crossing, armed Palestinian men supported by the Israeli military took them to an Israeli military checkpoint, where some were handcuffed, blindfolded, searched, threatened and had their belongings confiscated.
In response, two Israeli human rights organizations, Adalah and Gisha, called for an end to what they described as “a policy of abuse and unlawful restrictions” imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return through Rafah. They said the measures amount to “forced displacement.”
Gaza’s Health Ministry warned that maintaining restrictions at Rafah, limiting the number of travelers and slowing medical evacuations threaten the lives of thousands of patients and deepen the humanitarian crisis.
It urged that the crossing be opened permanently to allow patients and wounded people to travel without restrictions or delays.
The ministry also called for the urgent evacuation of critical cases and an increase in the number of travelers in line with accumulated medical needs, urging international and humanitarian organizations to intervene to guarantee patients’ right to treatment and travel under international law.
Palestinian officials say about 80,000 people have registered to return to Gaza, underscoring what they describe as a widespread refusal of displacement despite the destruction.
Before the war, hundreds of Palestinians crossed Rafah daily in both directions under a system managed by Gaza’s Interior Ministry and Egyptian authorities, without direct Israeli involvement.
Under the first phase of a cease-fire agreement, Israel was to fully reopen the crossing when the truce took effect Oct. 10, but it has not done so.
The cease-fire halted nearly two years of war that began Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 and caused widespread destruction affecting about 90% of civilian infrastructure. The United Nations estimates reconstruction costs at roughly $70 billion.
At least 601 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,600 injured in Israeli attacks since the cease-fire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Supermarket giant Coles planned to deceive customers with ‘utterly misleading’ discounts, court hears
Regulator claims Down Down promotions created ‘illusory’ discounts
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Australia’s consumer watchdog has accused supermarket giant Coles of running an “utterly misleading” pricing campaign, as a landmark Federal Court case gets underway in Melbourne.
Coles is accused of creating false discounts under its “Down Down” campaign – between February 2022 and May 2023 – by briefly raising prices on hundreds of staples such as toothpaste, soft drinks, cheese and pet food before reducing them and advertising the new price as a special deal.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) argued that this created “illusory” discounts and boosted sales without offering genuine discounts. Around 245 products are said to be involved.
Coles has denied wrongdoing, saying that the products in question were subject to “natural” price fluctuations and that ordinary customers were fully aware of the market forces at play.
According to ACCC head counsel Garry Rich SC, the “Down Down” sale was extremely lucrative for Coles. “Substantially more revenue is generated on promotion than not,” he said. “Material sales revenue are higher when the product is on promotion [and] Coles’s gross profit is projected to improve when the product is sold on the ‘Down Down’ price.”
Mr Rich alleged that Coles had repeatedly deceived their customers and that the pricing was not “fair dinkum”.
“Why on earth are you telling your customers the price is going down? They’re not,” he said.
Justice Michael O’Bryan heard the ACCC’s opening remarks on Monday on the first of a 10-day Federal Court hearing in Melbourne.
Mr Rich presented examples to the court that included Coles’ pricing of 1.2kg cans of Nature’s Gift Wet Dog food. Mr Rich told the court that for almost 300 days between April 2022 and February 2023, Coles sold a 1.2kg can of Nature’s Gift Wet Dog food for A$4.
The price then increased by 50 per cent to A$6 for seven days.
On the eighth day, it was reduced to A$4.50 – still 13 per cent higher than what customers had paid for all but seven of the previous 303 days – and was promoted by Coles under its “Down, Down” campaign.
Mr Rich said that while that statement was “literally true” it was also “utterly misleading”.
“It did not disclose that a reasonable consumer would not have understood that Coles had increased the price to $6 for just 7 days, immediately before the promotion, and that for 296 days before that, the price was $4,” he said.
“By making the statement it did, without disclosing those crucial qualifying facts, Coles led reasonable consumers into error.
“It caused them to assume that the ‘Down, Down’ price of $4.50 was a genuine reduction to, or discount from, the previous regular price of the product. That assumption was wrong.
“A reasonable consumer who knew the real facts would not think the price of the dog food has gone down, nor would they think that a price of $4.50 would be a genuine reduction or discount.”
John Sheahan KC, representing Coles, rejected the ACCC’s allegations that Coles ran a planned campaign to mislead consumers. “Grocery shoppers at Coles are much more attuned to these things than anyone around these tables are likely to be,” Mr Sheahan said.
He said the court should take into account that “ordinary, reasonable consumers know they’re in an inflationary environment”.
“They know that that means the price of things is changing in an upward direction,” he said.
“So when our learned friends says … Coles said prices were going down, in fact they were going up – it completely distorts the perspective with respect of an ordinary, reasonable consumer.
“In that context, what Coles is doing is perfectly natural.”
Consumer rights groups in Australia have welcomed the Federal Court action. “During a cost-of-living crisis, retailers should be doing all they can to ensure clear, transparent pricing – not obscuring rising prices with confusing promotions,” director of campaigns and communications at consumer group Choice, Andy Kelly, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
“This court case is not only a wake up call for Coles, but for other retailers who may be engaging in similar practices.”

Families of Japanese abductees conditionally soften stance on North Korea, urge victims' return
Families call on Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's administration to accelerate negotiations with North Korea to return victims
ISTANBUL
Families of Japanese nationals abducted by North Korea have agreed to ease their previously uncompromising position toward the authoritarian regime, provided that the Japanese government succeeds in bringing every victim back to Japan, Jiji Press reported on Monday.
At a joint gathering in Tokyo on Sunday, organizations representing the relatives of those abducted, along with their supporters, approved a policy of not opposing Japan’s provision of humanitarian assistance to North Korea, the removal of its unilateral sanctions, or the initiation of diplomatic normalization talks with Pyongyang, as part of efforts to secure the complete return of the victims.
The Association of Families of Victims Kidnapped by North Korea and the National Association for the Rescue of Japanese Kidnapped by North Korea also resolved that they would no longer request information from returned abductees beyond updates concerning other victims.
Calling on the administration of Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to accelerate negotiations with Pyongyang, Takuya Yokota—the 57-year-old younger brother of Megumi Yokota, who was abducted by North Korean agents in 1977 at age 13—said at a press conference that the groups had made a "painful decision."
"Although our grudge toward North Korea is ever-growing, we've concluded that a dialogue phase already started several years ago," said the head of the families’ organization. "I hope a dream I saw last night about my sister returning home comes true."
Japan officially lists 17 people as "abducted" in the 1970s and 1980s by North Korea.
Five were repatriated in Oct. 2002 following landmark talks in Pyongyang between late North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
But no major progress has since been reported.
Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic ties, and Pyongyang has said the abduction issue has been solved.

Iran’s Araghchi arrives in Geneva for second round of nuclear talks with US
Iran’s top diplomat says he will meet with IAEA director before the high-stakes talks with US are held on Tuesday.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has arrived in Geneva for high-stakes second round of nuclear talks with the United States aimed at reducing tensions and avert a new military confrontation that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned could turn into a regional conflict.
“I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal,” Araghchi wrote on X on Monday. “What is not on the table: submission before threats.”

Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear programme as US deploys warships, including a second aircraft carrier, to the region as mediators work to prevent a war.
Araghchi said he will be joined by Iranian nuclear experts for a “deep technical discussion” later on Monday with Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
The United Nations nuclear watchdog has been calling for access to Iran’s main nuclear facilities that were bombed by the US and Israel during the 12-day war in June. Tehran has said there might be a risk of radiation, so an official protocol is required to carry out the unprecedented task of inspecting highly enriched uranium ostensibly buried under the rubble.
Araghchi also said he would meet his Omani counterpart, Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi, who mediated the first round of talks between Iran and the US since the war earlier this month.
Iran has repeatedly emphasised that it will not agree to Washington’s demand for zero nuclear enrichment, and considers its missile programme a “red line” that cannot be negotiated.
Meanwhile, the US continues to build up its military presence in the region, with President Donald Trump saying a change of power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen” and sending in a second aircraft carrier.
Trump is again likely to send his special envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner to represent the White House in the Geneva talks.
The talks also come over a month after Iran’s deadly crackdown against nationwide protests, with Iranian officials claiming “terrorists” and “rioters” armed and funded by the US and Israel were behind the unrest.
The UN and international human rights organisations have blamed Iranian authorities for the widespread use of lethal force against peaceful protesters, which killed thousands, mainly on the nights of January 8 and 9.
In the other diplomatic track pursued in Switzerland on Tuesday, officials will be discussing ways of ending the Ukraine war, which is approaching the end of its fourth year after Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.
But no immediate breakthrough appears in sight, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy telling the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday that Kyiv has “too often” been asked to make concessions.

Iran's Araghchi in Geneva as Iran-US talks enter second round

Iran's foreign minister has arrived in Geneva ahead of a second round of negotiations with the United States, Iranian state television reported on Monday, as Washington keeps up pressure on Tehran.
According to Tehran, "indirect" Iran–US nuclear talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday, although Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including Iran's ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies.
Tehran and Washington restarted negotiations this month after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched a bombing campaign against Iran last June.
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fate of Iran's stockpile of more than 400 kilogrammes of 60-percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors in June.
"The foreign minister has arrived in Geneva at the head of a diplomatic and expert delegation to take part in the second round of nuclear negotiation," Iran's state-run IRIB wrote on its Telegram channel.
During his visit to Geneva, Abbas Araghchi is expected to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials, Iran's foreign ministry said.
Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
Iran may consider compromise
The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country's nuclear programme.
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.
Iran's deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the country's economy.
"If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran's ability to enrich more.
"There should be no enrichment capability... dismantle the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said during a speech.
'Viable' deal
On February 6, Araghchi led the Iranian delegation in indirect talks with Witkoff and Kushner in Muscat.
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
It has represented US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
Iranian deputy foreign minister for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said Tehran was seeking a deal with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, particularly in sectors such as aviation, mining and oil and gas, the Fars news agency reported.
"For the agreement to be viable, it is essential that the United States also be able to benefit from it in areas with strong and rapid economic return potential," he was quoted as saying.

Motorcycle bomb at police station kills at least 2 and wounds several in northwestern Pakistan
Authorities say a bomb attached to a motorcycle has exploded near the gate of a police station in northwestern Pakistan, killing at least two people, including a child, and wounding several others
- Bookmark
Explosives rigged to a motorcycle went off near the gate of a police station in northwestern Pakistan on Monday, killing at least two people, including a child, and wounding several others, police and rescue officials said. The blast also damaged nearby shops.
The attack took place in Bannu, a district in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, local police official Fida Mohammad said.
He did not provide any further details and only said the dead and wounded had been taken to a nearby hospital. Though no group immediately claimed responsibility, suspicion was likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP.
Pakistan has seen a surge in violence in recent years, with the government frequently blaming the outlawed TTP. The group is separate from but closely allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban who returned to power in 2021. The increase in attacks has strained relations between Islamabad and Kabul, as Pakistan accuses the TTP of operating freely inside Afghanistan, a charge both the TTP and Kabul deny.

Iran's foreign minister says he will meet IAEA director on Monday

DUBAI, Feb 16 - Iran's foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said he will meet with the director of the UN nuclear watchdog on Monday, the day before a second round of U.S.-Iran nuclear talks in Geneva.
Iran and the U.S. renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation as U.S. warships, including a second aircraft carrier, are deploying to the region.
"I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. What is not on the table: submission before threats," Araqchi said on X.
While Washington has sought to expand the scope of talks to non-nuclear issues like Iran's missile stockpile, Tehran says it is only willing to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief and won't accept zero uranium enrichment.
Prior to the U.S. joining Israel in striking Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran-U.S. nuclear talks had stalled over Washington's demand that Tehran forgoes enrichment on its soil, which the U.S. views as a pathway to an Iranian nuclear weapon.
Iran says its nuclear programme is solely for civilian purposes and is ready to assuage concerns regarding nuclear weapons by "building trust that enrichment is and will stay for peaceful purposes."
Araqchi said he will meet International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) head Rafael Grossi on Monday accompanied by nuclear experts "for deep technical discussions."
The IAEA has been calling on Iran for months to say what happened to its stockpile of 440 kg of highly enriched uranium following Israeli-U.S. strikes and let inspections fully resume, including in three key sites that were bombed in June: Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.
While Iran allowed the UN nuclear watchdog to inspect declared nuclear facilities that were not targeted last June, it says that the IAEA must clarify its stance regarding U.S. and Israeli strikes and adds that the bombed sites are unsafe for inspections.
The IAEA and Iran announced an agreement in September in Cairo that was supposed to pave the way towards full inspections and verification, but Tehran scrapped the agreement after Western powers reinstated UN sanctions on Iran. REUTERS

Monday's papers: Pensions blow, losing investments, and winter wonder

Private pension policies were particularly popular in Finland in the 1990s as a supplement to statutory pensions. At their peak, some 700,000 Finns held such policies, according to Finance Finland.
A series of legislative changes since the early 2000s has gradually eroded the appeal of voluntary pension insurance, reports Hufvudstadsbladet. Today, that number has fallen to around 400,000.
The reason is a series of legal changes over the past two decades that have gradually made the financial product less attractive. From the start of 2027, it will become even less appealing. Until now, policyholders have been able to deduct annual contributions of up to 5,000 euros.
The financial services lobby warns that the planned removal of tax incentives next year may prove to be the final blow.
Hindsight 20/20
Just a few years ago, Finnish newspapers were full of upbeat stories about enthusiastic property investors, says Helsingin Sanomat.
Today, things are different. HS asked readers to share their experiences of buying an investment property.
One respondent was 36-year-old Pekka Astala, who lives in Vantaa's Tikkurila district. In 2018, he bought a two-room apartment there for 187,000 euros. He now estimates its value has fallen to around 160,000 euros.
Eight years later, he says he considers the apartment a poor investment for small-scale investors like him, since it is not easily converted into cash.
Had he had a crystal ball, Astala says he would have sold the apartment in 2022, when the housing market was still in better shape.
Yle News' All Points North podcast asked if it's time to rent or buy after years of falling housing prices in Finland.
Wintry week ahead
The coming week looks good for getting outdoors, reports Maaseudun Tulevaisuus, citing the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI).
Temperatures across the country will stay below zero, from a few degrees below freezing in the southwest to around -15 degrees Celsius in Lapland. It may feel colder at times because of the wind.
There should be some sunshine here and there each day, although it will be fairly cloudy overall. Light snowfall is expected in many places, but nothing too heavy.

Google puts users at risk by downplaying health disclaimers under AI Overviews
Unknown

Google is putting people at risk of harm by downplaying safety warnings that its AI-generated medical advice may be wrong.
When answering queries about sensitive topics such as health, the company says its AI Overviews, which appear above search results, prompt users to seek professional help, rather than relying solely on its summaries. “AI Overviews will inform people when it’s important to seek out expert advice or to verify the information presented,” Google has said.
But the Guardian found the company does not include any such disclaimers when users are first presented with medical advice.
Google only issues a warning if users choose to request additional health information and click on a button called “Show more”. Even then, safety labels only appear below all of the extra medical advice assembled using generative AI, and in a smaller, lighter font.
“This is for informational purposes only,” the disclaimer tells users who click through for further details after seeing the initial summary, and navigate their way to the very end of the AI Overview. “For medical advice or a diagnosis, consult a professional. AI responses may include mistakes.”
Google did not deny its disclaimers fail to appear when users are first served medical advice, or that they appear below AI Overviews and in a smaller, lighter font. AI Overviews “encourage people to seek professional medical advice”, and frequently mention seeking medical attention within the summary itself “when appropriate”, a spokesperson said.
AI experts and patient advocates presented with the Guardian’s findings said they were concerned. Disclaimers serve a vital purpose, they said, and should appear prominently when users are first provided with medical advice.
“The absence of disclaimers when users are initially served medical information creates several critical dangers,” said Pat Pataranutaporn, an assistant professor, technologist and researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and a world-renowned expert in AI and human-computer interaction.
“First, even the most advanced AI models today still hallucinate misinformation or exhibit sycophantic behaviour, prioritising user satisfaction over accuracy. In healthcare contexts, this can be genuinely dangerous.
“Second, the issue isn’t just about AI limitations – it’s about the human side of the equation. Users may not provide all necessary context or may ask the wrong questions by misobserving their symptoms.
“Disclaimers serve as a crucial intervention point. They disrupt this automatic trust and prompt users to engage more critically with the information they receive.”
Gina Neff, a professor of responsible AI at Queen Mary University of London, said the “problem with bad AI Overviews is by design” and Google was to blame. “AI Overviews are designed for speed, not accuracy, and that leads to mistakes in health information, which can be dangerous.”
In January, a Guardian investigation revealed people were being put at risk of harm by false and misleading health information in Google AI Overviews.
Neff said the investigation’s findings showed why prominent disclaimers were essential. “Google makes people click through before they find any disclaimer,” she said. “People reading quickly may think the information they get from AI Overviews is better than what it is, but we know it can make serious mistakes.”
Following the Guardian’s reporting, Google removed AI Overviews for some but not all medical searches.
Sonali Sharma, a researcher at Stanford University’s centre for AI in medicine and imaging (AIMI), said: “The major issue is that these Google AI Overviews appear at the very top of the search page and often provide what feels like a complete answer to a user’s question at a time where they are trying to access information and get an answer as quickly as possible.
“For many people, because that single summary is there immediately, it basically creates a sense of reassurance that discourages further searching, or scrolling through the full summary and clicking ‘Show more’ where a disclaimer might appear.
“What I think can lead to real-world harm is the fact that the AI Overviews can often contain partially correct and partially incorrect information, and it becomes very difficult to tell what is accurate or not, unless you are familiar with the subject matter already.”
A Google spokesperson said: “It’s inaccurate to suggest that AI Overviews don’t encourage people to seek professional medical advice. In addition to a clear disclaimer, AI Overviews frequently mention seeking medical attention directly within the overview itself, when appropriate.”
Tom Bishop, head of patient information at Anthony Nolan, a blood cancer charity, called for urgent action. “We know misinformation is a real problem, but when it comes to health misinformation, it’s potentially really dangerous,” said Bishop.
“That disclaimer needs to be much more prominent, just to make people step back and think … ‘Is this something I need to check with my medical team rather than acting upon it? Can I take this at face value or do I really need to look into it in more detail and see how this information relates to my own specific medical situation?’ Because that’s the key here.”
He added: “I’d like this disclaimer to be right at the top. I’d like it to be the first thing you see. And ideally it would be the same size font as everything else you’re seeing there, not something that’s small and easy to miss.”

The neoliberals are showing that they are not up to this vital task
Angus Taylor and the Libs have learnt nothing from the past and have no plan for the future (“The cards are not in Taylor’s favour”, February 16). When they speak of cutting government spending and “waste”, they really mean austerity. How has that worked out in the past 50 years for those on low incomes, pensions and disability? The neoliberal experiment with “small government” has been a disaster for many in our society. It has been proven that “the market” cannot provide adequately for those in society who are struggling. Only government is capable of providing those support structures and services, and for that to be done we need revenue from a balanced taxation and income streams that are fairly derived from all sectors of the economy. Successive governments have been bullied by big business and multinational corporations into ignoring this need for tax equity. It is this part of the budget equation that needs to be addressed, and no amount of posturing by the leader of the opposition on spending will provide a solution. Tony Heathwood, Kiama Downs
Sean Kelly outlines the three key elements present in a leader capable of making the transition from elected opposition leader to a leader ready to govern: timing or luck, charisma and restraint. If we examine Taylor’s approach to taking over the leader’s role, it was clumsy and lacked timing. In his opening comments, Taylor spoke about standards of living and protecting our way of life, but there was no sign that he had answers. The concern with Taylor’s other approach comes when we look at the focus on the national flag, migrants and reports that privately he wants to limit the use of Welcome to Country. Dog whistling didn’t work for Peter Dutton, and it won’t work for Taylor. In opening remarks as leader, Taylor outlined two choices for the Coalition: change or death. So far, he was right about that. Time will tell if he is up for change. As disunity is death, a potential prime minister must unify the country, not divide it. Geoff Nilon, Mascot
Will the Liberal Party confine Angus Taylor to nine months to get the party competitive again? Elvis Kipman, Killara
Based on what I have read, I’ve yet to see the new Coalition “dream team” express any meaningful thoughts on climate action/renewable energy/energy policy. This whole issue has rated in the top tier of problems to solve for nearly two decades now, and is scientifically confirmed as essential for current and future living standards. Given the soaring cost of insurance, you can include that in “cost of living”. The new “change or die” advocates seem to be exhorting us to “look over there” towards immigration, cost of living and good old Australian values, and hoping a rather large elephant remains in the corner, unnoticed. Brian Jones, Leura
The growing number of climate-focused independent MPs reflects a clear shift in public expectations. Many voters feel the major parties have not yet shown the level of climate leadership required to meet the scale of the challenge. Independents have gained support by offering credible, science-driven commitments where voters perceive a gap. Unless the main parties show genuine intent to strengthen their climate policies, Australians will continue turning to independents who treat the issue with the seriousness that it demands. Ian Falconer, Turramurra
Three elements help to determine whether an opposition leader will succeed: luck, charisma, and whether the opposition leader demonstrates restraint and controls their party to prove they are ready to govern. There is a fourth one, which is most important but found to be wanting in the Coalition: to have strong policies, explained to voters well in advance, so that voters can digest them. A fifth one is hard work: to be out every day with voters rather than polarise voters with culture wars. It is the hardest job in politics, but the leader needs to have resilience, patience and tenacity, and I doubt Angus Taylor has all five to succeed. Mukul Desai, Hunters Hill
Have a close look at Angus Taylor, standing in front of the Australian flag, speaking for the first time as leader of the opposition, his deputy clothed in colours matching the flag. Not an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Island flag in sight. Compare that with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who stood in front of all three flags when he won the election. It says a lot. Janice Hull, Katoomba
How long will it take for the Liberal Party to have more ex-leaders than seats in the parliament? Dennis Fitzgerald, Box Hill (Vic)
Show us the CGT money
Brittany Busch reports (“Taylor calls on PM to work together on spending cuts”, February 16) that the Coalition’s new leadership will seek to “win back a reputation as the party of lower taxes and better economic management”. I support such an ambition provided the lower taxes are directed at those in, say, the bottom 50 per cent of wage earners and those on pensions and other forms of government support. And to pay for such tax cuts (or increased financial support), I would expect a government led by Angus Taylor to ensure the top, say, 20 per cent of earners, and especially those owning million-dollar property portfolios thanks to government-funded negative gearing, have their taxes raised to cover the revenue shortfall. Martyn Yeomans, Sapphire Beach
In his first policy announcement after being elected as leader of the opposition, Angus Taylor showed himself firmly committed to ongoing taxation subsidies to property investors, ignoring the urgent need to assist younger generations into secure housing that won’t break the bank. Taylor’s insistence that subsidies to property investors are the key to resolving the housing crisis flies in the face of 25 years of market failure. Truly, terribly, there is nothing new in the Coalition zoo. Colin Hesse, Nowra
I hope Albo, Jim Chalmers and company run with the touted capital gains tax reform. It’s a line in the sand, and Angus Taylor has already had his hissy fit about it. Screw your courage to the sticking place, Albo, for the good of all Australians, not the privileged few. Barry Ffrench, Cronulla
The companies we keep
Company income is taxed twice in many countries, including the US (“Higher GST, lower income tax urged to lift economy”, February 16). Our 30 per cent company tax rate plus dividend imputation is highly regarded. The narrow base of the GST should be broadened before the rate is raised. The wealthy benefit most from exemptions. The capital gains tax concessions recognise gains and losses are often made over many years. Amending up to 40 years of previous tax returns is too hard. Taxing unrealised income has the same problem. Hyundai and Tesla humanoid robots will start replacing workers in two years’ time. The tax on human worker payrolls should be replaced by a general increase in income tax and GST. Peter Egan, Adelaide (SA)
Here we go again. Another organisation (the IMF) with “tax the poor, give relief to the rich”. If the level of company taxation influenced productivity, the companies paying no tax should be flying. The fact is that, because of mergers, large companies have more income than small countries. They need to pay more tax, not less. Indeed, we should introduce a receipts tax to stamp out tax evasion. Furthermore, the rich who use trusts and other vehicles to avoid paying a fair share of tax need to be stopped. The GST is an unfair (regressive) tax. Whether rich or poor, both pay 10 per cent extra. Those on high incomes love this; much better than paying 40 per cent on income. Barry O’Connell, Old Toongabbie
Libs ignore teals at their peril
George Brandis, like all other Liberal politicians (“Liberals must tackle Hanson head on”, February 16), focuses on Pauline Hanson and One Nation, when the biggest problem is the fact that Liberals are continuing to lose seats to the teals. Not only do the teals recognise climate change for what it is, but if you happen to watch a parliament question time you would find these independents ask far better probing questions of the government than the Coalition, who continually ask the same boring question to try to make a political point.Ken Pares, Forster
In invoking much-loved senator Ron Boswell, George Brandis suggests that a conservative conversation about immigration without trying to be “One Nation lite” or dog whistling to racists requires courage, subtlety and good faith. He’s met Angus Taylor, though, right? Colin Stokes, Camperdown
It’s not often that I agree with George Brandis. But in this case, I think he’s right. Moving away from the centre and adopting One Nation policies is folly for the Liberal Party. David Rush, Lawson
I agree with George Brandis. One Nation is a danger to our democratic way of life, but it is entitled to stand for election, as that is what being part of a democracy is all about. May God help us all.Pasquale Vartuli, Wahroonga
Address gender balance
Your correspondent (Letters, February 16) is being glib and only looking at part of the Liberals’ female problem. We need more female MPs to reflect the gender balance of our society. More importantly, the policies and actions of a party have to be responsive to the concerns of women in the electorate. Tim Coen, Ashfield
Of course we see Liberal women out front. The party pushes the very few they have to the fore, hoping that no one will notice the glaring vacuum within. A cursory glance of the government numbers came up with 16 female ministers, many in the Cabinet. Elisabeth Goodsall, Wahroonga
Your correspondent asks how the Liberals are perceived to have a “women problem” when they have a raft of women in leadership positions in three states, the NT, and the deputy leadership in the federal opposition. The key part of the Liberals’ women problem is, despite all that, the majority of women won’t vote for them. What’s more, a lot of those non-Liberal voting women are relatively young, with many elections ahead of them. Daniel Flesch, Bellingen
Your correspondent misunderstands the term “woman problem” – it refers to the collapse of the Liberal female vote, not the number in senior positions, whom women can rightly see have just been sent in to clean up men’s mess again. Andrew Taubman, Queens Park
How many women have led the federal government when the Liberals were in power? Zero. How many women were appointed governor-general when the Liberals were in power? Zero. In contrast, the Labor Party had Julia Gillard as a prime minister and Quentin Bryce and Sam Mostyn as governors-general. Reg Richardson, Mosman
Boomers budget better
The lack of financial education by parents and at school has evolved for some in today’s society having little understanding of money matters in relation to the lifestyle they endeavour to desire (Letters, February 16). It is not just a lack of budgeting skills but also the constant advertising espousing the “must have” instant gratification types of purchases on ‘no deposit, buy now, pay later’ schemes. The stress associated with ever-increasing debt needs much more attention. For instance, financing a motor car purchase at one time required a 30 per cent deposit, this was reduced over time to the current no deposit consumer lease, and the impact of having a “balloon” at the end of the contract is understood by very few. The power of advertising at particular times of the year such as Black Friday, pre-Christmas, post-Christmas, and end-of-financial-year sales, are all designed to encourage consumers to spend on non-essential instant gratification purchases. And of course the current issue is housing, where a bigger house indicates status within society rather than providing shelter. The conversation always seems to focus on what Boomers have achieved, without analysing how their assets were accumulated with a strict “going without” budget-orientated lifestyle. Bruce Clydsdale, Bathurst
AI: Can we worry now?
A few years ago, I attended a public panel discussion about what was then the early days of AI. I asked one of the panel members, an eminent scientist, if we should be concerned about the so-called Terminator/Skynet scenario. My concerns were met with a dismissive “that would be like worrying about overcrowding on Mars”. Leaving aside the proposition that even one person on Mars could be seen as overcrowding, reading Maureen Dowd’s article (“Don’t worry about it?” , February 16) has left me with a strong sense that my concerns might have deserved a more considered response. It also left me with increased apprehension about the future and a feeling that climate change, as serious as it is, may, in fact, not be the greatest of our worries. Harvey Sanders, Annandale
Here come the drones
Now that the US Navy has realised that unmanned underwater drones are going to be more important in the future than Virginia Class subs (“Shift in US Navy strategy bodes well for Australia’s subs”, February 16), they’ll no doubt be relieved to have Australia as an enthusiastic buyer of their unwanted, outdated, hugely expensive submarines. Richard Tainsh, Potts Point
Age is snow barrier
Being concerned about ageing when turning 40, Laura Prael (“Young enough for TikTok, old enough to sit on a board”, February 16), seems a bit premature to me. Wait until the highlight of your day is the ski lift ticket seller in Japan wanting to check your ID to see if you are entitled to the over-60s senior ticket. I am 76. Ingrid Zoebe, Coogee

The answer to attacks on the UN is to revitalise it – not sideline it
Donald Trump has consistently railed against the irrelevance of the UN has justification for his actions, Heba Aly and David McNair write. But there is a clear path to creating a brighter future
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
There are decades when nothing happens, and weeks when decades happen, so said Vladimir Lenin.
The start of 2026 has brought too many of the latter. The US abduction of the president of a sovereign country in Venezuela and threats to annex Greenland have exposed just how little power the United Nations has to enforce the rules of international law.
Donald Trump has pointed to the UN’s irrelevance as justification for taking matters into his own hands in the establishment of his so-called Board of Peace, which not only circumvents the UN, but seeks to replace it with a privately-controlled entity in which the Chair has ultimate veto power.
Leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney now explicitly acknowledge both the weaknesses of the world order we have known since the Second World War – and the fact that it no longer exists.
We should make no mistake: this is an existential moment for the promise that commonly-agreed rules would make us all safer.
The likely trajectory is a shift towards a mercantilist, "might makes right" world where politics dominate over rules; territory is confiscated by the most powerful; and the comforts and safety we have enjoyed for the past 80 years fade away. It is a world where we may be forced to send our children to war; and where the UN is impotent to challenge these dynamics.
The United Nations Charter emerged from the ashes of the Second World War. Visionary leaders agreed that to avoid the devastation of conflict, we needed rules and an institution to govern them.
In its history, the UN has helped prevent nuclear war between the US and Russia and pushed to maintain peace in many post-conflict settings. It oversaw decolonisation; eradicated diseases, advanced human rights, helped reduce poverty; and contributed to the fastest declines in child and maternal mortality in the history of our species – in many of those cases, using aid pledged from its Member States.
Yet it is far from a perfect institution.
In the words of Dag Hammarskjöld, its second secretary-general, the UN was created not to take us to heaven but to protect us from hell. In recent years, it has failed to protect the people of Gaza, of Ukraine, of Sudan and many other places, from the hell they are living through.
On the current trajectory, everything the UN stands for is at risk, leaving a shell of an institution with bureaucrats debating meaningless resolutions without power or purpose.
Thankfully there is another path.
When the UN was created in 1945, its founders knew it would have to evolve as the world changed.
Then US President Harry Truman said: “This charter … will be expanded and improved as time goes on. No one claims that it is now a final or a perfect instrument. It has not been poured into any fixed mould. Changing world conditions will require readjustments.”
The Charter therefore included Article 109, which calls for a review conference to be held within 10 years, to update the UN’s rules.
But 80 years later, this promise is yet to be fulfilled; each time the idea was raised, it was deemed not the right time.
This is a message we still hear today, even as the UN has become an irrelevant player in its core purpose of maintaining peace and security.
But as the current world order crumbles around us, we have an opportunity to re-mould the UN Charter for a new era - to build “from this fracture”, as Carney put it, “something better, stronger, and more just.”
Already endorsed by countries like Brazil and South Africa, as well as smaller states who feel the system isn’t serving them, a UN Charter review conference can be called by a vote of two-thirds of the members of the UN General Assembly and any nine of the 15 Security Council members – meaning it cannot be vetoed.
The negotiation for updated governance systems – which will be undertaken by governments – could tackle a range of issues, from AI to the climate crisis. But in particular it could address three dysfunctions:
First, abuse of the veto: imagine a Security Council that could actually take decisions in the interest of peace and security, rather than the national interest of the five permanent members (US, Russia, China, France, and the United Kingdom). Imagine a Council that is more accountable to other UN bodies, such as the General Assembly, where every country has one vote.
Second, enforcement powers: imagine a UN capable of enforcing international law through universal jurisdiction of international courts or by increasing the binding powers of resolutions passed by the General Assembly.
Third, the delicate balancing act between national sovereignty, a core principle of our international relations, and the interdependent world of today: imagine a world in which collective solutions to global challenges are co-created between governments, businesses and civil society. These transnational collaborations could be more innovative, dynamic and likely to succeed than outcomes of inter-governmental negotiations.
Some fear that reviewing the UN Charter at a moment of polarisation risks resulting in something worse, but in recent weeks, that risk calculus has changed, as the status quo looks more and more dangerous.
Others are skeptical that a UN intergovernmental process is the right response to major powers doing what they want. Yes, economic and military heavyweights will ignore the rules when they want to, but the rest of the world can build its own strength through collective power.
Kickstarting a review would allow states representing the majority of the world’s population – many of whom were still under colonial rule when the Charter was negotiated – to co-create a vision for the future with solutions fit for the era we find ourselves in.

Japan resumes trial operations at world's largest nuclear plant

Japan’s Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) began power generation and transmission on a trial basis on Monday from a reactor at the world’s largest nuclear power plant as it prepared to resume nuclear power supply for the first time in nearly 14 years, Kyodo News Agency reported.
The company, still dealing with the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, plans to start full-scale transmission from the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant’s No. 6 reactor on March 18.
In late January, the No. 6 reactor became TEPCO’s first to restart since the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex triggered by an earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.
The turbine began operating on Sunday evening, and electricity transmission started early on Monday after no problems were detected.
During the trial, TEPCO will repeatedly disconnect and reconnect the generator while gradually raising output from 20 percent to full capacity. The reactor last transmitted electricity in March 2012 before shutting down for routine inspections.
Another reactor at the plant is also expected to restart, having already secured regulatory approval. However, most nuclear reactors in Japan remain offline due to lingering safety concerns after the Fukushima accident.
As part of its decarbonisation push, the government aims to maximise nuclear energy use by restarting reactors that meet strict safety standards.
The No. 6 reactor was initially restarted on January 21 but was shut down due to an alarm sounding during control rod extraction. It went back online on February 9.
Monday’s transmission was also delayed due to a malfunction in a neutron-measuring device.

Zelenskyy: 90% of Ukrainians against elections during war
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that 90% of Ukrainian citizens are against elections during the war, since for them to be held, first of all, it is necessary to end the war or at least achieve a ceasefire.
"We need security for this (to hold elections - IF-U). We need a ceasefire, that is, maybe not the end of the war, but a ceasefire or security guarantees. In such circumstances, the law needs to be changed, our parliament can do it, I hope. But it is interesting that 90% of Ukrainians are against the elections. If anyone is interested in what Ukrainians think, then 90% are against it, because they understand that it is terrible - how to hold elections now, during the war, under shelling," he said in an interview with Politico.
He noted that it is not clear how the military and 8 million Ukrainians who are abroad will vote during the war.
However, Zelenskyy noted that if US President Donald Trump agrees with Vladimir Putin on a 2-3-month ceasefire, then Ukraine will be able to hold elections.
As reported, on February 14, during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine is open to elections if necessary, but may also declare a ceasefire with the Russians if they hold their own elections.

Jumps racing cost taxpayers $1.8m more than it returned
Jumps racing cost Victorian taxpayers $1.8 million more than it generated in gambling revenue, according to an independent analysis commissioned by Animal Justice Party MP Georgie Purcell, as she ramps up calls to scrap the sport.
The figures are detailed in new costings provided by the Victorian Parliamentary Budget Office [PBO] finalised in October.
Purcell, whose party has long campaigned to end jumps racing in Victoria, asked the PBO to calculate the “net subsidy” of jumps racing in Victoria, or how much the state government spent on the sport compared with how much tax it brought in.
This was determined by subtracting the $900,000 the sport was estimated to have contributed to gambling taxes and wagering licence fees from $2.8 million it received as a share of these taxes and state government funding.
After rounding, the PBO put the “net subsidy” of the industry at $1.8 million in 2024-25.
This figure was a significant increase from a $300,000 subsidy in 2023-24, largely because of a new $90 million state government funding deed shared across the racing industry that came into effect in the last financial year.
“We estimate that the government receives less revenue from Victorian jumps racing than it provides in funds,” the PBO analysis says.
The report noted that it was forced to rely on publicly available information as documents requested from the Department of Justice and Community Safety were confidential.
Outside of prize money, the PBO had to rely on assumptions to estimate how much Racing Victoria spent on jumps racing, and it did not consider other forms of tax revenue. The analysis was completed in October, finalised before the release of the mid-year budget update and release of annual reports.
Purcell said jumps racing should have been banned decades ago, with no other Australian state still allowing the practice.
“This is a dirty industry that is already on its knees and this latest report confirms what we already know – it’s fighting desperately to stay afloat,” Purcell said.
“It is up to Premier Jacinta Allan and Racing Minister Anthony Carbines to explain why, in a cost-of-living crisis, their broke government is wasting taxpayer funds on this cruelty.
“To green-light racing of any kind is to green-light animal cruelty, but to stubbornly continue to fund an industry that’s running at a loss shows just how out of touch the Allan government is with Victorians.”
“It’s time the Victorian Labor government got behind calls from former deputy Premier and Racing Minister Rob Hulls and shut this down for good.”
Jumps events came under fresh scrutiny in 2024 after seven horse fatalities were recorded and Racing Victoria said it would review the season.
That triggered an intervention from Hulls, a former racing minister for Labor, who threw his support behind a ban.
In December 2024, the body said it would continue jumps racing in the state with extra safety measures, including a Jumps Taskforce to assess these changes.
In the 2025 season, there were five fatalities recorded following these changes. Critics argue this figure should be six fatalities in 2025 and 10 in 2024 as more horses that had competed in jumps events died later in the year.
At the time, Racing Victoria chair Tim Eddy said their decision recognised the cultural and economic significance of jumps racing to regional Victoria, particularly “its vital role in events such as the Warrnambool May Carnival”.
The board also found the Warrnambool May Carnival, which heavily features jumps, generated $14.8 million in direct expenditure annually for the local economy and removing the sport would likely reduce visitation numbers and appeal.
A Racing Victoria spokesperson said it had not seen the analysis but said the broad Victorian Thoroughbred Racing Industry supports 111,194 jobs and generates $3.4 billion economic activity.
They said changes introduced after 2024 led to a decline in raceday fatalities year-on-year.
“Racing Victoria’s Jumps Taskforce is committed to evaluating safety metrics, participation rates and economic impacts at the conclusion of each jumps racing season,” the spokesperson said.
A broader review planned for the end of 2027 was abandoned last year, with Racing Victoria pledging to hold the review only if key results were not met, such as a high rate of fatalities.
The RSPCA in January criticised Racing Victoria for taking down historical reports from the jumps review panel from its website.
A government spokesperson said decisions on the future of jumps racing were a matter for Racing Victoria.
“Jumps racing supports regional jobs and economies, with the Warrnambool May Carnival alone generating nearly $15 million and attracting more than 6,500 visitors last year,” they said.

Germany news: Crowds to turn out for Carnival parade
February 16, 2026What you need to know
- Cologne, Düsseldorf set to see satirical effigies making fun of politicians during Carnival parades
- German president travels to Lebanon
Here are the major headlines from Germany on February 16, 2026:
German president travels to Lebanon
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier travels to Lebanon on Monday, before traveling onward to Jordan on Wednesday.
The main agenda of the trip has to do with maintaining a ceasefire that was brokered by the US in 2024 to halt the fighting between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.
Israel has fired rockets and missiles into southern Lebanon nearly daily in recent months, saying it was necessary to prevent Hezbollah from rearming. A central tenet of the truce requires Hezbollah to lay down its weapons.
Hezbollah is an Iran-backed Shiite political party and militant group in Lebanon.
It is designated as a terrorist organization by the US, Germany and several Sunni Arab countries, while the EU lists its armed wing as a terrorist group.

Wild storm hits New Zealand, disrupts flights, leaves thousands without power
5 districts under states of emergency as evacuations underway
ISTANBUL
Severe rains and winds on Monday disrupted flight services and left thousands of properties without power across New Zealand's North Island.
More than 30,000 properties are without power after fierce winds toppled trees and power lines across much of the lower North Island, according to Radio New Zealand (RNZ).
Electricity provider Powerco reported around 23,000 outages across its network, including approximately 10,000 in the Wellington region alone.
Images circulating online show flooded semi-rural neighborhoods, waterlogged homes, and sections of road washed away after floodwaters receded.
The Manawatu-Whanganui region has been particularly hard hit and is now under a state of emergency.
Evacuations are underway on Lincoln Road in Masterton due to the danger posed by falling trees.
Wairarapa assistant commander Ian Wright described a busy night of weather-related callouts that are ongoing, warning that falling trees remain the greatest hazard.
He said shallow-rooted trees on Lincoln Road are "very, very unstable, so both roads have been closed and the people have been evacuated."
Air NZ has cancelled flights in and out of several major centers, including the capital, Wellington, because of the strong winds.
"Safety is paramount, and we are continuing to closely monitor conditions, with winds expected to reduce later this morning when we expect to resume services," chief operating officer Alex Marren said.
Five districts—Manawatu, Rangitikei, Tararua, Waipa, and Otorohanga—are under states of emergency.
Wind gusts have reached up to 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour) on the east coast of the lower North Island, including at Cape Turnagain, while high parts of Wellington recorded gusts of up to 190 km/h and around 130 km/h in the city.
The severe winds and heavy rain are expected to persist over the lower North Island before gradually shifting south later on Monday.

Norwegian scientist developed Havana-like symptoms after testing electromagnetic device on himself

A Norwegian government scientist built a device that emitted pulses of microwave energy and tested it on himself, attempting to prove that it would be harmless, the Washington Post reported, citing individuals familiar with the experiment. The scientist suffered symptoms aligned with “Havana syndrome,” a disputed medical condition.
Also known as Anomalous Health Incidents (AHI), the term “Havana syndrome” emerged in 2016 after personnel at the US embassy in Havana reported symptoms including dizziness, headaches, and cognitive difficulties. Believed by some to be caused by a device emitting electromagnetic pulses, hundreds of diplomats in several countries later reported similar AHI symptoms.
A 2022 panel of experts commissioned by the director of national intelligence and deputy CIA director concluded that electromagnetic waves “plausibly explain[ed]” AHI symptoms, though it emphasized significant information gaps.
However, in 2023, the US intelligence community, including the CIA and four other agencies, assessed that it was “very unlikely” that a foreign country was behind the incidents. In early 2025, some agencies changed their position, noting the possibility of foreign attacks on American diplomats.
Foreign involvement possible but unlikely
Two agencies, the National Security Agency (NSA), and the National Ground Intelligence Center (NGIC), reportedly revised their earlier conclusions, citing new developments that suggested a foreign actor could possess capabilities consistent with at least some AHI symptoms. The CIA and four other agencies, however, maintained that foreign involvement remained “very unlikely.”
Although no country has been named as the source of the attacks, the Washington Post reported that former officials, as well as victims of AHI, have pointed out Russia as a source, although the country denies responsibility.
Towards the end of the Biden administration in 2025, the Department of Defense reportedly purchased and tested a partially Russian-made device believed to cause the symptoms, CNN reported.
According to the Washington Post, the Norwegian researcher, described as skeptical of the directed-energy theory, constructed an electromagnetic pulse-emitting device in 2024 using classified information and tested it on himself. Sources familiar with the experiment said he suffered neurological symptoms that were not publicly detailed.
The Norwegian embassy in Washington did not respond to the Washington Post’s request for comment.
The Norway experiment doesn’t prove that AHIs are the result of a foreign attack, but it could renew debate within the US government over whether pulsed electromagnetic devices could cause medical effects, and whether such capabilities are being developed by rival countries.

Startup Nation Central summons 65 employees to dismissal hearings in restructuring

Startup National Central (SNC), a nonprofit organization supported by philanthropists including Paul Singer, Dan Loeb, the William Davidson Foundation, and others, has summoned 65 of its 80 employees in Israel to a hearing before their dismissal.
Founded 13 years ago, SNC is making this move as part of a rethinking of its activities to promote Israel's tech industry. Estimates are that the organization has raised $15-20 million annually to finance its activities.
At this stage, SNC is not closing down and will continue to maintain the building it owns on Lillienblum Street in Tel Aviv, as well as retain about 15 employees who will focus on individual support for certain initiatives in Israel's tech industry.
In recent months, the organization has lowered its media profile, and CEO Avi Hasson, former head of the Israel Innovation Authority, has left his position, which has been filled by a temporary acting director.
Donors who hold pro-Israel positions and inject millions of shekels each year into Israeli organizations will reportedly continue to invest money in Israel in other ways.
"The organization is adopting a leaner structure"
SNC was founded in 2013 by US Jewish philanthropist Paul Singer, CEO of Elliott Management Corp., a hedge fund, and Startup Nation co-author Dan Senor, and Wendy Singer, the wife of Senor's co-author Saul Singer.
Senor remains active on SNC's board of directors today. Singer was later joined by other donors, such as Dan Loeb, founder of the Third Point Ventures (TPV) hedge fund.
Inspired by the 2009 book "Startup Nation," SNC has sought to promote Israel's tech industry by organizing senior delegations to Israel and setting up meetings between Israeli executives, overseas company executives, and senior figures in foreign governments.
In recent years, thanks to the Abraham Accords, the organization has also worked extensively with executives in the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.
The rethinking SNC's founders are conducting of their activities comes during a historic week in which the sale of two Israeli companies, Wiz and CyberArk, for a combined total of more than $50 billion was approved. In such a situation, assistance to the Israeli tech industry, and to Israel in general, might better be provided in different ways.
SNC said, "Startup Nation Central, a non-profit organization that has been connecting Israeli innovation with global corporations, investors, governments, and leaders for over a decade, has decided to strategically change its operating model."
It added, "Due to the maturity of the Israeli innovation ecosystem and its dominance in international markets, the organization is adopting a leaner organizational structure and will now focus on a focused set of high-impact initiatives, aligned with current priorities. This strategic change also includes a reduction in staff, in a way that reflects the more focused scale of activity from now on."
"The organization will continue to serve the Israeli ecosystem and concentrate on focused initiatives where its network of connections, credibility, and experience can provide unique value, support Israel's economic resilience, and continue its leadership in global innovation," it said.
SNC interim CEO Aviva Steinberger said: "Startup Nation Central was founded to meet a need of a certain period, and together we helped shape an ecosystem that is now strong, global, and independent. The evolution we are talking about today reflects this success. As Israel's innovation landscape changes, so must we. By sharpening our focus and aligning resources with today's most strategic needs, we will continue to serve the ecosystem in meaningful and impactful ways."

The truth about intermittent fasting and your health
- A new Cochrane review suggests intermittent fasting is unlikely to lead to greater weight loss in overweight or obese adults than traditional dietary advice or doing nothing.
- The review analysed evidence from 22 randomised clinical trials involving 1,995 adults across North America, Europe, China, Australia, and South America.
- Lead author Luis Garegnani stated that the current evidence does not justify the enthusiasm for intermittent fasting seen on social media, as it “doesn't seem to work” for weight loss in this demographic.
- Nutritionists and medical officers warn that intermittent fasting is not a “magic solution” and can be difficult to sustain, potentially leading to compensatory overeating.
- Experts recommend focusing on improving overall diet quality by consuming protein, fibre, and healthy fats, while reducing ultra-processed foods, sugar, and refined carbohydrates for sustainable weight management.

SAPO serves suspicion notice to former Energy Minister Haluschchenko
Ukraine’s Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAP) has formally notified former Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko of suspicion in the "Midas" case, the SAP press service reported Sunday.
"Under the procedural supervision of an SAP prosecutor, National Anti-corruption Burea of Ukraine (NABU) detectives have served a new suspicion notice in the Midas case. The notice concerns the former Minister of Energy of Ukraine for the period 2021–2025. He is charged with money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation," the statement read.
According to investigators, in February 2021 a fund was registered on Anguilla, a British Overseas Territory, on the initiative of members of the criminal organisation subsequently exposed by NABU and SAPO in November 2025. The fund was designed to attract approximately $100 million in purported investment and was headed by a long-standing associate of the criminal organisation’s members — a citizen of the Seychelles and St. Kitts and Nevis who provided professional money laundering services on a commercial basis. The suspect’s family was listed among the fund’s "investors."
To conceal the suspect’s participation, two companies were incorporated in the Marshall Islands and integrated into a trust structure registered in St. Kitts and Nevis. The suspect’s former wife and four children were registered as the companies’ beneficiaries.
The Marshall Islands companies acquired shares in the Anguilla fund, effectively becoming its "investors," while members of the criminal organisation began transferring funds in the suspect’s interest to the fund’s accounts held at three Swiss banks.
Evidence obtained in Ukraine and through international legal cooperation with competent authorities in multiple countries indicates that during the suspect’s tenure as minister, his trusted intermediary — known by the alias facilitated the receipt of more than $112 million in cash by the criminal organisation, derived from unlawful activity in Ukraine’s energy sector.
"These funds were laundered through various financial instruments, including cryptocurrency and ‘investment’ in the fund," the prosecutor’s office stated.
Investigators have established that more than $7.4 million was transferred to fund accounts controlled by the suspect’s family. A further sum exceeding CHF 1.3 million and EUR 2.4 million was delivered in cash or transferred directly to family members in Switzerland. A portion of these funds was used to pay tuition fees at prestigious Swiss educational institutions attended by the suspect’s children and deposited into accounts held by the former wife. The remainder was placed on deposit, generating ongoing passive income for the family’s personal use.
On February 15, 2026, NABU detectives detained the former senior official at the state border as he attempted to leave Ukrainian territory. He has been served with a suspicion notice under Part 2 of Article 255 and Part 3 of Article 209 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The investigation is continuing. NABU is conducting the inquiry in cooperation with competent authorities in fifteen countries.
As previously reported, NABU confirmed on February 15 the detention of former Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko at the state border in connection with the Midas case.

Myanmar expels East Timor envoy in fallout over junta complaint

Myanmar has ordered the head of East Timor's diplomatic mission to leave the country within seven days, state media quoted the foreign ministry, in an escalating row over a criminal complaint filed by a rights group against Myanmar's armed forces.
Myanmar has been in turmoil since 2021, when the military ousted the elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, sparking a wave of anti-junta protests that have morphed into a nationwide civil war.
Myanmar's Chin state Human Rights Organization (CHRO) last month filed a complaint with the justice department of East Timor, also known as Timor-Leste, alleging that the Myanmar junta had carried out war crimes and crimes against humanity since the 2021 coup.
In January, CHRO officials also met East Timor President Jose Ramos-Horta, who last year led the tiny Catholic nation's accession into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), of which Myanmar is also a member.
CHRO filed the complaint in East Timor because it was seeking an ASEAN member with an independent judiciary as well as a country that would be sympathetic to the suffering of Chin State's majority Christian population, the group's Executive Director, Salai Za Uk, said.
"Such unconstructive engagement by a Head of State of one ASEAN Member State with an unlawful organisation opposing another ASEAN Member State is totally unacceptable," the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar quoted the foreign ministry as saying on Monday.
Genocide
A spokesman for the Myanmar junta did not respond to calls seeking comment.
In early February, CHRO said East Timor's judicial authorities had opened legal proceedings against the Myanmar junta, including its chief, Min Aung Hlaing, following the complaint filed by the rights group.
Myanmar's foreign ministry said East Timor's acceptance of the case and the country's appointment of a prosecutor to look into it resulted in "setting an unprecedented practice, negative interpretation and escalation of (public) resentments."
East Timor's embassy in Myanmar did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via email.
The diplomatic spat comes as the Myanmar military faces international scrutiny for its role in an alleged genocide against the minority Muslim Rohingya in a case being heard at the International Court of Justice.

Scientists in five European countries confirmed that Alexey Navalny was killed with a rare neurotoxin. Russian officials are calling it ‘necro-propaganda.’
On February 14, 2026, The Insider reported that independent laboratories in five countries had identified the substance used to poison Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. Scientists found epibatidine — a potent toxin derived from a South American frog — in biological samples taken from Navalny and smuggled abroad. Britain, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands subsequently issued a joint statement confirming the findings and accusing Russia of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States did not dispute the European assessment and described it as “troubling.” Russia’s Foreign Ministry dismissed the conclusions as deliberate disinformation. Meduza reviews reactions to the weekend’s revelations.

Russia’s reaction: ‘Disinformation,’ ‘a political pageant,’ and ‘necro-propaganda’
Russia’s Foreign Ministry denounced the five European countries’ conclusions about Navalny’s poisoning. Speaking on February 14, spokesperson Maria Zakharova said:
At a moment when they should be presenting the results of their investigation into [the Nord Stream pipeline bombing], they’re bringing up Navalny. When formally asked to provide Navalny’s test results, they deflected with bombshell claims about the Skripals. […] Show us the test results. Show us the chemical formulas. Then we’ll comment. Without that, all this talk is just a planted story meant to distract from the West’s real problems.
The Russian embassy in London called the five countries’ statement about Navalny’s poisoning a “political pageant” staged on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. The diplomatic mission said “there is no reason whatsoever to credit such ‘findings’ by Western ‘experts.’” “Yet what truly shocks is the method now favored by Western politicians: necro-propaganda. This is not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead,” the embassy said on social media.
Russian network television ignored the five countries’ joint statement about Navalny’s poisoning in its Saturday evening newscasts, the independent outlet Agentstvo reported. Meanwhile, several Russian publications — including Kommersant, Forbes, and Lenta.ru — addressed the poisoning only after Maria Zakharova’s statement, which became the focus of their coverage.
Other reactions: The United States doesn’t ‘question’ the Europeans, while Britain sees the Russian authorities’ ‘overwhelming fear’ of the opposition
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that the United States did not dispute the conclusions reached by European countries. He made the remarks at a press conference in Bratislava during his visit to Slovakia. “We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” Rubio added.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called Navalny’s poisoning “a cowardly act from a frightened leader.” “Russia has long acted as a terrorist state, relying on terrorist methods,” she noted.
“We never had any illusions about the nature of the Russian regime,” said German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul. “But it is clear that Russian authorities had the possibility, the motive, and the means to administer the poison to Navalny.”
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat,” said British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. “By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
“Two years ago, Alexey Navalny died from poisoning caused by one of the deadliest nerve agents [novichok]. We now know that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use chemical weapons against his own people to maintain his grip on power,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot.
Leonid Volkov, director of political projects for the Anti-Corruption Foundation, also commented on the laboratories’ findings:
Every propagandist was trying to outdo the others, inventing “natural causes,” “blood clots,” and “heart attacks” off the top of their heads like they always do. They laughed right in our faces […] It was a long two-year road. Today, there is a sense that we’ve turned an important page and finished a chapter. Someday, when it’s possible, we’ll write in our memoirs about what it all took… We’re still infinitely far from victory; only a tiny step has been taken. But we took it.
What else is known about the poison?
Ismail Efendiev, an Azerbaijani physician specializing in toxicology and a candidate of medical sciences (a credential roughly equivalent to a Ph.D.), described the properties of epibatidine during an appearance on The Breakfast Show. Efendiev, who in 2020 publicly commented on the Novichok poisoning attempt against Navalny, said the lethal dose of epibatidine could have been microscopic.
“Obviously, such experiments have not been conducted on humans — or if they have, those results were never made public. But based on what we know from animal studies, we’re talking about hundredths or even thousandths of a gram. Put simply, a deadly dose might be so tiny you wouldn’t even see it,” the toxicologist said.
Efendiev noted that poisonings by epibatidine and Novichok show similar symptoms, but there’s a key difference: atropine, the cholinolytic agent that Omsk doctors quickly administered to Navalny in 2020 after he collapsed on a plane, would not work against epibatidine. Efendiev explained that the only option would be to treat the symptoms, as there is no specific antidote. However, epibatidine lingers in the body and breaks down slowly, which actually makes it easier to detect.
Efendiev stressed that there is no way to purchase — let alone synthesize — epibatidine at home. Only government labs tied to specific agencies or organizations have the means to produce it.

For the first time since 1967: Government moves to expand Jerusalem beyond the Green Line
Unknown

The government has continued steps in recent years to assert sovereignty in Jerusalem, blurring the boundaries of the Green Line. A housing plan being advanced in the settlement of Adam (Geva Binyamin) in the Binyamin region, indicates that although it is officially presented as an expansion of the community settlement, it would in practice extend Jerusalem’s territory beyond its pre-1967 lines for the first time since the Six-Day War. The move would amount to de facto sovereignty in the area and an expansion of the capital.
The plan calls for hundreds of housing units on land located at a distance from Adam, currently with no direct access from the settlement, though there were past discussions of building a bridge to connect the two. Construction in the designated area would create territorial continuity within Jerusalem and effectively expand the Neve Yaakov neighborhood. According to the plan, the housing is intended for the ultra-Orthodox community.
Moreover, the access road for the project would begin in Jerusalem’s Neve Yaakov neighborhood and loop back into it. In effect, the plan would enlarge Jerusalem’s municipal jurisdiction, something that has not occurred since 1967.
Advancing the plan through the West Bank planning track has become far more efficient following sweeping changes made by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich within the Civil Administration, including the establishment of a new Settlement Administration. The approval process is expected to move quickly, and under the new procedures instituted in recent years, the project could be implemented within a few years. Smotrich has reshaped the government’s approach to settlement construction in the West Bank, replacing lengthy bureaucratic procedures with expedited approval channels.
The housing plan follows a series of dramatic Cabinet decisions regarding the West Bank, as well as the government’s approval this week to resume land registration in the West Bank in the name of the state for the first time since 1967. The moves have drawn criticism from friendly countries in the Arab world and the West, which have condemned them as “de facto annexation.”
The Israeli advocacy group Peace Now sharply criticized the latest move. “For the first time since 1967, under the pretext of a new settlement, the government is carrying out annexation through the back door,” the group said. “The new community will function in every respect as a neighborhood of Jerusalem, and presenting it as a ‘neighborhood’ of Adam is merely a pretext and an attempt to conceal a move that amounts to applying Israeli sovereignty to areas in the West Bank.”
MK Gilad Kariv of the Democrats party submitted an urgent query to Housing Minister Haim Katz, asking whether there is an intention to annex the area of the plan to Jerusalem and whether residents of the neighborhood, officially designated as part of Adam, would receive services from the Jerusalem Municipality.
“The planned step will exacerbate friction between Israelis and Palestinians, stir unnecessary tensions and ultimately harm Jerusalem’s status as Israel’s capital,” Kariv said. “The plans do not align with Israel’s international commitments, including to U.S. President Donald Trump, and they reflect Netanyahu’s complete capitulation to his extremist partners.”

Alleged murder victim given ‘promise’ to end suffering
An alleged murder victim who was largely paralysed with terminal brain disease told his sons and wife to promise to kill him, a magistrate has heard.
Kylie Ellina Truswell-Mobbs, 51, faced Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday for a committal hearing charged with murdering her husband David Ronald Mobbs.
Mobbs, 56, died at the family’s home at Alexandra Hills, south-east of Brisbane, between December 5 and 6, 2023.
Truswell-Mobbs was accused of making three attempts to administer a lethal combination of drugs to Mobbs via his feeding tube.
Her son Rylee Relja told the hearing his step-father had wanted to end his life if he reached the point where he could no longer use the toilet.
That point had arrived on December 5, 2023, magistrate Lewis Shillito heard.
“He was distraught, upset. He was crying,” Relja said.
He told police a toilet incident was a “trigger” for his parents.
“I know dad had made mum promise that if this was to occur then dad didn’t want to continue fighting,” he said.
Asked by Truswell-Mobbs’ barrister Ruth O’Gorman if that meant Mobbs wanted to die, Relja said: “Yes.”
Truswell-Mobbs sat in the dock wearing a T-shirt, jeans and sandals, frequently wiping her eyes with tissues as she listened to the testimony.
Mobbs’ health had rapidly declined after he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, an incurable neurological disease that progressively robs the brain of its ability to communicate with muscles.
He was bed-ridden and could communicate through blinks, grunts and by placing his finger on letters written on a signing board.
Relja said he left the family home for less than 30 minutes at 11pm to pick up takeaway food.
“You said ‘mum told me she had given dad something called a cocktail’,” O’Gorman said.
“Yes,” he said.
Relja testified that he asked his dad “is this what you want?” and that he blinked twice in response meaning “yes”.
Mobbs was asked “are you sure you want to OD [overdose] or words to that effect” and again blinked twice, Relja said.
He died peacefully in his sleep over the next few hours, Shillito heard.
Crown prosecutor Stephanie Gallagher asked Relja how he was sure Truswell-Mobbs had an agreement with Mobbs to end his life on December 5.
“I cannot remember,” he said.
His brother Jayden Relja also testified on Monday and said he was away from the house when his father was allegedly given a lethal dose of drugs.
After a meeting on December 5 to discuss palliative care and possibly aiding his death, he asked his dad “surely you can give it another week”.
“He had a bit of a sad face but he nodded his head and raised his eyebrows saying ‘yeah’,” Jayden Relja said.
After hearing from other witnesses, Shillito committed Truswell-Mobbs to stand trial in the Supreme Court at a date to be set.
She declined to say anything in response and was remanded in custody.

Migration minister proposes letting teenagers finish studies before deportation
Swedish Migration Minister Johan Forssell has made a small concession on the teen deportation issue, saying that teenagers who lose the right to live in Sweden should be allowed to stay in Sweden long enough to graduate from upper secondary school.
Speaking on the long Saturday interview on Swedish radio broadcaster SR, Forssell said that the government has asked for a proposal that could give the affected group more time to complete high school.
"Students who attend high school should be able to attend high school and complete it," he said in the interview.
Teen deportations, where people who turn 18 are ordered to leave Sweden even though their families are allowed to stay, have become a big issue in Sweden.
Swedish vocabulary: gymnasium – upper secondary school
Government asks development agency to use aid to help deportations
Sweden's government has asked the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) to use aid and the threat of withdrawing it to help the government's efforts to encourage countries to accept citizens deported from Sweden.
"We should find ways to cooperate with countries for efficient return operations," Hanna Hellquist, the agency's director general, said about the orders she has received from the government for 2026.
The instructions also request that the agency work more closely with Sweden's trade agencies and its foreign office, so that aid is an integrated part of Swedish foreign policy.
Swedish vocabulary: effektiv – efficient
Outrage after Migration Agency orders 8-month-old baby to be deported to Iran
The Swedish Migration Agency has ordered an 8-month-old baby, who was born in Sweden, to be deported to Iran alone, generating outrage in the Swedish media over the weekend.
The Migration Agency ruled that as the boy's mother had residency through the track change or spårbyte rule at the time he was born, the residency he received as a dependent was no longer valid.
The boy's mother and father have since received residency on other grounds, meaning the 8-month-old has been ordered to leave Sweden alone.
The Migration Agency ruled that the boy did not qualify for a permit under the "particularly distressing circumstances" safety clause.
Swedish prime minister Ulf Kristersson said that the decision, "sounds unreasonable".
"We do not deport small children separately from their parents," he said.
"Every thinking person realizes that a baby cannot leave the country on its own," wrote Ebba Busch, leader of the Christian Democrats.
Swedish vocabulary: orimlig – unreasonable
Migration Agency chief to be grilled by parliament on teen deportations
The Migration Agency's director general, Maria Mindhammar, has been called to the Swedish parliament's Committee on Social Insurance to be grilled on how the law could be changed to reduce the problem of teen deportations.
"It's not a reasonable way to treat people," Niels Paarup-Petersen, from the Centre Party, told the Aftonbladet newspaper.
He wants Mindhammar to reveal how long processing times are and what the Migration Agency needs to be able to stop the deportations of teenagers as quickly as possible.
Swedish vocabulary: handläggningstider – processing times

Australian police arrest man, recover stolen Egyptian artefacts after museum heist
The man is accused of stealing a mummy mask, collar, necklace and wooden cat from a museum in Caboolture, Queensland
The man was accused of breaking a window and making off with the priceless treasures in the early hours of Friday from the Abbey Museum of Art and Archaeology in the Queensland town of Caboolture.
Police said they found all the stolen goods – except for a wooden cat sculpture believed to be around 2,600 years old and from the 26th dynasty of ancient Egypt – with only minor damage when they searched a car the following day at a ferry terminal south of the museum.
They arrested the suspect on the same evening on Russell Island, a small island off the coast of Queensland, according to American broadcaster NBC News. “Police will allege the man was found in possession of the last missing artefact, the wooden cat sculpture,” they said.
The man, named by local media as Miguel Simon Mungarrieta Monsalve, was charged with various counts including breaking and entering, and three counts of wilful damage.
In court on Monday, a prosecutor said the man stole a mummy mask, a collar, a necklace reportedly 3,300 years old and the wooden cat while also causing “irreparable damage” to other items, according to public broadcaster ABC.

Today’s puzzle is a new twist on a classic genre: the “common knowledge” hat riddle in which logicians deduce facts about their hats based on what they know, and what they know others know.
Head sums
Ade, Binky, and Carl are honest perfect logicians. A hat is placed on each of their heads. Each hat has a whole number larger than zero written on it, which the other two logicians can see but which the wearer cannot. One of these numbers is the sum of the other two (so for example, the three numbers could be 3, 7, 4, or another possibility is 6, 6, 12). All of this is public knowledge.
Ade sees that Binky has a 3 and Carl has a 1.
Ade says for all to hear: “ I do not know the number on my hat”
Binky then announces: “I do not know the number on my hat”
Ade then announces: “I know the number on my hat!”
What number is on Ade’s hat?
I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solution. PLEASE NO SPOILERS. Please discuss hats.
The puzzle was devised by Timothy Chow, inspired by a puzzle by Dick Hess.

When is Ramadan 2026, and how is the moon sighted?

When is Ramadan 2026, and how is the moon sighted?
The first day of fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in Mecca will likely be Thursday, February 19.
The first day of fasting for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in Mecca, Saudi Arabia will be either Wednesday, February 18 or Thursday, February 19, depending on the sighting of the new moon.
Other countries follow their own moon sightings. Some use astronomical calculations for lunar phases, while others rely on traditional local sightings to confirm the start of the new month.

Ramadan is determined by the Islamic lunar calendar, which begins with the sighting of the crescent moon. Saudi Arabia and other Muslim-majority countries rely on the testimonies of moon sighters to determine the start of the month.
How is the Ramadan moon sighted?
For the moon to be visible, the crescent must set after the sun. This allows the sky to be dark enough to spot the small sliver of the new moon.
After the sun sets on the night of February 17, the 29th day of the month of Shaban in the Hijri calendar, moon sighters face west with a clear view of the horizon for a first glimpse of the crescent moon.
If the moon is sighted, the month of Ramadan begins, with the first day of fasting being February 18. Otherwise, Shaban will complete 30 days, and the first fasting day will be February 19.
In Saudi Arabia, testimonies of people who have spotted the moon are recorded, and the Supreme Court makes a decision on when Ramadan should begin.
In order to view the moon at sunset time, there are three important factors astronomers look for:
Elongation: The moon needs to be far enough from the sun to ensure its light is not drowned out. For a reliable naked-eye sighting, the moon must be 10-12 degrees away from the sun. If it is closer than 7 degrees, then the crescent may be physically too thin to reflect enough light for the human eye to see.
Altitude: The higher the moon is at sunset, the less it has to compete with the thick, hazy atmosphere and the glow of the sky near the horizon. An altitude of 10 degrees is typically sufficient for clear naked-eye visibility, while lower altitudes of 3 to 5 degrees may be adequate with the help of optical aids.
Lag time: This is the time between sunset and moonset. For reliable naked-eye viewing, there usually needs to be at least 45 minutes for the sky to darken enough to see the moon. Longer durations are even better.
When does Ramadan begin in different countries?
According to Crescent Moon Watch, a moon tracker run by the United Kingdom’s Nautical Almanac Office, Ramadan’s new moon will begin on February 17 at 3:01pm Mecca time (12:01 GMT).
On that night in Mecca, the sun will set at 6:19pm (15:19 GMT), and the moon will be visible for only three minutes, setting at 6:22pm (15:22 GMT). With the new moon only three hours and 18 minutes old, it is very unlikely that anyone across the globe will see the crescent moon that evening, meaning the first day of Ramadan will begin on February 19.
On the evening of February 18, the new moon should be visible in most parts of the world. By that time, the moon will be nearly 26 hours old. It will be higher in the sky and remain visible for much longer after sunset, making it easily observable to the public.
North America
The Fiqh Council of North America (FCNA) and the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), both of which follow astronomical calculations, have officially announced that Ramadan will begin on February 18, 2026. Their calculations state that, at sunset somewhere on the globe, the elongation of the moon should be at least 8 degrees, and the moon must be at least 5 degrees above the horizon for it to be visible.
Europe
The European Council for Fatwa and Research (ECFR) has declared that Thursday, February 19, will be the first day of Ramadan. ECFR notes that while the astronomical birth of the moon occurs on Tuesday, it will be impossible to see that evening either with the naked eye or through telescopes and observational instruments. Turkiye has also declared February 19 as the first day of the holy month of Ramadan, for the same reasons.
Middle East
Most Middle Eastern nations, led by Saudi Arabia, will not make a final announcement until the evening of Tuesday, February 17. If the Saudi Supreme Court receives a testimony of a sighting on Tuesday night, it may declare Wednesday as the first day of Ramadan. But this is very unlikely for the reasons mentioned above.
Asia
Across Asia, the start of Ramadan 2026 will most likely be Thursday, February 19, as the moon will set before the sun in that part of the world on Tuesday night.
Singapore has officially confirmed the start of Ramadan to be on Thursday, while countries in South Asia including India and Pakistan have forecast Thursday, February 19 as the first day of fasting.
Africa
In Africa, the start of Ramadan follows a similar pattern to the rest of the world, with most countries anticipating it to begin on Thursday, February 19.
Oceania
The Australian National Imams Council have announced that Ramadan will commence on February 19.
Why is Ramadan holy for Muslims, and what is the significance?
Muslims believe that Ramadan is the month when the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad nearly 1,450 years ago.
Throughout the month, observing Muslims fast from just before the sunrise prayer, Fajr, to the sunset prayer, Maghrib.
The fast entails abstinence from eating, drinking, smoking, and sexual relations to achieve greater “taqwa”, or consciousness of God.
Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam, along with the Muslim declaration of faith, daily prayers, charity, and performing the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca if physically and financially capable.
In many Muslim-majority countries, working hours are reduced, and most restaurants are closed during the fasting hours.
Ramadan greetings in different languages
Various Muslim-majority nations have a personalised greeting in their native languages. “Ramadan Mubarak” and “Ramadan Kareem” are common greetings exchanged over the month, wishing the recipient a blessed and generous month, respectively.

Power cuts, travel disruption as fierce storm strikes New Zealand

Heavy rain and strong winds have disrupted flights, trains and ferries, forcing the closure of roads across large parts of New Zealand's North Island, while snapping power links to tens of thousands.
Domestic media reported on Monday that a few flights had resumed operating by afternoon from the airport in Wellington, the capital, although cancellations were still widespread after airport authorities said most morning flights were disrupted.
Air New Zealand said it hoped to resume services when conditions ease later on Monday, after it paused operations at Wellington, Napier and Palmerston North airports.
Online images showed flooded semi-rural neighbourhoods, inundated homes, trees fallen on vehicles and collapsed sections of road after the waters receded.
The weather had been "absolutely terrifying", Marilyn Bulford, who lives in the rural town of Bunnythorpe, about 160 km (100 miles) north of Wellington, told the New Zealand Herald newspaper.
"I've never seen huge trees blowing around this much," she added. "It's so bad. I haven't seen anything like it."
The Wellington region accounted for more than half the 852 emergency calls received overnight, said Ken Cooper, assistant national commander of the emergency services.
"We had a very busy night, and our firefighters are continuing to respond to calls," he added.
More than 30,000 properties were without power, including about 10,000 customers in Wellington, said authorities, who have urged motorists to stay off roads, while several schools were closed as emergency crews tackled widespread damage.
The storm is forecast to bring heavy rains as it heads for the east coast of the South Island on Tuesday, the weather bureau said, with authorities warning of further disruption.
Raw sewage discharged after this month's failure of Wellington's main wastewater treatment plant in a storm was washed back onto the south coast by the weekend storm, in an incident some residents called a "poonami" on social media.
A low-pressure system east of the North Island has battered several regions since the weekend, bringing heavy rain and severe gales. A man was found dead on Saturday in a submerged vehicle on a highway.
The storm follows six deaths last month in a landslide triggered by heavy rains at Mount Maunganui on the North Island's east coast, bringing down soil and rubble on a site crowded with families on summer holidays.

North Korea builds homes for kin of troops killed in Ukraine
February 16, 2026North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inaugurated a new housing district in Pyongyang for the families of troops who died in overseas military operations, state news agency KCNA reported on Monday.
The new district symbolizes "spirit and sacrifice" of the dead troops, Kim said in a speech, adding that the homes would allow the bereaved families to "take pride in their sons and husbands and live happily."
He further pledged to repay the "young martyrs" who "sacrificed all to their motherland."
Images released by the news agency show the North Korean leader and his daughter, Kim Ju Ae, consoling families of the fallen soldiers while visiting their new homes.
North Korea has sent around 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian troops against Ukraine. Over 6,000 of those soldiers were killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, as per South Korean, Ukrainian and Western estimates.
Kim seeks to appease public
Pyongyang has conducted several public ceremonies over the last few months to honor the fallen soldiers, including a museum and a memorial complex featuring sculptures of troops.
Analysts see the public ceremonies as a way to promote unity and quash potential public discontent stemming from lives lost in a foreign war.
The new housing district comes ahead fo the Ninth Congress of the ruling Workers' Party, which will convene in late February.
The gathering is meant to showcase Kim's achievements and outline his goals for domestic and foreign policy for the next five years.

BELGOROD, February 16. /TASS/. The Ukrainian military attacked settlements in the Belgorod Region with more than 80 UAVs and fired more than 10 munitions over the past day, the region’s operational command said on its Telegram channel.
"In the Belgorodsky district, the settlements of Malinovka, Oktyabrsky, Razumoye, Nikolskoye, Tavrovo, and the farmstead of Tserkovny were attacked by 15 drones, 12 of which were shot down and destroyed. In the village of Nikolskoye, a man was injured when a drone attacked a car," the operational command wrote. It added that the munition strikes damaged infrastructure, while UAV attacks hit a private house and a power line.
Belgorod came under heavy rocket fire and an attack by a fixed-wing drone, which damaged energy infrastructure facilities and one apartment in a multi-family building. The Ukrainian military launched five UAVs in the Borisovsky district, hitting a car, and one fixed-wing drone in the Valuysky district, with no consequences reported. In the Volokonovsky district, a private house was damaged in attacks involving FPV drones and four other UAVs.
Settlements in the Grayvoronsky district were attacked with 20 drones, damaging five private houses, a power line, an outbuilding, and a social facility. The Krasnoyaruzhsky district was targeted with 15 munitions and 16 UAVs, with no consequences reported. One UAV struck the village of Rakitnoye, damaging a private home.
The Shebekinsky district came under attack from 23 UAVs and one munition, damaging a commercial facility, two infrastructure sites, four private houses, and two power lines. According to the operational command, some residents are temporarily without power, and emergency crews will begin restoration work after coordinating with the Russian Defense Ministry.

Political parties start waking up to the power of the expat vote
Robin PascoeHundreds of thousands of non-Dutch nationals can take part in next month’s local council elections and political parties are starting to wake up to the potential impact of so many additional voters.
Several political debates in English are being planned and there are signs that parties are also publishing more information in other languages too.
Turnout always hovers around 50% in most parts of the country in local elections, but many people who can vote are not aware of the fact. In a recent Dutch News survey, nearly one in five respondents said they did not know if they could vote in the local elections, even though many of them could.
Dutch nationals, EU nationals, and other foreign nationals who have officially lived in the Netherlands for at least five years will automatically be sent a voting card for the March 18 vote and have until March 13 to protest if they have not received one.
As the size of the international population grows, it is becoming more of a political force to be reckoned with. In Amsterdam, for example, international voters could effectively control five or six seats on the city council, given the size of the local expat population.
The situation is similar in The Hague, where 16% of potential voters are not Dutch nationals, and in Maastricht, Rotterdam, Amstelveen and Delft, where around 10% of potential voters have another nationality.
Under European law, local authorities are required to actively inform foreign nationals about their right to vote, but in practice Dutch towns and cities are reluctant to do anything which could be interpreted as favouring one population group over another.
Little has happened since the last local elections, despite a lot of hand-wringing about the low turnout, and local councils are still largely taking a passive approach.
Floris Vermeulen, associate professor at the University of Amsterdam and a specialist in migrants and voting, says the lack of interest is partly down to the political climate, in which backing the rights of certain groups, such as migrants, does not win votes.
“We’ve had a lot of contact with The Hague city council, for example, and they have told us explicitly that they are not doing anything special about this issue,” he said.
Political debates
Nevertheless, there are signs that local branches of the national parties are becoming more proactive in their approach to foreign voters. Political parties in Amsterdam, The Hague and several other towns and cities are organising events where international residents can come along and find out more about voting and the various party policies.
In Amsterdam, five parties of the biggest city parties will hold an English language debate on March 9, sponsored by Dutch News and IamExpat.
In The Hague, no less than three events are being planned: The Hague Municipal Election Debate will take place on February 24, a second event is being held on March 10 at The Hague Tech while the Student & Stand Debate is on March 5.
In Eindhoven, university students have organised their own information guide for students and staff because “many of them had no idea they could vote” while Groningen will host a debate featuring nine political parties on February 24.
Online information
Local parties are also publishing information about their policies in English, although it is too early in the campaign to say if the trend is upwards. In 2022, around half the parties did so.
In Amstelveen, for example, the CDA has published information about their local campaign in English.
In The Hague, populist party Hart voor Den Haag gives website visitors an option to choose their language, although this was not operational at press time, while in Leiden, seven of the 11 parties registered by early February had English information available. Maastricht had a similar high percentage.
Of the main political parties, the VVD is trailing when it comes to English information, with several local party websites containing broken links to English-language pages, according to Dutch News research involving 10 key cities.
More than half the Dutch News readers who took part in the recent website survey said they would like to be more involved in local politics, although several blamed their own lack of Dutch for not being better informed.
“Local politics is where change really begins, where citizens are directly affected,” said one. “I wish there was an easier way to stay informed about local politics in my area.”

Ukraine’s ex-energy minister Halushchenko charged in “Midas” case

Ukraine’s ex-energy minister Halushchenko charged in “Midas” case
This was reported on Telegram by the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), according to Ukrinform.
“Under the procedural guidance of a SAPO prosecutor, NABU detectives have issued a new suspicion in the ‘Midas’ case. It concerns the former Minister of Energy of Ukraine (2021–2025). He is accused of money laundering and participation in a criminal organization,” the statement said.
Halushchenko was charged under Part 2 of Article 255 and Part 3 of Article 209 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
According to the investigation, in February 2021, on the island of Anguilla (a self-governing British overseas territory), a fund was registered at the initiative of members of a criminal organization exposed by the NABU and SAPO in November 2025. The fund was intended to raise approximately $100 million in “investments.”
“The fund was headed by a long-time acquaintance of the criminal group, a citizen of the Seychelles and Saint Kitts and Nevis, who professionally provided money-laundering services for proceeds of crime.” The suspect’s family was listed among the fund’s “investors,” the SAPO added.
To conceal Halushchenko’s involvement, two companies were created in the Marshall Islands, integrated into a trust registered in Saint Kitts and Nevis. The companies’ beneficiaries were listed as the former spouse and four children of the official. These companies then “invested” in the fund by purchasing its shares, and members of the criminal organization transferred funds to the fund’s accounts in three Swiss banks on behalf of the suspect.
Evidence obtained in Ukraine, as well as through international cooperation with authorities in several countries, indicates that during Halushchenko’s tenure, through a trusted associate known as “Rocket,” the criminal organization received over $112 million in cash from illegal activities in the energy sector.
According to the SAPO, these funds were laundered through various financial instruments, including cryptocurrency and “investments” in the fund.
It has been established that over $7.4 million was transferred to the fund’s accounts managed by the suspect’s family. More than 1.3 million Swiss francs and 2.4 million euros were handed over in cash or transferred directly to the family in Switzerland.
Some of these funds were used to pay for the children’s education at prestigious Swiss institutions and deposited in the former spouse’s accounts. The remainder was placed in deposits, generating additional income for the family and covering personal expenses.
The agency noted that the investigation is ongoing. The NABU is cooperating with authorities in 15 countries in connection with these facts.
Earlier, Ukrinform reported that on February 15, the NABU detained the former minister at the border.
On November 10, the NABU announced a special operation exposing corruption in the energy sector. The investigation found that the criminal organization had established a large-scale scheme to influence strategic state-owned enterprises, including Energoatom.
A law enforcement source confirmed that the NABU conducted searches at the offices of businessman and co-owner of the Kvartal 95 studio, Tymur Mindich, as well as at Minister of Justice German Halushchenko, who previously served as Minister of Energy.
The Ministry of Justice later confirmed that investigative actions involving Halushchenko were carried out within the framework of the criminal proceedings.
The NABU stated that five of seven suspects have been detained. Among them are a businessman considered the leader of the criminal organization, a former energy ministry adviser, and the executive director for physical protection and security at Energoatom.

Accused Bondi Beach gunman makes 1st court appearance
24-year-old Naveed Akram appears via video link after allegedly carrying out Australia’s deadliest attack in December last year
ISTANBUL
A man accused of opening fire on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia in December appeared in court via video link Monday, local broadcaster SBS News reported.
Naveed Akram, 24, was speaking from the Goulburn Correctional Centre, a maximum-security prison southwest of Sydney. He faces 59 charges, including murder and terrorism-related offences.
Akram is alleged to have carried out Australia’s deadliest attack on Dec. 14 2025, when 15 people were killed and 42 injured during Hanukkah celebrations by the beach.
His father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was fatally shot by police during the incident.
Akram spoke after a magistrate extended suppression orders shielding victims and survivors who have not publicly identified themselves.
"Did you just hear what I just said?" Deputy Chief Magistrate Sharon Freund asked him.
"Yeah," Akram replied.
Later, his legal aid solicitor, Ben Archibold, requested time to consult with his client.
"Mr. Akram, your solicitor is going to give you a call after," the magistrate said.
"Yep," the accused gunman replied.
Akram wore a green prison-issued jumper and sat with his hands resting in his lap during the otherwise routine court mention.
After speaking with his client, Archibold told reporters outside court that Akram was coping as well as could be expected in Goulburn’s super-maximum-security prison.
"Everyone knows that (Goulburn's) supermax has very onerous conditions, and that's where people who (allegedly) commit these crimes are," he said.
Archibold said it was premature to signal any intended pleas.
He said discussions with his client Monday and previously at the prison had not covered the attack or any expression of remorse and prosecutors had not yet provided the brief of evidence.
Expecting the brief before the next court date on April 8, Archibold said the legal process could extend into 2027.
"When we have the brief, I'll have more to say," he told reporters.

Flights cancelled and 30,000 without power as freak storm brings 193kmph winds to New Zealand
‘Extremely unusual’ wind gust of 193kmph recorded in Wellington overnight

A man has died, flights have been cancelled and major roads closed after strong winds and heavy rain battered New Zealand’s lower North Island, forcing evacuations and cutting power to thousands.
An “extremely unusual” wind gust of 193kmph was recorded in Wellington overnight, local media reported. Falling trees caused damage to homes and blocked major roads.
More than 30,000 properties lost power across the region, including about 10,000 customers in Wellington, the authorities said.
Most flights arriving and departing from Wellington, the nation’s capital, were cancelled or delayed on the morning of 16 February, the airport said. Air New Zealand paused operations at Wellington, Napier and Palmerston North airports.
A mudslide trapped 20 vehicles on Turakina Valley Rd in the Rangitikei District, leaving drivers stranded until crews were able to clear the road, according to the New Zealand Herald.
Several other major routes, including parts of State Highway 1, were also shut as floodwaters and debris made travel unsafe.
Train services across the region were suspended, and Cook Strait ferry crossings were cancelled, disrupting travel plans for hundreds of passengers.
States of emergency have been declared in Otorohanga, Waipa, Tararua, Rangitikei and Manawatu districts.
Heavy rain warnings remain in place for parts of the North Island and the upper South Island, as communities brace for more downpours and assess the damage already left behind.
In Lower Hutt, about 7,000 homes were still without electricity by mid-morning on Monday. Hutt City Council warned residents to stay vigilant until around 6.00pm and to avoid waterways and low-lying coastal areas.
Waiwhetu Stream had earlier burst its banks, but levels were starting to fall, authorities said.
In Stokes Valley, a local resident Teresa Hayes said volunteers struggled to remove floodwater from her home.
“We were ankle-deep at one point,” she said. Despite the damage, she remained hopeful. “We are pretty lucky in the grand scheme of things. We are safe. That’s the main thing.”
In western Waikato, civil defence controller Wayne Allan described the storm as short, sharp and with intensity which varied significantly across the region.
He said: “In terms of numbers of impacted people, our primary focus has to be Pirongia’s water supply,” he said.
“The supply is fragile and relies on a single pipe to support an entire community. Water tankers are a contingency option but the least impact on households will be to reduce water use and make the reduced supply last.
“We have seen an increase in water use in the last 24 hours, and we’re monitoring it – we urge the community to keep the savings going.”
Emergency New Zealand Assistant National Commander Ken Cooper said: “We had a very busy night, and our firefighters are continuing to respond to calls.”
Fire and Emergency New Zealand received 852 emergency calls across the North Island overnight, authorities said in a statement. Most calls were linked to storm damage such as fallen trees, downed powerlines and damaged roofs, the statement said.
More than half of the calls came from the Wellington region as the storm tracked south, but nearly the entire North Island – except Northland – reported damage or flooding, Mr Cooper said.
Photos shared online showed semi-rural neighbourhoods underwater, homes swamped by flooding, and sections of road left collapsed and torn apart after the waters receded.
Sunday’s night’s storm follows a period of bad weather that has already claimed one life. Brent Knowles, described by locals as a “loving father”, died when his vehicle became submerged in floodwaters on State Highway 39 on Friday.
The latest deluge comes just a few weeks after deadly storms killed nine people and left widespread destruction.
MetService meteorologist Mmathapelo Makgabutlane told Stuff that the storm was tracking south, with eastern parts of South Island next in line for severe weather.
Heavy rain warnings have been issued for the Kaikoura district and Canterbury north of Amberley until 9.00pm on Monday, and for Banks Peninsula until 6.00pm on Tuesday.
Christchurch City Council has urged residents in Christchurch and across Canterbury to prepare for persistent overnight rain, with between 150mm and 250mm forecast to fall by 10.00am Tuesday local time.

Arrested retirees ‘vindicated’ by ruling against Palestine Action proscription

Retirees making up some of the nearly 3,000 people arrested for supporting Palestine Action since the organisation was proscribed have said they feel “vindicated” by the high court’s decision to overturn the ban this week.
However, uncertainty remains over whether their trials under terror laws may still go ahead after the government revealed it plans to appeal against the judgment made on Friday by three of the UK’s most senior judges.
A former army colonel and ex-military attache, Chris Romberg, who was yet to enter a plea after his Palestine Action arrest last August, said he was “pleased and satisfied that this proscription, which we knew was illegitimate, has now been shown to be unlawful as well”.
Since July last year, police have arrested at least 2,787 people across the UK for holding signs displaying statements such as “I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action”, according to the civil liberties organisation Defend Our Juries.
In a written judgment, Dame Victoria Sharp, president of the king’s bench division, ruled the proscription of Palestine Action was unlawful on two grounds: breaching human rights laws and the home secretary’s own proscription policy requiring the government to take into account the genuine threat to the UK posed by the group.
While the ban was overturned by the court in principle, Sharp said she would hear from both sides before issuing an order to remove the proscription while the appeal process was in place.
The Metropolitan police said on Friday that, as a result of the decision, officers would cease arresting people expressing support for the organisation, but would continue to gather evidence at protests.
Trisha Fine, who was arrested in Cardiff and spent 27 hours in police custody – during which officers failed to tell her husband what had happened to her – described the ruling as “good news, but with big reservations”.
“Quite a lot of friends have got in touch to say: ‘Yay, aren’t you lucky it’s all over?’ It bloody isn’t. It seems like our jolly government has got all the cards in their hands.”
Richard Whitmore-Jones, who was arrested on 9 August last year at a silent vigil in Parliament Square, said celebration had given way to caution. “Obviously yesterday was such a good day, we were all ecstatic that the prescription ban was overturned, but I think today I’m feeling a little bit more circumspect about what might happen in future with the appeal.”
Father John McGowan, a Catholic priest arrested at the same protest, said he “would have been really upset had the judgment gone against us”. “So yes I’m pleased, I’m very pleased,” he said.
He was, however, “angry at the government, and even angrier now that they should want to appeal”.
“They do not seem to understand the anger of probably the majority of British people at them for supporting Israel. If they want to know the reason why they’re unpopular, this is one of them. Their unconditional support for Israel,” said McGowan, who lived in Jerusalem for five years.
For McGowan, it was clear the government was “on the wrong side of history” and he said “it just struck me how out of touch the government is with the people in this country”.
Romberg, a member of Holocaust Survivors and Descendants against the Gaza Genocide, said he thought the Palestine Action ban had come about due to “the type of political class we have now, which doesn’t seem to believe in anything”.
“We have a government that seems to have given up on its values, on its liberties, on rights, happy to turn on its own people, and even to lie, and it hasn’t worked for them,” he said. “It may go to the supreme court, but whatever happens, this has been a big blow for the government because their credibility, I think, is completely shot.”
He was pleased that “lots of talk about secret evidence that would definitely prove that [Palestine Action] should be banned as a terrorist organisation hasn’t convinced the judges”.
Whitmore-Jones lamented the saga’s cost to the public purse, money which he thought could be put to better use. “It’s clearly just a disgraceful waste of money to keep arresting people for this and putting them in prison and holding people on remand for excessive periods,” he said. “It’s just unconstitutional and disgraceful.”
All those with outstanding charges or an open police investigation remain in limbo while the appeals process takes place. It is not clear yet whether they may still have to stand trial on terror charges.
Whitmore-Jones, who was arrested six times and has so far pleaded not guilty to the first of the charges, joked that he still had “a number of bad-boy appointments at magistrates courts”. On Friday, he received a summons to a plea hearing through the post while he was away celebrating the high court’s decision outside the Royal Courts of Justice.
All the arrestees the Guardian spoke to said they would repeat their actions, apart from Fine, who said: “I’m not sure that I would.
“I want to get my life back. I’ve had enough,” added Fine, who was denied antibiotics she needed for a serious gum infection while in custody, and was subjected to a travel ban which made it difficult to go away with her husband who was recovering from cancer treatment.
“I’d do it all over again, no question,” said McGowan. Whitmore-Jones echoed the sentiment adding, “in a heartbeat”.
McGowan added: “And if I have to go to prison, I would do so. I could justify it to my conscience. It isn’t an easy thing to do, to break the law, to get arrested, but I’d be willing to do it over again. It’s just an inconvenience to me, compared to what people are going through in Gaza.”
They all also spoke about their frustration that while all this was going on, Israel continued to kill Palestinians in large numbers as part of a continuing genocide. Whitmore-Jones said: “I’m concerned that all this fiddling around with the law doesn’t prevent civilians being killed in Palestine.”
He added: “At least one child is being murdered every day in Gaza. I think yesterday there were 30 or 40 people killed. People are dying from cold, lack of medicine, and they’re being killed by munitions. And our country is supporting it. I’m just horrified.
“I’ve just been talking to my grandchildren and I came out with this rather trashy quote that bad things happen when good people stand around and allow it to happen. And that’s exactly the situation that we’re in.”

‘Life requires cash’: Gaza’s jobs crisis leaves people struggling to afford basics

Every morning, Mansour Mohammad Bakr sets out from the small rented room in Gaza City he shares with his pregnant wife and two very young daughters. The 23-year-old walks past the port and the breaking waves of the Mediterranean where he once earned his living.
Before the two-year war that devastated Gaza, Bakr was a fisher, sharing tackle and a boat with his father and brothers. Now his brothers are dead, his father is too old, and his equipment was destroyed during the conflict. Like hundreds of thousands of others across Gaza, Bakr needs a job.
“Money is the main means of survival in Gaza … without it, a person cannot do anything,” he says. “The limited aid that reaches us doesn’t replace our need for money in any way and doesn’t cover even the most basic living requirements.”
Humanitarian organisations have ramped up distribution since October, when a ceasefire agreement came into effect, leading Israel to lift some of the heavy restrictions it had imposed on aid and easing its delivery within Gaza.
In January, United Nations agencies and their partners reached approximately 1.6 million people with household-level general food assistance. World Central Kitchen, an NGO, is now serving 1 million hot meals a day. But such assistance remains vastly insufficient and still covers only basic necessities. For everything else, brought in by the private sector, Palestinians in Gaza need cash.
Aid workers in Gaza say more fresh fruit, vegetables, meat, clothes and household items are now available, but at exorbitant prices. “There has been a huge increase in commercial supplies … but it is all very expensive,” says Kate Charlton, a Médecins Sans Frontières medical coordinator in Gaza City.
Mohammed al-Far, a 55-year-old former trader who lives with his family in al-Mawasi, a coastal area crowded with tent encampments for the displaced, says they receive only one meal a day from aid organisations.
“It’s either rice, lentils or beans, and once or twice a week, some meat. Life requires cash to go on. We can get enough to eat … but transportation, haircuts, charging mobile phones and buying vegetables and fruit all require money,” he says.
Al-Far has tried to launch falafel and sweets businesses, but without success, and has run up substantial debts. His age now makes it harder to find work.
“My health is still good, and I’m ready to do anything, but employers are looking for younger workers. I have been searching for months and months … I walk around the market looking for work, but without success,” he says.
The problem for al-Far and Bakr, as for all the others seeking work in Gaza, is that there is virtually none. The official unemployment rate, estimated by the UN, is 80% and the economy has shrunk to 13% of its former size.
In November, Pedro Manuel Moreno, the deputy secretary general of the UN’s trade and development agency, said the war had “wiped out decades of progress”. “Gaza is going through the fastest and most damaging economic collapse ever recorded,” he said.
The UN agency’s data shows that in 2024, GDP per capita in Gaza fell to just $161 (£118) a year – among the lowest in the world. The Israeli offensive shattered sanitation, transport, power and health systems, ruined fields and greenhouses and decimated Gaza’s fishing industry, which once employed thousands.
Bakr says: “I dream of returning to the sea and to the profession of fishing, and of being able one day to buy a fishing boat like the one I used to own, so I can provide my family with food, drink, clothing and medicine.”
The October ceasefire agreement was supposed to lead swiftly to reconstruction but progress has largely stalled. Some elements of the agreement have advanced, including the return of all hostages and limited reopening of the Rafah border crossing. Plans for an international stabilisation force are also emerging, with Indonesia saying it is preparing thousands of troops for humanitarian and reconstruction roles.
But Hamas, which controls most of the coastal area where almost all of the 2.3 million-strong population of Gaza now live, is reluctant to fully disarm and Israel appears unwilling to relinquish its control over more than half of the territory.
Israel has blocked the new technocratic administration that was to govern Gaza under Donald Trump’s “peace plan” from entering, while key crossing points remain shut or subject to restrictions.
Even if Bakr could somehow find and equip a new boat, limits imposed by Israel at sea would prevent him from practising his trade.
“My work as a fisher in the sea of Gaza was passed down to us from our grandfathers. I left school young and fishing is all I’ve ever done. I have been searching for work … everywhere I can,” he says.
Even those with advanced qualifications struggle amid the ruins and rubble. Bisan Mohammad graduated with a degree in medical laboratory sciences just months before the war in Gaza was triggered by a Hamas raid into Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and led to 250 being taken hostage by the militant Islamist organisation.
Her husband, a security guard, was killed in the early days of the war, leaving her alone to provide for their daughter. She now lives in a tent with her parents in Nuseirat, in central Gaza.
“I began looking for any available job but without success … everything needs money; even water, food and bedding all require cash. Sometimes I feel that even breathing needs money,” says Mohammad, 23.
Violence has continued since the ceasefire and Israel launched more attacks in Gaza in January than in any month since October, according to Acled, an independent US-based conflict monitor. Gaza health authorities say 586 Palestinians have been killed since the truce took effect, bringing the war’s overall death toll to more than 72,000, mostly civilians.
“What is being called a ‘ceasefire’ hasn’t changed our reality; in fact, it has made it worse,” says Mohammad. “The media has stopped talking about the ongoing killing … while the bombardment continues … prices keep rising, and even basic necessities, when available, such as water and food, are barely sufficient.
“I don’t think about the future and I don’t try to; thinking about it is exhausting and frightening, and the future is unclear. I don’t know what will happen to me or my daughter if this situation continues without work or income.”

Provence in bloom – exploring its flower festivals and the ‘perfume capital of the world’

As I take my seat in Galimard’s Studio des Fragrances, in the Provençal town of Grasse, I limber up my nostrils for the task ahead: to create my own scent from the 126 bottles in front of me. Together they represent a world of exotic aromas, from amber and musk to ginger and saffron. But given that I have left the grey British winter behind to come here, I am more interested in capturing the sunny essence of the Côte d’Azur.
Here in the hills north of Cannes, the colours pop: hillsides are full of bright yellow mimosa flowers, violets are peeping out of flowerbeds and oranges hang heavy on branches over garden walls, even though it’s not yet spring. It is the perfect antidote to the gloom back home, and the chance to bottle these very scents is a joy.
Over the next two hours, with the help of perfumery expert Manon Zamoun, I blend my own perfume that I name “Mimosa trail”. The scents (natural essences or synthetic aromas), are set out on three shelves, the top shelf for the high notes, the bottom for base notes, with the heart notes in between. I sniff, blend and decant; it’s the most rewarding chemistry lesson of my life.
The bottles’ labels are turned away from me so my choices are led by my nose not my brain. I’m surprised to find I liked parma violets and patchouli, while rose d’orient and fleurs de lilas don’t make the cut.
Galimard is Grasse’s oldest perfume house, established in 1747. The trade grew out of the town’s leather tanning industry; with scents created to cover the pong, it became the “perfume capital of the world”. Its other two famous perfume houses, Molinard and Fragonard, opened in 1849 and 1926 respectively, later joined by big names such as Dior, Guérlain and Chanel.
But beyond perfume, Grasse is a delight to wander – a maze of yellow-hued streets, overlooked by towering palm trees and, today at least, a welcome blue sky, though there’s still a little chill in the air. I take comfort in the fact it’s 10 degrees warmer than it is back home because I’m here to fast-forward spring with a short road trip between the lesser-known villages and towns of the Côte d’Azur.
En route to Grasse, I’d stopped at Tourrettes-sur-Loup for another of the region’s flowers: violets. When seen from the south, the village is a jumble of terracotta-roofed houses clinging to a clifftop. It’s known for its tradition of growing the small, purple blooms, and has supplied the perfume industry since Queen Victoria visited in the late 19th century while wintering in Nice, 18 miles (30km) south west of here. The queen gave her name to the variety that was, in her day, cultivated by 40 families in Tourrettes and, thanks to its long stalk, was traditionally given in small posies between Christmas and Valentine’s Day.
At La Bastide aux Violettes, a small museum on the outskirts of the village, I discover more about the flower and its history, and inhale its sweet, delicate scent in the greenhouse, where they grow in vertical columns. There are now only three producers, including Jérôme Coche and his family, who turn the petals into products such as crystalised violet sweets. The village still celebrates the end of the season with La Fête des Violettes in late February/early March, which attracts about 12,000 people (some on coach trips from Italy) with carnival floats, dancing, music and a flower and produce market.
Out of season the village is quieter, awaiting the summer crowds. Wine bar-restaurant La Cave de Tourrettes is buzzing with life though, even on a wet Wednesday evening, and my two-course meal is a superb beef tartare with grana padano, caper berries and cornichons, followed by pork filet mignon and orange-scented sweet potato with braised leeks (mains from €25.50). The next morning, the sky is a blaze of blue and I eat breakfast on the balcony of my townhouse apartment, with a lovely view of the valley towards the Mediterranean.
The sun is also shining in Mandelieu-la-Napoule, on the coast, my last stop. Mimosas were just starting to come into bloom on the dramatic route between Tourrettes and the village of Gourdon, which winds through the Gorge du Loup, with its waterfalls, tunnels and steep cliffs – but down on the coast, spring has really sprung.
La Route du Mimosa is a trail through the most impressive blooms, covering 80 miles from Bormes-les-Mimosas to Grasse. Around the town of Mandelieu-la-Napoule – which hosts the Fête du Mimosa, a weekend of celebrations to mark the start of the season in February – there are group hikes into the hills organised by the tourist office, as well as farms to visit and shops where producers have turned its delicate flavour into jams and cordials, and its scent into candles and soaps.
For a thrilling ride and to gain some local knowledge I’ve booked a three-hour tour with La Grande Vadrouille (€160 for one or two). Local guide Daniel Saffioti welcomes me to ride in the side-car of his Chang Jiang Pekin Express motorbike. Daniel knows all the best routes from Mandelieu to Tanneron, a town farther inland where you find mimosas in abundance. After donning my helmet and sunglasses, we set off along the coast road, La Corniche d’Or.
This sinuous route southward to the Cap d’Esterel offers astonishing views of Cannes and its backdrop, the snow-capped Mercantour mountains of the Alpes-Maritimes. Along the road, mimosas burst between palm trees and over the garden walls of luxurious villasWe double back toward Mandelieu, and then motor on into the hills, stopping for a rest just outside Tanneron, where the landscape is a tapestry of olive groves, eucalyptus trees and lavender fields awaiting their summer blooms. A closer inspection of a mimosa tree allows me to breath in its delicate scent and see its fern-like leaves and tiny flowers up close – like little yellow pompoms electrified by the sunshine. Daniel tells me how they were introduced by the British, having been brought from Australia (they are a kind of acacia) and how council workers work hard to keep them from taking over the landscape and roadsides, such is their propensity to thrive in the Provençal climate.
Our tour finishes in Mandelieu and after bidding Daniel farewell, I sit on the terrace of the Biskota cafe for lunch and a mimosa-infused lemonade. In the evening is the opening of the Fête du Mimosa. Gingham-clothed tables and benches are laid out for locals to sit and drink wine and street performers, some on stilts, dance through the crowds. Tomorrow there will be floats adorned with flowers, but tonight a firework display shoots up over the crenellated walls of the waterside chateau. I breath in the sulphurous tang that hangs in the air; it may not be the floral scent of spring, but it doesn’t matter – I’ve got a bottle of that in my bag.
The trip was provided by Côte d’Azur Tourism and Mandelieu-La-Napoule Tourism. La Borgarda in Tourrettes-sur-Loup has a one-bedroom apartment from €195 a night and a three-bedroom townhouse from €330 a night. The Pullman hotel has doubles from £130. Perfume blending at Galimard’ Studio des Fragrances is €99pp

Why did I get a £100 parking fine when charging my electric car?

I charged my electric car at the 24-hour Mer EV charging station in my local B&Q car park.
I then received a £100 parking charge notice (PCN) from the car park operator, Ocean Parking. It said no parking is allowed on the site between 9pm and 6am.
There were no signs on the EV charger explaining this, but Ocean has rejected my representation. Mer apologised for the “inconvenience”, but it will not help.
DT, Redhill, Surrey
This is one of the most farcical parking disputes I’ve come across. Mer’s website advertises the EV charger as a 24-hour facility. Signs at the entrance to Redhill retail park state, in large letters, that free parking for up to two hours is allowed. Smaller print beneath this says that terms and conditions apply.
It’s these terms and conditions that Ocean is relying on, and they are not printed on the entrance signs, or on the sign behind the EV charger.
The latter notice bears a line, in a tiny font, obscured by the cable frame, advising drivers to check any parking restrictions. These restrictions are detailed on separate signs around the car park.
I began with Mer. It was defensive, insisting that the sign on its charger was adequate, but admitted that the 24-hour promise on its website had caused “confusion”. It has now amended the website. Ocean’s defence was that it had no idea that the charger was in operation until I got in touch, and it had therefore assumed you were merely parking.
This is unconvincing. You had detailed in your representation that you were using the charger at the time, and Ocean’s rejection letter stated users of the charger are not exempt from parking restrictions.
I jogged Ocean’s memory, but it doubled down. “We maintain that the parking charges were issued correctly under the published conditions,” it said.
“However, given that signage in the immediate charging area only met the minimum standard, and Ocean Parking pride themselves on exceeding that, we have taken a pragmatic and fair‑minded approach: all outstanding PCNs relating to that specific location were cancelled, appeals were upheld, and refunds were offered to motorists who had already paid.”
In Leicestershire, CH is also caught in the tentacles of a private parking operator after stopping on a road in a business park to drink a cup of coffee. He was slapped with a £100 PCN by Euro Parking Services for parking on “double yellow lines/crosshatched bay” in a “restricted area”. He appealed and was asked to provide evidence that the restrictions were invisibly advertised. So back he went to the site to take photographs.
EPS’s response was to fire off another £100 PCN. The CCTV photos attached to this second PCN show him craning to snap a tiny sign, with tiny print, mounted on a pole at least three metres (10ft) high. The photos also show that there are no yellow lines or hatchings on the road.
EPS is a member of the trade body International Parking Community (IPC), whose code of practice requires signs to be conspicuous and legible. Member firms must also allow drivers a five-minute grace period to check for parking restrictions.
The sign in EPS’s own photos is manifestly not conspicuous nor legible, and its PCN confirms he was on site for 75 seconds, yet EPS refused to cancel either PCN.
EPS relented over the second charge when I questioned it, but insisted on upholding the first. “We recognise that drivers need to be able to read and, if necessary, photograph signs in order to submit a representation, and it is not our policy to penalise motorists for doing so,” said the firm which had done exactly that
We are reviewing the signage at this site to ensure that it is clear, legible and appropriately positioned for all drivers,” it said.
CH can appeal to the IPC, but if he loses, he also loses an early payment discount of £40.

How Israel's war is reshaping birth, life and loss in Gaza

A demographic collapse: How Israel's genocide has driven miscarriages and birth defects across Gaza
After two years of genocide in the Gaza Strip, experts say the enclave has experienced demographic destruction, a systematic, deliberate, or structural reduction of the population caused by Israel's relentless and never-ending violence.
The human cost of this demographic destruction is visible in many ways: Gaza's population pyramid has been distorted by falling birth rates, rising miscarriages, congenital abnormalities, and intrauterine deaths (stillbirths) — all worsened by inadequate healthcare for pregnant women.
This is expected to persist for years as a vast majority of Gaza's healthcare infrastructure has been damaged, destroyed, or rendered non-functional due to Israeli violence since October 2023.
The impact goes beyond immediate health outcomes. The decline in birth rates and the rise in miscarriages carry long-term social, psychological and health consequences that will affect future generations and the structure of a society in which children account for 47% of the population, according to official data.
For Palestinian researchers, these shifts are neither accidental nor temporary.
Rami al-Shaqra, head of the Palestine Institute for Strategic Studies, told The New Arab that the drop in births was not natural, but caused by the destruction of hospitals, lack of healthcare, and the starvation of pregnant women. He warned this would create a clear generational gap in the years ahead.
Rami explained that Israel was betting on breaking Palestinians demographically, while Palestinians were betting on survival and rebuilding generation after generation.
"History so far has stood with the Palestinian bet," he shared.
He added that the demographic imbalance extends beyond health, affecting the wider structure of society through family disintegration, a rise in the number of orphans, and distortion of the age composition, and while these effects are significant and long-term, they are not inevitable.
However, Rami believes that recovery is possible through deliberate social and health policies, intensive care for orphans, rebuilding education and empowering affected families.
"Recovery is not immediate, but it is possible and depends on rebuilding the health sector, supporting women psychologically and socially, and creating a minimum level of safety and stability," he said.
Temporary recovery
According to data from the information systems unit at the Palestinian Health Ministry, obtained by The New Arab, birth rates clearly increased during periods of calm and relative stability, despite the sharp decline during the two war years, when births fell by between 20% and 42% compared with previous years.
That said, in 2025, the unit recorded 48,600 births, resulting in 49,267 live births including twins — a 20% decline compared with pre-war levels, when 54,700 births were recorded in 2022.
The decline was sharper in 2024, with 38,000 births — a 42% drop compared with pre-war years — but after the January 2025 ceasefire, the situation began to improve, with pregnancies recorded later that year indicating that stability encourages higher birth rates.
Zaher al-Wahidi, head of the information unit at the Gaza Health Ministry, told The New Arab that the unit recorded 4,900 babies born at normal weight — defined by the ministry as 2.5kg — a 60% increase compared with pre-war figures.
The unit also recorded 4,000 premature births and around 5,000 registered miscarriages, though the actual number is likely higher, as some women did not seek care at health centres or miscarried in tents and homes.
Zaher said intrauterine deaths reached 611 cases, compared with 327 in 2022, an increase of 47%. Congenital abnormalities also rose, reaching 315 cases — including holes in the heart, bladder and genital organs — up from 184 cases in 2022, an increase of 58%. In addition, 452 newborns died in the first week after birth in 2025.
Ceasefire doesn't mean safety
It is important to note that even with a ceasefire in place, the effects of the war on pregnant women continue, with clinics reporting persistently high rates of miscarriages, premature births and intrauterine deaths.
Nagham Shahin, six months pregnant, was hoping to learn the sex of her foetus during a routine check-up when doctors discovered congenital abnormalities and fluid around the abdomen.
Her husband told The New Arab: "The news was shocking and affected her psychological state."
He added that the complications were likely linked to the most recent Israeli military operation in Gaza City, during which the family was displaced without vehicles and nearby areas were shelled, forcing repeated evacuations and constant fear.
With only three months remaining until delivery, the prospect of a baby being born with deformities was particularly difficult.
A Palestinian woman, Hiba Lafi, also said she had not planned to become pregnant, but when she did, the pregnancy initially progressed normally until a third-month check-up revealed a molar pregnancy outside the uterus, forcing her to have an abortion. Upon further tests, doctors advised her not to become pregnant for a year.
Hiba, who had four children before the war, explained that she had never experienced similar problems before, and that heavy shelling near her home in Shujaiya in October 2023 caused severe psychological stress and breathing difficulties, leading to hospitalisation.
She added that witnessing the killing of children and the struggle to protect them during the genocide made her avoid pregnancy.
However, during the ceasefire in October 2025, she became pregnant again, only to face an ectopic pregnancy that left her unable to sleep for days.
As for pregnant women living near the so-called 'yellow line', which refers to Israeli-designated military zones and buffer areas inside the Gaza Strip, they also continue to face insecurity.
Safa Sami Saad, for example, was severely affected when an explosive-laden vehicle detonated near her displacement area at the Shujaiya junction, three days before she developed complications in her pregnancy.
Her husband told The New Arab that she "screamed in fear, then developed influenza and complications."
Medical examinations later showed the foetus had died in the womb, forcing an abortion. He said it was a shock, particularly as the foetus had been in good condition before the blast, and Safa, who was four months pregnant, had not faced similar problems before the war.
At a primary healthcare centre in al-Daraj, Gaza City, conditions also remain dire. The centre is overcrowded, with pregnant women and those bringing newborns for vaccinations filling seats in corridors, outside doctors' rooms and waiting areas from early morning, while services remain severely constrained.
Reham Hijazi, director of the al-Daraj Primary Health Care Centre, said recent ultrasounds showed an increase in foetal abnormalities, including missing heads and heart deformities, as well as foetal loss in late pregnancy for unknown reasons.
"Mothers are suffering from malnutrition, which affects foetal health and the psychological state of pregnant women. Many are experiencing depression and fear of pregnancy because of concerns about childbirth, child-rearing and food provision. Despite this, fertility rates remain relatively good," she told The New Arab.
Reham added that pregnant women are experiencing increased vaginal and urinary infections, leading to premature birth and miscarriage, while living in tents without access to clean water or adequate food.
"Declining birth rates would lead to a shortage in the next generation, indicating that children were among the targets during the war as the foundation of society," she added.
"The aim is to weaken fertility in Gaza to prevent the emergence of a new generation."
Challenges ahead
Looking ahead, Gaza's health system faces a severe strain, with most primary healthcare centres out of service and limited capacity to support pregnant women.
Of 157 government, private and UNRWA-run primary healthcare centres, 95 are out of service, leaving only 62 operational and limiting the ability to address the ongoing impact of the war on pregnant women.
Ahmed al-Farra, head of paediatrics and obstetrics at Nasser Medical Complex, said care centres previously served as a medical safety net through continuous follow-up.
Their absence, he explained, led to major problems, including reduced foetal growth and an increase in premature births.
"These infants are vulnerable to respiratory infections due to weak immunity and poor weight gain. If the child is female, she may experience short stature later in life and face complications during pregnancy," he said.
"This means the effects of the war will persist for generations," he added.
Ahmed added that many children born prematurely may develop conditions such as autism and anxiety, placing an entire generation at risk, and said the main causes of declining birth rates during the war included displacement, poor living conditions in tents, lack of privacy, fear and anxiety over survival, and difficulty accessing largely destroyed health centres.

Ukraine prosecutors say former energy minister is suspect in kickback case

KYIV, Feb 16 - A Ukrainian former energy minister has been detained as a suspect in a high-profile kickback case for crimes such as moneylaundering and participation in criminal activity, anti-graft prosecutors said on Monday, but did not name him.
Ukraine's previous two energy ministers resigned amid fallout from the so-called "Midas" case, centred on an alleged $100-million kickback scheme at the state atomic agency that ensnared senior officials and business elites, including a former associate of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The scandal also claimed the job of Zelenskiy's chief of staff, and all three have denied wrongdoing.
"We are talking about the former energy minister of Ukraine (2021 to 2025)," special anti-graft prosecutors said on the Telegram messaging app. "He is charged with money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation."
The former minister was detained over the weekend while attempting to leave Ukraine, the prosecutors said.
"During the suspect's tenure ... the criminal organisation received more than $112 million in cash from illegal activities in the energy sector," Ukraine's National Anti-corruption Bureau said in a statement.
Materials obtained in Ukraine and through international cooperation with the competent authorities of a number of countries furnished the basis for its conclusion, the bureau added. REUTERS

As families across China gather for the 2026 Lunar New Year holiday, pre-made dishes at their reunion dinners – the centrepiece of Spring Festival celebrations – have again come under scrutiny.
Chinese households, many of which tend to reduce their budget, have increasingly been cautious, following a high-profile row over food transparency and quality involving a star influencer with millions of fans online and a national restaurant chain.
“I work all year round overtime and do eat pre-made food quite often, but it always feels cheap and not refined,” said Ma Shuai, a sales manager from Henan, a province in central China.

However, “there isn’t a single pre-made dish I’d want to put on the reunion dinner table,” he added.
Similar to Christmas dinners in Western countries, the Chinese dinner on Lunar New Year’s Eve is often regarded as the most important meal of the year - and one where they would prefer to allocate more money.

Such comments are common in China as it has raised broader questions about trust, disclosure and regulation in China’s fast-growing prepared food industry.

Australians back hit to capital gains and negative gearing to pay for tax cuts

Australians back hit to capital gains and negative gearing to pay for tax cuts
Australians want Jim Chalmers to reduce both the capital gains tax concession and negative gearing assistance, slash government spending by hacking into foreign aid and cut personal income tax.
An exclusive Resolve Political Monitor poll shows Chalmers has potentially strong political support to use his May budget to cut spending, with two-thirds of respondents backing reductions and just 8 per cent opposed.
But the poll of 1800 people conducted between February 8 and 14 shows voters want those savings to be channelled back to them as income tax cuts while they are also open to substantial tax reform – except for an increase in the GST.
Chalmers has signalled he will use the 2026-27 budget, forecast to show a deficit of $34.3 billion, to target inflation pressures, lift productivity and improve parts of the tax system.
Overnight, the International Monetary Fund urged Chalmers to embrace far-reaching tax reform including overhauling the CGT, cutting the company tax rate and increasing the GST.
Half of those surveyed back income tax cuts with just 11 per cent opposed. Support was strongest among high-income earners (58 per cent), Coalition voters (55 per cent), people with a job (57 per cent) and Labor supporters (51 per cent).
Given a range of possible options to help cover the cost of personal income tax cuts, two-thirds supported spending cuts, 58 per cent backed higher taxes on banks and 57 per cent wanted a lift in taxes on mining companies.
Forty per cent said they supported a reduction in the concessions on capital gains tax, with just 17 per cent opposed. Another 42 per cent said they were undecided or neutral, suggesting Chalmers could prosecute the case to reduce the concession that was introduced in 1999.
The Liberal Party has already said it will not support a change to the capital gains tax, with new leader Angus Taylor on Monday committing to income tax reductions.
“We will come forward with a strong, lower tax package that absolutely must be what we take to the next election,” he told the Centre for Independent Studies.
There was even stronger support to cut negative gearing concessions on investment properties. Seventeen per cent of respondents were opposed to negative gearing changes.
The only option opposed by most of those polled was an increase in the GST, with 54 per cent rejecting the idea compared to 18 per cent who backed the move.
Chalmers on Monday said the government did not support a change to the GST, but he would not rule out reforms to the CGT.
This masthead has revealed that a reduction in the CGT concession is being discussed as part of broader suite of measures, including a further cut to income tax.
The Treasurer said the government already had an “ambitious” tax agenda that included tax cuts due to start on July 1.
“That’s our focus when it comes to tax policy. We haven’t changed our policy – we’re rolling out those income tax cuts and the standard deduction and the boost to the low-income superannuation tax offset,” he said.
Almost 50 per cent of respondents said the government should focus on reducing spending to improve the budget bottom line. In the middle of last year, it was 41 per cent.
Paying for tax cuts would require lower government spending.
The Resolve poll showed 53 per cent of respondents backed a reduction in foreign aid. Strongest support was among One Nation voters (76 per cent), while both Coalition (54 per cent) and Labor supporters (49 per cent) backed the move.
The government expects to spend $4.2 billion this financial year on foreign aid in a budget with $785 billion in expenditure.
Foreign aid was the only option to have majority support from respondents.
There was support from 29 per cent of those questioned for reductions in the government’s $5 billion worth of renewable energy programs. Support was highest among One Nation voters (49 per cent) while it was just 13 per cent among Greens voters.
About one in five of all voters supported a cut to unemployment benefits, which will cost federal taxpayers more than $17 billion this year. The current Newstart payment is almost $400 a week compared to $540 for the age pension.
But support for cuts to some of the most expensive budget items was low. Just 5 per cent supported cuts to the age pension, which is the second-biggest budget line item, while only 16 per cent backed reductions in assistance to the states, which is the federal government’s largest expense.
Only 8 per cent of respondents backed a reduction in health spending. Among One Nation voters, support was just 4 per cent.

‘I thought it was depression’: How PMDD was misdiagnosed - and the FemTech revolution changing women’s health
Tayla Kenyon thought she had “really bad depression, bad anxiety, personality disorders,” before linking the symptoms to her periods.
She suffers from premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). It’s a condition affecting around one in 20 people who experience periods, and causes severe mood and anxiety symptoms.
“I've definitely struggled with periods since I was probably 11. I used to be sick from the pain, like physically sick,” Kenyon told The Independent.
Women’s health conditions like PMDD have long been neglected in medical research - but a new wave of FemTech innovations aims to change that.
UK-based Samphire Neuroscience has developed a headband using transcranial stimulation to help treat the symptoms of PMDD, endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
FemTech companies are part of a growing industry projected to be worth £75.5 billion by 2030.

In front of several hundred people, contestants in feathered costumes take turns screeching into a banana-shaped mic. Some come from nearby towns, others from much farther away. Everyone invents a character.
This year’s shield went to Laurie Duhaudt, aka “Maître Mouette et Chandon”, dressed in pearls, heart-shaped sunglasses and full gull plumage. The jury, made up of past winners and carnival regulars, rewarded timing, tone and commitment.
YouTuber Raphaël Carlier joined in too, while his partner David Coscas watched from the crowd. It is silly, noisy and oddly precise, and it now ranks among Dunkirk’s key carnival moments.

Bitter Cold Complicates Ukraine’s Drone Defence

Earlier this winter, Ali’s unit was flying an interceptor drone in subzero temperatures on the front when the camera suddenly froze, sabotaging their mission to detect and thwart an incoming Russian attack.
Temperatures across the 1,200-kilometre (745-mile) front line have plunged to their lowest of the entire four-year Russia-Ukraine war, complicating the use of battery-powered drones, central to both sides’ military tactics.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
“The impact on our drones is completely negative,” said Ali, who asked AFP to identify him by his call sign, in line with military protocol.
“Batteries lose charge faster, the cameras and wires freeze, they just ice up.”
Both Russia’s and Ukraine’s army have come to use cheap drones ubiquitously.
Small reconnaissance craft scope out enemy positions and can drop grenades on targets and soldiers, detecting even the smallest movement on the ground below, while others are packed with explosives and designed to slam into vehicles and buildings.
Some drones are now connected to their operators with an extremely thin fibre-optic cable, ensuring the connection to the pilot remains stable and immune to electronic jamming.
Interceptor drones, like the kind Ali’s unit was flying, are used for defence -- a kind of drone-on-drone aerial warfare to hobble incoming attacks.
But as temperatures have hit -20C on the front, both the equipment and men operating the devices freeze up.
‘My Kids’ Safety Comes First’ – Ukrainian Refugee Tells About Her New Life Abroad
Near the southern front, pilots from the 18th brigade were getting ready to launch their interceptor drones.
The light polystyrene craft resembles a toy plane.
“Frost, low cloud, fog. In such weather, it is difficult for a drone to fly. It can short-circuit, it can break in the air,” said Nazariy, one of the brigade’s squad commanders.
- Death trap –
Old-school solutions are sometimes required to help the high-tech devices stay airborne.
Denys Shtilierman, chief constructor at Fire Point, a company making Ukraine’s first long-range drones, said rubbing grease over them provided an extra layer of insulation from the frost.
“We just put lard on them and it takes off. I’m laughing, but it’s how it is,” he told AFP during a visit of the company factory.
The craft have become far too central to the war effort to abandon them because of tough weather.
“Drones are being used regardless of the conditions. We have certain limits, but we need to use them,” Shtilierman said.
While the winter poses a technical challenge, in other respects it makes drones an even more potent threat.
When the skies clear, the white layer of snow can quickly turn into a death trap for any troops trying to traverse it.
“It’s very easy to see where someone walked or drove because tracks stand out sharply in the snow,” said Lafayette, a pilot with the Achilles brigade.
Some drones are also equipped with thermal cameras, which makes the heat they pick-up from human bodies much more visible in winter.
- ‘Die from the cold’ –
Amid the cold snap, Russia has upped its long-range attacks on Ukraine’s energy sites, cutting off electricity and heating for hundreds of thousands of civilians across the country and triggering a major energy crisis.
At the front, Ukrainian forces are also struggling from the cold.
In January, Moscow’s army recorded one of its fastest advances of any winter month, according to AFP analysis.
Though several Ukrainian military officials have noted other periods of reduced intensity in Russian assaults due to the bitter cold.
At a recent training session for Ukrainian infantry, an instructor shouted as soldiers ran through thick snow, the layers of ice crushing under their boots.
“Infantry that comes out is literally destroyed because they have nowhere to hide,” said Koleso, a 31-year-old infantryman.
In the frost, wounds quickly turn deadly, as hypothermia weakens the body’s ability to cope with trauma.
Hypothermia and frostbite on limbs are common, said Nastya, a paramedic with the Da Vinci Wolves brigade.
“The wounded die not only from shrapnel and bullets -- they also die from the cold, which accompanies them like a dark companion in the frost,” she said.
“The cold is a very insidious enemy, it should not be underestimated,” she said.
Despite these risks, Nazariy said there was no way but to keep fighting, and ensure Kyiv’s drones stay in the air.
“We are at war. We work in any weather.”

Victorians have paid for ‘gangland figures to drive Ferraris’ thanks to CFMEU power

Victorians have paid for ‘gangland figures to drive Ferraris’ thanks to CFMEU power
In 2024, investigative reporter Nick McKenzie exposed alleged criminal infiltration and criminality within the country’s most powerful union, the CFMEU. This reporting prompted a slew of investigations among governments and law enforcement agencies around the country.
The conclusions of an investigation commissioned by the CFMEU’s own administrator reveal the extent of that corruption, and its findings are damning – including that the CFMEU’s conduct could have cost taxpayers $15 billion. And as Nick McKenzie tells host Julia Carr-Catzel on The Morning Edition podcast, not a “single public servant and not a single politician has been meaningfully held to account”.
McKenzie cites the report’s findings that major government projects like Victoria’s Big Build were infiltrated by corrupt union officials in bed with gangland figures and bikie gangs.
“That’s what was happening on the Big Build, we had subcontractors, sometimes run by bikie gangs, certainly linked to bikie gangs, linked to other gangland figures, charging well over the odds, getting work they should never have got at a vast scale,” McKenzie says on the podcast.
“I mean, there’s bikie gangland figures driving Ferraris around Victoria at the moment, care of the taxpayer, thanks to that negligence, that failure to keep contractors under control on these major, major sites.”
Click the player below to listen to the full episode, or read on for an edited extract of the conversation.
Carr-Catzel: And what would you say about the way the Big Build project has been run that makes it so vulnerable to corruption?
McKenzie: Well, you can imagine, if you’re running your own house renovation, you’d be wanting to know what your subcontractors, the person doing your tiling and doing your carpentry were charging. You’d be pretty keen to know if they were overcharging you, and if they rocked up on a Harley-Davidson in bikie colours, you’d be especially concerned.
Now, lets times that by many multiples. That’s what was happening on the Big Build, we had subcontractors, sometimes run by bikie gangs, certainly linked to bikie gangs, linked to other gangland figures, charging well over the odds, getting work they should never have got at a vast scale. I mean, there’s bikie gangland figures driving Ferraris around Victoria, at the moment care of the taxpayer thanks to that negligence, that failure to keep contractors under control on these major, major sites.
So why was this happening? I mean, we still really haven’t got to the bottom of why the Labor government didn’t protect public funds. We know they didn’t. But why? Was it because they wanted an ally in the CFMEU? Was it because they wanted the projects done on time? I mean, at the end of the day, the projects weren’t done on time, the budgets were blown out, and relations with the CFMEU were poor.
Geoffrey Watson, SC, the corruption expert, in his expert testimony said his view was that the government was seeking some sort of accord with the union that it was ultimately scared of. The union’s industrial might was so great, the government didn’t know how to deal with it and thought by passing the problem on to major government contractors on these sites, the problem was simply go away. You’ll disappear. And of course, it has not.
Carr-Catzel: And so you’ve given us a snapshot of the corruption taking place. But a big question in all of this, and what you alluded to before, is just how much the Labor government knew and when, because Watson’s report does suggest that ministers knew much more than they’re letting on. Is that right?
McKenzie: It absolutely suggests that, I mean, Watson concludes that not only did the state government of Victoria have a duty to know how the money was being spent and misused on these government sites, but that it did know it was being misspent and abused.
The bureaucrats running these projects, or overseeing these projects, knew about this corruption and this impropriety, and the government itself knew and chose to do nothing about it.
That stands to absolute reason. I mean, there are many government officials that have been involved in these mega-projects. We know that there are reports of serious corruption, unlawful or improper behaviour on many of these sites, on many occasions. So in some respects, it’s a matter of sheer logic backed up by hard evidence that the government knew.
What’s very disturbing in Victoria is having established that the government did know, well, where’s the accountability in a Westminster system? If a minister presides over a series of corrupt projects, responsibility should flow to that minister. Well, who was the minister most responsible for the big build? It’s the premier, Victoria Jacinta Allen. There’s been an absolute absence of accountability down the government chain of command. Not a single public servant and not a single politician has been meaningfully held to account. And ultimately, there’s growing calls for an independent inquiry to really lay out who knew what, when in government, and if they did, if politicians, if public servants, did, as Geoffrey Watson has concluded, indeed, know a vast amount of this corruption was going on, then what’s the appropriate penalty?

Hongkongers make 1.4 million outbound trips ahead of Lunar New Year
Longer holiday, Valentine’s Day overlap drive 21.6 per cent increase in outbound trips from 2025
Hongkongers made close to 1.4 million outbound trips in the three days leading up to Lunar New Year’s Eve, a 21.6 per cent increase from the same period last year, while inbound journeys rose slightly by five per cent to more than 550,000.
In this year and the last, city residents were able to take two weekdays off alongside the three Lunar New Year public holidays to create a nine-day holiday, with two weekends flanking the five days.
In 2026, the festive period also coincided with Valentine’s Day on February 14, which did not occur last year.
Data from the Immigration Department released on Monday showed that from February 13 to 15, Hong Kong residents made 1.39 million outbound trips, up from 1.14 million during the same period last year, from January 25 to 27.
The number of arrivals from mainland China and overseas grew from 524,489 to 551,382 during the same period.
Lai Wing-chun, chairman of the Hong Kong Wholesale Florist Association, said the closeness of the Lunar New Year and Valentine’s Day had led to weaker business for local florists.
“Some shoppers used the same flowers for both celebrations,” Lai said, adding that families typically spent about HK$1,000 (US$128) this year, roughly the same as last year, with orchids remaining among the most popular Lunar New Year choices.

Each year, Ivrea becomes the stage for a ritualised street battle as the Battle of the Oranges takes over the town. Residents form foot teams, facing off against masked cart riders in a coordinated volley of citrus. The contest, both chaotic and carefully organised, anchors the Carnival of Ivrea and signals the start of its busiest days.
The ritual retells the story of Violetta, the miller’s daughter who kills a tyrant and sparks a revolt. Today, the fruit stands in for stones and anger.
The Carnival of Ivrea runs for three days ahead of Lent, combining noise, physical effort and strict organisation. Locals wear red caps to signal they are not taking part, while visitors are advised to watch before joining in.
This year’s programme stretched from early January to Shrove Tuesday on 17 February, with the Battle of the Oranges staged on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday. On Monday, parades continued through the town before the orange fights began mid-afternoon.

War update: 235 clashes on frontline over past day, fiercest fighting in Pokrovsk sector
This was reported by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Facebook, providing operational data as of 08:00 on Monday, February 16, according to Ukrinform.
“In total, 235 combat clashes were recorded over the past day,” the statement said.
According to the General Staff, yesterday, the enemy carried out one missile strike using a single missile and 79 airstrikes, dropping 224 guided aerial bombs. In addition, 4,757 kamikaze drones were deployed and 3,387 shelling attacks targeted settlements and Ukrainian positions, including 121 with multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS).

Ex-energy minister charged in Ukraine's biggest corruption case

Editor's note: This story is being updated.
Herman Halushchenko, Ukraine's former energy minister, was charged of money laundering and involvement in a criminal group as part of the country's major corruption scandal, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) announced on Feb. 16.
The charges against Halushchenko were brought months after Ukraine was rocked the biggest corruption investigation during Volodymyr Zelensky's presidency. A day earlier on Feb. 15, the ex-official was detained while attempting to leave Ukraine.
Halushchenko has been investigated by the NABU as part of a case involving state nuclear power company Energoatom. Eight other suspects have been charged, and Timur Mindich, a close associate of Zelensky, is the alleged ringleader.
Halushchenko served as energy minister from 2021 to 2025 and was appointed justice minister in July 2025. He was dismissed as justice minister in November amid a corruption scandal. Energy Minister Svitlana Hrynchuk, who is also allegedly implicated in the case, was fired the same day.
According to the NABU, members of the criminal group exposed by the anti-graft agencies in November initiated the registration a fund on the island of Anguilla in February 2021. The fund aimed to raise about $100 million in "investments," with Halushchenko’s family among the "investors," the bureau said.
The fund was led by a long-time associate of the group, a citizen of the Seychelles and St. Kitts and Nevis, who allegedly provided money laundering services.
To conceal Halushchenko's involvement, two companies were allegedely set up in the Marshall Islands and linked to a trust in St. Kitts and Nevis, with his ex-wife and four children as beneficiaries, the beraus said.
The NABU alleged that the companies became "investors" in the fund, while the group transferred funds to the fund’s accounts in three Swiss banks, in Halushchenko's interest.
According to the bureau, during Halushchenko's tenure as energy minister, over $112 million was funneled through Ihor Mironyuk, a former advisor to Halushchenko and a suspect in the case.
The NABU said over $7.4 million was transferred to the fund's accounts controlled by Halushchenko's family. Additionally, more than 1.3 million Swiss francs ($1.6 million) and 2.4 million euros ($2.8 million) were withdrawn in cash and sent directly to his family in Switzerland, according to the bureu.
According to the NABU, part of the funds were spent on Halushchenko's children's education at top Swiss institutions and placed in the ex-wife's accounts. The remainder was allegedely put into a deposit, "earning extra income for the family's personal use."
Halushchenko has yet to comment on the charges brought against him.

UK’s Starmer announces crackdown on AI chatbots in child safety push
PM also says he will seek legal powers to act on a consultation that is considering an Australia-style social media ban for those below 16.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a crackdown on artificial intelligence chatbots that endanger children and pledged to seek broader powers to regulate internet access for minors.
Starmer’s office said on Monday that the government would target “vile and illegal content created by AI” and push for legal powers to act quickly on the findings of a public consultation that will consider a social media ban for children below 16 years of age.

- list 4 of 4Spain v social media giants: What’s the big dispute about?
The powers are likely to reduce parliamentary scrutiny of future curbs.
“Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up,” Starmer said in a statement.
“We are acting to protect children’s wellbeing and help parents to navigate the minefield of social media,” he said.
The measures will require all AI chatbot providers to abide by digital safety laws, including a ban on creating sexualised images without a subject’s consent. The move follows action against “non-consensual intimate images” created by the Grok chatbot on Elon Musk’s X platform.
Starmer’s office went on to explain its push for broader powers, saying it wants to act on the findings of the public consultation “within months, rather than waiting years for new primary legislation every time technology evolves”.
The measures will be introduced as an amendment to existing crime and child-protection legislation being considered by parliament.
The consultation, which begins in March, will consider measures like setting a minimum age limit for social media and a ban on children from using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access pornography.
It comes as more countries worldwide eye restrictions after Australia became the first nation to prohibit children below 16 from using social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and YouTube.
Since Australia instituted the ban, social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children below 16.
Under the country’s law, social media companies face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2m) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of children younger than 16 years old.
Starmer’s plan for age restrictions has received broad support from his Labour Party as well as the opposition Conservative Party, which is also seeking a social media ban on UK citizens below 16 years of age.
While aimed at shielding children, such measures often have knock-on implications for adults’ privacy and ability to access services, and have led to tension with the United States over limits on free speech and regulatory reach.
Websites such as image-hosting site Imgur, used to make memes and provide images for many general online discussion forums, blocked access to all UK users last year and gave them blank images instead, after tighter age-verification rules.
Some major pornography websites have also blocked access for UK users rather than verify their age.
However, such geographic restrictions can be circumvented by using readily available VPNs. The British government said its consultation on child safety would include potential age restrictions for VPNs.
France is also currently debating bills for a social media ban for those below 15, including one championed by President Emmanuel Macron.
The bill has already been approved by the National Assembly and is awaiting approval in the Senate.

ALBAWABA - An Indonesian military spokesperson said Monday that the country is planning to send 1,000 troops to Gaza by early April.
The spokesperson further mentioned that the army will prepare to have 8,000 soldiers in the Gaza Strip by June as part of the peacekeeping forces.
The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a lengthy statement on the matter, affirmed that any potential Indonesian participation in the international stabilization force in the Palestinian territories is entirely subject to Indonesian national decision-making and is based on the mandate of UN Security Council Resolution 2803 (2025), as well as its commitment to an independent and proactive foreign policy and the principles of international law.

The statement clarified that the scope of the Indonesian personnel's mission would be "limited and strictly defined," in accordance with the strict and binding national mandate and restrictions established by the Indonesian government and agreed upon with the leadership of the international stabilization force.
It is worth noting that Indonesia joined the peace council, which was established by U.S. President Donald Trump and announced last month.
The council has a mandate from the UN Security Council to create an international stabilization force that will help secure the border areas of Gaza and ensure the demilitarization of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas.
The council, which is scheduled to hold its first meeting in Washington on February 19, will also oversee a new Palestinian technocratic government in Gaza and post-war reconstruction efforts.

Marco Rubio, the U.S. secretary of state, has downplayed fears that Washington is seeking to withdraw from NATO, adding that the stronger its members, the stronger the alliance.
Speaking in Bratislava after bilateral talks with Prime Minister Robert Fico, Rubio added that the U.S. wanted other NATO members to have more say in the alliance, which he said was a “positive thing.”

Washington’s top diplomat said President Donald Trump wants NATO to be stronger and that collective strength comes from individual strength.
“The stronger our allies are the stronger we are collectively,” he said.
At a joint press conference with Fico, Rubio said the U.S. expected every country to act in its own interests and that these would sometimes diverge from Washington’s, which he couched as being part of a relationship based on partnership.
“We’re not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States,” he said. “We want the [NATO] alliance to be so strong that no one will ever challenge it.”

‘Europeanizing’ NATO
Rubio’s comments come against the backdrop of a historic restructuring of NATO’s military hierarchy. On February 10, the alliance confirmed that the U.S. is handing over leadership of all three Joint Force Commands to European officers.
The move has fueled concerns over whether the U.S. is ‘Europeanizing’ NATO as a prelude to downsizing its commitment to the alliance as America shifts its focus to the Indo-Pacific.

No, George Washington didn't have wooden teeth. Yes, he led the Siege of Boston

No, George Washington didn't have wooden teeth. Yes, he led the Siege of Boston
More than a decade before he became the country’s first president, George Washington was leading a critical campaign in the early days of the American Revolution
- Bookmark
More than a decade before he became the country's first president, George Washington was leading a critical campaign in the early days of the American Revolution. The Siege of Boston was his first campaign as commander-in-chief of the Continental Army and, in many ways, set the stage for his military and political successes — celebrated on Presidents Day.
Following the Battles of Lexington and Concord, militias had pinned down the British in Boston in April 1775. The Continental Congress, recognizing the need for a more organized military effort, selected Washington to lead the newly-formed army.
What was the Siege of Boston
On this day 250 years ago, Washington would have been nearing the end of an almost yearlong siege that bottled up as many as 11,000 British troops and hundreds more loyalists. The British were occupying Boston at the time, and the goal of the siege was to force them out.
A critical decision made by Washington was sending Henry Knox, a young book seller, to Fort Ticonderoga in New York to retrieve dozens of cannons. The cannons, transported hundreds of miles in the dead of winter, were eventually used to fire on British positions. That contributed to the decision by the British, facing dwindling supplies, to abandon the city by boat on March 17, 1776.
Historians argue the British abandoning their position, celebrated in Boston as Evacuation Day, rid the city of loyalists at a critical time, denied the British access to an important port and gave patriots a huge morale boost.
“The success of the Siege of Boston gave new life and momentum to the Revolution,” Chris Beagan, the site manager at Longfellow House in Cambridge, a National Historic Site that served as Washington's headquarters during the American Revolution. “Had it failed, royal control of New England would have continued, and the Continental Army likely would have dissolved."
How the siege shaped Washington
The siege was also a critical test for Washington. A surveyor and farmer, Washington had been out of the military for nearly 20 years after commanding troops for the British during the French and Indian War. His successful campaign ensured Washington remained the commander-in-chief for the remainder of the revolution.
Doug Bradburn, president of George Washington’s Mount Vernon, said Washington took the first steps to creating a geographically diverse army that included militiamen from Massachusetts to Virginia and, by the end of the war, a fighting force with significant Black and Native American representation. It was the most integrated military until President Harry S. Truman’s desegregated the armed forces in 1948, he said.
Washington, a slave owner most of life who depended on hundreds of slaves on his Mount Vernon estate, was initially opposed to admitting formerly enslaved and free Black soldiers into the army. But short of men, Washington came to realize “there are free Blacks who want to enlist and he needs them to keep the British from breaking out” during the siege, Bradburn said.
Ridding Boston of the British also turned Washington into one of the country's most popular political figures.
“He comes to embody the cause in a time before you have a nation, before you have a Declaration of Independence, before you’re really sure what is the goal of this struggle,” Bradburn said. “He becomes the face of the revolutionary movement.”
Commanding the military more than eight years also prepared Washington for the presidency, Pulitzer Prize-winning military historian Rick Atkinson said. “Perhaps most important, it gave him a sense that Americans could and should be a single people, rather than denizens of thirteen different entities.”
Myths of Washington
His rise to prominence also led to plenty of myths about Washington, many which persist to this day.
One of the most popular is the cherry tree myth. It was invented by one of Washington's first biographers, according to George Washington’s Mount Vernon, who created the story after his death. Supposedly, a 6-year-old Washington took an ax to a cherry tree and admitted as much when caught by his father, famously saying “I cannot tell a lie … I did cut it with my hatchet."
The second one is the wooden teeth myth. It was rumored that Washington had wooden dentures and scholars, well into the 20th century, were quoted as saying his false teeth were made from wood. Not true. He never wore wooden dentures, instead using those with ivory, gold and even human teeth.
More than a statesman
During his lifetime, Washington had a myriad of pursuits. He was known as an innovative farmer, according to the George Washington’s Mount Vernon, and an advocate for Western expansion, buying up to 50,000 acres of land in several Mid-Atlantic states. After returning to Mount Vernon, he built a whiskey distillery that became one of the largest in the country.
His connection to slavery was complicated. He advocated for ending slavery, and his will called for freeing all the slaves he owned after the death of his wife, Martha Washington. But he didn't he own all the slaves at Mount Vernon so he could't legally free all of them.
Celebrating Presidents Day
For fans of George Washington, Presidents Day is their Super Bowl. Originated to celebrate Washington's birthday, which falls on Feb. 22, the holiday has become associated with good deals at the mall. Still, there are plenty of places celebrating all things Washington on this day.
There will be a wreath-laying ceremony at Washington's tomb at Mount Vernon, and there will be a Continental Army encampment. There will be a parade honoring Washington in Alexandria, Virginia, and, in Laredo, Texas, a monthlong celebration features a carnival, pageants, an air show and jalapeno festival.

Opening statements to start in the trial of a Georgia high school shooting suspect's father
The trial of a man whose teenage son is accused of killing two students and two teachers at a Georgia high school in 2024 is set to get underway
- Bookmark
Opening statements are expected Monday in the trial of a man whose teenage son is accused of killing two students and two teachers at a Georgia high school in September 2024.
The case is one of several around the country where prosecutors are trying to hold parents responsible after their children are accused in fatal shootings. Colin Gray faces 29 counts, including two counts of second-degree murder, two counts of involuntary manslaughter and numerous counts of second-degree cruelty to children related to the shooting at Apalachee High School in Winder.
The indictment says Gray gave his son, Colt, access to a gun and ammunition “after receiving sufficient warning that Colt Gray would harm and endanger the bodily safety of another.” Prosecutors argue that amounts to cruelty to children, and second-degree murder is defined in Georgia law as causing the death of a child by committing the crime of cruelty to children.
The trial is being held in Winder, in Barrow County, where the shooting happened. The defense asked for a change of venue because of pretrial publicity, and prosecutors agreed. The judge kept the trial in Winder but decided to bring in jurors from nearby Hall County to hear the case. Jurors were selected last week.
Investigators have said Colt Gray, who was 14 at the time, carefully planned the Sept. 4, 2024, shooting at the school northeast of Atlanta that is attended by 1,900 students.
With a semiautomatic rifle in his book bag, the barrel sticking out and wrapped in poster board, he boarded the school bus, investigators said. He left his second-period class and emerged from a bathroom with the gun and then shot people in a classroom and hallways, they said.
An investigator testified at a pretrial hearing that Colin Gray had given his son the gun as a gift the Christmas before the shooting and bought a larger magazine so the weapon could hold more rounds.
Colin Gray knew his son was obsessed with school shooters, even having a shrine in his bedroom to Nikolas Cruz, the shooter in the 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, prosecutors have said. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent testified that the teen’s parents had discussed their son’s fascination with school shooters but decided that it was in a joking context and not a serious issue.
Colin Gray was also aware his son’s mental health had deteriorated and had sought help from a counseling service weeks before the shooting, an investigator testified.
“We have had a very difficult past couple of years and he needs help. Anger, anxiety, quick to be volatile. I don’t know what to do,” Colin Gray wrote about his son.

Hong Kong court to announce verdict on appeals of 12 jailed activists on February 23
Court will also rule on one acquitted defendant in city’s largest national security trial of 47 opposition figures over illegal ‘primary’ election
A Hong Kong appellate court will announce its verdict next Monday on the appeals of 12 activists convicted of conspiring to subvert state power in an unofficial election, and also rule on an acquitted defendant in the city’s largest national security trial.
Eleven of the 12 found guilty over a scheme during the 2020 Legislative Council election to undermine, destroy or overthrow the administration earlier lodged appeals against their convictions and sentences. They have been serving jail sentences ranging from 6½ years to seven years and nine months.
Defendant Prince Wong Ji-yuet, who pleaded guilty and received a sentence of four years and five months, appealed against her punishment and asked for leniency.
The trial court two years ago found that the opposition activists had conspired to secure a controlling majority in the Legislative Council and to indiscriminately reject the government’s budget.
Two defendants, social worker Lee Yue-shun and barrister Lawrence Lau Wai-chung, were acquitted. The government appealed against Lau’s acquittal, arguing the trial judges had failed to consider evidence showing Lau’s knowledge of the unlawful scheme and his agreement to be bound by the unofficial poll’s result.

Bondi Beach attack suspect gives single-word answers in first court appearance
Naveed Akram appears via video link from supermax facility, wearing a green prison jumper
- Bookmark
A man accused of carrying out Australia’s deadliest mass shooting in three decades at Bondi Beach last year has appeared in court for the first time.
Naveed Akram, 24, faces 59 charges in relation to the attack on a Jewish event at Sydney’s Archer Park that killed at least 15 people and injured dozens on Sunday 14 December.
Mr Akram appeared via video link on Monday at the Downing Centre Local Court and spoke briefly, mostly in single-word answers.
The magistrate extended suppression orders which were made late last year to protect the identities of victims and survivors after they opted not to be publicly identified.
Mr Akram and his father Sajid Akram are accused of targeting Jewish people celebrating Hanukkah in an anti-semitic attack that sent shockwaves around the world. It was Australia's worst mass shooting since 1996, and the worst terror attack targeting Australians since the 2002 Bali bombings.
Sajid Akram was shot dead by police at the scene.
Mr Akram, who was wearing a green jumper and sat with his hands on his lap, only spoke after deputy chief magistrate Sharon Freund asked if he had been listening to a discussion about an extension of suppression orders.
“Did you just hear what I just said?” Ms Freund asked. Mr Akram replied: “Yeah.”
His Legal Aid solicitor, Ben Archbold, later asked the magistrate for time to speak with his client.
“Mr Akram, your solicitor is going to give you a call after,” the magistrate said. “Yep,” the accused replied.
Mr Archbold said it was too early to confirm what plea his client would enter and he was yet to receive the brief of evidence.
Speaking to reporters outside the court, he said his client was "as well as can be expected" as he remains in the Goulburn supermax prison in New South Wales.
"Everyone knows it's supermax … very onerous conditions," Mr Archbold said.
Asked if Mr Akram had given an interview to the police, he said: "All we've done is start the process. We're waiting for the brief to be served. There's nothing more I can say."
Mr Archbold also said he went to the High Risk Management Correctional Centre (HRMCC) to visit Mr Akram.
When asked about his visit and Mr Akram’s conditions, he said: "He's just a client and he's a client that needs to be represented, and we don't let our personal view get in the way of our professional obligations."
Police allege that the Bondi Beach attackers parked their vehicle near a footbridge overlooking Archer Park at Bondi at about 6.50pm on 14 December.
It is alleged that a "tennis ball bomb" and three pipe bombs were thrown into the crowd before the pair opened fire.
None of the bombs detonated, but were deemed viable during preliminary police analysis.
In December, court documents made public police allegations that Sajid and Naveed Akram visited the area for "reconnaissance and planning" in the days before the attack.
Police have further accused the pair of conducting firearms training in the Australian countryside.
Mr Akram will return to court in April.

The Ukrainian delegation has departed for Geneva, Switzerland, ahead of the next round of negotiations scheduled for Feb. 17-18, aimed at ending Russia’s war against Ukraine.
“On the way to Geneva. The next round of talks is ahead,” Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s Office of the President (OP), wrote on Telegram, posting a photo near a train.

He added that the team would use the journey to reflect on history and draw the right conclusions, stressing that Ukraine’s interests must be protected.
The talks will be held in a trilateral format involving Ukraine, Russia, and the United States, with special envoys for US President Donald Trump – Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner – expected to take part.
Key items on the agenda include ceasefire monitoring mechanisms and arrangements for further prisoner exchanges.
The next round of Ukraine peace talks will take place in Geneva on Feb. 17-18, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.
Ukraine’s OP confirmed the dates and format. Presidential communications adviser Dmytro Lytvyn said Kyiv’s delegation is preparing for negotiations.
According to Peskov, the talks will be held in a trilateral format involving Russia, the US, and Ukraine, with Vladimir Medinsky leading Russia’s delegation.
Russian media report that Moscow will send a delegation of at least 15 people, including Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin.
Zelensky Should Kick the US Out of Peace Negotiations
Medinsky – a former culture minister and ideologue close to Vladimir Putin – is linked to propaganda efforts in occupied Ukrainian territories. He heads the Russian Military Historical Society.
Observers also recalled his role in earlier talks, where he cited fabricated quotes attributed to Napoleon and Otto von Bismarck – claims later debunked by Ukrainian officials and historians.
Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said last week that negotiations remain far from complete, dismissing optimistic claims of progress. He pointed to earlier talks in Abu Dhabi, saying there was “still a long way to go,” and accused Washington of backtracking on proposals discussed in Anchorage.
Previous US-mediated rounds were held on Jan. 23-24 and Feb. 4-5. Trump said a deal was “almost achieved,” while Witkoff called the talks constructive – a view echoed by Moscow.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, however, says a “fundamental difference” remains: Kyiv seeks a ceasefire while holding current territory, while Russia is demanding sweeping concessions and recognition of occupied regions.
Trump told reporters on Friday, Feb. 13, that Zelensky was “going to have to get moving” on peace negotiations with Russia.
“Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelensky’s going to have to get moving, otherwise he’s going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move,” Trump said as he departed the White House for North Carolina.

The EU is hiring AD5 graduates and aims to attract new talent and digital skills. For about 1,400 successful candidates, this is a chance for a permanent job in the EU civil service. Ask the Euronews AI chatbot about the EU’s most elite exam.
The last time the EU held its general entry-level AD5 competition, as opposed to specialist ones, was in 2019. EPSO explained the repeated delays as part of the Commission’s work to update old IT systems and fix problems with the testing platform.
With open eligibility and a monthly salary of nearly €6,000, about 50,000 people are expected to apply before the 10 March deadline for these entry-level civil service jobs.
Candidates will take a four-part online test to determine if they are ready to become permanent EU officials and help with policy work.
There is a catch: passing the AD5 competition does not guarantee a job. About 1,400 successful candidates will be placed in a pool and may be hired by any EU institution, body or agency within a year.
With around 50,000 expected candidates and a reserve list of only around 1,400 successful applicants, the odds of passing the test are just 3%. Many say the effective success rate is higher if you exclude those who never sit the exam, drop out early or prepare superficially.

Indonesia’s Gaza gamble

Indonesia’s Gaza gamble
Participation in Trump’s Board of Peace and plans to deploy 8,000 troops could stretch Jakarta’s military, strain its diplomacy and weaken its hard-won reputation for independence.
President Prabowo Subianto’s government said on February 10 that Indonesia is preparing to deploy up to 8,000 troops to a proposed multinational Gaza stabilisation force under Donald Trump’s so-called Board of Peace (BoP). The troop proposal forms part of Jakarta’s broader decision to participate in the BoP framework, an initiative conceived and driven by Trump. Together, these steps signal a significant shift in Indonesia’s longstanding foreign policy posture. At a time of intensifying geopolitical volatility, Jakarta appears to be committing itself to a project shaped around a single, deeply polarising political figure. The decision raises a fundamental question: is Indonesia advancing its national interests and diplomatic credibility, or allowing its foreign policy direction to be shaped by an external agenda?
Geopolitics is not a theatre for symbolic proximity to power but a disciplined calculation of national interest and sovereign credibility. Indonesia’s decision to engage with the BoP appears less like a carefully calibrated strategic choice and more like a reactive impulse that risks weakening the philosophical foundations of its diplomacy, built over decades. Indonesia’s international influence has historically rested on strategic equidistance rather than personal alignment with controversial leaders.
There is a growing sense that Jakarta risks acting out of geopolitical urgency. Yet the initiative Indonesia has chosen to support is led by a figure known for transactional diplomacy and disregard for international consensus. The implications extend well beyond Middle East peace initiatives. What is at stake is Indonesia’s reputation as an independent stabilising actor in global diplomacy.
If Indonesia proceeds with troop deployment under the BoP framework, the risks become even more acute. Gaza is not a conventional peacekeeping theatre. It is one of the most volatile and politically contested conflict environments in the world, where humanitarian imperatives and hard security objectives frequently collide. Deploying thousands of troops into such an arena without an inclusive multilateral mandate risks drawing Indonesia into a conflict environment where neutrality would be difficult to sustain.
The erosion of the ‘Free and Active’ doctrine
The most serious concern is the gradual erosion of Indonesia’s “Free and Active” foreign policy doctrine, the intellectual backbone of its diplomacy since the Djuanda Declaration and the Bandung Conference. Indonesia has historically positioned itself as a mediator rather than a follower of personalised diplomatic agendas.
By participating in an institution closely identified with Donald Trump, Jakarta risks legitimising unilateral approaches that often conflict with established international norms. “Free” diplomacy implies independence, and “active” diplomacy implies engagement driven by national priorities rather than external pressure.
Indonesia also risks being reduced to a symbolic endorsement of a United States-centred foreign policy outlook. If Jakarta drifts too far into this orbit, its leverage with other major actors, including China, Russia and ASEAN partners, could weaken. Indonesia’s leadership in Southeast Asia has depended on its credibility as a neutral stabilising force. That credibility may erode if it is seen as participating in great-power security agendas.
Indonesia’s respected record in United Nations peacekeeping has historically rested on internationally recognised neutrality under UN command structures. Participation in a BoP framework, which sits outside established multilateral systems, risks shifting Indonesia from neutral arbiter to participant in a political security architecture shaped beyond globally recognised peacekeeping norms.
More troubling is the precedent this sets. If foreign policy principles become negotiable in exchange for economic or strategic promises, Indonesia risks undermining the coherence of its diplomatic identity. Its constitutional commitment to promoting global peace and social justice depends on preserving policy independence.
The Palestine paradox
Indonesia’s participation in the BoP also creates a visible moral and constitutional tension. The Indonesian constitution explicitly rejects all forms of colonialism and emphasises international justice. Participation in an initiative led by the architect of policies historically skewed in Israel’s favour creates a contradiction that is difficult to reconcile.
Trump’s record in the region remains controversial. His decision to relocate the US embassy to Jerusalem altered decades of diplomatic consensus and drew widespread criticism across the Muslim world. For Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation and a consistent supporter of Palestinian statehood, association with this framework carries significant political sensitivity.
If the Board of Peace advances regional normalisation without firm guarantees of Palestinian sovereignty, Indonesia risks being linked to a process widely perceived as externally imposed. This would conflict with domestic public sentiment and weaken Indonesia’s moral leadership in forums such as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations.
The troop deployment dimension deepens these concerns. The Gaza conflict landscape extends beyond Israeli and Palestinian actors to include broader regional power networks, including the so-called “Axis of Resistance”. Indonesian forces could be perceived by militant groups as extensions of Western-backed security arrangements, increasing the risk that peacekeeping troops become operational targets.
Strategic and economic trade-offs
Deploying 8,000 personnel overseas is not a marginal decision. For Indonesia, it represents a full brigade likely composed of some of its most capable units. At a time of rising tensions in the North Natuna Sea and intensifying Indo-Pacific competition, diverting elite forces to the Middle East risks diluting focus on core national defence priorities and stretching military readiness across distant theatres.
The financial dimension is equally significant. Sustaining thousands of troops in a devastated and heavily militarised enclave would require extensive logistical infrastructure. Even when operations receive international support, hidden costs often revert to national budgets. At a moment when Indonesia’s domestic economy requires stimulus and its defence sector seeks modernisation, allocating substantial resources to an expeditionary mission with uncertain strategic returns warrants serious parliamentary scrutiny.
Diplomatic engagement must deliver tangible dividends to the public, not impose new burdens on an already stretched state budget. Without clearly defined security or economic benefits, troop deployment risks appear as an expensive geopolitical gamble. Indonesia could find itself dependent on security arrangements shaped by shifting US domestic political priorities, creating commitments that may prove unreliable over time.
The absence of robust public debate surrounding this decision is equally concerning. Large-scale overseas military commitments require democratic oversight. Without transparency, foreign policy risks becoming an elite-driven exercise detached from national consensus.
Reputational risk and strategic myopia
Indonesia’s close association with an initiative so strongly linked to Donald Trump introduces long-term reputational risk. US politics remains deeply polarised. If future administrations distance themselves from Trump-era initiatives, Indonesia could face diplomatic exposure through no necessity of its own.
Foreign policy frameworks built around highly personalised leadership often prove unstable. Indonesia’s diplomatic partnerships have traditionally been grounded in multilateral institutions such as the United Nations and ASEAN, which provide durability precisely because they are not tied to individual leaders.
If the Board of Peace becomes politically contested or evolves into a coercive security instrument, Indonesia may struggle to disengage without reputational damage. Participation, therefore, concentrates diplomatic risk rather than diversifying it.
In a rapidly multipolar world, Indonesia does not require shortcuts to global influence. Its credibility has historically been built on independence, balance and principled diplomacy. The central question is whether Indonesia will preserve that tradition or compromise it in pursuit of geopolitical visibility and proximity to power. Indonesia deserves a far more independent role than that.

North Korea opens new housing district for families of soldiers killed in Russia-Ukraine war
Leader Kim Jong Un attends inauguration ceremony in Pyongyang for newly established Saeppyol Street
ISTANBUL
North Korea announced Monday that it has completed construction of a new housing district in the capital Pyongyang for the families of North Korean troops killed in the Russia-Ukraine war, state media reported.
The Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took part in Sunday’s inauguration ceremony for the newly established Saeppyol Street, accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju Ae and other officials.
In remarks delivered at the event, Kim said the new street "has been built thanks to the ardent desire of our motherland that wishes that the precious lives of its excellent sons, who defended the most sacred things by sacrificing their most valuable things, will live forever."
Calling the street "a source of honor for our generation and a pride of Pyongyang and our state," he said it is intended for "the bereaved family members of the fallen soldiers and other combatants, as well as the combatants of the regiment of the engineers, who have been dispatched to the overseas military operations."
"The Party and the government will take all necessary steps to ensure that these families lead a proud and worthwhile life while enjoying the preferential treatment by the state and the loving care of the whole society," he added, according to KCNA.
Following his speech and the ribbon-cutting ceremony marking the street’s completion, Kim visited several of the residences to extend his condolences.
The report did not specify the number of homes constructed for the families.
North Korea sent around 1,000 military engineers to Russia’s Kursk region in August 2025 to assist Russian forces in clearing land mines planted during fighting with Ukrainian troops.
The deployment followed an earlier dispatch of an estimated 15,000 combat troops to support Russia’s war effort, according to South Korea's spy agency, which claims Pyongyang lost 2,000 troops in the war.
North Korea and Russia signed a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2024, pledging mutual military support if either came under attack by a third party.

Harry Styles to curate 2026 Meltdown Festival
British pop star joins a long line of prestigious past curators including David Bowie, Yoko Ono, Patti Smith and Elvis Costello

Harry Styles will curate the 2026 Meltdown festival at London's Southbank Centre, organisers have announced.
The 32-year-old follows the likes of David Bowie, Yoko Ono, Chaka Khan, Grace Jones and Patti Smith in arranging the festival's line-up.
Organisers said this year's event will form part of a “landmark” celebration, presented as part of the Southbank Centre's 75th anniversary year.
Speaking about the festival, the “Aperture” singer said: “I'm deeply honoured to curate the Meltdown festival, especially for the Southbank Centre's 75th anniversary year.
“My goal as the curator is to share the music and art that I love, and to celebrate the rich history of the venue.”
The festival will run from Thursday June 11 until Sunday June 21.
“We both share a passionate belief that music is a vital part of life. It brings us together and the Southbank Centre has been at the heart of it, providing easy access to great music for the past 75 years,” Styles said.
“I'm incredibly grateful to Southbank for having me, it's really exciting for me to have this opportunity in such an iconic venue.”
The announcement comes ahead of the release of Harry Styles' highly anticipated fourth album, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, set to drop in March.
The Grammy-winning artist also recently announced his next global tour, with dates in London, Amsterdam, New York, Sao Paulo, Mexico City, Melbourne, and Sydney starting in May.
Styles launched his solo career after he and fellow One Direction members Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson went on hiatus in 2016, almost a year after Zayn Malik left the group.
The Worcestershire-born star released his self-titled debut solo album in 2017, followed by Fine Line in 2019, and Harry's House (2022) - with the first and third releases reaching number one in the UK charts.
Meltdown has become known for unique performances, with The Smiths' lead singer Morrissey getting a reunited New York Dolls to perform at his 2004 event, Ray Davies restaging 1960s TV pop show Ready Steady Go! in 2011, and Jeff Buckley playing his final UK show at Elvis Costello's Meltdown in 1995.
Mark Ball, artistic director of the Southbank Centre, called Styles an “iconic British artist with a global influence whose impact extends across artistic disciplines, generations and borders”.
“Throughout our 75-year history, the Southbank Centre has existed to give our greatest artists a platform to take creative risks and present work that pushes contemporary culture into new and unexpected directions,” he said.
“Harry Styles' Meltdown feels like a natural expression of what the Southbank Centre exists to do, and we are delighted to become his creative playground in our anniversary year.”
A full lineup and ticket release dates will be announced in the spring.

‘We are prepared to move from defense to offense’: Israel signals harder line in Gaza
Unknown

Israel and Hamas continued to exchange fire over the weekend, despite a fragile ceasefire still in place in Gaza.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
Health officials from the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said eight Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces overnight between Saturday and Sunday. The IDF has yet to comment, though recent days have shown an uptick in clashes.
Hamas says nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces since a ceasefire took effect in October 2025, after two years of war. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed since.
“Things are moving in Gaza,” Dr. Nimrod Goren, president of Mitvim – the Israeli Institute for Regional Foreign Policies, and an executive board member at Diplomeds – The Council for Mediterranean Diplomacy, told The Media Line. “Even if the plan appears questionable in terms of its sequencing and its end game on the ground, the reality on the ground in recent months has improved, and the process is continuing, contrary to expectations. There is a very limited momentum of progress, and if you look at the plan with adjusted expectations, there is room for some satisfaction.”
After completion of the first phase of the deal, which included the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas, a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces, and a halt in large-scale fighting, US President Donald Trump is trying to kickstart the second phase. That phase is expected to include Hamas’ complete disarmament, a full Israeli withdrawal, and the establishment of a technocratic government to administer the territory, removing Hamas as Gaza’s sovereign authority.
For now, violations continue, with both sides blaming each other. Israeli officials have warned that fighting will resume if Hamas does not disarm as mandated by the 20-point peace plan.
The peace plan was adopted by the United Nations Security Council in November 2025, increasing pressure on both sides to comply.
“For Hamas, the goal of the ceasefire was to end the fighting, get humanitarian aid in and rebuild its military capabilities,” Shaul Bartal, a research associate at the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies, told The Media Line. “Hamas sees itself less bound than Israel to Security Council Resolutions and therefore views its attacks against the IDF as legitimate. Israel’s counter-attacks are also considered a violation of the ceasefire.”
Zamir: Not giving up on war objective to demilitarize Hamas
“We are not giving up on the war objective that was set out, which is to completely demilitarize Gaza and disarm Hamas of all its weapons,” IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir told troops stationed along the Yellow Line in Gaza on Friday. “We are prepared to move from defense to offense.”
The military is currently holding positions along a demarcation line known as the “Yellow Line,” established under the October 2025 ceasefire. The line divides the Strip into Israeli-controlled and Palestinian-administered areas.
“This situation could last for years,” Bartal said. “Israel could continue its control of safe areas, backed by several Palestinian militias, and Hamas will rule other parts of Gaza. The potential for a flare-up is always there.”
For decades, Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza lived under a cycle of fragile calm and periodic conflict. The war that began in October 2023 and lasted two years was the deadliest for both sides, leaving much of Gaza in ruins. With neither side taking steps that would force a major political change, there is a risk that the current arrangement hardens into a long-term reality.
“Israel can claim that without its presence, the danger from Hamas would be greater, and Israel’s presence in Gaza allows Hamas to maintain its hold on the remaining parts,” Goren said. “It’s a win- win situation for both Hamas and Netanyahu, because the status quo allows both sides to maintain a presence in Gaza.”
Israeli media have reported that the military has plans in place to renew the offensive against Hamas.
Separately, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar is expected to attend Trump’s first formal Board of Peace meeting in Washington later this week at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The US president is expected to announce a multibillion-dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and unveil detailed plans for the International Stabilization Force, a multinational body intended to train local police, help secure Gaza’s borders, and disarm Hamas while sidelining the terrorist group.
A Palestinian committee expected to oversee Gaza’s reconstruction and participate in postwar governance has yet to enter the territory, despite meeting in Egypt last month.
At the Munich Security Conference on Friday, BoP High Representative for Gaza Nickolay Mladenov said the committee will not be able to enter Gaza or carry out its mission if ceasefire violations continue.
“The fact that Israel still maintains a presence in over half of the Gaza Strip, which is actively supported by several leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, contradicts a lot of statements that were made during the war,” Goren said. “There are many anomalies that leaders and countries are willing to accept, each because of their own interests.”
“Israel’s willingness to participate in the Board of Peace is likely due to an American request and expectation,” he added.
Despite heavy losses during months of fighting, Israeli assessments say Hamas is working to rebuild its capabilities by recruiting new members, reestablishing command-and-control structures, and trying to replenish its arsenal through local weapons production and the recovery of unexploded Israeli ordnance. Israeli officials also say Hamas is attempting to rebuild its tunnel network and restore some rocket-launch capacity.
“Hamas is recovering,” Bartal said. “It is unlikely Israel will return to full-scale fighting, but it could turn the Yellow Line into its border and conduct pinpoint operations aimed at stalling Hamas’ rehabilitation.”
While the ceasefire remains formally in effect, conditions on the ground reflect a delicate balance between continued hostilities and cautious diplomacy. Clashes, targeted strikes, and mutual allegations of violations have tested the truce, even as mediators press forward with efforts to implement the next stages of the 20-point plan.
“The current situation is not ideal for anyone looking for a future of peace and to guarantee that what happened will never happen again,” Goren said. “But this can’t last forever; things have a tendency to rise above the surface.”
Gaza remains caught between the risk of renewed escalation and slow diplomatic progress. Fighting has not fully stopped, and mistrust continues to weigh on the ceasefire. Even so, parallel efforts to advance the next phase of the UN-backed framework suggest international actors and regional stakeholders are still trying to turn a fragile calm into a more durable arrangement.

'Tehran' producer Dana Eden dies at 52 during filming in Greece

Dana Eden, a producer and creator of the show Tehran, died at 52 during filming of the fourth season in Greece, Israeli media confirmed on Monday.
Israeli media reported this morning that Greek news outlets said that Athens police were investigating the possibility that Dana Eden was murdered by agents of the Iranian government, which had been attacking the television series Tehran on its state media since it first premiered.
However, Yonatan Rieger of Channel 12 said Monday morning that this report was “fake news” and that no mention had been made of a murder investigation or Iranian involvement.
Greek news outlets, such as Ta Nea, Documento, and Proto Tema, did report that she was found dead in an Athens hotel room where she had been staying since February 4, that her brother discovered the body, that bruises were found on her neck and limbs, and that pills were found in the room. All these sources said that authorities were investigating the possibility of suicide. Israeli news is reporting her age at 52, while Greek media says she was 53.
Eden began her career in television when she produced the pilot episode of the show Chalomot Ne'urim, which aired in 1998. Since then, she has become one of Israel's most prestigious women producers, working on shows such as Saving the Wildlife, She Has It, Magpie, and Shakshouka.
'Tehran' production company reacts to Eden's death
In 2007, Eden partnered with producer Shula Spiegel to found Donna and Shula Productions, through which Tehran and many of Eden's other works are produced.
"We are shocked and saddened by the untimely passing of our beloved friend and partner, Dana Eden," Donna and Shula Productions told Walla. "Dana, a gifted and internationally renowned creator, has been active in the industry for over thirty years, and over the past eighteen years at the production company Dana and Shula Productions has won multiple awards, including an Emmy Award for producing the international series Tehran."
KAN, a primary Israeli broadcast network that worked with Eden, released a statement on her death, saying that "We are saddened by the passing of our friend and partner in a long line of productions, series, and programs. Dana was among the senior figures in the Israeli television industry and was a central figure in the creation and leadership of some of the most prominent and influential productions in the corporation."
The television series about a Mossad agent played by Niv Sultan, who is trying to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program, won an International Emmy in 2021 for Best Drama series, and is available in Israel on KAN 11 and abroad on Apple TV+.
Its three seasons have been extremely popular on Apple, where the recently released third season, starring Hugh Laurie as a nuclear regulatory investigator, was in its top 10. While the third season was released in Israel in late 2024, it did not start streaming on Apple TV+ until a few weeks ago, and was reportedly delayed due to the Israel-Hamas war.
The series stars many well-known Iranian actors who now live abroad, including Shaun Toub and Navid Negahban. Since filming in Iran was never in the cards, the producers settled on Athens as the best substitute for Tehran from its first season. KAN released the series on its website with Farsi subtitles, so Iranians could watch it.
The Iranian government-linked press criticized the series as Zionist propaganda and was also angered by its depiction of unsanctioned sexual activity among its elite.
The series attracted its first international star, Glenn Close, in its second season, where she played a psychologist who is secretly working to bring down the government.
Eden was interviewed by Ynet following the war between Iran and Israel in June 2025, after she traveled during the war by boat from Israel to Cyprus with her son, actor Gur Eden, who was filming a series, The Saints, for Martin Scorsese in Italy. Gur Eden reportedly plays Jesus in the series.
“For the past two years, I’ve been living in this overlap between reality and the show. We keep asking ourselves whether the events will outpace the series or vice versa. In the end, it’s a suspense thriller, and we want to keep it that way,” she told Ynet.
“I have to admit - we’ve been pretty accurate. Season three is extremely relevant and touches on exactly what’s happening now in the war: centrifuges, efforts to stop Iran from reaching the bomb, nuclear inspectors, and Iran’s deception. Thomas Friedman from The New York Times recommends watching Tehran to understand the Mossad’s work. Even the former FBI director endorsed it.”
Just last week, Eden was active on social media, posting positive reviews for Tehran on Facebook, as well as on-set photos from the filming of the fourth season.

WATCH: IDF, Soroka, Joseftal hospitals carry out first-ever ECMO patient evacuation

A first-of-its-kind helicopter operation was carried out by the Israel Air Force, Soroka Medical Center, Beersheba, and Joseftal Hospital, Eilat, to evacuate a young woman connected to an Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) machine, spokespeople for the hospitals announced on Saturday.
An ECMO is a life-support system that acts as an artificial heart and lungs for patients with critical, life-threatening conditions.
The patient was brought to Joseftal by Magen David Adom paramedics after having been found unconscious, with resuscitation efforts underway.
When she arrived at the hospital, she was transferred to an intensive care unit, but her condition deteriorated due to respiratory instability. The on-call anesthesiologist from Soroka, who was at Joseftal, contacted the head of ECMO at Soroka, and it was decided to connect her to the life-saving system and transfer her immediately.
A military helicopter was dispatched to Soroka, and all required equipment was loaded on board. A team from Soroka's internal intensive care unit boarded the helicopter, flew to Joseftal, carried out complex procedures required to connect the woman to the device, and transported her by helicopter to Beersheba.
Senior Soroka, Joseftal doctors comment on successful transfer operation
"This is a woman in severe medical condition and in life-threatening danger due to severe lung injury. After the team at Joseftal identified that this was a severe lung injury that was not improving with mechanical ventilation, an inquiry was made to Soroka, and it was decided that, due to her severe respiratory condition, it was essential to connect her to ECMO and transfer her by helicopter rather than by ground transport," Dr Ori Galante, director of Soroka's internal intensive care unit, and head of the ECMO program said.
"Patients connected to an ECMO machine are in a condition in which their lungs do not function at all, and their lives depend on the device. Any transfer of a patient in such a condition is extremely complex. Thanks to the cooperation with the Air Force, the helicopter transfer was completed successfully. The patient’s condition is still very severe," Galante noted.
"I thank the excellent team from Soroka and the Air Force for their assistance in saving the woman’s life. Her condition is improving, and I hope she will soon return to full health," Josefthal director Dr. Yaffa Ashur added.

US transports a nuclear microreactor for first time, to show nuclear power

The US Departments of Energy and Defense on Sunday for the first time transported a small nuclear reactor on a cargo plane from California to Utah to demonstrate the potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.
The agencies partnered with California-based Valar Atomics to fly one of the company’s Ward microreactors on a C-17 aircraft, without nuclear fuel, to Hill Air Force Base in Utah.
Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Michael Duffey were on the C-17 flight with the reactor and its components, and hailed the event as a breakthrough for US nuclear energy and military logistics.
“This gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Duffey said.
President Donald Trump's administration sees small nuclear reactors as one of several ways to expand US energy production. Last May, Trump issued four executive orders aimed at boosting domestic nuclear deployment to meet growing energy demand, support national security, and advance competitive AI.
Energy Department issues grants to help accelerate developing modular reactors
The Energy Department in December issued two grants to help accelerate the development of small modular reactors.
Proponents of microreactors have also touted them as energy sources that can be sent to remote locations, offering an alternative to diesel generators, which require frequent fuel deliveries. But skeptics have argued that the industry has not demonstrated that small nuclear reactors can generate power at a reasonable cost.
"There is no business case for microreactors, which, even if they work as designed, will produce electricity at a far higher cost than large nuclear reactors, not to mention renewables like wind or solar," said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The Energy Department plans to have three microreactors reach “criticality,” when a nuclear reaction can sustain itself, by July 4, Wright said.
The microreactor in Sunday's event, a little larger than a minivan, can generate up to 5 megawatts of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, according to Valar CEO Isaiah Taylor. It will start operating in July at 100 kilowatts and peak at 250 kilowatts this year before ramping up to full capacity, he said.
Valar hopes to start selling power on a test basis in 2027 and become fully commercial in 2028. Although private industry funds its own development of nuclear technology, it also needs the federal government “doing some enabling actions to allow fuel fabrication here and uranium enrichment here,” he said.
Fuel for Valar's reactor will be transported from the Nevada National Security site to the San Rafael facility, Wright told reporters.
However, even small generators result in a significant amount of radioactive waste, Lyman said. Other experts have said designers are not compelled to consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for its management.
Although disposal of nuclear waste remains unresolved, the Energy Department is in talks with a few states, including Utah, to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal, Wright said.

Events have started in Cappadocia as 2026 has been designated the “Year of the Horse” according to the Chinese zodiac calendar.
The program, held at an event area set up by the Cappadocia Area Directorate in the town of Göreme, began with the national anthems of Türkiye and the People’s Republic of China.
Deputy Culture and Tourism Minister Gökhan Yazgı said in his speech that Türkiye hosted approximately 64 million visitors last year, generating $65.2 billion in tourism revenue.
Emphasizing that significant progress has been made in line with the strategy of spreading tourism across all 12 months and 81 provinces, Yazgı said this model has made Türkiye’s high value-added, sustainable and balanced tourism growth permanent.
Noting that a visa-free travel policy has been introduced for citizens of the People’s Republic of China alongside an intensive promotional campaign, Yazgı said, “As stated in our medium-term program, our tourism revenue target for 2026 is $68 billion. One of the markets we are focusing on most for 2026 is China. China holds a strategic position with its high visitor potential, strong travel culture and increasing spending capacity. In 2024, we hosted more than 425,000 Chinese guests. Our medium-term target is 1 million Chinese visitors.”
“We see this step not merely as a convenience but as a natural extension of our historical ties rooted in the Silk Road and a sincere gesture of friendship extended to the Chinese people. Our goal is to make Türkiye the most accessible Mediterranean destination for Chinese citizens. To this end, we have significantly strengthened our air connections. The weekly flight quota has been increased from 21 to 49 and new direct routes have been launched,” he added.
Yazgı said that as 2026 corresponds to the “Year of the Horse” in the Chinese calendar, Cappadocia has gained special significance.
“In this unique geography historically known as the ‘Land of Beautiful Horses,’ horse shows, thematic festivals, cultural and artistic events and special tour programs targeting the Chinese market will be organized as part of the work carried out by the Cappadocia Area Directorate,” he added.
Chinese Ambassador to Ankara Jiang Xuebin said that under the strategic leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping and President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, relations between China and Türkiye continue to develop.
Stressing that growing bilateral relations have been reflected in cooperation in education, culture and the economy, Xuebin said, “China’s traditional Spring Festival is not only a day when families come together but also keeps Chinese values such as peace and harmony alive. It also reflects shared values such as the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. The inclusion of the Spring Festival in UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2024 demonstrates the contemporary vitality of Chinese civilization. On the occasion of this event, I hope for the further development of past mutual interaction and cooperation in humanitarian fields.”
Nevşehir Governor Ali Fidan said he believes the event will contribute to the development of relations between China and Türkiye.
Such events will make respect for shared culture more visible, Fidan said, noting that Cappadocia hosts millions of visitors each year.
“We know that citizens of the People’s Republic of China also show interest in our region. The number was 26,000 in 2023, rose to 89,000 in 2024 and reached 115,000 last year,” he said.
MHP Deputy Group Chair and Nevşehir lawmaker Filiz Kılıç, Nevşehir Mayor Rasim Arı and Cappadocia Area President Aydın Cem Aslanbay also delivered speeches during the program.
After a recital by Chinese artist Ma Tianyi, participants toured the gastronomy street.
As part of the event, attendees watched a 3D mapping show and a drone performance forming various figures in the sky above an area where specially designed hot air balloons were placed.

Disney has sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance accusing the Chinese company of using Disney characters to train and power its Seedance 2.0 AI video generator without permission, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Disney said ByteDance had pre‑packaged Seedance with a pirated library of copyrighted characters from franchises including Star Wars and Marvel, portraying them as if they were public-domain clip art, the person said.
The letter alleges Seedance is reproducing, distributing, and creating derivative works featuring Spider-Man, Darth Vader, and other characters, the person added.
ByteDance will strengthen safeguards on its Seedance 2.0 AI video tool to prevent the unauthorized use of copyrighted characters and celebrity likenesses, the Chinese firm told the BBC on Sunday.
ByteDance did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Paramount Skydance also sent a cease-and-desist to ByteDance
Online news outlet Axios was the first to report on Disney's move. Paramount Skydance has also sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing the Chinese firm of engaging in "blatant infringement" of its intellectual property, Variety reported at the weekend.
Videos generated by Seedance 2.0, which was released last week, have gone viral in China, including one of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in a fight. The AI model has been compared to DeepSeek and has been praised for its ability to produce cinematic storylines with just a few prompts.
Disney has taken similar actions against Character.AI, demanding that the startup immediately stop the unauthorized use of its copyrighted characters.
In December, Disney signed a licensing deal with OpenAI, letting the startup use characters from Star Wars, Pixar, and Marvel franchises in its Sora video generator.

The Istanbul State Opera and Ballet (IDOB) has staged the world premieres of the contemporary operas “Deli Dumrul” (Mad Dumrul) and “Tehlikeli Oyun” (Dangerous Play) at the Kadıköy Municipality Süreyya Opera House.
According to a statement from IDOB, the premiere performance of “Tehlikeli Oyun” was dedicated to the memory of former IDOB Director and Artistic Director, opera singer and academic Professor Mesut İktu, who recently passed away.
Speaking at the premiere, IDOB Director and Artistic Director Caner Akgün said the audience was witnessing a historic evening.
Emphasizing that the continuation of the operatic tradition from generation to generation is only possible through the creation of new works, Akgün said, “The geography we live in, our historical, philosophical and literary richness, lives on through the creation of new works within the concept of opera, which represents the sum of all art forms. The İstanbul State Opera and Ballet and the General Directorate of State Opera and Ballet carry out the most important and highest-quality work in culture and arts in line with the reforms of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. As in the rest of the world, works that nourish society in the right and diverse ways emerge in this way in our country as well.
“In light of all this, we dedicate this evening to the valuable baritone and man of art, Professor Mesut İktu, who rendered great services to our institution and values and whom we recently lost. We will carry his legacy into the future.”
With a libretto by Mehmet Ergüven and music by Mesruh Savaş, “Tehlikeli Oyun” was staged for the first time. The opera tells the story of a relationship between two people that turns into a psychological confrontation in a closed setting.
Set in the visiting room of a prison in the 1920s, the work is built on dialogue between a woman and a man. Sections featuring quotations from different composers and black-and-white short film scenes reflecting the couple’s past and memories support the narrative structure.
Directed by Nazlı İktu, the production featured the IDOB Orchestra conducted by Murat Kodallı. Set and costume design was by Nilsu Baldan and lighting design by Bersan Baş. Soloists Şebnem Ağrıdağ Kışlalı and Alper Göçeri performed in the premiere.
With a libretto by Sinan Bayraktar and enriched by the melodies of composer Çetin Işıközlü, “Deli Dumrul” stands out as the first opera work notable for its ballet-driven structure.
Based on a tale from the Book of Dede Korkut, “Deli Dumrul” offers a staging inspired by the dramatic narrative tradition of Turkish cinema and theater. The work is also distinguished as Türkiye’s first one-man opera, structured as a poetic narrative.
Directed by Cenk Bıyık, the production featured the IDOB Orchestra conducted by Murat Kodallı. Set and costume design was by Tan Ergin, lighting design by Gürkan Dökmetaş and choreography by Deniz Özaydın.
Burak Kul performed the role of Deli Dumrul in the premiere, while Tuğrul Savaşçı, Cansın Kaleci and Deniz Özaydın appeared on stage as dancers.
The Feb. 17 performance of the work will be dedicated to former Istanbul State Opera and Ballet director and artistic director, opera singer Sedat Öztoprak, on the sixth anniversary of his death.
Both works will continue to meet art lovers at the Kadıköy Municipality Süreyya Opera House on Feb. 20, 24 and 27 and March 13.

Mystery of burnt bread

Toward the end of the excavation season at the Küllüoba prehistoric archaeological site near Eskişehir, in central Türkiye, something miraculous happened. It was late in September 2024 and the archaeologists were about to wrap up the season’s findings and close the excavation site until the next season. And then, suddenly, a small finding was discovered on the doorway of a building. There it was: A small, round, disc-like substance, with only a bite-sized fragment missing. It was completely charred and carbonized. The archaeologists soon realized that it was the remains of burnt bread. That piece of carbonized bread was about shed new light on the history of bread and contribute to writing the agricultural history of Anatolia.
A bread story
The discovery of the bread immediately made headlines in local newspapers, leading to the writing of a completely different story. Upon seeing the news, Ünsal Yamaner, the general manager of Lasaffre Türkiye, which is also based in Eskişehir, got very excited and wanted to meet with the excavation director right away. The next day, they were already discussing future projects with Professor Murat Türkteki, the head of the excavation. This paved the way for a wonderful collaboration, with Lasaffre Türkiye becoming one of the leading sponsors of the Küllüoba excavation, not only as a producer of yeast and bakery products, but also with the prospect of contributing to culinary history.
Another exciting development came from the Eskişehir Metropolitan Municipality, one of Küllüoba’s major sponsors. Soon, the R&D team of Eskişehir Halk Ekmek started experimenting with recreating the ancient bread. Halk Ekmek, translated as “Public Bread,” is a municipal organization aiming to provide people with low-cost and high-quality bread. After searching for the appropriate wheat type, they succeeded with the “gernik/kavılca” variety, which is the closest wheat variety to the ancient one, luckily still cultivated in certain parts of Anatolia. Since May 2025, Eskişehir Halk Ekmek has been producing bread that is as close as possible to the original Küllüoba bread, preserving this ancient culinary heritage for the future.
Old bread from the Oldest City of the ‘Old City’
Eskişehir means “Old City” in Turkish. Küllüoba is considered as the oldest city in Eskişehir, aka the old city. Küllüoba deserves this title with its 5,000-year history; of course, that is for the time being, since there are about 200 prehistoric sites in the region that are yet to be excavated and older settlements could be unearthed at any time. Küllüoba provides important data on the history of agriculture and food, particularly with its early Bronze Age findings, such as this carbonized bread found almost intact. According to radiocarbon analysis, the bread dates to 3100 BC, making it a uniquely rare example from an archaeological perspective. The bread has a round, disc-like shape, 12 cm in diameter, 2.5 cm in thickness. It is made from coarsely ground emmer wheat, botanically “Triticum dicoccum,” and also contains lentils, Lens culinaris. Tiny air pockets in the dough indicate that the bread was likely leavened and kneaded. Most interestingly, it was found at the doorway of a house, under a layer of sterile soil, almost as if it had been laid there as an offering, or as part of a ritual. This discovery not only demonstrates the skill of Early Bronze Age people in bread-making, but also highlights the symbolic meaning that bread carried for them. That small, blackened fragment from Küllüoba, possibly the oldest bread found in Anatolia so far, speaks to us across 5,000 years — telling the story of how food was not only just for survival, but also a vital part of belief, identity and ritual.
Culinary heritage for the future
So, why is Küllüoba bread important? Anatolia and Mesopotamia, also known as the Fertile Crescent, are where the Neolithic Revolution began. The transition of humanity from hunter-gatherer communities to agriculture and settled life happened on these lands. First, wild wheat was harvested and then cultivated. The transition from cave life to settled life, in parallel with the development of agriculture, happened here. As grain cultivation developed, the first cities and city-states were formed. In a sense, the development of the Anatolian civilization was tied to the cultivation of wheat, barley and similar grains.
Grinding wheat into flour and making bread from flour is another story. Wheat was probably first consumed in whole grain form, similar to today’s “keşkek,” a wheat berry stew or porridge, commonly served as a communal wedding dish throughout Anatolia. Wheat must have also been turned into “bulgur,” which is parboiled and dried cracked whole wheat berries, a product that can be stored for a long time without fear of rotting or sprouting, still a staple food of Anatolian cookery. The first bread was likely unleavened and flat. The making of leavened bread from ground wheat most probably developed later. Over time, even the wheat varieties diversified and wheat itself evolved.
Excavations are important not only for discovering and understanding history, but also for preserving cultural heritage for the future and learning about the past. Unfortunately, prehistoric excavations like Küllüoba are rare, making it extremely difficult to write the history of bread based solely on archaeological findings. It is still unclear whether the piece of uncooked dough formerly found at Çatalhöyük was actually a bread or a porridge-like dish. The first breads were probably flat, thin, unleavened dough breads similar to today’s lavash. Anatolia is also the cradle of ancient wheat varieties. Indeed, it is still possible to make Küllüoba bread using ancient wheat varieties that have not been lost, such as kavılca, gernik and siyez. Thanks to Küllüoba, efforts have already begun to cultivate these wheat varieties mainly around Eskişehir and to preserve our agricultural heritage. On the other hand, Küllüoba revealed interesting data about agricultural history. For instance, during periods of drought, people turned to dry farming and cultivated vetch instead of wheat or barley, which required more irrigation. With climate change being a major threat and, with groundwater resources drying up, that is a lesson learned from the past. This is why archaeology is important: It builds a bridge from history to the future for a sustainable planet.

Three swans that became exhausted during migration are being remotely monitored, fed and tracked by camera traps by teams from the Düzce Directorate of Nature Conservation and National Parks.
The two adult swans and one juvenile stopped about a month ago at the Efteni Lake Wildlife Development Area, where they have been kept under observation without disturbing their natural habitat.
Teams are protecting the animals from a distance and carefully feeding the “guests” along the shores while monitoring them with camera traps.
“We expect citizens to protect such birds when they see them,” said Düzce Nature Conservation and National Parks Branch Director Mevlüt Şanlı Şimşek.
Speaking to state-run Anadolu Agency, Şimşek said the lake has been visited this year by a family of three swans — mother, father and offspring.
Noting that the region is not located on a main migration route and that the species is therefore rarely seen in the area, Şimşek said swans prefer mild climates.
“These delicate species usually stay in reed beds, ponds and canals. They migrate from cold climates to warmer ones. When winters are particularly harsh in northern countries, they visit our country. The species exists in the literature of our Efteni Lake, but visits are very rare,” he said.
Şimşek stated that the swans have been hosted around Efteni Lake and its surroundings for about a month.
“We will continue to monitor these beautiful animals as long as they remain in the area. When the weather warms up, our birds will return to the region they came from. We plan to accompany our birds until they migrate,” he said.
Highlighting the importance of swans for wetlands, Şimşek said they help spread aquatic plants by creating movement in the water and contribute to the continuity and sustainability of wetland ecosystems.

Antalya, a major tourist and agricultural hub on Türkiye’s Mediterranean coast, has braved an extraordinary deluge in a mere 40 days, remarkably matching the city’s entire rainfall for the previous year.
According to official data, the city recorded around 550 kilograms of rain per square meter in a single month-long stretch, matching the total rainfall of the entire last year.
For nearly six weeks, these intermittent but intense downpours have ravaged homes, workplaces and greenhouses, prompting local authorities to launch urgent damage assessment efforts across the region.
Heavy rain also triggered landslides and road collapses.
Meteorology regional director Murat Ayvazoğlu said rainfall has dominated weather conditions since early January, occasionally reaching severe levels.
Temperatures have remained above seasonal averages, increasing the impact of heavy rain.
This extreme weather pattern escalated into severe flooding across multiple districts, particularly Alanya.
Heavy rains, accompanied by storms, submerged residential areas, farmland and businesses. In several districts, schools were temporarily closed.
At Dim Dam, water levels reached critical thresholds, prompting authorities to release water through spillways.
Residents living in ground and basement floors were urgently evacuated, with municipal buses providing transport to public shelters.
Rivers such as Dim River, Oba Stream and Köprüçay River overflowed, damaging picnic areas, roads and agricultural land.
In the Serik district, emergency teams rescued 27 dogs trapped by floodwaters, while in other areas, livestock and infrastructure suffered losses.
As the storm system moved west, Muğla also experienced severe flooding.
According to the officials, initial assessments show damage to 5,773 decares of agricultural land and 550 decares of greenhouses.
Floodwaters affected 44 homes and workplaces, three trout farms and forced the evacuation of 20 houses.
Authorities reported losses including 35 tons of farmed fish, livestock deaths and damage to roads and bridges at 14 locations.
Further north, in Aydın, persistent rainfall caused the Büyük Menderes River to overflow once more.
This time, farmlands in the İncirliova district were submerged.
Teams from the state hydraulic works cleared debris blocking water flow under bridges, while local officials warned residents about waste accumulation increasing flood risks.
Meteorological authorities continue to urge residents across southwestern Türkiye to follow official warnings closely and take precautions against flooding and landslides.

Turkish salmon revenues have surged by 39 percent year-on-year to reach a staggering $32.19 million in January alone, marking a powerful start to 2026 as the industry ignited the trade year with an explosive performance.
According to data compiled from the Eastern Black Sea Exporters’ Association (DKİB), Turkish salmon reached 11 different international markets during the month.
In terms of quantity, exports experienced a 51 percent year-on-year increase, reaching 4,792 tons compared to the 3,178 tons recorded in January of the previous year.
By destination, Russia remained the largest market, accounting for $24.6 million of total exports. It was followed by Vietnam and Belarus.
Turkish salmon are raised in inland freshwater farms until they reach a specific weight and are then transferred to sea cages in the Black Sea for further growth.
This strategic approach propelled the Eastern Black Sea region to account for a significant 32.5 percent share of Türkiye’s total Turkish salmon exports in January.
Within the region, Trabzon province played a leading role, accounting for $9.91 million of the total export value.
Saffet Kalyoncu, chairman of the DKİB, said the strong performance in January reflects growing international demand for Turkish salmon, both nationally and regionally.
“Our goal is to establish Turkish salmon as a stronger and more recognized brand in global markets,” Kalyoncu said, noting that the industry aims to further expand production capacity, enter new markets and strengthen international promotion through overseas trade fairs.

Iran's foreign minister has arrived in Geneva ahead of a second round of negotiations with the United States, Iranian state television said Monday, as Washington keeps up pressure on the Islamic republic.
According to Tehran, "indirect" Iran-U.S. nuclear talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday, although Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed including Iran's ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies.
During his visit to Geneva, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials, the foreign ministry statement said.
Tehran and Washington restarted negotiations in Muscat on Feb. 6, months after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June that started a 12-day war.
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fate of Iran's stockpile of more than 400 kilogrammes of 60-percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors in June.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal between the two must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran's ability to enrich more.
"There should be no enrichment capability... dismantle the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said during a speech in Jerusalem.
Meanwhile, Iran's deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the Islamic republic's economy.
"If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.
The latest talks came with Washington having threatened Tehran with military action and deployed an aircraft carrier group to the region following Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
On Feb. 6, Araghchi led the Iranian delegation in indirect nuclear talks with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner in Muscat.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to AFP that the two men, who have been Trump's lead Iran negotiators, would represent Washington for the talks.
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
It has represented U.S. interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
Iranian deputy foreign minister for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said Tehran was seeking a deal with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, particularly in sectors such as aviation, mining and oil and gas, the Fars news agency reported.
"For the agreement to be viable, it is essential that the United States also be able to benefit from it in areas with strong and rapid economic return potential," he was quoted as saying.

Locksley forges super high-purity antimony in US tests
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Locksley Resources’ recent metallurgical testwork has forged more than 99 per cent in pure metallic antimony from material sourced at its flagship Desert Antimony Mine in the US state of California.
The company’s ongoing metallurgical optimisation program is sharpening its pathway toward defence-grade antimony, marking a critical step in anchoring a secure, fully domestic US supply chain for this strategic mineral. The metallurgical testwork is also a vital step in confirming its process flowsheet.
The company says XRD and Rietveld refinement testing have delivered antimony that is now knocking on the door of US defence specifications, spurring a series of technical and commercial meetings with strategic partners to advance its domestic mine-to-market strategy.
Last year, management engaged the servicers of the renowned US metallurgical and processing firm, Hazen Research.
‘Metallurgical testing marks an important step forward as we continue to systematically advance the Mojave project.’Locksley Resources managing director and chief executive officer Kerrie Matthews
Hazen was tasked with producing antimony metal solely in the US from ore sourced from Locksley’s Mojave project’s deposit and processed into a concentrate, with no offshore processing an important condition of the allotted task. Mojave forms part of the wider Desert Antimony Mine project.
The outcome was significant for the potential restart of domestic antimony production, with Hazen producing a 100 per cent American-made antimony ingot from the Mojave material.
The result provided technical validation that a US supply chain reliant on local expertise and infrastructure is possible.
A Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the two firms to assess the optimal toll-treating options for the high-grade antimony-bearing material from the Desert Antimony Mine.
The company is now assessing a low-capital start-up scenario, focusing on initial production and revenue generation while longer-term development studies are completed.
Locksley Resources managing director and chief executive officer Kerrie Matthews said: “This collaboration with Hazen Industries and the advancement of metallurgical testing mark an important step forward as we continue to systematically advance the Mojave project. Advancing exploration alongside downstream processing validation strengthens our integrated development pathway and reinforces our commitment to rapidly unlocking value at Mojave”.
The company also plans to focus on the manufacture and qualification of antimony trioxide and antimony trisulphide.
Antimony trioxide is a critical component in electronics, plastics, fire retardants and energy applications. Antimony trisulphide is used as a strategic industrial material for pigments and pyrotechnics and used in defence systems, primers and specialty chemicals.
Locksley will prepare product samples for supply to potential US offtake and qualification partners. It says achieving a recognised product standard is essential to securing long-term offtake agreements and integration into industrial and defence products.
Today’s positive metallurgical results follow hot on the heels of the company’s reveal last week that it has scored a prized Affiliate Membership role with the US Department of Energy’s (DOE) Critical Materials Innovation Hub (CMI), a consortium focused on the security of US critical mineral supply chains.
The flagship Mojave project, prospective for large-scale antimony and rare earths resources, could now be in the box seat to benefit from a series of cutting-edge research and development (R&D) projects.
The company’s US-based subsidiary, Enigma Strategic Minerals, has been welcomed into the CMI fold, along with the potential to participate in various coveted DOE-funded R&D projects. The Critical Materials hub is a DOE innovation hub led by the Ames National Laboratory in Iowa.
Ames is a top-level national laboratory for research on national security, energy and the environment.
The CMI’s primary objective is to develop technology solutions to minimise reliance on supply chains from foreign nations for critical minerals vital for renewable energy, electric-vehicle technologies and national security.
The ability to produce greater than 99 per cent purity metallic antimony is a huge forward leap for the company’s Mojave project, as the aspiring producer eyes antimony and rare earths glory.
Locksley has its sights firmly set on commercially viable mineralisation at the Desert Antimony mine. This breakthrough could pave the way for US production-scale operations as the world’s most powerful nation scrambles to lock in a domestic supply of the munitions-critical metal.

'No regrets.' Belarusian activist opens up on Germany exile
February 16, 2026In 2020, Maria Kolesnikova — alongside activists Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and Veronika Tsepkalo — was a key figure in the Belarusian opposition, set against the country's strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko.
During anti-government protests, Belarusian authorities detained Kolesnikova and took her to the Ukrainian border for expulsion. However, in the neutral zone, she broke away from security forces, ripped up her passport, making legal border crossing impossible, and fled on foot back to Belarus.
She was subsequently charged with conspiracy to seize power, among other things, and sentenced to 11 years in prison.
In mid-December, 2025, following international pressure and a US-brokered deal with Lukashenko, she was one of 123 political prisoners released from Belarusian prison. At least 1,100 political prisoners remain imprisoned.
Today, the professional flautist lives in a friend's apartment in the German capital, Berlin, but says she's looking for her own place there. German authorities granted her political asylum and invited her to Germany, where she received medical care.
"I feel much better than I did during the past five years," she says.
While in prison, where she spent months in isolation, she contracted a life-threatening condition that required intensive care. She had been healthy prior to her incarceration.
What Belarusians need from the EU
She currently relies on her family for financial support and does not receive any benefits from the German state. "But I can still work, and of course, that's what I'm going to do," she says.
Kolesnikova has a German travel document for foreigners and a visa, but she hasn't yet obtained a new Belarusian ID. She and the political prisoners she was released with were exiled without any papers.
"All other documents are still in the works. The German side has been very supportive, and I'm very grateful for that. Efforts are also being made to sort out issues with my bank," she explains.
While in jail, her German bank account had been blocked — as a citizen of Belarus, she, too, had been affected by sanctions. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the support Belarus provided to Russia, the European Union sanctioned both countries.
Kolesnikova argues that the trouble she's having with her bank account demonstrates how sanctions harm ordinary citizens without really affecting leaders like Lukashenko or Russian President Vladimir Putin.
"I can't complain, I'm receiving so much support from so many people. But thousands of Belarusians are not. Politicians in Europe and Germany don't grasp the pain of Belarusian citizens," she says. "There is a huge divide between them [European and German politicians] and Belarusian refugees."
To bridge this, she suggests European politicians pursue three goals "once the question of diplomatic initiatives between the EU and Lukashenko arises." EU politicians should push for the freeing of political prisoners in Belarus, the end of political repression there as well as the end of the counrty's isolation.
For now, Kolesnikova says, the most important step is the first one. "Everyone criticized me for thanking Lukashenko," she says referring to a press conference in Ukraine after her release, where she thanked the dictator for freeing prisoners. "I would thank the devil if it meant people were set free."
Kolesnikova also worries about her homeland's isolation. "It's important to end the country's isolation," she says. "It turns out it's only benefiting Putin." Belarusians who do not study abroad, or travel to the EU and or have connections to European culture, eventually turn eastward, she suggests.
Belarus will be 'free one day'
Before 2020, Kolesnikova spent 13 years in Germany. "I'm well integrated in German society and have lots of friends here," she says. "I'm part of a large community of artists, and that's where our strength lies. In the last six years, they worked on dozens of projects that they dedicated to me, raising awareness for political prisoners in Belarus."
Now that she has started granting interviews to German media, Kolesnikova says more people recognize her on the street. "People approach me and say they support Belarus and believe the country will be free one day," she notes. "I'm not used to things like that. But of course, it's nice when people recognize me and start talking about Belarus."
During the conversation, Kolesnikova also touches on the 2020 protests against Lukashenko following a presidential election widely criticized as a sham. Lukashenko's government responded to the protests harshly, jailing thousands. It's estimated that half a million Belarusians fled the country because of this. Even now, the Lukashenko regime still arrests people who took part in those protests six years ago.
Kolesnikova says she doesn't regret anything that happened back then.
"All Belarusians could see that in 2020, we were closer than ever to change. We didn't get there with a bloody revolution, but with democratic means," she says.
"The fact that Lukashenko got so scared and turned to such violence is another thing entirely. None of us is to blame for that. It was the decision of certain officers, security forces and Alexander Lukashenko himself to lock people up, to beat and mistreat them."

Former energy minister Halushchenko served with notice of suspicion in Midas case
Ukraine's former energy minister Herman Halushchenko has been served with a notice of suspicion in connection with the Midas case.
Source: National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU)
Details: Halushchenko has been accused under Article 255.2 (participation in a criminal organisation) and Article 209.3 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (legalisation of proceeds from crime).
Investigators revealed that a fund had been registered in Anguilla, a self-governing UK overseas territory, in February 2021 on the initiative of members of the criminal organisation linked to the Midas case. The fund aimed to attract around US$100 million in investments.
The fund was headed by a long-time associate of the criminal group, a citizen of the Seychelles and Saint Kitts and Nevis, who provided professional services for laundering money obtained illegally.
Reports indicated that Halushchenko's family had been among the fund's "investors".
Quote from NABU: "To conceal his involvement, two companies were set up in the Marshall Islands, integrated into a trust structure registered in Saint Kitts and Nevis. The companies listed the former spouse and four children of the senior official as beneficiaries.
These companies became 'investors' in the fund (by purchasing its shares) and members of the criminal organisation began transferring funds to the fund's accounts in three Swiss banks on behalf of the suspect."
Details: Investigators reported that during Halushchenko's time in office, over US$112 million in cash had been obtained illegally from the energy sector through his trusted associate known as Rocket (former advisor to the energy minister Ihor Myroniuk).
The funds were laundered using various financial instruments, including cryptocurrency and investments in the fund.
So far, over US$7.4 million has been transferred to the fund's accounts managed by Halushchenko's family.
An additional CHF 1.3 million (about US$1.69 million) and €2.4 million were given in cash or directly transferred to the former minister's family in Switzerland.
Part of the money was spent on his children's education at prestigious Swiss schools and deposited into his ex-wife's accounts.
The remainder was placed in a deposit, generating additional income for the family to use as they wished.
According to Ukrainska Pravda sources in political circles, NABU and the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) detained Halushchenko on the night of 14-15 February while he attempted to cross the border.

Detention of ex-Ukrainian justice minister signals Zelensky's looming collapse — Duma

SIMFEROPOL, February 16. /TASS/. The arrest of former Ukrainian Energy and Justice Minister German Galushchenko is another sign of Vladimir Zelensky’s imminent downfall, Mikhail Sheremet, a State Duma lawmaker from Crimea and a member of the Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, told TASS.
Earlier, Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau confirmed that Galushchenko, implicated in the case of businessman Timur Mindich, was detained while attempting to leave the country. Galushchenko served as minister of energy from 2021 to 2025. He later headed the Ministry of Justice for several months before being dismissed over his alleged involvement in a corruption scandal.
"These events are a powerful indicator that the Kiev regime’s ship has sprung a leak that can no longer be plugged by obedient sailors. That is why Zelensky’s corrupt entourage, like cunning rats, began to scatter, spreading panic on the rickety vessel, signaling a tightening noose around the neck of the Ukrainian dictator and another collapse of Nazism, which was revived with the help of the West," Sheremet said.
Mindich case
On November 10, 2025, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office announced an investigation into a major corruption scheme in the energy sector, dubbed Operation Midas. Searches were conducted at the Energoatom energy company and at the residences of entrepreneur Timur Mindich and Justice Minister German Galushchenko, who was later suspended. Galushchenko had served as the country’s energy minister at the time of the alleged offenses. Investigators said that participants in the scheme had laundered about $100 million. NABU also began releasing recordings of conversations from Mindich’s apartment that revealed discussions of corrupt practices.
On November 11, charges were also brought against former Deputy Prime Minister and former Minister of National Unity Alexey Chernyshov, along with Mindich. Mindich, who some have called Zelensky’s "wallet," left the country hours before the searches began and is now in Israel. On November 17, reports said that Andrey Yermak might appear in the case files under the pseudonym Ali Baba. Searches were conducted at his office and apartment on November 28, and Zelensky dismissed him later the same day.

EU official says Türkiye key to middle corridor to China

European Union Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos said Türkiye is a “critical partner” for regional transport and connectivity projects aimed at strengthening Europe’s access to Central Asia and China.
Kos spoke at a panel on deepening Trans-Caspian cooperation at the 62nd Munich Security Conference, attended by Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, among others.
She said progress in Armenia-Azerbaijan talks has opened space for practical cooperation and argued that connectivity initiatives will only work if regional actors move in step, describing a “multi-layered” regional picture that also includes Türkiye.
Kos said the EU is building a pipeline of projects with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Türkiye and stressed the need for private investment alongside public financing for large infrastructure plans.
She also pointed to ongoing discussions on launching a feasibility study for a railway project involving Nakhchivan — Azerbaijan’s exclave bordering Türkiye, Armenia and Iran — calling it an area where cooperation could prove a “game changer.”
The EU has been backing what it calls the Trans-Caspian Transport Corridor, also known as the “Middle Corridor,” as an alternative route linking Europe and Asia via the South Caucasus and the Caspian Sea.
Brussels says the broader corridor aims to connect Europe and Central Asia with a target transit time of 15 days.
In earlier EU briefings on the project, Kos said cargo along the Middle Corridor has grown sharply since 2022 and could triple again by 2030 if bottlenecks are addressed and capacity expanded.

Key Takeaways from the ISW:
- The Kremlin continues to discuss future elections in Ukraine to advance its false claim that the current Ukrainian government is illegitimate and insists on means of controlling Ukraine’s politics.
- The Kremlin continues to signal that it will reject any election result that does not produce such a pro-Russia government in Ukraine.
- Long-term, meaningful US security guarantees for Ukraine must precede a war termination agreement to prevent the Kremlin from following through on its stated intent to reject such guarantees after Ukraine has committed to ceding territory.
- General Staff Army General Valery Gerasimov continues to aggrandize Russian seizures of small villages and fields to influence ongoing negotiations and push the West and Ukraine to give in to Russian territorial demands.
- Russian gains continue to move at a footpace and do not portend the collapse of the Ukrainian lines.
- Recent Ukrainian tactical counterattacks have reportedly liberated multiple small settlements along the Yanchur and Haichur rivers in the Oleksandrivka and Hulyaipole directions.
- Russia is reportedly testing a stratospheric communications system as an alternative to Starlink, which some Russian milbloggers have already dismissed as an inadequate replacement.
- Ukrainian forces recently advanced in northern Kharkiv Oblast and in the Oleksandrivka and Hulyaipole directions.

ALBAWABA - Two U.S. veterans were arrested at the Senate after protesting against sending aid to Israel, accusing Washington of being complicit in the 'genocide in Gaza', activists said on X.
A video resurfaced online showing two U.S. veterans, who were identified as Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Aguilar and Josephine Guilbeau, arrested on Sunday night for opposing Washington's continued aid to Tel Aviv.
Guilbeau and Aguilar were at a Senate hearing when they spoke up, accusing the government of being complicit in the war in the Gaza Strip, but they were immediately taken by American security guards and dragged out of the room.
While being taken, Anthony Aguilar said, "Every American sitting at home right now needs to realize that you are paying for a genocide. Rise up, Rise up America, it is time to take back America from these corrupt politicians, it is beyond time..."
Josephine Guilbeau continued, "Rise up, America, rise up. It's time to take this country from these corrupt politicians." "It's time. It's beyond time," she continued.
What's the truth behind the video?
However, after checking the video, it turned out to be old footage from 2025. According to AJ Plus, the video first emerged for the first time last September, but it does show the arrest of Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Aguilar and Josephine Guilbeau after they opposed sending aid to Israel during a hearing at the Senate.

Return of Sardinia’s griffon vultures hailed as one of Italy’s greatest conservation success stories

In 2014, Sardinia’s Eurasian griffon vulture population had shrunk to around 60.
Sardinia's griffon vultures were on the brink of extinction at the beginning of 2010.
The population of the birds had been plummeting due to indirect poisoning, including from pesticides and chemicals ingested by animals they fed on.
But today, the Italian island is home to more than 500 individuals, making it one of Italy’s most impressive conservation success stories.
Sardinia’s griffon vultures risked extinction
In 2014, Sardinia’s Eurasian griffon vulture population had shrunk to around 60, with the colony living solely between Bosa and Alghero on the west coast.
Toxic food sources were the main culprit of their demise, causing them to accidentally ingest pesticides, chemicals and lead shot from scavenged animals like wild boar killed by hunters.
The birds were also targeted by direct culling, despite not posing a threat to humans or livestock.
The decline of the species risked ripple effects in Sardinia’s ecosystem, as griffon vultures ‘clean up’ carcasses, helping to remove potentially dangerous bacteria that could cause infectious diseases in other animals.
Sardinia launches projects to save disappearing griffon vulture population
From 2015 to 2020, a European Commission-funded project began a push to reverse the decline in the griffon vulture population.
The ‘Life Under Griffon Wings’ project focused on the Bosa area, where it worked to increase food availability, reduce disturbances in nesting areas, and raise public awareness.
In 2021, a sister project was launched. ‘Life Safe for Vultures’ will run until the end of 2026 with a budget of over €3 million and the participation of partners including the University of Sassari, the Forestas Agency, the Sardinian Forestry Corps and the Vulture Conservation Foundation.
The scheme has created feeding stations - known as carnai - to ensure a safe and regular food source for the vultures.
It has also improved the safety of power lines - where birds risked electrocution - and raised awareness among hunters about the use of lead-free ammunition to reduce cases of poisoning.
Griffon vultures start to thrive on Sardinia
Beyond improving safety, a key effort of the project has been to release young griffon vultures - many from rescue centres in Spain - back into areas of Sardinia where the species has been absent for decades.
The final 15 individuals arrived from Barcelona in January, according to Italian daily La Repubblica. They are currently acclimatising in an aviary and will be released into the wild later in the year.
The idea is not just to boost the population of griffon vultures, but to increase their distribution across the island, too.
The latest census is testimony to the project’s success. The population of griffon vultures now stands between 516 and 566 individuals, a 21 per cent increase compared to 2024.
While around 60 per cent of individuals still live in Bosa, colonies are growing in central and southern Sardinia, too.
Results from monitoring the species’ reproduction are also positive. In 2025, a total of 120 territorial pairs were counted in northwestern Sardinia, the griffon vulture's only breeding area on the island.
This represents a 14.3 per cent increase on 2024’s numbers, according to Fiammetta Berlinguer, the scientific director of Safe for Vultures.
The number of fledged young has also increased by 15.5 per cent. The researchers also note that restocked individuals and native Sardinian birds have successfully formed pairs.
"The ultimate goal is ambitious: to extend the griffon vulture's range across the entire island, reconnecting the northern populations with new nesting sites in southern Sardinia,” the Forestas Agency told Italian media.

Families bid to take over their children’s care home that amassed huge tax debts
Unknown

A group of families have launched an audacious bid to take over their disabled children’s residential care home after it emerged the charity running it faces closure after amassing huge tax debts and paying £1m in fees to one of its trustees.
William Blake House faces a potential winding up order in seven weeks and is under investigation by regulators over serious financial governance concerns. The families said they no longer trust that the charity’s board has their children’s best interests at heart.
The families said a parent-led takeover was the best solution given the urgency of the threat to the charity’s services and ethos and the need to overhaul what they see as failing management that has led it to near insolvency.
They have accused the charity’s board of acting secretively and keeping parents in the dark about its £1.6m unpaid tax bill. They have also questioned the appropriateness and legality of £1m payments to a company solely owned by the charity’s chair, Bushra Hamid.
In a statement, the parents said: “The charity belongs to the 22 residents, not to the board of trustees and the chief executive who through their actions have taken this charity from a thriving community to one at the brink of failure. These people will be gone if the care homes go into insolvency, they will walk away. Our relatives won’t. This is supposed to be their secure home for life.
“Now that this group of 18 families have found each other, we have formed an incredible bond. There has been an outpouring of love and support for each other which we want to harness for the wellbeing of our beloved children. So we are taking matters into our own hands.”
The families are in the process of setting up a not-for-profit company to oversee the care services provided by the charity. They say they can draw upon a large pool of professional expertise among their number, including legal, business, accountancy and social care management.
A parent-led takeover of care services is rare, though the learning disability sector has a tradition of parent activism. Some established charities, such as Mencap, were set up by families determined to provide better care than the outdated and limited institutional services their children had been offered.
William Blake House is one of a handful of specialist residential homes in England for adults with severe and complex learning disabilities. The residents are mostly non-verbal, and require round-the-clock support and care.
It is run on Steiner principles, which aim to create a therapeutic environment where residents are treated as having potential rather than limitations and where care is underpinned by an active and socially inclusive lifestyle. Councils and the NHS spend more than £3m a year funding its services.
The families said they were devastated to realise the home was at risk. “Many of the residents had histories of unsuitable placements, emergency placements and trauma, so finding William Blake House, which was a place we could trust, was a godsend,” one parent said.
The families said the home’s ethos had suffered in recent years, with residents’ trips and activities reduced, although the quality and safety of care remained generally good. They discovered its financial plight and serious potential conflicts of interests on the charity’s trustee board last autumn.
They started to build a parent network after realising the charity had been been at risk of overnight insolvency multiple times after failing to pay staff PAYE and national insurance. Its assets shrank from nearly £1m to £200,000 in three years, and auditors have questioned whether it is a viable business.
The Northamptonshire-based charity has blamed its financial difficulties on high agency staff costs and the failure of local authorities to raise care fees in line with inflation. It plans to settle its tax debts by selling land to a developer.
It told the Guardian it had passed the families’ proposal to its solicitors and it would respond to their takeover bid this week.
The Charity Commission has opened a regulatory compliance case into potential governance concerns at William Blake House. It also confirmed it had received a serious incident report relating to the charity’s finances, believed to have been issued by a former trustee.

Ukrainian civilian casualties surged by 26% in 2025, say researchers

Civilian casualties in Ukraine caused by bombing soared by 26% during 2025, reflecting increased Russian targeting of cities and infrastructure in the country, according a global conflict monitoring group.
Action on Armed Violence (AOAV) said 2,248 civilians were reported killed and 12,493 injured by explosive violence in Ukraine according to English-language reports – with the number of casualties an incident rising significantly.
An average of 4.8 civilians were reported killed or injured in each strike, 33% more than in 2024, with the worst attack taking place in Dnipro on 24 June. Russian missiles hit a passenger train, apartments and schools, killing 21 and injuring 314, including 38 children.
Iain Overton, executive director of AOAV, said the figures showed “Ukraine fits a wider collapse of restraint that is now visible across multiple wars”, and respect for the distinction of proportionality in war “has broken”.
Deliberately targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure in a way that is excessive to direct military advantage is a war crime, but experts have said the principle of proportionality is at breaking point across multiple conflicts, including Gaza, Sudan and Congo as well as Ukraine.
“We have watched this erosion unfold over years, from Homs to Aleppo to Mariupol and on to Gaza. What seems different now is the sense that there is no longer a functioning international rules-based order capable of ever holding those responsible to account,” Overton argued.
Missile and drone attacks took place almost nightly across Ukraine during 2025, and continued into 2026, leaving millions of people with limited or no access to electricity, heating and water. A total of 805 drones and 13 missiles targeted Ukraine on the night of 9 September, the largest air raid recorded in the war.
AOAV monitors civilian casualty figures based on English-language reports of incidents of explosive violence globally. Though the measure is consistent, it undercounts of the true numbers of civilians killed and wounded, partly because media accounts in one language are inevitably incomplete.
Globally, civilian casualties dropped 26% from a 10-year high recorded by the monitoring group in 2024, largely because of the October ceasefire in Gaza, previously the most deadly and dangerous conflict for civilians. Civilian casualties recorded by AOAV were 14,024 in Gaza in 2025, 40% lower than the year before.
Israel’s military at the end of last month indicated it accepted that the death toll compiled by authorities in Gaza was broadly accurate. A security official acknowledged that 70,000 Palestinians had been killed since October 2023, in line with the latest Gaza health ministry total of 72,061 killed and 171,715 injured.
During 2025, 25,718 Palestinians were recorded as killed by the health ministry and 62,854 injured, demonstrating that the English-language press reports monitored represent an undercount of the reality on the ground.
According to AOAV, 45,358 civilian casualties were recorded worldwide during 2025, down from 61,353 the year before. Those figures comprised 17,589 civilians reported killed and 27,769 injured by explosive violence of all types.
The country responsible for the most killed and wounded by explosive violence was Israel, marginally ahead of Russia.
Israel’s involvement in multiple conflicts in 2025 meant that it was recorded as causing 35% of all reported casualties against 32% for Russia. Wars in Sudan and Myanmar were the next most deadly, where total recorded casualty numbers were 5,438 and 3,178 respectively.
“Across Ukraine, Myanmar, Gaza and Sudan, the message is the same,” said Overton. “When impunity becomes normalised, war crimes stop being shocking exceptions and begin to resemble a method of warfare.”

The Trades Union Congress is urging the Bank of England to cut interest rates and rekindle economic growth, pointing to analysis showing that cash-strapped consumers are lagging their international peers.
The Bank’s monetary policy committee voted 5-4 to leave borrowing costs unchanged this month, after six cuts since mid-2024.
Some members of the committee remain anxious about the risks of high wage growth unleashing a fresh bout of inflation, but the TUC argues that weak growth should be the more pressing concern.
Paul Nowak, the TUC’s general secretary said: “The Bank of England has a crucial role to play here. Last year they were overly cautious and too slow to act. They should go for growth with a sequence of quick-fire cuts this year.
“Lower interest rates would help households and help the high street – putting money in people’s pockets to spend in shops and restaurants, and boosting confidence for consumers and for businesses.”
Official data showed GDP expanded by just 0.1% in the final quarter of last year. The TUC said that was because consumer demand was being depressed by high borrowing costs, with the Bank’s base rate set at 3.75%.
Its analysis shows consumer demand has grown more slowly in the UK over the past three years than in 32 of the 37 industrialised economies in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development – many of which have still achieved low inflation.
And while consumer demand has generally accounted for two-thirds of economic growth since the 2008 financial crisis, the TUC said that over the past two years it made no contribution at all.
The Bank is widely expected to cut rates at its next meeting in March after this month’s close vote, but markets are not expecting a repeat of last year’s run of reductions.
Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, sought to open the way for further cuts with policies in her November budget designed to bring down inflation – including by cutting energy bills from April. The monetary policy committee has said that should help to bring inflation back down to the 2% target by the spring, from 3.4% in December.
However, some businesses have said that Reeves’s decision to raise employer national insurance contributions and the national minimum wage contributed to inflation as employers sought to pass on the costs through price rises.
Huw Pill, the Bank’s chief economist, said on Friday he believed interest rates were already “a little bit too low” and that “underlying” inflation was probably 2.5%, once the impact of Reeves’s price-cutting policies were taken out of the equation. Data on the jobs market and inflation will be published this week.
After a fortnight of Labour party turmoil, the chancellor is determined to show she will stick to her growth strategy, which involves boosting infrastructure investment and liberalising planning reforms as well as tackling inflation.
She plans to give a low-key Commons statement on 3 March responding to updated economic forecasts by the Office for Budget Responsibility – in contrast to last year’s spring statement, when she made hasty welfare cuts that were subsequently reversed.
Reeves will then make a speech later in the spring reiterating her commitment to what she has called “securonomics”, which combines an activist industrial policy with supply-side changes such as cutting red tape.
Responding to the lacklustre recent growth figures, Reeves said: “I’m confident that the decisions that we have made to return stability to the economy, to bring investment to our economy, and the changes we’re making around planning and regulation will help deliver stronger growth this year.”
Labour’s economic policy would be likely to feature heavily in any leadership contest. City analysts are weighing up the probability that some candidates would pursue more relaxed tax and spending policies, with knock on effects for government bond markets.

Keir Starmer has a unique talent – to alienate absolutely everyone | Nesrine Malik

After a tumultuous few weeks, we are once again in “reset” territory. Keir Starmer has bought some more time, there is a modest bounce in his polling, and he has had the well-timed fortune of the Munich security conference. His call there for the “remaking” of western alliances and taking the initiative on European defence cooperation has fumigated the air a little of the sense of imminent demise that has been swirling around him. But it will probably be a temporary hiatus. He is in a hole that is too deep to climb out of. The prime minister’s persistent unpopularity is best understood as the result of abundance: there is simply, in Starmer, something for everyone to deplore.
In policy, he has taken stances that have established him in the minds of many people as devoid of principle and compassion. On Gaza, Starmer got it wrong from the start. From his early assertion that Israel had the right to cut off water and power, to refusing calls for a ceasefire and then cracking down on protest (a move now judged as unlawful by the high court), the prime minister positioned himself against a huge domestic swell of distress. Add to that the cuts to disability benefits that made him appear callous after so many years of austerity, and what you have – whatever U-turns or watering down followed – is an impression of a politician whose instincts are those of a state apparatchik; someone whose default is enforcing pre-existing conventional wisdoms in foreign policy and economics, no matter how damaging or unpopular they are.
Feeding into this is his feverish immigration rhetoric and policy. The “island of strangers” speech; the hectic posting and projection of imagery and footage of crackdown, arrests and deportations; the launch of measure after measure making life harder for those already working and living in the country legally; and for refugees, extending the qualifying time for settlement and ending family reunification. More positions that simply build on the immigration hysteria of the late Tory years and communicate that under Starmer, Labour is a continuity consensus party.
And then there is Starmer himself. Personality alone does not make a politician, and God knows we have suffered enough from big personalities such as Boris Johnson – but you need something. Not necessarily fireworks and charm, but at the minimum just a sense of tangibility. Starmer is impalpable; not in the sense that he isn’t there, but that he is hiding. He doesn’t dream, he says, nor does he have phobias, nor favourite novels. He communicates in only the most generic terms, in staccato sentences using repetitive themes – “change” or his working-class roots – connected by meaningless “let me be clears” and “make no mistakes”.
This manner summons all sorts of characters that overpopulate our corporatised lives – the middle manager, the jobsworth, the emissary from whatever head office. He has a way of somehow always communicating that sorry, he’s just doing his job – while holding the most powerful office in the country. Again, a state representative rather than a leader with volition and conviction.
Who is this person’s constituency? Not the left, to which he has made clear in policy and in purges that this is not its Labour party. Not the right, which will never be at home in Labour, no matter how many people it deports or how much capital it courts. And not the centre any more, for which Starmer’s incompetence and lurching from one debacle to the next is becoming increasingly hard to rationalise.
This is why there has been a nosedive in the polls, one that for past prime ministers would have been cushioned by whichever constituency they explicitly served: Brexiters, anti-immigration ultras, establishment free-marketeers, the working class. Who is out there banging the tables for “growth” and genocide?
And then there is the obvious: two lords appointed to senior roles despite associations with sex offenders, and the disruption caused by the changing of personnel in the wake of related staff departures. The lack of judgment in these appointments is once more an indictment of Starmer’s tendency to defer to establishment names, networks and advisers who staff the senior ranks of a government that is a mash-up of zombie New Labour and austerity management inertia. If it’s broke, don’t fix it.
But Starmer’s problem is even bigger than that. Disliking him has become something wider: an expression of, once again, being thwarted and let down by politicians. He is feeling the impact of the country’s recent history of government instability, corruption and short premierships. The time he had to prove himself was always short, so violated was the country by the Brexit and pandemic years. Starmer was supposed to wipe the slate clean, not further sully it with his own record.
More serious still is his failure in not having even the faintest ability to understand that the entire political establishment was on probation – and that he needed to break with the past in the most dramatic and surefooted ways in both policy and affect. The public is on high alert for cliquishness and chaos. The feelings of those who hate Starmer are sharpened by the fact that even he – finally a Labour leader who campaigned on being a decent, hardworking and upright person – could not deliver. There is no stronger feeling than one inspired by those you expected better from.
All this doesn’t fit neatly with macro-concerns about paving the way for Reform with a sooner rather than later election, or the risks of plunging the country into another phase of economic and political instability by dumping yet another prime minister. But that doesn’t refute in any way the reasons for Starmer’s unpopularity. In a way, the prime minister is a manifestation of the dead end British politics finds itself in – either far-right populism, or Starmer’s all-at-once volatile, unintelligible and remote regime. What’s not to hate?

What happens to frozen eggs and embryos when they are no longer needed?
Unknown

As fertility treatments are on the rise, patchy legislation across Europe leaves thousands of eggs and embryos in limbo.
Women are born with all the eggs they will have. From their first period, reserves begin declining, decreasing faster after the age of 35 and reaching critically low levels by 40.
At the same time, in Europe, people are having children later than ever. The average maternal age is now 30.9, with fertility rates at a record low of 1.46 children per woman amid increased cost of living and job instability.
In response, more people are turning to fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and egg and embryo freezing, hoping to preserve the eggs at their quality peak for future use – this is known as “social freezing”.
The global egg freezing and embryo banking market size accounted for $5.41 billion (€4.55 billion) in 2024 and is anticipated to grow to around $25.63 billion (€22.1 billion) by 2034.
Social egg freezing conservation often has different rules than medical freezing, which is aimed at women with fertility-threatening diseases such as cancer or endometriosis.
“We need to think about egg freezing like an insurance policy you take”, Saghar Kasiri, head director of fertility services at Cryos, the world’s largest egg and sperm bank, told Euronews Health.
“Social egg freezing is almost like an insurance policy, you put some eggs away and hope that you find the right partner or are at a stage where you can get pregnant naturally. If you can't, then you'll have a backup”, she added.
This process also brings new challenges: what happens when women no longer want those eggs or embryos?
Patients later having children naturally, suffering illness, relationship changes, career shifts, or simply a change their mind means women who froze eggs for a specific timeframe may no longer wants them.
The same applies to frozen embryos. In an average IVF cycle for a woman under 35, six to ten embryos are produced, of which normally one is transferred and the rest frozen.
Medically speaking, frozen embryos can remain viable indefinitely with modern vitrification – flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen at -196°C – which prevents ice crystal damage.
Blood, plasma, and other tissues are discarded under very strict sanitary conditions if unused. Embryos and eggs, however, often evoke emotional attachment and moral dilemmas.
Embryos occupy a grey area in regulation and an even greyer area in data collection. There is no precise number of “abandoned” eggs or embryos, nor aggregated data on discards or donations.
Patchy laws across Europe
European countries vary widely in their approach. The United Kingdom has no limits on the number of embryos that can be created or transferred and allows frozen embryo storage for up to 55 years. If the patients don’t want to use them, the country allows donation, use in research, or discarding.
Poland’s 2015 Infertility Treatment Act bans destruction. After 20 years, the donation to other couples is mandatory.
In Italy, unused embryos must remain frozen indefinitely. The country doesn’t allow donation for research or destruction. Maria Rosaria Campitiello, head of the Department of Prevention at Italy's Health Ministry, estimated over 10,000 abandoned embryos in 2025.
On the opposite side, Sweden requires embryos to be destroyed after a storage limit of 10 years.
The recent European regulation for Substances of Human Origin (SoHO), aimed at regulating quality and safety standards of human substances, explicitly excludes embryos from its scope.
When there are options, still difficult
Even in the countries where donation and destruction are legal, the procedure is still complicated.
The Spanish Fertility Association estimated in 2023 that 60,005 out of the 668,082 embryos in the country were “abandoned”.
In Spain, clinics must periodically request renewal or modification of patients’ original choices. If, after two attempts, patients don’t give a response, embryos become the clinic’s responsibility and they can be donated, used for research, or destroyed.
The country has emerged as Europe’s top destination for egg freezing, with no age restrictions and no defined storage duration limits.
With many patients coming from abroad, getting a hold of them and keeping registries can be complicated.
Yet, bureaucracy is not the only hurdle.
“Frozen embryos, especially if the egg and the sperm are from the patients, are likely to be discarded. If they have chosen a donor, especially if it's a double donation, they are more open to donating it to another family,” Kasiri added.
She explained that, as it is their genetic material, patients are often reluctant to donate it to others.

Analysis: Will Big Tech's colossal AI spending crush Europe's data sovereignty?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-16
06:00:01 UTC
15:00:01 KST

Big Tech companies are going all in on AI development, raising their projected capital expenditure to over $700bn (€590bn) this year, an increase of roughly 75% compared to 2025.
Several Big Tech companies have reported earnings in recent weeks and provided estimates for their spending in 2026, along with leading analysts' projections.
The data point that seems to have caught Wall Street’s attention the most is the estimated capital expenditure (CapEx) for this year, which collectively represents an investment of over $700bn (€590bn) in AI infrastructure.
That is more than the entire nominal GDP of Sweden for 2025, one of Europe's largest economies, as per IMF estimates.
Global chip sales are also projected to reach $1tn (€842bn) for the first time this year, according to the US Semiconductor Industry Association.
In addition, major banks and consulting firms, such as JPMorgan Chase and McKinsey, project that total AI CapEx will surpass $5tn (€4.2tn) by 2030, driven by "astronomical demand" for compute.
CapEx refers to funds a company spends to build, improve or maintain long-term assets like property, equipment and technology. These investments are meant to boost the firm's capacity and efficiency over several years.
The expenditure is also not fully deducted in the same year. CapEx costs are capitalised on the balance sheet and gradually expensed through depreciation, representing a key indicator of how a company is investing in its future growth and operational strength.
The leap this year confirms a definitive pivot that began in 2025, when Big Tech is estimated to have spent around $400bn (€337bn) on AI CapEx.
As Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang has repeatedly stated, including at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, we are witnessing "the largest infrastructure build-out in human history".
Hyperscalers bet the house
At the top of the spending hierarchy for 2026 sits Amazon, which alone is guiding to invest a mammoth $200bn (€170bn).
To put the number into perspective, the company’s individual AI CapEx guidance for this year surpasses the combined nominal GDP of the three Baltic countries in 2025, according to IMF projections.
Alphabet, Google’s parent company, follows with $185bn (€155bn), while Microsoft and Meta are set to deploy $145bn (€122bn) and $135bn (€113bn) respectively.
Oracle also raised its 2026 CapEx to $50bn (€42.1bn), nearly $15bn (€12.6bn) above earlier estimates.
Additionally, Tesla projects double the spending with almost $20bn (€16.8bn), primarily to scale its robotaxi fleet and advance the development of the Optimus humanoid robot.
Another of Elon Musk's companies, xAI, will also spend at least $30bn (€25.2bn) in 2026.
A new $20bn (€16.8bn) data centre named MACROHARDRR will be built in Mississippi, which Governor Tate Reeves stated is "the largest private sector investment in the state's history".
xAI will also expand the so-called Colossus, a cluster of data centres in Tennessee that has been described by Musk as the world's largest AI supercomputer.
Furthermore, the company was acquired by SpaceX in an all-stock transaction at the start of this month.
The merger valued SpaceX at $1tn (€842bn) and xAI at $250bn (€210bn), creating an entity worth $1.25tn (€1.05tn), reputedly the largest private company by valuation in history.
There are also reports that SpaceX intends to IPO sometime this year, with Morgan Stanley allegedly in talks to manage the offering that now includes exposure to xAI.
Elon Musk stated that the goal is to build an "integrated innovation engine" combining AI, rockets and satellite internet, with long-term plans that include space-based data centres powered by solar energy.
Conversely, Apple continues to lag in spending with "only" a projected $13bn (€10.9bn).
However, the company announced a multi-year partnership with Google last month to integrate Gemini AI models into the next generation of Apple Intelligence.
Specifically, the collaboration will focus on overhauling Siri and enhancing on-device AI features. Therefore, one could say that Apple is outsourcing a lot of the investment it needs to be competitive on AI development.
As for Nvidia, it will report earnings and release projections on 25 February.
The company is primarily in the business of selling AI chips, and is expected to get the lion's share of the Big Tech's spending. Particularly, for the build-out of data centres.
In last August's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang estimated a cost per gigawatt of data centre capacity between $50bn (€42.1bn) and $60bn (€50.5bn), with about $35bn (€29.5bn) of each investment going towards Nvidia hardware.
The great capital rotation
Wall Street has had mixed feelings about the enormous spending Big Tech companies have planned for 2026.
On the one hand, investors understand the necessity and urgency of developing a competitive edge in the artificial intelligence age.
On the other, the sheer scale of the spending has also spooked some shareholders. The market’s tolerance hinges on demonstrable ROI from this year onwards, as the investments are also increasingly financed with massive debt raises.
Morgan Stanley estimates that hyperscalers will borrow around $400bn (€337bn) in 2026, more than double the $165bn (€139bn) that was loaned out in 2025.
This surge could push the total issuance of high-grade US corporate bonds to a record $2.25tn (€1.9tn) this year.
Currently, projected AI revenue for 2026 is nowhere near matching the spending, and there are valid concerns. For instance, the possibility of hardware rapidly depreciating due to innovation, and other high operational costs such as energy usage.
It can be confidently stated that the numbers have a heavy reliance on future success.
As Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged this month, there are “elements of irrationality in the current spending pace".
Back in November, Alex Haissl, an analyst at Rothschild & Co, became a dissenting voice as he downgraded ratings for Amazon and Microsoft.
In a note to clients, the analyst wrote “investors are valuing Amazon and Microsoft's CapEx plans as if cloud-1.0 economics still applied”, referring to the low-cost structure of cloud-based services that allowed Big Tech firms to scale in the last two decades.
However, the analyst added “there are a few problems that suggest the AI boom likely won't play out in the same way, and it is probably far more costly than investors realise".
This view is also shared by Michael Burry, who is best known for being among the first investors to predict and profit from the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. Burry has argued that the current AI boom is a potential bubble pointing to unsustainable CapEx.
Big Tech’s AI race is funded by a tremendous amount of leverage. Whether this strategy will pay off, and which companies will be the winners and the losers, only time will tell.
At the moment, Nvidia certainly seems to be a great beneficiary. Moreover, Apple has a distinct approach by increasing third party reliance, through a partnership with Google, instead of massively scaling their spending. It is a different trade-off.
Europe’s industrial deficit
Amid all this spending, urgent questions have also been raised about Europe’s ability to compete in a race that has become a battle of balance sheets.
For the European Union, the transatlantic contrast is sobering. While American firms are mobilising nearly €600bn in a single year, the EU’s coordinated efforts do not even match the financial firepower of the lowest spender among the US tech titans.
Brussels has attempted to rally with the AI Factories initiative, and the AI Continent Action Plan launched last April, which aim to mobilise public-private investments.
However, the numbers tell a stark story. Total European spending on sovereign cloud data infrastructure is forecast to reach just €10.6bn in 2026.
While this is a respectable 83% increase year-on-year, it remains a rounding error compared to the US AI build-out.
Last year, at the time when the initiatives mentioned were being discussed, the CEO of the French unicorn Mistral AI, Arthur Mensch, stated that “US companies are building the equivalent of a new Apollo program every year”.
Mensch also added that “Europe is building excellent regulation with the AI Act, but you cannot regulate your way to computing supremacy”.
Mistral represents one of the only flickers of European resistance in the AI race. The French company is employing the same strategy as most of Big Tech and aggressively expanding its physical footprint.
In September 2025, Mistral AI raised a €1.7bn Series C at a valuation of almost €12bn, with the Dutch semiconductor giant ASML leading the round by singly investing €1.3bn.
During the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, Mistral's CEO confirmed a €1bn CapEx plan for 2026.
Just last week, the company also announced a major €1.2bn investment to build a data centre in Borlänge, Sweden.
In a partnership with the Swedish operator, EcoDataCenter, the facility will be designed to offer "sovereign compute" compliant with the EU’s strict data standards, and leveraging Sweden’s abundant green energy.
Set to open in 2027, this data centre will provide the high-performance computing required to train and deploy Mistral’s next-generation AI models.
This is an important move for the company, as it is the first infrastructure project outside France, and it is also a core venture for European data sovereignty.
Meanwhile, US tech titans are attempting to placate European regulators by offering "sovereign-light" solutions. Several Big Tech projects have been rolled out for "localised cloud zones", for example in Germany and Portugal, promising data residency.
However, critics argue these remain technically dependent on US parent companies, leaving the European industry vulnerable to the whims of the American economy and foreign policy.
As 2026 unfolds, the stakes are clear. The US is betting the house, and its credit rating, on AI dominance.
Europe, cautious and capital-constrained, is hoping that targeted investments and regulation will be enough to carve out a sovereign niche in a world increasingly run on American technology.

How Lithuania marked Independence Day during last throes of Soviet Union

In early 1988, Lithuania was still stuck in Soviet-era stagnation and commemorating Lithuania’s restoration of independence was unthinkable. However, mobilisation by dissidents, as well as a statement from US President Ronald Reagan, helped bring about change.
Commemorations marking Lithuania’s Restoration of Independence, signed on February 16, 1918, were banned on September 26, 1940, following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania.
But the thaw that had begun in the Soviet Union had already opened up some previously uncomfortable topics – Stalin’s terror was being discussed publicly, while previously banned texts, like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s The Gulag Archipelago, had appeared in bookshops.
A few days earlier, on February 11, US President Ronald Reagan also declared February 16 as the Lithuanian Independence Day.
The statement attracted considerable attention in Lithuania. It was broadcast by foreign radio stations, and the news reached Lithuania, inspiring at least symbolic commemorations of the banned date.
Reagan’s statement also infuriated Soviet regime loyalists, provoking the communists into staging their own “commemoration” of February 16. Ironically, this meant that the Soviets marked the day for the very first time – with increased security in cities and a communist rally.
“It was foolishness and low-level Soviet madness,” recalled Andrius Tučkus, a Lithuanian dissident. “Throughout the city, there were constant Komsomol patrols, organised at night; they walked in pairs. Complete absurdity.”
On February 15, 1988, mostly Russian-speaking workers were summoned from factories to gather in the Cathedral Square – then known as Gediminas Square. Local party representatives and some public figures took to the stage. It is estimated that around 15,000 people may have attended the rally.
The speeches were not, of course, about February 16. Instead, the Soviets condemned US imperialist policy, referencing Reagan’s statement as “incitement”.
The rally was followed by articles in the press and lectures at universities on the “true meaning” of February 16, which was said to have nothing in common with Soviet reality and to be invoked only to stir negative sentiment. In other words, it was neither important nor a holiday nor a significant date.
This condemnation was widely covered in the Soviet press and was intended to emphasise the supposed loyalty of Soviet citizens and their distancing from the “bourgeois Lithuanian past”.
In reality, it meant that February 16 was still regarded as illegal and that commemorating it was equated with anti-state activity.
The last underground commemoration
Even before February 16, the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party had prepared plans and instructions for the press on how to combat a possible surge of nationalism. Militia officers were deployed on the streets to monitor the situation and prevent any provocations.
Such preparations were not accidental, as dissidents were planning to mark the holiday. In a 2008 broadcast of the programme Spaudos Klubas, one of the organisers, Vytautas Bogušis, said the commemoration was to take place in churches, where services would be held, followed by a planned procession.
“We prepared a statement and urged that these events be organised throughout Lithuania. We appealed to priests to hold Mass in every church for independence. We succeeded because that announcement reached abroad,” Bogušis said.
Both the Central Committee and KGB structures were aware of this information. In February, the organisers of the rally were placed under house arrest, dissidents were followed, and on the morning of February 16 the organisers Antanas Terleckas, Nijolė Sadūnaitė and Vytautas Bogušis were detained and taken to the KGB.
“The militia officers were very polite, and we went. The KGB officers did not know who we were and began telling us terrible things were happening in Vilnius – students overturning cars,” Terleckas recalled in 2008.
Although without the organisers, the planned commemorations went ahead, though the information passed to Terleckas had been exaggerated. No cars were overturned, but there were arrests.
Services were held in churches, and a small procession was organised, while the Soviets declared a quasi-military regime to ban large gatherings.
Nevertheless, unrest could not be avoided even after the organisers were detained. Participant Andrius Tučkus recalls that after Mass at St Nicholas Church, the crowd moved towards City Hall, where clashes began.
“In the evening after Mass at St Nicholas Church, we organised a procession. Soviet activists tried to block the road to Vokiečių Street, but we reached City Hall. There, they began dealing with us more seriously. They tried to drag away one woman; I started struggling with them.
Then they pulled me out of the crowd, twisted my arms and put me in a militia car. They had set up a post near St Nicholas Church, with about a hundred volunteer enforcers, all in civilian clothes. They checked my sobriety and later released me,” Tučkus said.
The Soviets officially stated that 21 people were detained during the commemorations, but the true figures remain unknown. Most were released the same day as the situation calmed, and the security measures had been introduced “for fear of possible riots”.
By the end of the day, Terleckas, Sadūnaitė and Bogušis were also released from detention. For them, February 16 became their final arrest and encounter with the KGB. However, Tučkus’s problems caught up with him less than a week later over another incident.
“There was great enthusiasm to organise marches and demonstrations in Estonia as well [Estonia marks its independence day on February 25]. I planned to go there, but on February 21, as I left church, militia officers attacked, seized me along with Jonas Pratusevičius and Algis Statkevičius and jailed us for 10 days for hooliganism,” Tučkus, a member of the Lithuanian Freedom League, recalled.
During his detention, there were attempts to recruit him. But temporary imprisonment was not the worst part.
“I was sentenced and then these mild repressions followed – they dismissed me from work and expelled me from university,” Tučkus said.
The first ‘legal’ celebration
In June 1988, Lithuanian activists formed the initiative group of the Sąjudis (Rebirth) movement. Its first rallies took place later that month.
Over the summer, events unfolded rapidly, and the Soviet authorities lost ground. State symbols – the flag and the national anthem – returned to public life.
Even tightly controlled television had to allow alternative views. The country began openly discussing Soviet injustices, deportations and everyday terror.
On February 16, 1989, Sąjūdis symbolically clarified its goal of seeking independence. That year, the main commemorations took place in Kaunas, where the movement declared its principal aim – the restoration of Lithuania’s independence.
A memorial plaque was also unveiled at the site of the former Štralis restaurant on Pilies Street in Vilnius, marking the place where the Act of Independence had been signed.
Cameramen who had previously produced propaganda films about Lenin anniversaries were now filming February 16 commemorations in Vilnius and Kaunas filled with tricolours that had been banned only a year earlier. It was the first time since 1940 that people in Lithuania could openly celebrate the February 16 anniversary.

Western pressure on Russian oil trade brings Indonesia into focus
Analysts say Indonesia’s energy demand could draw scrutiny as Moscow seeks new buyers, potentially complicating US trade talks
Reading Time:3 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
As Western pressure tightens on traditional buyers of Russian crude, analysts say Indonesia’s status as a fast-growing net oil importer with limited fiscal headroom could position it as a potential new market for Moscow’s discounted supplies.
But any shift towards Russian barrels would carry diplomatic risks, they add, particularly as Jakarta seeks to conclude sensitive trade negotiations with Washington and avoid complicating ties with the US and its allies.
Indonesia has already come under closer international scrutiny in recent weeks. A report by Reuters early this month cited ship-tracking data from commodities intelligence firms Kpler and Vortex as indicating that two tankers carrying Russian crude had conducted ship-to-ship transfers near Hong Kong, with the oil later reported to have been discharged at ports in Indonesia as recently as January.

Separately, it was reported last week that the European Union was considering extending its sanctions regime to include ports in Georgia and Indonesia’s Karimun, which, according to a proposal drafted by the European External Action Service and the European Commission, had frequently handled Russian crude.
Indonesian authorities and state energy firm Pertamina have denied importing Russian oil, disputing suggestions that the shipments involved Russian crude and saying they operate in accordance with the law.

Mitsotakis: Greece–Türkiye talks proceed despite disputes

Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Feb. 15 said that while disagreements between Türkiye and Greece persist, dialogue is now being conducted without tension and within the framework of international law, referring to his meeting in Ankara with President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
“I was in Ankara this week. President Erdoğan and I held a frank and comprehensive discussion about the points that bring us closer together and those that set us apart,” Mitsotakis said in a written statement.
“Our disagreements are real and significant. We do not underestimate them. However, today we can articulate them without creating tension, through open channels of communication, with confidence and with constant reference to international law.”
Mitsotakis noted that Greece seeks neither tension nor inertia and wants a normal, functional relationship with Türkiye focused on national interests.
He said their geography necessitates coexistence as neighbors and that, in a volatile international environment, Greece chooses stability.
The Greek premier added that they will continue the structured dialogue launched two and a half years ago, which has produced tangible results and will expand areas of cooperation, stressing that they will remain on a path of responsibility.
According to Mitsotakis, this is what the majority of citizens want — not national hysteria, but a Greece defined by national self-confidence.
Erdoğan and Mitsotakis met in Ankara on Feb. 11.
Erdoğan said they once again addressed their respective positions on the Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean in an open and sincere manner, adding: “Although the existing issues are complex, they are not irresolvable on the basis of international law — provided there is goodwill, constructive dialogue and the will to reach a solution.”

Singapore sets first ever sustainable aviation fuel levy, as Southeast Asia's fuel industry grows
Singapore is piloting the world’s first sustainable aviation fuel levy
- Bookmark
Flying in and out of Singapore, home to Southeast Asia's busiest airport, will get slightly more expensive this year as the city state begins imposing a levy of between 75 cents to $32 per ticket to fund sustainable aviation fuel.
The tax will support Singapore's growing use of the cleaner burning fuel, which is often made from used cooking oil or agricultural waste. The global aviation industry is encouraging its use as it tries to slash rising emissions that contribute to climate change without altering current aircraft.
Southeast Asia is poised to become a hub for global production of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, as new facilities and policies launch across the region, while environmental backpedaling in the United States under President Donald Trump creates an opening in global fuel production.
Singapore has the region's largest SAF plant and is beginning construction of a next-generation facility this year, with set agreements to supply fuel to major carriers like JetBlue and Singapore Airlines. Thailand launched a brand-new SAF plant in Bangkok in 2025. Malaysia and Vietnam hit domestic production milestones last year and Indonesia, like Singapore, recently announced plans to expand current operations.
The industry is just getting started, said Tat Chuan Goh, with Aether Fuels, the Chicago-based fuel development company building Singapore's new plant. “But we do sense the momentum is clearly building up," he said.
Singapore sets its new levy
Singapore's levy will affect flights departing after Oct. 1 and sold after April 1 from Changi International Airport, which handled a record 70 million passengers last year.
Passengers will pay a surcharge based on their trips' distance and cabin. The lowest levy of 1 Singapore dollar (about 75 U.S. cents) will apply to economy flights within Southeast Asia. Those traveling in premium cabin flights to the Americas will pay the most, 41.60 Singapore dollars (about $32).
For cargo, the levy is based on distance travelled and weight. To ensure transparency, the tax will be shown on tickets and air cargo contracts.
Daniel Ng, chief sustainability officer at the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, said the levy will allow “all aviation users to do their part to contribute to sustainability at a cost which is manageable for the air hub.”
Southeast Asia's fuel industry grows
With Southeast Asia's abundant access to fuel ingredients, like agricultural and forest waste, the region is sitting on a “pot of gold that can really be scaled up," said Goh with Aether Fuels.
Vietnam delivered domestically-made SAF mixes to local carriers like VietJet Air in 2025. Malaysia's first deliveries to local carriers like Malaysia Airlines and customers in Europe also took place last year.
Indonesia plans to increase its domestic fuel production and others in the region, like the Philippines, are cutting red tape to entice fuel developers.
“We can, if managed responsibly, support competitive and scalable SAF production,” said Aung Soe Moe, a senior officer for air transport for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ASEAN estimates the region could produce 8.5 million barrels of SAF per day by 2050.
Kelvin Lee, who leads sustainability in the Asia-Pacific region for the International Air Transport Association, the leading group of global airlines, said it's “natural that people are paying quite a bit of attention to SAF production in this part the world."
“But we do still need quite a bit of government support to have that momentum continue," Lee said.
U.S. pullback slows global production
Aviation contributes about 2.5% of annual global carbon emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, which says emissions from aviation are growing faster than those from any other transportation industry.
With aviation demand rising, the UN-backed International Civil Aviation Organization set a goal of zero net carbon emissions for 2050. Using SAF could cut about 65% of the industry's emissions, it says. That prompted some airlines and countries to set SAF mandates.
But there are doubts that SAF can scale up quickly enough, partly because of the Trump administration's reversal of clean energy efforts.
Global SAF production was steadily growing, with the U.S. output nearly doubling to a record last year. That was before Trump rolled back climate policies denting production that had surged under former President Joe Biden.
The global growth of SAF production is forecast to slow for the first time since large-scale output began in 2018.
Preeti Jain, who leads IATA’s net zero research, said the U.S. rollbacks are “definitely a topic of discussion.” But she said “the good thing is that those policy incentives have not totally evaporated, but there is some period of uncertainty."

Türkiye deploys drillship, navy escort for Somalia offshore oil, gas search

Türkiye has taken a decisive step in its bid to become a major player in the global energy arena, dispatching its deep-sea drillship Çağrı Bey to Somalia for its first overseas mission.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar described the move as a “historic step” in the country’s offshore energy drive during a ceremony at Taşucu Port in Mersin on Feb. 15.
The vessel is expected to arrive in Mogadishu in approximately 45 days and commence drilling at the Curad-1 well in April.
Türkiye and Somalia signed agreements in 2024 covering onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration. The seismic vessel Oruc Reis previously completed surveys in three offshore blocks.
Bayraktar emphasized that this milestone marks a new era for Türkiye’s energy strategy. “With the launch of intercontinental operations through Çağrı Bey, we are advancing the goal we set in 2016 to conduct offshore exploration with our own ships and personnel. Today, we are taking that ambition further by intensifying exploration abroad, both through partnerships and independent efforts,” he said.
Since the beginning of 2026, Türkiye has signed strategic agreements with ExxonMobil, Chevron, and BP in oil and gas exploration. Another international offshore partnership is expected to be announced this week, Bayraktar said.
With the addition of Çağrı Bey and Yıldırım, Türkiye’s fleet now includes six drillships, alongside seismic vessels Oruç Reis and Barbaros Hayrettin Paşa, making it the world’s fourth-largest offshore exploration fleet.
Türkiye’s overseas expansion is not limited to Somalia. Bayraktar confirmed that seismic studies will be conducted in Pakistan’s maritime zones this year using Oruç Reis or Barbaros Hayrettin Paşa.
In Libya, Türkiye has secured exploration rights in two fields — one offshore and one onshore — through a licensing round held last week. These projects will be pursued in partnership with Spanish energy company Repsol, with Türkiye holding a 40 percent stake in both.
Looking ahead, Türkiye aims for its national oil company to reach production of around 500,000 barrels of oil and gas per day by 2028, with a longer-term target of 1 million barrels per day.
Bayraktar underscored that these initiatives form part of Türkiye’s broader strategy to strengthen energy independence while positioning itself as a significant global energy actor.

Türkiye is close to introducing new regulations aimed at protecting children on social media platforms, Family and Social Services Minister Mahinur Özdemir Göktaş said on Feb. 15.
In a post on Turkish social media platform N Sosyal, Göktaş said the government was nearing implementation of measures as concerns grow over the impact of constant digital stimulation on children.
She warned that attention spans have dropped to around eight seconds — a trend she said harms children more than adults.
Göktaş also said children’s attention spans have fallen by at least 30 percent over the past decade, affecting concentration, friendships and school performance, and making teaching harder.
She said similar rules are being debated or introduced in other countries and called on parents and teachers to support efforts to build a safer online environment for children.
Türkiye has been discussing tighter safeguards for minors amid a broader global push to regulate children’s social media use.

Europe’s growing fight over Israeli goods: Boycott movements mushroom
From an Irish supermarket worker’s grassroots act to state-led initiatives, a protest grows. But pro-Israel groups battle back.
One afternoon late August in a quiet Irish seaside town, a supermarket worker decided he could no longer separate his job from what he was seeing on his phone.
Images from Gaza, with neighbourhoods flattened and families buried, had followed him to the checkout counter.

- list 4 of 4US border chief says ending ICE deportation surge in Minnesota
At the time, Israel’s genocidal onslaught had killed more than 60,000 Palestinians.
His first act of protest was to quietly warn customers that some of the fruit and vegetables were sourced from Israel. Later, as people in Gaza starved, he refused to scan or sell Israeli-grown produce.
He could not, he said, “have that on my conscience”.
Within weeks, Tesco supermarket suspended him.
He requested anonymity following advice from his trade union.
In Newcastle, County Down, a town better known for its summer tourists than political protest, customers protested outside the store.
The local dispute became a test case: Can individual employees turn their moral outrage into workplace action?
Facing mounting backlash, Tesco reinstated him in January, moving him to a role where he no longer has to handle Israeli goods.
“I would encourage them to do it,” he said about other workers. “They have the backing of the unions and there’s a precedent set. They didn’t sack me; they shouldn’t be able to sack anyone else.
“And then, if we get enough people to do it, they can’t sell Israeli goods.”
“A genocide is still going on, they are slowly killing and starving people – we still need to be out, doing what we can.”
From shop floors to state policy
Across Europe, there is labour-led pressure to cease trade with Israel.
Unions in Ireland, the UK and Norway have passed motions stating that workers should not be compelled to handle Israeli goods.
Retail cooperatives, including Co-op UK and Italy’s Coop Alleanza 3.0, have removed some Israeli products in protest against the war in Gaza.
The campaigns raise questions about whether worker-led refusals can lead to state-level boycotts.
Activists say the strategy is rooted in history.
In 1984, workers at the Dunnes Stores retail chain in Ireland refused to handle goods from apartheid South Africa. The action lasted nearly three years and contributed to Ireland becoming the first country in Western Europe to ban trade with South Africa.
“The same can be done against the apartheid, genocidal state of Israel today,” said Damian Quinn, 33, of BDS Belfast.
The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is a Palestinian-led campaign launched in 2005 that calls for economic and cultural boycotts of Israel until it complies with international law, including ending its occupation of Palestine.
“Where the state has failed in its obligation to prevent and punish the crime of genocide, citizens and workers across the world must refuse Israel and apply pressure on their governments to introduce legislation,” said Quinn.
That pressure, he said, takes the form of boycotting “complicit Israeli sporting, academic and cultural institutions”, as well as Israeli and international companies “engaged in violations of Palestinian human rights”.
The movement also seeks to “apply pressure on banks, local councils, universities, churches, pension funds and governments to do the same through divestment and sanctions”, he added.
Supporters argue that such pressure is beginning to shape state policy across Europe.
Spain and Slovenia have moved to restrict trade with Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank following sustained public protests and mounting political pressure. In August 2025, Slovenia’s government banned imports of goods produced in Israeli-occupied territories, becoming one of the first European states to adopt such a measure.
Spain followed suit later that year, with a decree banning the import of products from illegal Israeli settlements. The measure was formally enforced at the start of 2026.
Both countries’ centre-left governments have been outspoken critics of Israel’s conduct during the war, helping create the political conditions for legislative action.
In the Netherlands, a wave of pro-Palestinian campus protests and public demonstrations in 2025 shifted political discourse. Student demands for academic and trade disengagement became part of broader calls for national policy change.
Later that year, members of the Dutch parliament urged the government to ban imports from illegal Israeli settlements.
Meanwhile, Ireland is attempting to advance its Occupied Territories Bill, first introduced in 2018, which would prohibit trade in goods and services from illegal settlements in occupied Palestinian territory, including the West Bank.
Progress, however, has stalled despite unanimous backing in the lower house of Ireland’s parliament, the Dail.
Paul Murphy, an Irish pro-Palestine member of parliament who, in June, attempted to cross into Gaza, told Al Jazeera the delay amounts to “indirect pressure from Israel routed through the US”. He accused the government of “kicking the can down the road” as it seeks further legal advice.
Pro-Israel organisations are working to oppose initiatives that aim to pressure Israel economically.
B’nai B’rith International, a US-based group that says it strengthens “global Jewish life”, combats anti-Semitism and stands “unequivocally with the State of Israel”, decries the BDS movement. In July 2025, it submitted an 18-page memorandum to Irish lawmakers, warning the bill could pose risks for US companies operating in Ireland.
The memorandum argued that, if enacted, the bill could create conflicts with US federal anti-boycott laws, which prohibit US companies from participating in certain foreign-led boycotts – particularly those targeting Israel.
B’nai B’rith International also “vehemently condemns” the United Kingdom’s recognition of Palestinian statehood and has donated 200 softshell jackets to Israeli military personnel.
Critics say interventions of this kind go beyond advocacy and reflect coordinated efforts to influence European policymaking on Israel and Palestine from abroad.
While lobby groups publicly press their case, leaked documents, based on material from whistleblower site Distributed Denial of Secrets, suggest the Israeli state has also been directly involved in countering BDS campaigns across Europe.
A covert programme, jointly funded by the Israeli Ministries of Justice and of Strategic Affairs, reportedly hired law firms for 130,000 euros ($154,200) on assignments aimed at monitoring boycott-related movements.
Former Sinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson, who supports the BDS movement, previously accused Israeli advocacy organisations of attempting to silence critics of Israel through legal and political pressure.
According to the leaked documents cited by The Ditch, an Irish outlet, Israel hired a law firm to “investigate the steps open to Israel against Martina Anderson”.
She told Al Jazeera she stood by her criticism.
“As the chair of the Palestinian delegation in the European Parliament, I did my work diligently, as people who know me would expect me to do.
“I am proud to have been a thorn in the side of the Israeli state and its extensive lobbying machine, which works relentlessly to undermine Palestinian voices and to justify a brutal and oppressive rogue state.”
Pushback across Europe
In 2019, Germany’s parliament, the Bundestag, adopted a non-binding resolution condemning the BDS movement as anti-Semitic, calling for the withdrawal of public funding from groups that support it.
Observers say the vote has since been used to conflate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism.
The European Leadership Network (ELNET), a prominent pro-Israel advocacy organisation active across the continent, welcomed the move and said its German branch had urged further legislative steps.
Meanwhile, in the UK, ELNET has funded trips to Israel for Labour politicians and their staff.
Bridget Phillipson, now secretary of state for education, declared a 3,000-pound ($4,087) visit funded by ELNET for a member of her team.
A coworker of Wes Streeting named Anna Wilson also accepted a trip funded by ELNET. Streeting himself has visited Israel on a mission organised by the Labour Friends of Israel (LFI) group.
ELNET’s UK branch is directed by Joan Ryan, an ex-Labour MP and former LFI chair.
During the passage of a bill designed to prevent public bodies from pursuing their own boycotts, divestment or sanctions policies – the Labour Party imposed a three-line whip instructing MPs to vote against it. Phillipson and Streeting abstained.
The Economic Activity of Public Bodies (Overseas Matters) Bill was widely seen as an attempt to block local councils and public institutions from adopting BDS-style measures.
A vocal supporter of the legislation was Luke Akehurst, then director of the pro-Israel advocacy group, We Believe in Israel. In a statement carried by ELNET, he said it was “absurd” that local councils could “undermine the excellent relationship between the UK and Israel” through boycotts or divestment.
“We need the law changed to close this loophole,” he said, arguing that BDS initiatives by local authorities risked “importing the conflict into communities in the UK”.
The legislation was ultimately shelved when a general election was called in 2024. It formed part of broader legislative efforts in parts of Europe to limit BDS-linked boycotts.
Akehurst has since been elected as Labour MP for North Durham, having previously served on the party’s National Executive Committee.

Japan resumes power transmission from reactor at world’s largest nuclear plant
Tokyo Electric Power Company plans start of full-scale commercial operation of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant’s No. 6 reactor on March 18
ISTANBUL
Japan’s Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) began power generation and transmission on a trial basis Monday from a reactor at the world’s largest nuclear power plant as it prepared to resume nuclear power supply for the first time in nearly 14 years, Kyodo News Agency reported.
The company, still dealing with the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, plans to start full-scale transmission from the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant’s No. 6 reactor on March 18.
In late January, the No. 6 reactor became TEPCO’s first to restart since the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex triggered by an earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011.
The turbine began operating Sunday evening, and electricity transmission started early Monday after no problems were detected.
During the trial, TEPCO will repeatedly disconnect and reconnect the generator while gradually raising output from 20% to full capacity. The reactor last transmitted electricity in March 2012 before shutting down for routine inspections.
Another reactor at the plant is also expected to restart, having already secured regulatory approval. However, most nuclear reactors in Japan remain offline due to lingering safety concerns after the Fukushima accident.
As part of its decarbonization push, the government aims to maximize nuclear energy use by restarting reactors that meet strict safety standards.
The No. 6 reactor was initially restarted on Jan. 21 but was shut down due to an alarm sounding during control rod extraction. It went back online on Feb. 9.
Monday’s transmission was also delayed due to a malfunction in a neutron-measuring device.

FBI says DNA from glove may link suspect to disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s mother
Investigators await confirmation after glove found near Arizona home matches surveillance footage
ISTANBUL
US investigators obtained a DNA sample from a glove found near the home of the 84-year-old mother of NBC News morning show Today co-anchor Savannah Guthrie which seems to match the pair worn by a man captured on a doorbell camera on the night she went missing, the FBI said Sunday.
“The one with the DNA profile recovered is different (from other gloves that have been found) and appears to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video,” a spokesperson for the bureau told Fox News.
The revelation suggests that investigators may have obtained DNA evidence from the main suspect in the Feb. 1 abduction of Nancy Guthrie, according to media reports.
The FBI said it has received preliminary DNA test results on the glove and is still waiting for "quality control and official confirmation" before entering an "unknown male profile" into its database.
The glove was found roughly two miles (3.21 kilometers) from Nancy Guthrie’s home in the Catalina Foothills near Tucson, Arizona and was one of around 16 collected by detectives in the area during their two-week investigation.
The FBI also said that most of the other gloves recovered during the searches belonged to investigators and had been discarded while they were carrying out sweeps near the home.
Guthrie has been missing for two weeks, with authorities saying she is believed to have been abducted.
Investigators earlier released doorbell camera footage showing a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack approaching her home, attempting to cover the camera with his hand and using yard brush to obstruct its view.
The FBI has also raised the reward for information related to the disappearance of Guthrie from $50,000 to $100,000.

Nepali candidates launch their campaigns on Monday for next month's parliamentary elections, the first since deadly anti‑corruption protests toppled the previous government in 2025.
"This election will draw the future of the country," Sushila Karki, who is serving as interim prime minister until the March 5 vote, said ahead of the launch.
The youth-led protests were triggered by a brief social media ban, but were fuelled by anger at economic stagnation and an ageing elite seen as out of touch.
Over two days in September, 77 people were killed, scores were injured, hundreds of buildings set on fire —including parliament, courts and a Hilton hotel — and 73-year-old Marxist leader KP Sharma Oli was ousted.
It was the Himalayan nation's worst violence since a decade-long civil war in 2006.
Young and old
Two weeks of campaigns will see a host of new, younger candidates promise to offer change, challenging veteran politicians who say they provide stability and security.
A key election clash will see rapper-turned-mayor Balendra Shah, 35, face Oli in a head-to-head battle in the former prime minister's constituency.
Sharply dressed Shah, better known as Balen, has emerged as a symbol of youth-driven political change.
He has joined the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), the fourth biggest in the last parliament.
Also in the race is Nepali Congress, the country’s oldest party.
It was once part of Oli's coalition government, but has elected a new leader since the uprising — 49‑year‑old Gagan Thapa.
And, at the other end of the spectrum from Gen Z politics, supporters of the ex‑king Gyanendra Shah, 78 — deposed in 2008, ending 240 years of monarchy — will also campaign.
The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), which draws support from royalist nostalgia and frustration with mainstream politics, rallied thousands in Kathmandu on Friday as the ex-king drove through the streets waving from his car.
'Way out'
Nearly 19 million people have registered to vote, including 800,000 taking part for the first time.
They will elect members to the 275-seat House of Representatives, the lower house, with 165 via a direct vote and 110 through proportional representation.
More than 3,400 candidates are competing in the direct vote, 30 percent aged under 40.
Campaign banners and party flags are already being strung up in towns, with a string of rallies planned as candidates seek to woo voters.
"This election is being conducted in a special condition," former chief justice Karki said, as she oversaw polling preparations last week. "This has to give the country a way out."
Nepal's Election Commission has said it is ready to hold the polls as planned despite concerns over weather conditions, as many high-altitude areas may be snowbound that early in the year.
The vote is being held unusually early in the year, due to an accelerated election schedule brought on by the September unrest.
Extra security forces have been drafted to ensure calm, with around 300,000 officers and temporary election police deployed.

Scents and sensibility: Greek goddess Pasithea inspires rest and relaxation in Warsaw art show

At Agnieszka Apoznańska's 'Pasithea' visitors see through painted eyes, catch a whiff of honey and feel that rest is a right, not a reward. The Greek goddess Pasithea embodies the thoughts of the artist.
As you walk into the 'Pasithea' exhibition by Agnieszka Apoznańska at Lotna Gallery in Warsaw, you can feel your tiredness melting away, even though the long winter shows no sign of easing.
Right at the entrance you are greeted by... a scent. It is unusual, because after all we have come to a painting exhibition. But this show aims to awakens more of our senses.
Zuzanna Ziętek, who specialises in combining fragrance and art, has created a special perfume for Agnieszka Apoznańska’s exhibition that reflects its mood.
'The scent complements these wonderful works, which are very intimate, soft, full of subtle nuances and, in my view, harmonise perfectly with the fragrance I created especially for this exhibition. The scent completes the artist’s paintings: it is enveloping, sweet, warm and has something slightly mysterious about it,' explains Ziętek.
The 44 paintings are intended as an invitation to effortless rest. As curator Julia Barbasiewicz says, the 'Pasithea' exhibition is a tribute to relaxation you do not have to justify.
Pasithea is the Greek goddess of relaxation, rest and hallucinations, the youngest of Venus’s companions and the wife of Hypnos, the god of sleep. She embodies the idea the artist is trying to convey in her works.
'They are very oneiric, dreamlike. Agnieszka blurs the contours in her paintings, which is very characteristic of her. And it is precisely on this kind of softness and slight unreality of these situations that we have built the “Pasithea” exhibition. We would like it to be an invitation to rest, but also to let go of a certain pose, a certain mask we wear every day,' the curator explains.
Shades of pink dominate in Agnieszka Apoznańska’s works. It is a colour that has many meanings for her.
'For me it is a colour that is at once very feminine, stereotypically feminine – little girls are pink – but it is also associated with closeness, with the warmth of the mother’s womb, and with skin, with a very strong sense of corporeality. With each work I explore it in a slightly different direction, trying to draw out the intimate qualities of this colour, and sometimes the repellent ones. A dirty pink that may remind you of a scratch on the skin, that can verge on the colour of blood, that can stir unease in us, and on the other hand can evoke a feeling of warmth, love and the almost tangible texture of this colour,' explains Apoznańska.
The painter admits that the opening is one of the few moments when she can see so many of her paintings together at once and can play with them a little.
'I work on a single idea, which I explore from painting to painting. In this case it was the theme of rest, relaxation and the need to find yourself in it. With each subsequent work I found that rest in a different symbol, or a different intensity of colour, or a fragment of the body. Each work gave me a hint of what the next one would look like,' says Apoznańska.
There is no single way to experience the 'Pasithea' exhibition.
'The paintings work like a kind of jigsaw puzzle, and the paths you can trace for yourself between them are certain motifs that recur. But this is not imposed either by the artist or by me. We want everyone to be able to build their own story on the basis of Agnieszka’s works,' says curator Julia Barnasiewicz.
Agnieszka Apoznańska confides that she likes the fact that when she works with many paintings at the same time, she can eventually arrange them like a puzzle.
'Juxtaposing one path I followed with another – for example a piece of the body with a symbol, with another colour, and so on. With this display I could play a little, juxtaposing formats, close-ups and details,' the painter says.
The artist would like visitors to play this game too. 'By walking around and looking for the story and the thread that passes from work to work. To look at one painting and after a moment continue their thought in the next one. Just as I do in my process,' she encourages.
The exhibition also features the motif of a curtain. It is a pink, circular, transparent drape installed among the paintings, through which you can look at a blurred world of the kind that Apoznańska presents in her works.
'The motif of a curtain also appears in the exhibition – both in the paintings and physically – a curtain behind which we no longer have to perform for other people. You can step into it, in a sense like into a portal where you can hide, but through which you can also look at the works,' says the exhibition’s curator.
The painting exhibition 'Pasithea' by Agnieszka Apoznańska can be seen at Lotna Gallery in Warsaw until 6 March.

Country diary: An anxious buzzard has me mirroring its movements | Derek Niemann

Six, seven, eight, nine long‑tailed tits are on a foraging flit through hawthorn bushes, and the straggler drops obligingly on to a berry‑stacked twig before my eyes. Its tail works like the hand of a clock as the clinging bird jiggle‑jumps through a full 360-degree rotation, beak pecking for who knows what. The twig is unmoved by such exertions, for the bird weighs the equivalent of seven paperclips. What must it be like to inhabit the insubstantial ghost‑world of a long‑tailed tit, where you can leap and land all you like with no discernible impact?
Ahead and above, a bird 100 times its weight is weightless in the sky. The soaring buzzard masters gravity with its “fingertips” – the deeply separated primary feather tips on the wings. I cannot see the little flicks and tilts that enable it to descend in controlled steps; drop and hold, drop and hold.
The buzzard begins a slow circumnavigation of the space above an oak crown on the old railway embankment and then thinks better of it, cutting away towards the top of a stately conifer. Here it makes like the post-Christmas fairy, talons thrust forward to alight at the very tip. This, it would seem, is destined to be its lookout perch.
Nobody has told the tree. The bird tucks its wings away on landing, but not quite. One wing is held crooked and refuses to close. Then the other wing half rises, straightens, fingers reaching out. The buzzard squirms and shifts its grip, but still it can’t find stability on its perch. There isn’t a breath of wind, but perhaps the tree is forced to flex under an overheavy burden. The bird is visibly discombobulated.
Watching this anxiety-ridden performance, I am suddenly aware that my arms have lifted themselves from my side in sympathy, as if I too was trying to balance. In this moment, when I can truly relate to the discomfort and uncertainty of a fellow creature, I feel the warmest gush of true empathy.
The buzzard gives up on Christmas and peels away, letting gravity carry it down off the side of the bank. Fast, very fast.

At this year’s Munich Security Conference, the U.S. struck a softer tone — but Europe remains wary.
Back in Brussels, as finance ministers gather for a Eurogroup meeting, a new informal format — the so-called E6 — is drawing attention. Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Poland — Europe’s biggest economies — are coordinating more closely, reigniting questions about whether the EU is drifting toward a multi-speed future. Not everyone is comfortable with it.
Meanwhile, after 613 days without a fully empowered executive, Brussels finally has a new regional government.

Sarytogan nails huge, measured graphite milestone in Kazakhstan
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Sarytogan Graphite has landed a key milestone for its flagship graphite deposit in Central Kazakhstan, with a significant JORC-compliant upgrade to its mineral resource estimate, which includes a maiden measured reserve of 5.4 million tonnes at 28.3 per cent total graphitic carbon (TGC).
For the first time, Sarytogan’s central graphite zone – the backbone of its PFS mine plan for the first 23 years of production – now hosts a measured resource.
Significantly, the new reserve alone supports more than three decades of initial mine life at the targeted processing rate of 0.15 Mtpa.
The full upgraded CGZ resource now comprises a total combined measured, indicated and inferred resource of 56.6 million tonnes at an average grade of 28.8 per cent TGC.
‘Achieving Measured classification is a significant step forward for the Sarytogan Graphite Project.’Sarytogan Graphite managing director Sean Gregory
Combined with the previously reported northern graphite zone’s indicated and inferred 168 million tonnes at 29.3 per cent TGC, the project’s total mineral resource inventory across the central and northern zones is a massive 225 million tonnes at 29.2 per cent TGC, casting Sarytogan’s graphite venture into the heady realm of a truly world-class deposit.
The graphite deposit belongs to the black shale regional-metamorphic type. Its general geology comprises graphite mineralisation hosted in metamorphosed carbonaceous siltstones, shales and conglomerate sediments. Local hydrothermally altered greisen zones add to the mix, forming a mineralised package more than 80 metres thick within the Sarytoganbai syncline.
A syncline is a trough-shaped fold in one or more rock layers that has formed by compressive tectonic forces that have bent the layers downwards. The sedimentary sequence has been subject to strong contact metamorphism by its proximity to granite intrusions which has led to the formation of the high-grade graphite mineralisation.
Sarytogan Graphite managing director Sean Gregory said: “Achieving Measured classification is a significant step forward for the Sarytogan Graphite Project. The new MRE is informed by much closer spaced drilling at 50m x 50m that has enabled a more detailed geological and structural interpretation and exclusion of waste blocks.
The latest resource estimate is underpinned by an extensive dataset from 82 historical and recent diamond drill holes and 18 trenches, delivering a high level of confidence in geological and grade continuity. That confidence is reinforced by close-spaced drilling across the measured areas, which tightly constrains the mineralised system.
The upgraded mineral resource estimate, including the new measured reserve, is part of the definitive feasibility study slated for completion by mid-year.
Sarytogan’s metallurgical testwork has demonstrated strong graphite recoveries and the capacity to produce high-purity concentrates of up to 99.999 per cent carbon – known as five nine purity - via thermal purification and spheronised material suitable for use in modern lithium-ion battery designs, as well as other industrial uses.
Sarytogan says it will complete pilot-scale flotation in Australia this quarter for customer samples, followed by pilot purification and spheronisation in the US.
The project enjoys strong support from its strategic status under the EU’s critical raw materials act, with mining lease and environmental permits already in hand.
Sarytogan Graphite’s resource re-evaluation has significantly sharpened geological confidence across its priority mining area, materially de-risking the path to production. Notably, it has achieved this while preserving the project’s status as one of the highest-grade, large-scale graphite assets on the global stage.
The resource classification and scale upgrade represent a major hurdle that Sarytogan has now crossed. A high-grade measured reserve in the company’s envisaged initial starter pit that could sustain production at the current planned rate for a generation is exactly what lenders and off-takers love to see.

India hosts a high-stakes AI summit in New Delhi, drawing 20 leaders and top tech CEOs
India is hosting a major AI summit in New Delhi this week, as it pushes to shape global rules and show its own AI ambitions
- Bookmark
India is hosting an artificial intelligence summit this week, bringing together heads of state, senior officials and tech executives to New Delhi for a five-day gathering highlighting the growing global importance of the technology.
Organizers said the India AI Impact Summit is the first such summit being held in the Global South to discuss the technology developed and dominated by wealthy companies based in rich countries. It comes at a pivotal moment as AI rapidly transforms economies, reshapes labor markets and raises questions around regulations, security and ethics.
From generative AI tools that can produce text and images to advanced systems used in defense, health care and climate modeling, AI has become a central focus for governments and corporations across the world.
The summit, previously held in France, the U.K. and South Korea, has evolved far beyond its modest beginnings as a meeting tightly focused on the safety of cutting-edge AI systems into an all-purpose jamboree trade fair in which safety is just one aspect.
India aspires to be a rising AI power
India — the world’s most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing digital markets — sees the summit as an opportunity to project itself as a bridge between advanced economies and the Global South.
Officials said the country’s experience in building large-scale digital public infrastructure, including digital identity and payment platforms, offer a model for deploying AI at scale while keeping costs low.
“The goal is clear: AI should be used for shaping humanity, inclusive growth and a sustainable future,” India’s Minister for Electronics and Information Technology Ashwini Vaishnaw said.
The summit begins Monday and will be attended by 20 heads of state and government, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a session Thursday.
Google’s Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, Qualcomm’s CEO Cristiano Amon, OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman, Microsoft’s President Brad Smith and AMI Labs Executive Chairman Yann LeCun are also expected to attend.
Indian executives are hoping the summit will reflect the country’s recognition as an enabler of national capabilities, economic resilience and long-term capabilities.
“As India continues on the journey to become a developed nation by 2047, AI has a critical role to play in strengthening large scale systems, from energy and manufacturing to public infrastructure,” said Sumant Sinha, the CEO of the NASDAQ-listed ReNew, a clean energy company.
Summit to adopt New Delhi declaration
Like previous editions, the India AI Impact Summit is not expected to result in a joint binding political agreement. It’s more likely that the event could end with a non-binding pledge or declaration on goals for AI development.
Last year’s edition, the Paris AI Action Summit, was dominated by U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s speech in which he rebuked European efforts to curb AI’s risks by warning global leaders and tech industry executives against “excessive regulation” that could hobble the rapidly growing AI industry.
AI summits have evolved since the first meeting in November 2023, barely a year after the launch of ChatGPT, which stoked both excitement and fear about the capabilities of generative artificial intelligence.
That meeting at a former code breaking base north of London was attended only by official delegations from 28 countries and the European Union, along with a small number of AI execs and researchers, and was focused on keeping AI safe and reining in its potentially catastrophic risks.
Ahead of the India meeting, a panel of experts released a second annual safety report on the risks posed by the most advanced AI systems, including through misuse, malfunctions and so-called systemic risks.
AI governance efforts are also underway elsewhere, including at the United Nations, which last year adopted a resolution to set up two key bodies on AI — a global forum and an independent scientific panel of experts.
“The whole point of this report is to build an international consensus on the state of the science regarding the emerging risks of AI,” said Yoshua Bengio, a prominent scientist known as one of the “Godfathers of AI” who led the study. “It’s really important that the world will continue to have a strong independent scientific evaluation of the risks.”
Reskilling key to hedging AI impact on jobs
Like elsewhere, there have been concerns in India about AI’s adverse effect on jobs across technology and allied sectors, but experts point to reskilling to hedge risks.
“There is a lot of genuine concern around this theme, and I don’t want to underestimate this impact. But, from an Indian lens, emphasis is on re-skilling programs and as AI becomes much more mainstream, you will also see newer job roles coming up,” said Sangeeta Gupta, senior vice president at Nasscom, a prominent body representing India’s technology industry.
For 22-year-old Anirudh Singh, pursuing a master’s in social work from Delhi University, AI makes it easier to prepare internship projects.
“I think AI is just reducing the tedious work that students generally had to do,” said Singh.

Europe should abandon its illusions about transatlantic relations — newspaper

BEIJING, February 16. /TASS/. Europe needs to abandon its illusions about transatlantic relations and embrace a more pragmatic and multipolar world order, a China Daily editorial on the Munich Security Conference said.
The newspaper notes that geopolitics is increasingly driven by calculation rather than value-based rhetoric. "Geopolitics is not a romantic drama. It is a balance sheet," the article states. According to the publication, the US is increasingly viewing its alliance commitments through the prism of its own interests rather than the idea of a "shared destiny" with its European allies.
The editorial points out that signals from Washington indicate that the terms of cooperation are being reassessed. Statements by US officials about burden sharing should be seen not as temporary disagreements, but as a revision of the contract terms, the newspaper notes.
At the same time, Europe should take into account the changing global balance of power, the article says. Emerging economies already account for more than 60% of global production, and China remains the largest trading partner for more than 120 countries. In these circumstances, "interdependence is not a slogan; it is the validation of relations," the article points out.
The newspaper recalls that, during his speech in Munich, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged strengthening multilateralism and rejecting bloc thinking. He stressed that Europe should not be "on the menu but at the table" when it comes to resolving international crises. The publication also highlights the economic interdependence between the EU and China, whose daily trade volume exceeds 2 billion euros, noting that disruptions in global supply chains could harm European industries.
Overall, the newspaper writes that the current situation underscores the need to revise European strategic thinking. "The era of strategic adolescence — when Europe could rely on US guardianship while indulging in geopolitical wishful thinking — is ending," the piece concluded.

Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ null and void: Palestinian Foreign Ministry
Ministry says move seeks to legitimize settlement expansion, calls for urgent international action to halt annexation and protect two-state solution
ISTANBUL
The Israeli government's approval of a proposal to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” is legally null and void, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said Sunday, warning that the move aims to advance annexation and settlement expansion.
In a statement on the US social media company X’s platform, the ministry condemned the decision “in the strongest terms.”
It also rejected any attempt to transform the lands of the occupied West Bank into state property under the authority of the occupation along with all the consequences that entail attempts to “legitimize the crime of settlement and annexation, and to create pathways that facilitate the seizure, occupation and theft of Palestinian lands and the expansion of illegal settlements.”
It stressed that the measure also constitutes a practical beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state.
The move constitutes a direct challenge to the international legal order and the will of the international community, amounting to a flagrant violation of international peace and security principles, it added.
The ministry said the decision is in “clear contradiction with United Nations resolutions, foremost among them UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which affirmed the illegality of settlements in all of the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem.”
It also cited the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which found Israel’s occupation unlawful.
“The Ministry calls on the international community, the Security Council, and all legal and international bodies to stand firmly against these accelerating unilateral illegal measures,” the statement said.
It also called for urgent action to deter the occupation and halt annexation and settlement policies that “threaten the two-state solution, the international consensus, and undermine security and stability in the region.”
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast swathes of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A of the West Bank is under full Palestinian control and Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B while prohibiting it in Area C.
The latest move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

‘Absolutely terrifying’ New Zealand storm leaves 30,000 homes without power
One man was found dead in a submerged vehicle on a highway after heavy rains and strong winds lashed the North Island over the weekend
Domestic media reported a few flights had resumed operating by afternoon from the airport in Wellington, the capital, although cancellations were still widespread after authorities said most morning flights were disrupted.
Air New Zealand said it hoped to resume services when conditions ease later on Monday, after it paused operations at Wellington, Napier and Palmerston North airports.
Online images showed flooded semirural neighbourhoods, inundated homes, trees fallen on vehicles and collapsed sections of road after waters receded.
The weather had been “absolutely terrifying”, Marilyn Bulford, who lives in the rural town of Bunnythorpe, about 160km (100 miles) north of Wellington, told The New Zealand Herald newspaper.
“I’ve never seen huge trees blowing around this much,” she added. “It’s so bad. I haven’t seen anything like it.”

Ghana’s president urges African Union states to back resolution recognizing injustices of transatlantic slave trade
Move would formally acknowledge historical crimes and advance dialogue on reparatory justice, says John Mahama
ISTANBUL
Ghana’s president called on African Union (AU) member states Sunday to support a draft resolution aimed at recognizing the historical injustices caused by the transatlantic slave trade.
John Mahama made the comments while speaking at a press conference during the 39th AU Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Mahama said that while the step would not erase the past, it would formally acknowledge that the trade in enslaved Africans and racialized slavery were grave crimes that played a central role in shaping the modern world.
“All peoples of African descent have been waiting for this day. The truth cannot be buried. The legal foundations are sound; the moral imperative is undeniable,” he said.
Highlighting that confronting historical truths is a matter of “moral courage,” not division, Mahama noted that the effects of slavery continue today in the form of structural inequality, racial discrimination and economic imbalances.
“Adoption of the resolution will not be the end. Following the adoption, Ghana will continue engagement with the United Nations Secretary General, the African Union Commission, relevant UN bodies and interested member states,” he said.
“This is about a sustained dialogue on reparatory justice and healing,” he added.

Ukrainian drone strike sparks fires at Russian Black Sea port ahead of US-brokered peace talks

The latest attacks in fighting between both sides come ahead of another round of US-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva.
Ukrainian authorities said Sunday that a drone strike ignited fires at one of Russia’s Black Sea ports ahead of this week's fresh talks aimed at ending the nearly four-year-old war.
"An oil terminal in southern Russia and the Pantsir-S1 air defence systerm in the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea have been hit," Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement.
According to regional Gov. Veniamin Kondratyev, two people were wounded in the attack on the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, which damaged an oil storage tank, warehouse and terminals.
In the latest Russian strikes, officials in Ukraine's Odesa region reported falling debris from Moscow's drones damaged civilian and transport infrastructure, causing disruption to the power and water supply, while two women were reportedly injured in a guided aerial bomb strike on the Zaporizhzhia District.
The latest attacks in fighting between both sides come ahead of another round of US-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva.
It also comes ahead of the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbour which began on 24 February 2022.
Ukrainian authorities say their long-range drone attacks against Russian energy facilities are intended to deny Moscow the money it needs from oil exports in order to carry out its full-scale invasion.
Their attacks are also seen as a response to Russia's massive strikes to destroy the Ukrainian electricity grid in order to prevent citizens from having access to running water, heat, or light.
On Sunday, Ukrainian officials stated that over 1,600 buildings in Kyiv were still without heat following a flurry of Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, which have also killed dozens of civilians and workers.
Zelenskyy: Questions remain over security guarantees
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested there were still questions remaining over future security guarantees for his country.
His concerns were echoed by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a ranking member of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
“Unless we have real security guarantees on whatever peace agreement is ultimately determined, we are going to be here again, because one of the things we know is that Russia has geared up not just for Ukraine, but to go beyond Ukraine,” she told reporters in Munich on Sunday.
Zelenskyy also questioned how the concept of a free trade zone—proposed by the US—would work in the Donbas region, which Russia insists Kyiv must give up for peace.
He said the Americans want peace as quickly as possible and that the US team wants to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time, whereas Ukraine wants guarantees for the country’s future security signed first.
Meanwhile, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas warned on Sunday that Russia was hoping to win diplomatically what it had failed to achieve on the battlefield and was banking on the US to deliver concessions at the negotiating table.
Kallas told the Munich conference that key Russian demands — including the lifting of sanctions and unfreezing of assets — were decisions for Europe.
“If we want a sustainable peace then we need concessions also from the Russian side,” she said.
Previous US-led attempts to reach an agreement to end the war, including two rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have fallen short in resolving complex issues, including what to do with Ukraine's industrial heartland of Donbas, whose large parts are controlled by Russian forces.

‘Move with agility and steadiness’ in Year of the Horse, John Lee tells Hongkongers
In his Lunar New Year message, city leader describes the horse as a symbol of ‘speed and stamina’, one that ‘boldly charges ahead’
Hong Kong will “move with agility and steadiness” in the Year of the Horse to seize opportunities and overcome challenges, the city’s leader has said in a message to residents.
The one-minute Lunar New Year video, broadcast on Monday, showed Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu admiring ceramic paintings featuring horses, some created by his wife, Janet Lee Lam Lai-sim.
On the eve of the Lunar New Year, Lee described the horse as a symbol of “speed and stamina”, one that boldly charged ahead and covered vast distances each day.
“As we step into the Year of the Horse, let us move with agility and steadiness, seizing opportunities, overcoming challenges and propelling Hong Kong forward,” Lee, dressed in a traditional red Chinese suit, said in the televised address.
Filming their annual Lunar New Year greetings outside Government House for the first time, the pair were seen leading a horse on a stroll in the video.
“My wife and I wish every sector in Hong Kong to lead the way, every endeavour to achieve swift success and the Year of the Horse to bring good fortune and joy to all,” they said.
Lee is scheduled to visit a New Year fair in Kwun Tong on Monday afternoon.

US conducts first air transport of nuclear microreactor in bid to show technology's viability

UTAH -The US Departments of Energy and Defense on Feb 15 for the first time transported a small nuclear reactor on a cargo plane from California to Utah to demonstrate the potential to quickly deploy nuclear power for military and civilian use.
The agencies partnered with California-based Valar Atomics to fly one of the company’s Ward microreactors on a C-17 aircraft – without nuclear fuel – to Hill Air Force Base in Utah. Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment Michael Duffey were on the C-17 flight with the reactor and its components, and hailed the event as a breakthrough for US nuclear energy and military logistics.
“This gets us closer to deploy nuclear power when and where it is needed to give our nation’s warfighters the tools to win in battle,” Mr Duffey said.
US President Donald Trump’s administration sees small nuclear reactors as one of several ways to expand US energy production. Mr Trump in May issued four executive orders aimed at boosting domestic nuclear deployment to meet growing demand for energy for national security and competitive artificial intelligence advancements.
The Energy Department in December issued two grants to help accelerate development of small modular reactors.
Proponents of microreactors have touted them as energy sources that can be sent to far-flung and remote places, offering an alternative to diesel generators, which require frequent deliveries of fuel. But sceptics have argued that the industry has not proven that small nuclear reactors can generate power for a reasonable price.
“There is no business case for microreactors, which – even if they work as designed – will produce electricity at a far higher cost than large nuclear reactors, not to mention renewables like wind or solar,” said Mr Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
The Energy Department plans to have three microreactors reach “criticality” – when a nuclear reaction can sustain itself – by July 4, Energy Secretary Wright said.
The microreactor in the event, a little larger than a minivan, can generate up to 5MW of electricity, enough to power 5,000 homes, according to Valar chief executive Isaiah Taylor. It will start operating in July at 100 kilowatts (kW) and peak at 250kW in 2026 before ramping up to full capacity, he said.
Valar hopes to start selling power on a test basis in 2027 and become fully commercial in 2028. Although private industry funds its own development of nuclear technology, it also needs the federal government “doing some enabling actions to allow fuel fabrication here and uranium enrichment here”, he said.
Fuel for Valar’s reactor will be transported from the Nevada National Security site to the San Rafael facility, Mr Wright told reporters.
However, even small generators result in a significant amount of radioactive waste, the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Mr Lyman said. Other experts have said designers are not compelled to consider waste at inception, beyond a plan for how it will be managed.
Although disposal of nuclear waste remains an unresolved issue, the Energy Department is in talks with a few states, including Utah, to host sites that could reprocess fuel or handle permanent disposal, Mr Wright said. REUTERS

US forces board tanker in Indian Ocean that fled Trump’s Venezuela blockade
Panamanian-flagged Veronica III left Venezuela on the same day as the US capture of President Nicolas Maduro in January.
United States forces have boarded another tanker in the Indian Ocean that was sanctioned for carrying Venezuelan oil, according to the Pentagon.
In a post on X on Sunday, the Pentagon said the Panamanian-flagged Veronica III had “tried to defy” US President Donald Trump’s blockade of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean and attempted to “slip away”.

But, “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down”, it said.
The post included a video of US forces boarding a helicopter and then boarding the tanker ship.
Venezuela faced US sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure President Nicolas Maduro, before US special forces abducted the Venezuelan leader in January.
Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight.
Last week, the Pentagon also intercepted the Aquila II in a similar fashion.
At least nine ships have been seized so far.
The seizures are part of the Trump administration’s broader efforts to take control of Venezuela’s oil.
US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright told NBC News on Thursday that oil sales from Venezuela, controlled by Washington, have generated more than $1bn since Maduro’s capture. He said the sales in the next few months will bring in another $5bn.
According to TankerTrackers.com, the Veronica III left Venezuela on January 3, the same day as Maduro’s abduction, with nearly 2 million barrels of crude and fuel oil.
“Since 2023, she’s been involved with Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil,” the organisation said.
The vessel has been under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the website of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The Panama Maritime Authority said in a brief statement on Sunday that the ship was no longer registered there and had been cancelled in December 2024.
The Pentagon did not say in the post whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under US control. It told The Associated Press news agency in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond that post.
The ships seized in recent months make up only a tiny fraction of the total number of sanctioned “shadow fleet” vessels operating worldwide.
The AFP news agency, citing a senior US coastguard officer, said the number could be as high as 800.
On Saturday, US forces also attacked a boat in the Caribbean Sea, killing three people, as it continues deadly air strikes on vessels it alleges are carrying drugs. The strikes have killed at least 133 people since September 2025.

Bondi Beach attack suspect gives single-word answers in first court appearance
Naveed Akram appears via video link from supermax facility, wearing a green prison jumper
- Bookmark
A man accused of carrying out Australia’s deadliest mass shooting in three decades at Bondi Beach last year has appeared in court for the first time.
Naveed Akram, 24, faces 59 charges in relation to the attack on a Jewish event at Sydney’s Archer Park that killed at least 15 people and injured dozens on Sunday 14 December.
Mr Akram appeared via video link on Monday at the Downing Centre Local Court and spoke briefly, mostly in single-word answers.
The magistrate extended suppression orders which were made late last year to protect the identities of victims and survivors after they opted not to be publicly identified.
Mr Akram and his father Sajid Akram are accused of targeting Jewish people celebrating Hanukkah in an anti-semitic attack that sent shockwaves around the world. It was Australia's worst mass shooting since 1996, and the worst terror attack targeting Australians since the 2002 Bali bombings.
Sajid Akram was shot dead by police at the scene.
Mr Akram, who was wearing a green jumper and sat with his hands on his lap, only spoke after deputy chief magistrate Sharon Freund asked if he had been listening to a discussion about an extension of suppression orders.
“Did you just hear what I just said?” Ms Freund asked. Mr Akram replied: “Yeah.”
His Legal Aid solicitor, Ben Archbold, later asked the magistrate for time to speak with his client.
“Mr Akram, your solicitor is going to give you a call after,” the magistrate said. “Yep,” the accused replied.
Mr Archbold said it was too early to confirm what plea his client would enter and he was yet to receive the brief of evidence.
Speaking to reporters outside the court, he said his client was "as well as can be expected" as he remains in the Goulburn supermax prison in New South Wales.
"Everyone knows it's supermax … very onerous conditions," Mr Archbold said.
Asked if Mr Akram had given an interview to the police, he said: "All we've done is start the process. We're waiting for the brief to be served. There's nothing more I can say."
Mr Archbold also said he went to the High Risk Management Correctional Centre (HRMCC) to visit Mr Akram.
When asked about his visit and Mr Akram’s conditions, he said: "He's just a client and he's a client that needs to be represented, and we don't let our personal view get in the way of our professional obligations."
Police allege that the Bondi Beach attackers parked their vehicle near a footbridge overlooking Archer Park at Bondi at about 6.50pm on 14 December.
It is alleged that a "tennis ball bomb" and three pipe bombs were thrown into the crowd before the pair opened fire.
None of the bombs detonated, but were deemed viable during preliminary police analysis.
In December, court documents made public police allegations that Sajid and Naveed Akram visited the area for "reconnaissance and planning" in the days before the attack.
Police have further accused the pair of conducting firearms training in the Australian countryside.
Mr Akram will return to court in April.

ByteDance pledges to prevent unauthorised IP use on AI video tool after Disney threat
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ByteDance will take steps to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property on its artificial intelligence (AI) video generator Seedance 2.0, the Chinese technology firm said on Feb 16, following threats of legal action from US studios, including Disney.
Videos generated by Seedance 2.0, which was released last week, have gone viral in China, including one of actors Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in a fight. The AI model has been compared to DeepSeek and has been praised for its ability to produce cinematic storylines with just a few prompts.
Disney sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance accusing the Chinese firm of using Disney characters to train and power Seedance 2.0 without permission, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters late on Feb 15.
Disney said ByteDance had pre-packaged Seedance with a pirated library of copyrighted characters from franchises including Star Wars and Marvel, portraying them as if they were public-domain clip art, the source said.
The letter alleged Seedance was reproducing, distributing and creating derivative works featuring Spider-Man, Darth Vader and other characters, the source added.
“We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards as we work to prevent the unauthorised use of intellectual property and likeness by users,” ByteDance said in its statement.
It did not elaborate on the measures it was taking.
Online news outlet Axios was the first to report on Disney’s move. Paramount Skydance has also sent a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance, accusing the Chinese firm of engaging in “blatant infringement” of its intellectual property, Variety reported.
Disney has taken similar actions against Character.AI, demanding that the start-up immediately stop the unauthorised use of its copyrighted characters.
In December, Disney signed a licensing deal with OpenAI, letting the start-up use characters from Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel franchises in its Sora video generator. REUTERS

Are aliens real? Obama says yes but rules out long-running conspiracy
Barack Obama says a secretive US base isn’t holding extraterrestrials - unless a massive conspiracy kept him in the dark
Former US president Barack Obama said in a podcast interview on the weekend that aliens are real, but they aren’t at Nevada’s Area 51.
During an appearance on YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen’s show, Obama said he hadn’t seen extraterrestrials but that they existed.
“They’re not being kept in Area 51, there’s no underground facility, unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama said during a rapid-fire round of questions at the end of the interview.
Cohen didn’t ask a follow-up question on the subject, and Obama initially didn’t explain his answer further.
“What was the first question you wanted answered when you became president?” Cohen asked next.
“Where are the aliens?” Obama replied with a laugh.

Abduction of Mexican mine workers raises doubts over touted security improvements
The abduction of 10 mine workers in Mexico's Sinaloa state has raised questions again about the government's touted security improvements
- Bookmark
Deep in the coastal mountains above the sparkling Pacific resort of Mazatlan, towns spaced along a twisting road appear nearly deserted, the quiet broken only by the occasional passing truck.
It was near one of these towns, Panuco, that 10 employees of a Canadian-owned silver and gold mine were abducted in late January. The bodies of five were located nearby and five more await identification.
Most residents of these towns have fled out of fear as two factions of the Sinaloa Cartel have been locked in battle since September 2024, said Fermín Labrador, a 68-year-old from the nearby village of Chirimoyos. Others, he said, were “invited” to leave.
The abduction of the mine workers under still unclear circumstances has raised fears locally and more widely generated questions about the security improvements touted by President Claudia Sheinbaum. She signaled her more aggressive stance toward drug cartels in Sinaloa with captures and drug seizures after she took office in late 2024. It has been one year since she sent 10,000 National Guard troops to the northern border to try to head off U.S. tariffs over the cartels’ fentanyl trafficking, much of which comes from Sinaloa.
In January, Sheinbaum held up a sharp decline in homicide rates last year as evidence that her security strategy was working.
“What these kinds of episodes do is demolish the federal government’s narrative that insists that little by little they are getting control of the situation,” said security analyst David Saucedo. He said Sheinbaum had tried to “manage the conflict” while the Sinaloa Cartel’s internal war spread and split the state by obliging people “to take a side with one of the two groups.”
Fleeting security
The mine workers’ disappearance in late January brought more troops into the mountains as they searched by air and on the ground for signs of them.
Mexico’s Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch came to coordinate the operation. Several arrests were made and from information gleaned from suspects, authorities found the clandestine graves.
But the increased security presence has not brought peace of mind to residents.
Roque Vargas, a human rights activist for people displaced by violence in the area, said that “all of the hubbub has scattered the organized crime guys” but he worries they could return. He and others are also concerned about being mistaken for bad guys and attacked by security forces when they leave their town, because it has happened elsewhere in the state.
“We’ve practically been abandoned,” he said.
Cartel infighting triggered violence
Sheinbaum took office in October 2024, when Sinaloa was entering a new spiral of violence following the abduction of Sinaloa Cartel leader Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada by a son of former cartel leader Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán. Zambada was handed over to U.S. authorities and his faction of the cartel went to war with the faction led by Guzmán’s sons.
Initially, residents of the state capital, Culiacan, were caught in the crossfire, but the conflict eventually extended statewide. U.S. President Donald Trump took office last year and designated the Sinaloa Cartel, among others, a foreign terrorist organization, upping the pressure on Sheinbaum’s administration to get tough with the cartels.
By last April, Vizsla Silver Corp., the Vancouver, Canada-based mine owner, announced it was halting activities at the mine because of security concerns in the area. The pause lasted a month.
García Harfuch said this month that the suspects arrested were part of the Sinaloa Cartel faction loyal to Guzmán’s sons, known as “los Chapitos,” and had mistaken the workers for belonging to the other faction. There has not been an explanation for how the confusion could have occurred since Vizsla said the workers were taken from their site.
Mines and crime
Mines, along with other businesses like avocado groves and pipelines carrying gasoline, have long attracted organized crime's attention in Mexico as a source of extortion payments or to steal the extracted material.
Saucedo, who has researched cases in Guanajuato, Sinaloa and Sonora, said he has also seen cases where mines take advantage of armed groups to control mine opponents.
The Mexican government has said it has no reports that Vizsla was extorted. Sheinbaum said that her administration would talk with all mining companies in Mexico “to offer the support they require.”
Vizsla did not respond to questions emailed by The Associated Press, but has said in statements that its focus is on finding the remaining workers and supporting the affected families. Relatives of one of the workers declined to comment.
Search for the missing
In the community of El Verde, in the foothills that rise between the ocean and the mountains, Marisela Carrizales stood beside banners bearing the photographs of missing people. The road leading to a site where clandestine graves were discovered was blocked by a police car. The surrounding town was silent.
“I’m here waiting for answers,” said Carrizales, who belongs to one of the many search collectives that have spread all over Mexico to look for the missing. She has been looking for her son, Alejandro, for 5 ½ years and had come to El Verde with more than 20 others also looking for missing relatives to monitor authorities’ work and demand that they help them look in other places, too. “We have information that there are a lot more graves here … we have to come to look for them.”
It was here in the first week of February that authorities found a clandestine grave and then more in the days that followed. The Attorney General’s office said 10 bodies were found in one location, five of which have been identified as the missing mine workers. But the Sinaloa state prosecutor’s office also said additional remains were found in four other grave sites around the community.
There are many missing. In Mazatlan, a Mexican tourist was taken from a bar in October. In January, a businessman disappeared. In February, six other Mexican tourists were abducted from a ritzy part of the resort city. A woman and a girl who were part of that group were later found alive outside the city, but the men who were with them have not appeared.
While the government has strengthened security in Mazatlan ahead of carnival celebrations, back in the mountains, teachers, doctors or even buses are not coming to many of the communities out of fear, Vargas said.
Labrador, the man from Chirimoyos, said that when he is lucky, he borrows a friend's motorcycle to go to his job in a highway toll booth. When he can’t borrow it, he has to walk more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) through the mountains, because the person in charge of local public transportation disappeared in December.

Asian shares trade higher ahead of Lunar New Year holidays and gold prices fall
Asian markets are higher ahead of Lunar New Year holidays
- Bookmark
Asia shares traded higher Monday and gold declined, as several stock markets were closed or trading for a half-day ahead of Lunar New Year celebrations.
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 edged 0.1% higher to 56,996.21, after the government reported that Japan’s economy grew more slowly than economists had expected in the latest October-December quarter, at an annualized 0.2%.
The sluggish rate of growth increases the likelihood that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi will press ahead with plans to revive the economy by raising government spending and cutting taxes, Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia Pacific at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.
Trading was thin as stock markets in China, South Korea and Taiwan were closed. The first day of the Lunar New Year this year falls on Tuesday.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.5% in its half-day session, closing at 26,705.94.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 picked up 0.3% to 8,940.60. India's Sensex was up 0.2%.
U.S. futures edged higher. The future for the S&P 500 rose 0.2%, while that for the Dow Jones Industrial Average was also up nearly 0.2%. U.S. stock markets are also closed on Presidents Day, a holiday.
On Friday, U.S. stocks calmed after a sharp drop earlier driven by worries about artificial intelligence disruptions across various industries which particularly hit software companies hard.
A report showing inflation cooled last month also helped steady the markets. The data suggesting U.S. price pressures may be easing offered more room for another Federal Reserve interest rate cut.
The S&P 500 edged up less than 0.1% to 6,836.17. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% to 49,500.93. The Nasdaq composite edged down 0.2% to 22,546.67.
Computer chip maker Nvidia, the heaviest weight company on the S&P 500, was down 2.2% Friday. Technology company AppLovin rose 6.4% after losing almost a fifth of its value on Thursday, as investors focused on how AI could disrupt businesses of software and technology-related firms.
In other dealings early Monday, gold and silver prices fell. The price of gold was down 1.1% to $4,994.60 per ounce — falling from the $5,000 mark — and the price of silver fell 3.8% to $75.04 an ounce.
Oil prices were steady.
U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 5 cents to $62.94 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, rose 5 cents to $67.80 per barrel.
The U.S. dollar was at 153.08 Japanese yen, up from 152.64 yen. The euro was trading at $1.1867, down from $1.1872.

An explosion at a fireworks store in eastern China has killed eight people and injured two, authorities have said.
Rural communities in China often light sparklers and screeching "missile" fireworks to celebrate holidays and milestones such as the Lunar New Year, which falls on Tuesday.
The "improper discharge" of fireworks by one or more villagers caused an explosion at a nearby store in Jiangsu province's Donghai county around 2:30 pm (0630 GMT) on Sunday, local authorities said in a statement on social media.
"Emergency management, fire, public security, and health authorities rushed to the scene immediately to carry out rescue and response operations," Donghai authorities added.
Safety standards
A fire caused by the explosion was extinguished by around 4:00 pm, the statement said, adding that eight people were killed and two people sustained minor burns.
Investigations were being carried out and those responsible have been taken into custody.
The Ministry of Emergency Management said that China was entering the peak period for fireworks use during the Lunar New Year holiday, warning citizens against unsafe practices like test-firing or smoking outside of shops.
It added that it also sent a warning notice to fireworks enterprises nationwide "requiring a full inspection" of safety risks and hazards.
Industrial accidents are common in China due to lax safety standards.
An explosion at a biotech factory in northern China's Shanxi province killed eight people this month.
And in late January, an explosion at a steel factory in the neighbouring province of Inner Mongolia left at least nine people dead.

Russians scattering “petal” mines by drone in occupied Kherson region
Journalist Oleh Baturin reported this on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.
“According to local residents, there has been some kind of frantic panic among the Russian occupiers and their local collaborators in Kakhovka over the past few days. They have been blocking roads and scattering ‘petal’ mines by drone in the Kakhovka district, in settlements near the former reservoir,” he wrote.
Baturin said that local civilians are now under threat and could be killed or injured as a result of the occupiers’ criminal actions.
“Therefore, as always, civilians should avoid checkpoints and places where Russian troops are concentrated. They should always be treated as plague-stricken areas, which may increase the chances of survival,” the journalist added.
As Ukrinform previously reported, in the temporarily occupied Kakhovka district of the Kherson region, the occupiers are preparing new repressive measures against parents whose children do not attend Russian-run schools.

West succeeded in making Ukraine European in terms of Nazism — diplomat

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. Western countries have succeeded in making Ukraine a European state in terms of Nazism, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS.
Earlier, at the Munich Security Conference, Finnish President Alexander Stubb said that Russian leader Vladimir Putin had wanted to make Ukraine Russian, but now it has become European.
"I don't know what Stubb means by the word European. If they assume that Europe is synonymous with Nazism, which has repeatedly manifested itself there, then perhaps they have succeeded in making Ukraine European - Nazi, judging by Zelensky's statements. Russia has never had any aspirations to disrespect Ukraine's sovereignty. We have always treated Ukraine as a sovereign, independent state," the diplomat said, commenting on Stubb's words.
Zakharova pointed out that Russia has always proceeded under the assumption that it is fostering friendly interstate relations with Ukraine that are "particularly close yet sovereign." "We established diplomatic relations immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union and exchanged embassies. Special figures were always appointed as ambassadors to promote strong bilateral relations. We signed all kinds of intergovernmental agreements, including those concerning the navy. Although we were close neighbors and had a common economy, we traded on the principle of international economic relations. There were many projects that they now call integration projects, but before, they were joint projects," she recalled.
"Russia did not carry out a coup d’etat there, change the regime, or hold Maidan rallies to bring its puppets to power. It was the West that did this. And they handed out cookies, or rather buns, in the form of US diplomats such as [Victoria] Nuland. And the rallies, which should be the exclusive prerogative of the people of that country, were attended by ambassadors and foreign ministers from Germany, France, Poland, and other Western European countries. So don't accuse us of doing what you yourselves are doing," the spokeswoman emphasized.

The Emma Thompson-led thriller “Dead of Winter” and Hilary Duff's first full-length album in 11 years are some of the new television, films, music and games headed to a device near you.
Also among the streaming offerings worth your time this week, as selected by The Associated Press’ entertainment journalists: A new season of “The Night Agent” lands on Netflix, Dove Cameron and Avan Jogia star in the new series “56 Days” for Prime Video and Harris Dickinson's brilliant directorial debut, “Urchin,” lands on Hulu.
New movies to stream from Feb. 16-22
— Harris Dickinson might be best known for his acting in films like “Babygirl,” but last year he proved himself to be a filmmaker to watch as well. His brilliant directorial debut, “Urchin,” streaming on Hulu on Tuesday, follows in the social realist tradition of Ken Loach in chronicling the ups and downs of an unhoused addict (Frank Dillane) in London.
— HBO Max has the Emma Thompson-led thriller “Dead of Winter” arriving on Friday, Feb. 20. Thompson plays a grieving loner who gets lost near a Minnesota lake during a blizzard and stumbles on a cabin where a young woman is being held by an armed couple.
— And if Emerald Fennell’s “Wuthering Heights” leaves you wanting more (or moor) Cathy and Heathcliff, there are plenty of other versions streaming on various platforms. There is of course William Wyler’s lush but much condensed 1939 film, with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon (on HBO Max and Criterion Channel). The 1992 version (free on Kanopy) starring Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche is one of the most faithful to Brontë’s text for actually including the second generation of Lintons and Earnshaws. Andrea Arnold’s underseen film, released in 2011, (free on Tubi) notably features a multiracial actor, James Howson, as Heathcliff, opposite Kaya Scodelario’s Catherine. There’s also the British television miniseries from 2009 with Charlotte Riley and Tom Hardy that’s available on BritBox.

New music to stream from Feb. 16-22
— The millennial queen hath returned. Hilary Duff will release her first full-length since 2015’s “Breathe In. Breathe Out.” on Friday, Feb. 20. Titled “luck… or something,” the album is a 11-track collection of nostalgic pop, the ideal listening experience for those still devastated by the tabled, adult “Lizzie McGuire” reboot. Of course, this time around, Duff has won out, and the themes are, as one song title puts it, “Mature.”
— It is not too late to hop aboard the Megan Moroney train, but the rest of us are pulling out of the station — and following her to greener pastures. The country singer-songwriter emerged as a fully-realized talent with the release of her platinum-selling single “Tennessee Orange” a few years back; her 2024 sophomore album “Am I Okay?” only strengthened her charms. Now she’s preparing to release “Cloud 9,” out Friday, Feb. 20, to win over even more hearts. There’s a reason “6 Months Later” has been inescapable on country music. Isn’t it time you found out why?
— AP Music Writer Maria Sherman
New series to stream from Feb. 16-22
— Dove Cameron and Avan Jogia star in a new series “56 Days” for Prime Video as Ciara and Oliver who meet by chance at a grocery store and embark on a whirlwind, passionate romance. Fifty-six days later, homicide detectives find a decomposed body in a bathtub which could be Ciara or Oliver leaving the question, who killed who? It's based on a best-seller by Catherine Ryan Howard. Cameron and Jogia, who started out on Disney and Nickelodeon respectively, show they're not kids anymore in this sexy thriller. It premieres Wednesday.
— A new season of Netflix's “The Night Agent” arrives Thursday. It stars Gabriel Basso as Peter Sutherland, a secret operative working in counter-intelligence for the FBI. In Season 3, he's on a mission to find a treasury secretary who has fled to Istanbul after committing murder, that leads to the discovery of a dark money network. Information may be power, but it can also be deadly and Peter's in trouble.
— Jennifer Garner's “The Last Thing He Told Me” returns Friday, Feb. 20 on Apple TV. It's based on novels by Laura Dave. Garner plays Hannah Hall, a new wife and stepmom whose world is rocked in Season 1 when her new husband, Owen, (played by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) disappears, leaving a note to protect his teen daughter, Bailee (played by Angourie Rice). Season 2 picks up five years later when (spoiler alert but it's in the trailer) Owen shows back up. Now, the three are in danger. Garner, who mastered fight scenes for her breakout role in the TV show “Alias” and as Marvel assassin Elektra, gets to show her kicks and punches.
— Alicia Rancilio
New video games to play from Feb. 16-22
— Stealth games like Thief, Dishonored and Splinter Cell have seen better days, but at least one developer — France’s Cyanide — is trying to carry the genre forward. In Styx: Blades of Greed, you are a goblin who isn’t particularly well-equipped to fight toe-to-toe against orcs and other bullies. But if you take the sneaky approach you can fill your pockets with quartz, the most valuable and volatile substance in this fantasy world. Magic powers like invisibility and mind control make it a little easier to avoid brawling, but if things get out of hand you can whip out a glider and fly away. The heist begins Thursday on PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.

EU’s deportations plan risks ICE-style enforcement, rights groups warn

More than 70 rights organisations have called on the EU to reject a proposal aimed at increasing the deportation of undocumented people, warning that it risks turning everyday spaces, public services and community interactions into tools of ICE-style immigration enforcement.
Last March, the European Commission laid out its proposal to increase deportations of people with no legal right to stay in the EU, including potentially sending them to offshore centres in non-EU countries.
The draft regulation on enforcement, which still needs to be agreed on by MEPs, comes after the far right made gains in the 2024 European parliament elections.
In a joint statement published on Monday, 75 rights organisations from across Europe said that the plans, if approved, could expand and normalise immigration raids and surveillance measures across the continent while also intensifying racial profiling.
The plans “would consolidate a punitive system, fuelled by far-right rhetoric and based on racialised suspicion, denunciation, detention and deportation,” the statement said. “Europe knows from its own history where systems of surveillance, scapegoating and control can lead.”
In announcing the proposals last year, the European Commission described them as “effective and modern procedures” that would increase the deportations of people denied asylum or who had overstayed their visa. One in five people without the right to stay are returned to their country of origin, and the rate has changed little in recent years.
Monday’s statement highlighted the sweeping nature of the proposed measures, with plans to allow police to search private homes for undocumented people without a judicial order, as well as “other relevant premises”.
The result could be “ICE-like raids” in private homes as well as public spaces and workplaces, said Michele LeVoy of the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants. “We cannot be outraged by ICE in the United States while also supporting these practices in Europe.”
The proposal could also require public services to report undocumented people, a move that would probably deter people from accessing essential healthcare, education and social services.
Médecins du Monde, a humanitarian organisation, said the broader consequences of such a move were alreadyplaying out in Minnesota, where a public healthcare crisis was unfolding after the months-long immigration crackdown.
“Pregnant women, children and people with chronic illnesses simply avoid seeking essential health services, even in emergencies and when their lives are at risk,” said Andrea Soler Eslava of the organisation. “This is unacceptable and can also cause serious public health issues.”
At the end of January, 16 rights experts from the UN wrote to the EU about the proposed regulation. The 19-page missive lists more than a dozen concerns over how the plans could contravene international human rights obligations.
The UN letter also questioned the EU’s motives. “We are concerned that the proposed regulation may, in part, have been motivated by stigmatising migrants for certain homegrown social problems, wrongly suggesting that removing migrants would solve these problems,” it said, citing the housing crisis as an example.
On Monday, the signatories of the statement added to the UN’s concerns, citing draft measures that include the collection of personal data in bulk and easing the exchange of this data across police forces in the EU.
Alamara Khwaja Bettum of Statewatch said: “Increasing surveillance, policing, and racial profiling will only fuel racism and a far-right agenda – not reduce migration. If accepted, these proposed measures will undermine the most basic of civil liberties to disastrous ends, which is the real threat we should be focused on addressing.”
The draft returns regulation is due to be voted on by the European parliament’s civil liberties committee in early March. Last week the EU moved closer to creating offshore centres for migrants after centre-right and far-right MEPs united to back changes that will give authorities more options to deport asylum seekers, including sending people to countries they have never been to.
Emmanuel Achiri of the European Network Against Racism said those who were most likely to be affected by the proposed returns regulations were racialised communities across Europe, potentially adding to the widely documented racial discrimination they already face.
“Far from being a neutral migration measure, this proposal constitutes a direct and disproportionate attack on communities that are already marginalised and too often abandoned by policymakers,” he said. “Measures of this kind have no place in a European Union that claims to be serious about addressing structural racism.”

Hong Kong banks lure wealthy clients with gold, mahjong sets, fireworks during holiday
HSBC, Hang Seng Bank, Standard Chartered, Citibank and DBS offer the metal to select clients while it hovers near a record high
Gold, mahjong sets, fancy lai see packets and dinners with fireworks views are among the incentives Hong Kong banks are using to lure wealthy customers from the city and the mainland during the Lunar New Year, which kicks off on Tuesday.
Hong Kong authorities estimated that as many as 1.43 million mainland visitors would cross the border during the holiday period, up 6 per cent from a year earlier.
The Year of the Horse begins on Tuesday, but the mainland holiday started on Sunday and ends on February 23, a lengthy period that banks see as a golden opportunity to sign up high-net-worth customers to boost their wealth management and insurance businesses.
Gold appears to be the star of this year’s incentives, with major lenders including HSBC and its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank, Standard Chartered, Citigroup and DBS (Hong Kong) all offering the yellow metal to high value customers.
HSBC is giving gold souvenirs featuring the popular Chiikawa characters to certain customers, while its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank is running a lucky draw for gold medals through March for selected customers.
Both Standard Chartered and Citibank are offering certain wealthy customers gold coins featuring a Year of the Horse design, while DBS Hong Kong is giving out gold-plated Fortune Horse ornaments in a lucky draw.
The price of gold hit a record high of US$5,608 per ounce in January, before retreating to just below US$5,000 in recent days. The metal has risen 15 per cent in 2026 as of Friday, after gaining 64 per cent last year.

Japan rebukes China over accusations of reviving militarism

Tokyo said it had lodged a "stern demarche" with China through diplomatic channels after Beijing's top diplomat, Wang Yi, accused "far-right forces" in Japan of seeking to revive militarism.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Wang weighed in on Beijing's current relationship with Tokyo, which has been under heavy strain since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made comments about Taiwan in November.
Wang said that "Japanese people should no longer allow themselves to be manipulated or deceived by those far-right forces, or by those who seek to revive militarism".
"All peace-loving countries should send a clear warning to Japan: if it chooses to walk back on this path, it will only be heading toward self-destruction."
Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed the claims in a post on X on Sunday as "factually incorrect and ungrounded".
"Japan's efforts to strengthen its defence capabilities are in response to an increasingly severe security environment and are not directed against any specific third country," the statement said.
It said there were "countries in the international community that have been rapidly increasing their military capabilities in a non-transparent manner", but added that "Japan opposes such moves and distances itself from them".
Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi made his stance clear at another session of the conference, followed by a stern demarche against the Chinese side through diplomatic channels, the statement said.
Just weeks into her term, Takaichi said Japan would intervene militarily in any attack on Taiwan.
Beijing claims the self-ruled democratic island as part of its territory and has threatened to use force to bring it under its control.
Takaichi was seen as a China hawk before becoming Japan's first woman prime minister in October.
She said last week that under her leadership, Japan, which hosts some 60,000 US military personnel, would bolster its defences and "steadfastly protect" its territory.

Osmond eyes downstream prize in EU minerals push
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Osmond Resources is looking beyond the drill bit and into the value chain, progressing multiple downstream product initiatives tied to its Orión EU critical minerals project in southern Spain.
Orión EU hosts a suite of minerals listed by the European Union as critical raw materials, strategically important to the bloc’s industrial and defence supply chains. These include rutile, zircon and monazite - the primary sources of titanium, zirconium, hafnium and rare earth elements.
As such, Osmond is strategically positioning Orión not just as a mineral discovery but as a potential vertically integrated critical minerals play within Europe.
Following encouraging early drilling and the sheer size of its 228-square-kilometre permit area in Andalucía, the company believes Orión has the potential to deliver strong grade at meaningful scale. That combination, if confirmed through ongoing work programs, could give Osmond a competitive advantage in supplying strategic minerals into an EU market actively seeking to reduce reliance on imports.
‘We have the potential to have unrivalled grade and scale of rare earths, rutile (titanium), zircon and silica.’Osmond Resources chief executive officer and managing director Anthony Hall
The company is now running parallel workstreams to examine downstream product options across rare earths, titanium (from the mineral rutile) and silicon. These initiatives are designed to capture additional value beyond concentrate production and potentially open funding avenues from Spanish and EU government-backed support programs.
Osmond is also working with various industry partners to advance metallurgical and product-related test work, supported by a 150kg bulk sample that has provided sufficient material for early-stage downstream evaluation.
The bulk rock channel samples collected across the Avellanar Zone – or Zone 1 - returned some encouraging results, including rutile between 13.36 and 13.49 per cent, zircon up to 9.79 per cent, monazite as high as 1.62 per cent and total rare earth oxides (TREO) up to 1.18 per cent. Heavy mineral content reached as high as 32.8 per cent in one sample. These figures underscore the potential grade profile Osmond is aiming to leverage.
The Orión EU project in southern Spain’s Jaén Province is hosted mainly in the Ordovician Pochico Formation, a quartzite sequence interpreted as a lithified placer sand system. In geological terms, the heavy minerals were initially concentrated in ancient coastal or near-shore environments before being cemented and cooked into quartzite over geologic time. A key attraction of the system is that the mineralisation occurs within predictable, relatively flat-lying layers.
Osmond Resources chief executive officer and managing director Anthony Hall said: “Based on our initial drilling success and the size of our permit area, we think we have the potential to have unrivalled grade and scale of rare earths, rutile (titanium), zircon and silica. Given this, we are progressing product-related initiatives with leading industry partners to leverage our potential competitive advantage into opportunities that we believe could disrupt existing markets.”
Titanium, as a finished product of one of Orion’s key elements, rutile, is a cornerstone metal for aerospace, defence and medical applications, while zircon and zirconium play vital roles in ceramics, refractories and nuclear technologies. Hafnium, which rarely occurs in economic concentrations, is prized for use in nuclear control rods and high-temperature alloys.
Elsewhere, Osmond also wholly owns the Iberian One kaolinite and alunite project in central Spain and is exploring options with both the global geochemistry giant SGS and the University of Salamanca to fast-track the development and local production of alumina, potash, and graphite.
In a European landscape increasingly focused on securing a domestic supply of strategic raw materials, Osmond’s portfolio and timing could prove significant. The European Critical Raw Materials Act is designed to fast-track projects deemed strategically important, with Brussels targeting 10 per cent domestic extraction and 40 per cent processing of annual EU consumption by 2030.
Set against that backdrop, a scalable rare earths–rutile–silicon system in Spain offers significance far beyond the rocks themselves.
If Orión can prove competitive grades alongside downstream processing potential, it would put Osmond at a clear advantage as a strategic pillar in a jurisdiction determined to unwind its reliance on Chinese supply chains.

Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Russian attacks on Sumy Oblast on Feb. 15 caused damage to local infrastructure and injured four people, local officials reported.
Sumy Oblast Governor Oleh Hryhoriv reported that a Russian drone targeted unspecified "medical infrastructure" in the city of Sumy overnight on Feb. 14-15, causing damage to the site.
The attack marked the second time Russian forces targeted health care facilities this week, Hryhoriv added.
Later in the day on Feb. 15, in the community of Okhtyrka, two women and a man were injured in a Russian attack. While a 43-year-old woman was hospitalized in the community of Velykopysarivka after a Russian attack targeted a civilian vehicle.
While the exact weaponry used in the attack was not immediately clear, Ukraine's Air Force warned throughout the day of Russian drones targeting various communities of Sumy Oblast.
No information was available on the extent of the injuries caused.
Russia has regularly launched attacks on communities across Sumy Oblast since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion. The region lies in Ukraine's northeast along the Russia-Ukraine border.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 15 that over the past week, Russia launched around 1,300 attack drones, more than 1,200 guided bombs, and 50 missiles, nearly all of them ballistic, at Ukraine. Zelensky said Russia continues to deliberately target Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, including power generation facilities, substations, and the power grid, while also striking residential areas.

Police say two men murdered in Arab city in northern Israel
Two men were murdered in Umm al-Fahm on Monday, reported Israel police.
Magen David Adom rescue services said the two were found inside an overturned vehicle with gunshot wounds. One of them was initially declared critically injured at the scene, and was later pronounced dead.
The deaths of the two men raise Israel's homicide rate to a total of 51 since the beginning of the year, with 46 from Arab society.
Iran says it will hold technical discussion with UN nuclear watchdog
Iran plans to hold high-level talks with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Monday, amid ongoing tensions over the country's nuclear programme.
Araghchi wrote on X that he would meet IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi in Geneva on Monday for what he described as a "deep technical discussion" to try and reach a "fair and equitable deal," and that Iran would not agree to "submission before threats."
Araghchi travelled to Switzerland on Sunday for the next round of negotiations with the United States. In early February, the two countries began a renewed dialogue in Oman following military threats by U.S. President Donald Trump.
The talks in Geneva are again being mediated by Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi. Switzerland, like several Gulf states, is viewed by Tehran as a neutral intermediary.
Grossi himself has faced criticism from Iranian hardliners. An ultra-conservative newspaper accused him of acting as an Israeli spy and called for the death penalty for him. Some Iranian officials argued that the IAEA chief had not spoken out forcefully enough against the bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities.
Israeli citizen accused of gathering intel on former Defense Minister Gallant for Iran
An Israeli is accused of gathering intelligence on Israel's former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant for Iran.
The citizen, Fares Abu al-Hija, a resident of Kaukab Abu al-Hija, was arrested several weeks ago. His interrogation revealed that he had been in contact with an Iranian official, who paid him in exchange for collecting the information.
Yoav Gallant is the former defense minister of Israel and a lawmaker from Likud, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's party. He was Netanyahu's pick for defense minister after his 2022 electoral victory. In November 2024, he was fired by Netanyahu over "significant gaps in how the war [should be] managed."
Gallant later said that he was dismissed over three issues that put him at odds with Netanyahu: "My firm stance on universal conscription, commitment to return the hostages and call for a state commission of inquiry into the failure of October 7."
His dismissal prompted widespread protests across Israel. Gallant was replaced with former Foreign Minister Israel Katz.
Police expected to request extended detention for seven Bnei Brak rioters
The police are expected to ask the Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court to extend the detention of seven of the 26 people arrested in Sunday's riots in the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak.
Police commander for central Israel: Bnei Brak not closed to soldiers, but updated safety guidelines are necessary
The police commander for Israel's central Dan Region wrote on Monday that police approval was not required for soldiers to arrive for an activity in Bnei Brak, but added that in the current operational reality, updated security guidelines are necessary.
The commander added that "contrary to the narrative that is being painted, Bnei Brak is not a city closed to soldiers. Soldiers eat in the city, travel by public transportation and move around it regularly."
On Sunday, two Israeli women soldiers on an official trip to a soldier's house in the majority ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak were attacked by a group of Haredi men, and had to be evacuated by the police, sparking mass riots.
During the riots, a police car was overturned, and a police motorcycle was set on fire. Trashcans were thrown at a police car. Three police officers were lightly wounded during the events, and 23 people were arrested.

Trump's Board of Peace risks becoming a sanctions loophole for Iran's trade partners | Analysis
When U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace holds its first official meeting on Wednesday, Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will also have the opportunity to sign a new trade agreement. After prolonged negotiations and considerable pressure, Trump agreed to cut tariffs on Indonesian imports from 32 percent to 19 percent. In exchange, the world's largest Muslim-majority country agreed to lower its tariffs on American goods, purchase Boeing aircraft, and increase imports of U.S. soybeans.
Is there a connection between the agreement and Jakarta's announcement that it will contribute 8,000 troops to the international stabilization force in Gaza?
Former Republican congresswoman warns of 'Christian persecution' in West Bank
Former Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene urged her followers on social media to learn about and speak out against what she described as Christian persecution in the West Bank, shortly after visiting Bethlehem, where she met Mayor Maher N. Canawati.
"Christians have been killed in the bombings in Gaza and churches have been attacked," Greene wrote, adding that there are "approximately 139 IDF checkpoints now in Bethlehem," a town she said was reduced from 41 square miles to 7 square miles. She added that Mayor Canawati said "settlers continue to take their homes."
"American Christians are largely unaware of the Christian persecution happening there, but need to learn about this and speak out," Greene concluded, reminding followers that "Bethlehem is the birthplace of Jesus."
Greene's partner, reporter Brian Glenn, also posted about Christians being "persecuted and even killed ... by the hands of Israel and the IDF," asking whether "Zionists" were "brainwashing the American church" to cover up persecution.

Here are Sunday's updates from Israel, Gaza, the West Bank and the Middle East:
■ Israel fired airstrikes across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, killing at least 11 Palestinians, Palestinian officials said, in what the military called a response to cease-fire violations by Hamas.

The end of the boozy Chinese banquet hits Australia’s largest winemaker
Treasury Wine Estates’ reentry into the once-lucrative Chinese market has been hampered by a government-ordered crackdown on boozy banquets and renewed efforts to choke the supply of wine being sold through the grey market.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had predicted the resumption of Australian wine sales into China in 2024 would lead to a resurgence in sales, but Treasury’s earnings released on Monday show the country’s appetite is not what it was.
The Penfolds maker announced in December it would slash wholesaler holdings in China by 400,000 cases and in the US by half a million as it attempts to regain control over supply and pricing in both markets, where its profit and revenue are being hit hard by fewer people drinking wine.
Demand for alcohol in China suffered after the Chinese Communist Party tightened rules around ordering extravagant dishes such as shark fin soup, smoking expensive cigarettes and drinking at official receptions and functions.
The wine giant has also been restricting shipments to other Asian countries, where some customers in other markets have been found reselling wine into China, which undercuts Treasury’s control over supply and pricing.
“If you don’t really diligently stay on top of it, it creeps,” Treasury Wine’s new chief executive Sam Fischer said of the grey market.
“I saw some pricing in the market that I thought was undermining our positioning. We went back and got a bit forensic in relation to customer order patterns and specific risky customers, and decided that there was too much risk, and we pulled right back on it.”
The reduction in shipments to Asia contributed to the 10.1 per cent fall in Penfolds’ net sales revenue for the first half of the 2026 financial year.
The $4.1 billion global winemaker, once a market darling, lost almost all of its Chinese business virtually overnight after Beijing imposed steep tariffs on Australian wine in 2020 amid worsening relations with the Morrison government.
When the imposts were finally scrapped in late March 2024, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Trade Minister Don Farrell hailed the end of the four-year dispute as the result of Labor’s “calm and consistent” approach.
“When the impediments to trade with China were put in place, the trade was worth, in 2019, $1.1 billion every year. Now, we reckon that the resumption of trade … will see an even higher amount,” Albanese said at the time.
Treasury Wine Estates posted a steep net loss after tax of nearly $650 million, mostly attributed to the $687 million writedown in the value of its Americas division announced in December.
Earnings nosedived 66 per cent to $236 million compared to the same period last year, while net sales revenue of nearly $1.3 billion represented a decline of 16 per cent. Revenue per case fell 5.1 per cent. The company has suspended its interim dividend.
MST Marquee lead consumer analyst Craig Woolford said the suspension of the dividend was a signal of Treasury’s balance sheet position and the timeframe needed to destock across Asia and the US.
“Treasury Wines’ has a long journey to rebuild trust,” said Woolford. Key areas of concern include the impact to Penfolds’ long-term margins given the lower demand for ultra-luxury wine in China, he added.
The company’s cost-cutting program, TWE Ascent, is underway, targeting savings of $100 million a year. New chief executive Sam Fischer said the program would be a “key enabler” for a more resilient business in the long term.

Sweeping reforms announced to stamp out WA’s ‘tobacco thugs’

Sweeping reforms announced to stamp out WA’s ‘tobacco thugs’
The West Australian government has announced sweeping reforms of the state’s tobacco laws to stamp out “tobacco thugs” on the back of the biggest seizure of illicit products in the state’s history.
Under the proposed changes to the Tobacco Products Control Act 2006, the maximum penalty for possession of a large commercial quantity of illicit tobacco and vaping products would be $4.2 million for an individual or $21 million for a company, and 15 years imprisonment – the highest of any jurisdiction.
Store closure orders of up to 90 days would also be introduced, meaning businesses supplying illegal products will not be able to operate while investigations take place.
The state government will give parliament notice of the new laws on Tuesday.
Premier Roger Cook described the illegal trade as a “scourge on our society”.
“Make no mistake about it, organised crime is at the heart of our illicit tobacco trade,” he said.
“They don’t care how they put people in the line of fire to carry out their insidious illegal activities.
“These tobacco thugs must be stopped.”
Police Minister Reece Whitby said officers had cracked down on the black market trade after a series of attacks including firebombings and shootings on smoke shops across Perth.
Whitby said since January 2025, police had seized 1.26 million illicit cigarettes, 467 kilograms of tobacco, almost 17,000 illegal vapes, $770,000 of cash, while parcels containing a further $1.7 million had been intercepted in WA and Victoria.
As a result, 19 people have been charged with related offending.
Police have also focused their efforts on the Hamad family crime syndicate, who they believe were trying to expand their monopoly of the illicit tobacco trade to WA.
Kazem Hamad was allegedly calling the shots from the Middle East, while his brother Maytham Hamad, been charged with knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime to the value of more than $1 million, as well as possessing prohibited tobacco products (Maytham has not been charged in connection with any other of Kazem’s alleged criminal activity).
Both brothers are now in custody – Kazem in Iraq and Maytham in WA, where his case remains before the courts.
Whitby said police had allegedly interrupted Kazem Hamad’s syndicate and executed the “largest single seizure of illegal tobacco in state history”, off the back of a number of arrests following an attempted attack on a Rockingham convenience store.
Detectives attended a unit on Focal Way in Bayswater and seized more than 3.9 million cigarettes, 3900 vapes and 288 kilograms of loose tobacco.
The total retail value of those items was about $4.5 million dollars.
“WA Police intelligence indicates that this particular seizure has had a significant impact on the Hamad syndicate’s operation,” Whitby said.
“The single seizure represents a figure four times larger than the total the WA Police have seized in the last 12 months.
“This is significant. This is even before these new laws take effect. In terms of other syndicates operating, I’m loath to go into it in detail because this is important intelligence that our police are operating with.”
Health Minister Meredith Hammat said collaboration with WA Police was important in disrupting the supply chains that provided products to retail stores.
She said WA Health would work closely with police as part of a compliance unit to identify the shops selling the illegal products and shut them down for up to 90 days, “hitting them where it hurts”.
“Reasonable suspicion will be sufficient for a 72-hour closure and there will be a higher standard for a closure of up to 90 days,” Hammat said.
“Those closure orders will be a way that we can disrupt the trade quickly and make sure that we’re putting a stop to the sale of those illicit products.”
A second tranche of legislation is expected by the end of the year, and will look at more complex laws including a landlord’s right to evict tenants found to be part of the illicit trade.

No evidence aliens have made contact, says Obama after podcast comments cause frenzy

Hours after Barack Obama caused a frenzy by saying aliens were real on a podcast, the former US president has posted a statement clarifying that he has not seen any evidence of them.
In a conversation with the American podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen over the weekend, Obama appeared to confirm the apparent existence of aliens during a speed round of questioning where the host asks guests quick questions and the guests respond with brief answers.
After he was asked “Are aliens real?”, Obama said: “They’re real but I haven’t seen them.”
He went on: “They’re not being kept at Area 51. There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States.”
The comment was picked up by media outlets around the world, with headlines such as “Former US president Barack Obama says aliens are real” and “‘They’re real’: Obama’s shock alien claims”. Time Magazine covered the drama, reporting: “Obama says aliens are real, but they aren’t at Area 51”.
However, following the media frenzy, Obama released a statement on Instagram on Sunday evening.
“I was trying to stick with the spirit of the speed round, but since it’s gotten attention let me clarify. Statistically, the universe is so vast that the odds are good there’s life out there,” he said. “But the distances between solar systems are so great that the chances we’ve been visited by aliens is low, and I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!”
There is a long-running conspiracy theory claiming that the US government is hiding extraterrestrials at Area 51, a highly classified air force site in Nevada.
In 2019, after 1.5 million people signed up to “storm” the site, approximately 150 social media influencers gathered around the airstrip but the event ended anticlimactically, with only a few arrests, and ultimately turned into a music festival.
Declassified documents released in 2013 revealed that the secret airstrip was actually used for aerial testing of US government projects including the U-2 and Oxcart aerial surveillance programs.
“High-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side-effect – a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFOs),” the documents said.

Iran urges US to negotiate independently of Israeli influence in nuclear talks
Tehran remains open to talks over its nuclear program, accuses Israel of attempting to sabotage process
ISTANBUL
Iran has urged the US to assess its interests independently of Israeli influence in negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear program.
In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said the negotiation process is continuing and that regional countries are also making efforts to help the talks succeed.
Addressing a letter sent via Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi conveying Tehran’s positions to the US, Larijani said that no official response has been received.
He emphasized that Iran remains open to cooperation in the negotiations and continues to support talks, noting there was common ground between Tehran and Washington on Iran not possessing nuclear weapons, which it insists it is not pursuing.
Stressing that the negotiation process should not be prolonged, Larijani said Iran’s missile program will not be part of the negotiations, as including other topics could disrupt the process.
“Our missile program stands entirely separate from the nuclear one. It is a domestic matter, basically linked to our national security. As such, it cannot be part of these negotiations,” he said.
He also said the notion of Iran reducing its uranium enrichment to zero was “not on the table.”
“It is impractical for a country that has already mastered this technology to reduce it to zero,” he said, citing the need for enriched uranium for purposes such as health research and treatment.
Larijani also stressed that Iran is prepared for any potential threats and accused Israel of attempting to interfere in the negotiations and destabilize the region.
“Our negotiations are exclusively with the United States. We are not engaged in any talks with Israel,” he said. “However, Israel has inserted itself into this process, with their intent on undermining and sabotaging these negotiations.”
He noted that Iran is ready to cooperate with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Türkiye to maintain regional stability.
Commenting on the 12-day war with Israel in June last year, Larijani conceded that Iran’s intelligence apparatus was not as strong as portrayed but noted that security measures have been strengthened and Israel’s attack fostered national unity.

The two changes to your evening routine that could have a measurable impact on heart health
Pancreas responded more effectively in participants making this adjustment, scientists say

Dimming the lights and avoiding food in the three hours before going to bed can have a positive affect on blood pressure, heart rhythms and blood-sugar control in adults at risk for heart disease, a new study has found.
Scientists wanted to explore whether better matching an overnight fast to a person’s natural cycle of sleeping and waking could improve heart health and overall metabolism.
Previous studies have shown that the body’s internal clock, known as the circadian rhythm, plays a key role in regulating a range of bodily processes.
Poor metabolic health has been shown to increase the risk of chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and heart disease.
In the new study, researchers from Northwestern Medicine in the US investigated how the timing of the last meal in the day could be optimised for the best heart health and metabolism benefits.
The 7.5-week-long study compared 39 overweight individuals who stopped eating at least three hours before bed with those who maintained their usual eating habits.
Participants were assigned either to a group that underwent overnight fasting for 13 to 16 hours or to a control group that maintained a habitual fasting window of 11 to 13 hours.
Both these groups dimmed their lights three hours before bedtime, a measure that has previously been shown to align the body’s circadian rhythm with a more natural cycle of light and dark.
Scientists focused only on adjusting when participants ate and not on reducing their calorie intake.
Those who adjusted the timing of their last meal saw their nighttime blood pressure and heart rate decrease significantly at night and adjust to a healthier pattern.
When given glucose, their pancreas also responded more effectively, suggesting improved insulin release and steadier blood sugar levels, scientists said.
"Timing our fasting window to work with the body's natural wake-sleep rhythms can improve the coordination between the heart, metabolism and sleep, all of which work together to protect cardiovascular health," explained Daniela Grimaldi, author of the study published in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology.
The researchers said eating earlier and anchoring fasts to times when people are largely asleep were realistic changes that would be achievable for the group of high-risk individuals being studied – and offered a different tactic for intervention compared to dietary changes.
"It's not only how much and what you eat, but also when you eat relative to sleep that is important for the physiological benefits of time-restricted eating," Dr Grimaldi said.
Researchers hope to test the benefits of similar fasting approaches in larger trials.

Why the stakes are so high in the Coles ‘fake discounts’ case

Why the stakes are so high in the Coles ‘fake discounts’ case
On Monday in a Melbourne courtroom, the consumer regulator ripped the scab off a very nasty and previously weeping supermarket pricing sore, hearing allegations they were trying to hustle customers with fake discounts, or more technically speaking, misleading us on price cuts.
The case is also evidence of the power and influence of the social media collective, and in particular the power of a deluge of Reddit outrage that highlighted the allegedly misleading high-low pricing on a barrage of everyday supermarket products.
From dog food to deodorant, and from Band-Aids to biscuits, the masses were calling out what they believed to be counterfeit supermarket price-discounting claims. The consumer watchdog investigated the claims and went on to launch bombshell legal action against our two biggest supermarkets in 2024. The trial against Coles kicked off on Monday.
In the firing line are two of the highest-profile Australian executives – Coles chief executive Leah Weckert and her Woolworths equivalent Amanda Bardwell – and at stake are the two companies’ bona fides as providers of value for shoppers sensitive to the cost of living.
Coles is the first of the two major supermarkets now under the glare of the Federal Court, which is adjudicating the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) claim that consumers had been hoodwinked into thinking they were buying discounted products.
There’s a lot at stake for the supermarket giants that all political parties have cast as corporate pirates, price gougers, untrustworthy and overly motivated by profits.
It has been a popular and targeted refrain by politicians looking to share the blame of the cost-of-living crisis. This is even though none of the government inquiries over the past couple of years have landed a real punch on the nose of the supermarket giants.
In the recent period of rapid inflation, consumers have eagerly blamed the big supermarkets for their difficulties in managing household budgets.
It’s fair to say that community wide, the large supermarkets can count very few friends.
If Coles, which is the first of the supermarkets to face the court, loses this case, it will cement a crucially negative customer perception that they have been hoodwinked and sacrificed at the altar of profit.
It will be a far more costly outcome than any penalties the company could endure. Brand and trust are as much on trial here as anything else. Even if Coles wins the case, there is likely to be brand damage from the fierce scrutiny.
The ACCC is mounting the case that the supermarkets have misled their customers by raising prices for a short period of time – maybe only a few weeks – then lowering them to the same or even above the original price, but calling the newest price a discount.
The ACCC reckons that Coles made false or misleading representations to consumers about the prices of 245 products during the period between February 2022 and May 2023.
By way of example, the regulator says from at least January 1, 2021, until October 11, 2022, Coles offered the Strepsils Throat Lozenges Honey & Lemon 16-pack product for sale at a regular price of $5.50 (on a pre-existing “Down Down” promotion) for at least 649 days.
On October 12, 2022, the price was then increased to $7 for 28 days. On November 9, 2022, the product was placed on a “Down Down” promotion with the tickets showing a “Down Down” price of $6 and a ‘was’ price of $7.
It raises the question of which of the three prices is the real price or what customers perceive as the real price.
It is complicated by genuine price increases that suppliers sought and received from supermarkets in the immediate post-COVID era when inflation was running rampant.
Supermarkets can legally offer whatever prices they want, so this ACCC action has nothing to do with price-gouging.
Rather, it is about whether discounts are fair dinkum or a calculated marketing tool to have us believe that we are receiving value.
Supermarket pricing involves a highly sophisticated and dynamic matrix across the whole range of products, ultimately designed to maximise revenue and gross margin.
Equally scientific are the marketing discounting and campaigns conducted by supermarkets, which in the case of Coles include its trademark longer term “Down Down” discounts and its weekly one-off specials.
It is the “Down Down” marketing strategy which is on trial, and a poor outcome may place new tighter guardrails on how Coles (and potentially Woolworths) operate their discounting strategies.
It will ultimately answer whether the supermarkets’ customers are suckers or whether the ACCC has missed the mark.

Woman’s body found at Bayswater home, man arrested
Updated ,first published
A woman found dead in Melbourne’s outer east on Monday has been remembered by a neighbour as someone who was “always good to us”.
Homicide squad detectives are investigating after the woman’s body was found at a house on Mountain Highway near Dorset Road in Bayswater about 11am.
A 39-year-old Bayswater man was arrested nearby less than an hour after police made the grim discovery. Officers were planning to interview him.
Police believe the pair knew each other.
One neighbour, Steve Nicholls, described the woman as “a nice girl”.
“She was always good to us – she always looked out for me, and we were always there for her,” Nicholls said.
He said police knocked on his door about 1pm on Monday asking whether he had heard anything unusual. He said he recalled hearing a loud noise the night before, followed by silence.
There had previously been heated arguments at the property over the years, including raised voices and doors banging, he said.
“I thought it was one of those episodes last night. It’s a shock, it’s a shame. Hopefully she can rest in peace now.”
Other neighbours said the woman mostly kept to herself and they had not interacted with her much.
Anyone who witnessed the incident that led to the woman’s death, with footage or further information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report at www.crimestoppersvic.com.au.

Armed attackers kill 6 in northern Nigeria
Gangs attack villages in Borgu area of Niger state
ABUJA, Nigeria
Armed attackers killed at least six people Sunday in northern Nigeria’s Niger state.
Wasiu Abiodun, a spokesperson for the Niger State Police Command, said around 200 armed individuals carried out attacks on villages in the Borgu area.
Abiodun said six people were killed, many others were injured or abducted, and a police station and several homes were set on fire during the incidents.
Some local media reports claimed that 32 people lost their lives in the attacks.
Nigeria continues to face attacks from armed gangs in various regions as well as from the terrorist groups Boko Haram and ISWAP, the West African branch of ISIS (Daesh).
Kidnappings for ransom are common in Nigeria despite being punishable by death.
Armed groups typically target villages, schools and travelers in the northern part of the country to demand ransom.

Critica cracks commercial-grade rare earths code in WA
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Testwork from Critica Limited’s giant clay-hosted Jupiter project in Western Australia has delivered its first high-quality mixed rare earth carbonate.
Critically, the company has been able to upgrade key magnet elements neodymium and praseodymium (NdPr), dysprosium and terbium simply using a conventional sulphuric acid bake. The findings represent a significant breakthrough in developing a commercial, repeatable and scalable carbonate product.
Testwork undertaken by the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) showed the carbonate was of high quality, delivering a refinery-ready grade of 58 per cent total rare earth oxides (TREO) and recovering about 80 per cent of the TREO.
By recycling the material a second time in a commercial process, overall recovery through to MREC could increase to as much as 89 per cent TREO.
High value neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium represent approximately 24 per cent of the total TREO, reinforcing Jupiter’s reputation as a magnet-rich rare earth element clay-hosted deposit.
ANSTO also noted low levels of nuisance uranium and thorium, an impurity profile that will significantly help with permitting and environmental red tape down the line. Testwork also improved iron and phosphorus rejection, supporting efficient recoveries.
Critica Limited chief executive officer Jacob Deysel said: “Producing both a mixed rare earth carbonate and a mixed rare earth oxide from Jupiter marks a significant advancement for Critica. This is where metallurgical testwork moves beyond laboratory validation and advances towards delivering a demonstrated commercial product pathway.
Deysel added that the results, although still being fine-tuned, materially de-risk the production process and give the company a solid, proven benchmark it can use to set formal product specifications as it engages with refineries and offtake partners,
Mixed rare earth carbonate is a widely traded stepping stone in the rare earths supply chain, shipped to downstream refineries where it is further processed, including by electrowinning, to produce high-purity rare earth metals.
Notably, the finished carbonate product produced by the ANSTO test work program compares very favourably with other clay and ionic clay projects currently being progressed in Australia.
According to Critica, Jupiter is Australia’s largest clay-hosted rare earths resource, containing 1.8 billion tonnes grading 1700 parts per million (ppm) TREO.
The resource is rich in valuable magnet rare earths such as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium with a bonus 39 parts per million (ppm) gallium.
‘… This is where metallurgical testwork moves beyond laboratory validation...’Critica Limited chief executive officer Jacob Deysel
Initial metallurgical testing showed that the in-situ material could be initially upgraded by 830 per cent, using a two-stage process involving wet, low-intensity magnetic separation and rougher froth flotation to produce a concentrate grading up to 13,310 ppm (1.33 per cent) TREO.
Jupiter’s flat-lying, near-surface mineralisation is well-known for its lower mining costs. As a softer clay-hosted deposit, it avoids the blasting and heavy crushing typical of hard-rock rare earths projects, keeping operating costs down.
That simplicity underpins Critica’s “beneficiate-first” strategy, designed to upgrade the ore six to ten times early in the flowsheet process before downstream processing kicks in.
Drilling is also lined up as part of the scoping study push, with programs planned to grow the resource, lift grades and tighten confidence levels, while feeding cleaner data into resource optimisation and future mine planning.
Critica is targeting completion of the scoping study by the end of June, subject to the outcome of the metallurgical testwork programs. For Critica, the Jupiter scoping study is about more than just economics.
With a refinery-ready product now in hand, improving recoveries and a clear development pathway taking shape, Jupiter appears to be rapidly moving from concept to contender.
As global demand for secure, magnet-rich rare earth supply accelerates, Critica is positioning itself squarely in the sweet spot where scale, simplicity and strategic relevance intersect.

Warning of unclear parking rates after Hongkonger charged 7 times more than advertised
Consumer Council says complaints about car-park services have remained persistently high in recent years, with 120 cases recorded in 2025
Some shopping centres in Hong Kong display unclear parking discount terms that often lead to disputes, the consumer watchdog has said, citing a case where a driver was billed HK$1,210 (US$155) for a full day, more than seven times the advertised rate.
The Consumer Council said on Monday that complaints about car-park services had remained persistently high in recent years, with 120 cases recorded in 2025, reversing a dip to 96 in 2024 and broadly matching 118 in 2023.
In one complaint, a driver noticed a banner outside a residential estate car park advertising “24-hour unlimited parking” for HK$145 and parked there overnight for about 22 hours.
But when she tried to leave the next evening, she was charged HK$1,210 instead of the advertised rate.
Staff later explained that the promotional rate applied only to vehicles parked in a designated area known as the car park’s “inner zone”, a condition not clearly stated on the large banner. As a result, the hourly rate of HK$55 was applied to her stay.
Following the council’s conciliation, the operator refunded the HK$1,065 difference.

Ukraine-Russia war latest: Kyiv drone strikes hit Black Sea ports ahead of crucial US-backed peace talks
Another round of US-brokered peace talks will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva

Huge fires raged at a Russian port on the Black Sea following a Ukrainian drone strike on Sunday, regional officials said, as Kyiv and Moscow prepared for fresh talks in Geneva aimed at ending the war.
More than 100 people were drawn in to put out fires at the port, which handles Russian oil products, grain, coal and commodities, as both sides resumed strikes on each other’s energy infrastructure.
Two people were injured as an oil storage tank, a warehouse, and terminals were damaged in Volna village, the site of the Taman port, according to governor Veniamin Kondratyev.
The attacks came ahead of another round of US-brokered talks on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, just before the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion.
Earlier on Sunday, UK foreign secretary Yvette Cooper said the UK and its allies had exposed a “barbaric Kremlin plot” to poison opposition leader Alexei Navalny as she suggested new sanctions against Moscow could follow.
The Russian embassy in London has denied Moscow was involved in Mr Navalny’s death.
PM 'weighs hiking defence spending' to meet emerging threats
Sir Keir Starmer is weighing a increase in defence spending, the BBC reported today, as a major security conference concluded in Munich.
The prime minister’s aides told the broadcaster that he is considering bringing forward spending targets, though no decision has yet been taken and it remained unclear when a boost could come.
The PM has already promised to bring expenditure to 2.5 per cent of GDP by April 2027, followed by an “ambition” to increase it to 3 per cent in the next parliament.
At the Munich Security Conference over the weekend, he signalled that more spending would be needed to meet emerging challenges.
“To meet the wider threat, it’s clear that we are going to have to spend more, faster,” he told leaders.
Ukraine says former energy minister is suspect in kickback case
A Ukrainian former energy minister has been detained as a suspect in a high-profile kickback case for crimes such as money laundering and participation in criminal activity, anti-graft prosecutors said on Monday, but did not name him.
Earlier reports confirmed the minister arrested is German Galushchenko who was held while trying to cross the border out of Ukraine. He served the war-hit nation last year and resigned in November, when a number of Ukrainian ministers were forced out after a money-laundering scheme came to public light.
Ukraine's previous two energy ministers resigned amid fallout from the so-called "Midas" case, centred on an alleged $100m kickback scheme at the state atomic agency that ensnared senior officials and business elites, including a former associate of president Volodymyr Zelensky.
The scandal also claimed the job of Zelensky's chief of staff, and all three have denied wrongdoing.
"We are talking about the former energy minister of Ukraine (2021 to 2025)," special anti-graft prosecutors said. "He is charged with money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation."
The former minister was detained over the weekend while attempting to leave Ukraine, the prosecutors said.
"During the suspect's tenure... the criminal organisation received more than $112m in cash from illegal activities in the energy sector," Ukraine's National Anti-corruption Bureau (NABU) said in a statement.
Materials obtained in Ukraine and through international cooperation with the competent authorities of a number of countries furnished the basis for its conclusion, the bureau added.
What is dart frog toxin, the poison linked to Alexei Navalny’s death?
Epibatidine, the highly potent toxin Britain has linked to the death of Alexei Navalny, is reportedly 100 times more powerful than morphine.
This extremely toxic, nicotine-like compound originates from the Epipedobates genus of poison dart frogs, found exclusively in northern South America. Crucially, these amphibians are not indigenous to Russia.
Species such as the brightly coloured Anthony’s poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog secrete this substance onto their skin. Researchers theorise that the frogs acquire the toxin through their diet, as captive-bred animals lack it, and wild populations exhibit varying levels depending on their habitat.

Foreign secretary considers more sanctions after Navalny accusations
New sanctions against Moscow could follow after Britain and its allies blamed the Kremlin for poisoning Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, foreign secretary Yvette Cooper said.
Speaking to the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Cooper hit back at the Russians for dismissing the Navalny report, insisting the accusation was “deeply serious”.
She said: “The statement that we made yesterday shows that we have the evidence.
“We continue to look at co-ordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime,” she said.
“As you know, we have been pursuing this as part of our response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, where we are also coming up to the fourth anniversary of that invasion as well.”
North Korea honours families of Ukraine war dead with new housing district
North Korea announced completion of a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honour the war dead.
State media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the "young martyrs" who "sacrificed all to their motherland”.
In recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia's war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.
Rubio explains why US did not back assessment on Navalny's poisoning
When Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands declared that Russia poisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the US did not add its name to the list of countries confirming the analysis.
The report stated that analyses of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
On being asked why the US did not join the statement, US secretary of state Marco Rubio said the assessment "just wasn't our endeavour".
“Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. We chose - Doesn't mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn't, our endeavour. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing based on the intelligence they've gathered," Rubio said.
“We're not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there," he added.
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.
Fire after drone attack at Russia's port of Taman put out, officials say
Local authorities in Russia's Krasnodar region said that a fire at the Black Sea port of Taman, which handles oil products, grain, coal and commodities, had been extinguished.
The port was damaged by a Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday.
British and German defence chiefs call for defence spending to prevent war
The defence chiefs of the UK and Germany have made a rare public plea to Europeans, asking them to support increased defence spending if they want to prevent war with Russia.
Germany’s chief of defence, Gen. Carsten Breuer, and the UK’s chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, wrote in a joint article in The Guardian and Die Welt that European nations “must now confront uncomfortable truths” about the continent's security and make “hard choices”.
“Moscow’s military buildup, combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention,” they said.
“Moscow’s intentions range wider than the current conflict,” the pair wrote, arguing that the pubic must get behind increased defence spending, even if it means other public service programmes – the “peace dividend” from the end of the Cold War – might suffer.
A critical point for Ukraine – and for Europe
Almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the situation on the ground and in the diplomatic arena has become critical.
Our report from Kyiv graphically depicts the plight of so many residents in Ukraine’s capital city, who face nightly Russian air raids, targeting primarily civilian power supplies, in mid-winter.
The intensity of the attacks, the damage sustained for want of sufficient air defence, and the winter temperatures have all been markedly worse than in previous years.
The human aspect, as ever, is the most poignant: nursery-age children who have learned to distinguish outgoing from incoming fire; a parliamentarian relieved that his family lacked the money to buy a flat in an adjacent high-rise that turned out to be more vulnerable than his ground-floor flat in an older building; no hot water, no heating or power, for all but two of 24 hours, all detrimental for wellbeing and morale.
If this is what it is like living an MP’s relatively privileged life in Kyiv, the conditions for others, including those living further east, in the actual battle zone, must be many times worse.

A critical point for Ukraine – and for Europe
UK dismisses Russia's denials over Navalny killing
Foreign secretary Yvette Cooper has said Russia is in possession of the toxin used to kill opposition leader Alexei Navalny and the UK is aware of it.
"This is a particular chemical. It can be produced synthetically. It can also be found in this particular frog in Ecuador,” Ms Cooper told Sky News.
"And we do know that the Russian regime has had possession of this particular chemical. It is obviously not one that is found naturally in Russia,” she said.
Britain and its European allies said on Saturday that the opposition leader had died after being poisoned with a lethal toxin found in dart frogs in South America.
After the findings were announced by Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, the foreign secretary pinned the blame squarely on the Kremlin and said only Russia had the “means, motive and opportunity” to carry out such an attack.

How British scientists found Putin’s frog poison – and exposed a secret chemical arsenal

How British scientists found Putin’s frog poison – and exposed a secret chemical arsenal
London/Munich: In their high-security base in the Wiltshire countryside in England, the scientists of Porton Down made an astonishing discovery.
Tissue samples taken from the body of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny and smuggled out of Russia showed he had been assassinated using the toxin produced by an Ecuadorian poison dart frog.
Eight years ago, scientists at the UK Ministry of Defence research centre revealed that the nerve agent Novichok had been used in the attempted killing of KGB defector Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury.
The finding was central to establishing that Russia was responsible for the failed assassination, which resulted in the death of innocent bystander Dawn Sturgess.
It called into question whether Moscow had been telling the truth when it claimed in 2017 to have destroyed its chemical weapons in line with the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, which bans them.
But the British scientists have now left the Foreign Office convinced that Russian President Vladimir Putin is indeed in possession of illegal chemical weapons – made in secret laboratories for use against his enemies at home and abroad.
Navalny was 47 when he died at a high-security Arctic prison in February 2024 after years of accusing Putin and the Kremlin of corruption.
He had fallen suddenly ill while exercising outside. Escorted back to his cell, the dissident began vomiting as he writhed in pain on the floor. His sudden collapse, loss of consciousness and the failure of resuscitation efforts aroused suspicions.
State investigators, however, dismissed them, saying instead that his death was caused by arrhythmia, an abnormal heart rhythm, and another medical condition. His body was released to his family, and he was buried after a Russian Orthodox funeral service.
It was then that his supporters embarked on a daring mission to show the world what really happened to a man who had been hailed as “the fiercest advocate for Russian democracy”.
Tissue samples were surreptitiously taken, smuggled out of Russia and secretly transferred across Europe to Porton Down, one of the world’s leading centres of scientific research.
The headquarters of the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) hosts some of Britain’s most advanced chemical laboratory capabilities, and researchers at the secretive base have a deep expertise in testing for chemical and biological weapons.
Deploying newly discovered toxicology techniques, researchers concluded that Navalny’s sudden collapse was caused by epibatidine, a toxin produced by the Ecuadorian poison dart frog.
The results, confirmed through collaboration with Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Germany, were shocking.
‘By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.’Yvette Cooper, British Foreign Secretary
Discovered in the 1970s, the toxin is a fast-acting nicotinic receptor agonist that was first considered for use as a painkiller due to its numbing effects.
Those efforts were abandoned because, in large doses, it can cause death within 30 minutes by triggering respiratory failure, convulsions and paralysis.
There was “no innocent explanation” for the toxin – which is 200 times more potent than morphine, not native to Russia and found only in wild frogs – being in Navalny’s body, the government said.
Although a well-known poison, it does not appear to have ever been used in targeted killings before – at least that the West knows of.
Show of strength
There is a question mark over whether it was chosen for use because it is difficult to detect, in which case Russia would not have expected the West to have the technical capabilities to detect its use.
It is not impossible, however, that it was chosen precisely so that it would be uncovered as a calling card – a show of strength and ingenuity intended to signal Russian power.
Colonel Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, former commanding officer of Britain’s Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Regiment, said: “This is a classic FSB/GRU [Russian security services] modus operandi, using deadly toxins and chemical weapons.
“But it also shows how leaky and pretty inept the Russian secret service is, that we know so much detail.”
Such a message would have been intended to intimidate the West and neighbouring former Soviet nations, which Russia believes rightfully belong to its sphere of influence, as well as the Russian public amid rising discontent over the war in Ukraine and the flat-lining economy.
“By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on Saturday.
The toxin’s development in sufficient quantities for an assassination would have required serious technical capabilities – most likely a special laboratory – which put to bed the notion that Russia has abandoned its arsenal of chemical weapons.
It has shed light on the breadth of the Kremlin’s chemical stockpile and revealed the extent of its expertise in chemical weapons production.
“This is not something you order online,” one specialist told Russian outlet The Insider. “You would need a state-level chemical program or access to an advanced research laboratory. The number of actors capable of synthesising and weaponising epibatidine is extremely small.”
The tightly controlled environment in the Arctic prison where Navalny was held gave the Russian state free rein over when it would attempt to kill him.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain said Moscow had “the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him”.
Attention will now turn to the consequences Putin faces for his use of banned chemical weapons, which contradicts Russia’s claim that it had disposed of all 40,000 tonnes of toxins it inherited from the Soviet Union.
Since then, Moscow has used Novichok against the Skripals in 2018, as well as on Navalny on a flight to Munich in 2020. In addition to the use of ebipatidine to kill Navalny, it has also deployed chloropicrin, a potentially fatal World War I choking agent, during the war in Ukraine.
De Bretton-Gordon said: “This confirms what we were all thinking, that Russia’s chemical weapons program is almost certainly extant and of course they are using industrial amounts of chemical weapons in Ukraine.”
As well as the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, Russia is a signatory to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which also prohibits the use of such weapons.
“Russia is a signatory of both, so if it was behind the poisoning of Navalny, it has broken treaties it has sworn to uphold,” said Professor Alastair Hay, a British toxicology expert.
The conventions do not include a system of sanctions for non-compliance, and instead direct complaints to the United Nations Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member. The council can recommend imposing sanctions following an investigation.
“These latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention,” the foreign ministers’ joint statement said.
“Our permanent representatives to the organisation for the prohibition of chemical weapons have written today to the director-general to inform him of this Russian breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
“We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons. We and our partners will make use of all policy levers at our disposal to continue to hold Russia to account.”

Palestine welcomes African Union’s support for its bid for full UN membership
AU concludes its 39th summit calling for full UN membership for Palestine, rejects forced displacement plans
RAMALLAH, Palestine
Palestine’s Foreign Ministry on Sunday welcomed the decision of the 39th African Union (AU) Summit to support full UN membership for Palestine and reject plans for the forced displacement of Palestinians.
In a statement, the ministry described the clear and firm positions expressed at the summit as encouraging, reflecting the African continent’s support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
Palestine also expressed appreciation for the summit’s call to end the Israeli occupation and accelerate recognition of the State of Palestine’s full UN membership, emphasizing that this demand is a legitimate and natural political and legal right.
The AU concluded its 39th session in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa on Sunday with a comprehensive final statement calling for granting the State of Palestine full membership in the UN, affirming that this step represents a legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.
The summit statement also strongly condemned any attempts to forcibly displace the Palestinian population, describing such actions as a “severe violation of international law.”
Palestine holds the status of a “non-member observer state” at the UN, which was granted by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 29, 2012.
In May 2024, the General Assembly also adopted a resolution supporting Palestine’s application for full UN membership.

Netanyahu calls for dismantling Iran’s nuclear programme in any US deal
Israeli prime minister details demands on Iran as US prepares to hold second round of nuclear talks in Geneva.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has outlined the conditions he considers necessary for any prospective deal between the United States and Iran, including the dismantling of all of Tehran’s nuclear infrastructure.
His comments on Sunday came as Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Abbas Araghchi headed to Switzerland for a second round of nuclear talks with the US.

- list 3 of 3Israel bombs Lebanon-Syria border, kills four people
Speaking at the annual Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Netanyahu said he was sceptical of a deal, but had told US President Donald Trump last week that any agreement must include several elements.
“The first is that all enriched material has to leave Iran,” he said.
“The second is that there should be no enrichment capability – not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place”.
The third, he said, was resolving the issue of ballistic missiles.
Netanyahu also called for sustained inspections of Tehran’s nuclear programme.
“There has to be real inspection, substantive inspections, no lead-time inspections, but effective inspections for all of the above,” he said.
Iran and the US resumed nuclear negotiations in Oman on February 6, months after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June, which started a 12-day war.
The US joined in the attacks, bombing three Iranian nuclear sites.
Netanyahu’s comments mark the first time he has spoken publicly on the discussions with Trump in Washington, DC, last Wednesday. The meeting was their seventh since Trump returned to office last year.
Trump told reporters afterwards that they had reached no “definitive” agreement on how to move forward with Iran, but that he had “insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a deal can be consummated”.
According to a report by Axios, the two leaders agreed to intensify economic strangleholds on Iran, mostly on its oil sales to China. More than 80 percent of Iranian oil exports current go to China.
The report, which cited US officials, said Netanyahu and Trump agreed in their meeting on the necessary end state: an Iran without the capability to obtain nuclear weapons. But they disagreed about how to get there.
Netanyahu told Trump it would be impossible to make a good deal, while Trump said he thought it was possible. “Let’s give it a shot”, Trump said, according to Axios.
Iran has long denied any intent to produce nuclear weapons, but has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its atomic programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. It has ruled out linking the issue to missiles, however.
The CBS broadcaster, meanwhile, reported on Sunday that Trump had told Netanyahu during a meeting in Florida in December that he would support Israeli strikes on Iran’s ballistic missile programme if the US and Iran could not reach a deal.
The network cited two sources familiar with the matter.
There was no immediate comment from the US or Israel on the CBS report.
The renewed push for diplomacy comes after Trump threatened new attacks on Iran and sent a US aircraft carrier to the region, citing a deadly crackdown on antigovernment protesters in January.
Tensions in the region remain high, meanwhile.
On Friday, Trump said he was sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, and openly discussed changing Iran’s government.
Asked if he wanted a government change in Iran, Trump responded that it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen”.
Asked why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.”
For its part, Iran has promised to retaliate to any attack, saying it will strike US bases in the Middle East.
The continued tensions have sparked fears of a wider regional war.

Munich Conference proves NATO solidarity nonexistent — Russian diplomat

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. The Munich Security Conference, held on February 13-15, clearly showed that there is no solidarity among the NATO member states, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Channel One.
She pointed out that the difference in positions voiced by the US and European countries at the conference the day before is "not so much a difference as an indicator that there was and is no NATO solidarity;" there is a divided group of countries with their own interests. One part, according to the diplomat, is represented by countries that can defend their interests, such as Hungary. At the same time, Zakharova noted the "rude ferocity" with which Vladimir Zelensky insulted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in order to "look good in front of the rest of the Western European vassals or slaves."
"So this is an indicator for me," the spokeswoman pointed out. "Yes, there are indeed countries that can <...> resist the mainstream, betting on their own short-term or long-term projects, and that silent but at the same time aggressive - I don't know what to call them: minority, majority - at least part of the internal community of the EU countries, which have bound themselves or allowed themselves to be bound by certain mandatory ties within the framework of the command-and-control system and are collectively going downhill." Moreover, as Zakharova clarified, this is true "both in economic and financial terms and, most importantly, in moral and ethical terms."

Columnist Uri Misgav rightly urged that Naftali Bennett, Gadi Eisenkot and Yair Lapid join forces and create a framework for a joint ticket in the next election (Haaretz, January 22). And the head of this ticket, he argued, should be Bennett, both because the public sees him as an alternative to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and because he is backed by Miriam Adelson, who has influence over U.S. President Donald Trump.

Japan's economy barely grows in the last quarter as exports slow, with 2025 expansion just 1.1%.

Japan's economy expanded at an anemic 0.2% annual pace in the last quarter, the government reported Monday, with growth for all of 2025 at just 1.1%.
Private consumption rose at a 0.4% annualized pace in October-December, but that was offset by a 1.1% drop in exports, the latest seasonally adjusted preliminary data show.
Japan’s export-reliant economy has been shaken by President Donald Trump’s tariffs, but has been growing at a lackluster pace for years. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is expected to roll out policies to help revive the economy after a landslide victory in a general election earlier this month.
Takaichi has promised to spend more and to suspend Japan's sales tax on food, among other measures.
Japan’s GDP contracted 0.7% in July-September, quarter-to-quarter, after growing 0.5% in April-June. Since the economy returned to growth in the latest quarter, the country narrowly avoided a technical recession, which is two straight quarters of contraction.
On a quarterly basis, the economy grew 0.1% in October to December, the Cabinet Office reported.
The 1.1% expansion last year was the fastest since 2022, when Japan was recovering from the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The government is projecting that the economy will expand at an average rate of about 0.6% in the near term.

Nepalese candidates launched their campaigns on Monday for next month’s parliamentary election, the first since deadly anti-corruption protests toppled the previous government last year.
“This election will draw the future of the country,” Sushila Karki, who is serving as interim prime minister until the March 5 vote, said ahead of the launch.
The youth-led protests were triggered by a brief social media ban but were fuelled by anger at economic stagnation and an ageing elite seen as out of touch.

Over two days in September, 77 people were killed, scores were injured, hundreds of buildings set on fire – including parliament, courts and a Hilton hotel – and 73-year-old Marxist leader K.P. Sharma Oli ousted. It was the Himalayan nation’s worst violence since a decade-long civil war in 2006.
Two weeks of campaigns will see a host of new, younger candidates promise to offer change, challenging veteran politicians who say they provide stability and security.

A fireworks store explosion in China kills 8 ahead of Lunar New Year
An explosion and fire at a fireworks shop in eastern China has killed eight people and left two others with minor burns
- Bookmark
An explosion and fire at a fireworks shop in eastern China has killed eight people and left two others with minor burns ahead of the Lunar New Year, authorities said.
The Sunday afternoon blast in a village in Jiangsu province was caused by a resident setting off fireworks improperly near the store, the Donghai county government said in a statement. It did not provide further details on what happened.
Setting off firecrackers at midnight on the Lunar New Year is a tradition in China, but many places have banned fireworks in recent years, at least in part because of air pollution.
They may make a comeback in some places after some governments eased their bans last year.
The Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival in China, falls on Tuesday. It will mark the start of the year of the horse in the Chinese zodiac.
Following Sunday's explosion, the Ministry of Emergency Management urged all regions to strengthen the supervision of the production, transportation, sales and use of fireworks to prevent future accidents.
A ministry statement said that trying out fireworks and firecrackers around stores should be strictly prohibited and called on local governments to identify and eliminate blind spots “to ensure the people have a safe, auspicious and happy Spring Festival.”

The Ministry of Emergency Management has warned officials of the urgent need to prevent a repeat of the fireworks explosion that killed eight people in Jiangsu province, eastern China, on Sunday, the start of the country’s nine-day Lunar New Year holiday.
The ministry convened an emergency meeting following the blast at a fireworks shop in Dongan village in Donghai county, which happened after a villager “improperly set off fireworks near the store”.
According to state broadcaster CCTV, two people sustained minor burns in the explosion. Officials from the emergency, fire, public security and health departments attended the scene. The report said “those responsible” had been taken into custody and further investigations were under way.

In a statement on Monday, the ministry said that all regions had to learn from the Sunday explosion and must strengthen the supervision of all stages of fireworks production, transport, sales and use.
“[Officials must] resolutely prevent similar incidents from recurring,” the ministry said in the statement issued after the meeting, which was presided over by Vice-Minister Xu Jiaai.
According to the statement, all regions, as well as fireworks businesses, must carry out a thorough assessment of safety risks and dangers related to fireworks and firecrackers.

Brazil's Lula gets image boost at Rio Carnival, but also faces legal risks
A Rio Carnival samba school has honored Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva with a glowing parade, but his rivals are calling it illegal early campaigning
- Bookmark
Rio de Janeiro’s Sambadrome hosted a glitzy parade Sunday evening celebrating Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in a year he bids for his fourth inconsecutive term. However, his adversaries are crying foul and seeking legal action against the 80-year-old leader and the samba school, alleging the tribute kicked off his campaign six months in advance.
The parade by top samba school Academicos de Niteroi centered on Lula's trajectory from a childhood of poverty in Brazil’s northeast region to his current standing as one of Latin America’s most prominent leaders. Its floats, costumes and songs were nothing but praise to the president, whose poll numbers have been almost evenly split for months.
Lula, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and their wives attended the parade despite risks pointed out by legal analysts about their presence, as it could trigger suits in Brazil's electoral court before and after the October election.
Tiago Martins, the parade's chief organizer, said that Academicos do Niteroi directors wanted to focus this year’s theme on the country’s northeast, as it was in 2025. They later decided that Lula’s story suited that purpose, despite the legal risks.
“Lula deserves a tribute like this, just like any other Brazilian who does a lot for our people,” Martins told The Associated Press as preparations unfolded in Niteroi, a city outside Rio. He denied that the samba schools’ lyrics, floats or costumes were intended as campaign material.
Martins said that Academicos do Niteroi executives traveled to Brasilia months in advance to present their vision to Lula, who accepted to receive the tribute.
Lula, first lady Rosângela da Silva and their guests watched it all from the Rio de Janeiro city hall box, alongside Mayor Eduardo Paes. Brazil's president wore a white suit and a hat with a blue stripe that is a reference to traditional Carnival revelers.
The veteran politician saw many revelers sing along Lula's historic campaign jingle, “ole, ole, ole, ola... Lula, Lula,” as part of an Academicos de Niteroi song. One of his team's fears — a massive boo from the stands — did not materialize even when he left the boxes to take pictures on the Sambadrome floor.
João Santana, Lula's campaign manager in his 2006 bid for reelection, does not foresee any electoral gains from the tribute. He noted the Brazilian president could actually alienate some moderate and evangelical voters who reject the connection between Carnival and politics. Santana also agrees Lula is facing unnecessary legal risks.
“The president and the first lady have dangerously approached this parade,” Santana said in a video published Thursday. “This could all backfire.”
‘There could be fines’
It is not the first time Carnival parades have honored Lula, as progressives like him comprise the majority celebrating the bash. In 2003, his first year as president, the prominent samba school Beija Flor featured a float depicting him as a courageous politician fighting hunger. Nine years later, the Sao Paulo-based samba school Gavioes da Fiel also centered its parade on Lula.
But never had such a Carnival tribute happened in a presidential election year and with an electoral court closely watching.
“Lula is not getting a single vote because of that tribute; everyone knows he's popular in the samba world,” said Thomas Traumann, a political analyst and consultant based in Rio. He notes that the primary legal hurdle involves whether the administration allows a link between the tribute and the election. This could get traction if the president or members of his Cabinet attend the parade while misusing public resources on government-sponsored planes and hotel accommodations.
“There could be fines, the loss of free-air time during the campaign. That matters in a close election.”
As of now, Lula’s closest rival in his reelection bid is Senator Flávio Bolsonaro, the 44-year-old son of former President Jair Bolsonaro. And while recent polls show Lula as the front-runner, the latest numbers suggest a tight race.
A move to block the parade
Martins and Academicos de Niteroi are wary of potential penalties and fines for themselves and Lula. The school had already instructed its more than 3,000 revelers to refrain from making “L” hand gestures — a historic reference to the left-wing leader — during the 80-minute parade. Participants were also forbidden to tell the 80,000 spectators at the Sambadrome on Sunday to vote for him.
Some right-leaning politicians had moved to block Niteroi’s parade, arguing it gives Lula an unfair advantage through early campaigning, something not afforded to his rivals. They also said samba schools receive public funding.
“Samba schools are not meant to campaign for anyone,” lawmaker Kim Kataguiri posted on social media before the parade. “I filed a complaint to stop your money from being used to finance electoral campaigns disguised as tributes.”
“Do you want to pay tribute to politicians? So do it with your own money!” Kataguiri added.
Brazil’s top electoral court rejected the complaints Thursday, with judges ruling they cannot censor a samba school before the parade takes place. They also said they might review the case if there’s any action that violates electoral law during the performance.
Within months, the electoral court's leadership will pass to Supreme Court Justice Kássio Nunes, who was appointed by Lula’s foe and predecessor Jair Bolsonaro, a Carnival critic during his presidency. Nunes will also be in charge during Brazil’s presidential election in October.

‘He smashed it’: Teen marks 18th birthday with 100km run for charity

‘He smashed it’: Teen marks 18th birthday with 100km run for charity
Most teenagers mark their 18th birthdays with a party.
Rohan Martin Ritchie spent his running 100 kilometres for charity on a hot and muggy Sunday morning.
“I will not be going out partying,” said the year 12 student, after nearly nine hours on his feet.
“I’m going to have an ice bath and lie down for a long time.”
Friends and relatives cheered, and some ran alongside him at times, as he ran 33 and a bit circuits of a three-kilometre loop beside Gardiners Creek in Burwood, in Melbourne’s east.
Just before 1pm, as the temperature climbed to 29 degrees, Martin Ritchie lay on the ground in exhaustion.
But he rallied when supporters, including parents Jen and Euan, sang Happy Birthday. He later said that apart from sore legs and a tender stomach, he felt fine.
“He absolutely smashed it,” his mother, Jen said. The run had so far raised over $16,000 on MyCause for the youth mental health organisation, headspace.
Rohan averaged five minutes and 23 seconds per kilometre across the 100 kilometres.
“We are beyond proud of him because it was really hard work,” she said. He did eight months of heat training, which included training in warm clothes.
Rohan, a Box Hill High School captain, started the run in the dark at 4am and said he never thought of cancelling due to the heat.
“It wasn’t an option. I was never going to not do it,” he said. ”Unless I broke a leg or something. I promised myself I would.”
Of turning 18, he said: “I’ve never been a massive party person. I naturally like going to bed quite early.
“I’ve also developed a love for running over the past few years. So, I wanted to combine that love for running with a way to help people, and do something that I thought was meaningful, rather than just having a party that I wasn’t that excited about.”
He had seen “first-hand how many teenagers and young adults struggle silently with stress, anxiety, and depression” and finds running helps with his own mental health.
Proceeds will go to the Box Hill branch of headspace.
Headspace CEO Jason Trethowan said:
“Not only will the money raised by Rohan help headspace Box Hill to keep supporting young people, but Rohan is also having an important impact on stigma.
“It’s really powerful when young people like Rohan share the message with their friends that it’s OK to get help for your mental health.″
Gill Callister, chief executive of Mind Australia, which manages headspace Box Hill, said:
“The funds Rohan raises will make a life-changing difference to young people in the Box Hill community who need support.”
She said it would allow headspace Box Hill to expand community engagement with schools and sporting groups, and host activities for young people and the broader community.

Bondi Beach terrorist Naveed Akram makes first court appearance in Sydney

13:05:27 KST

Naveed Akram, 24, who is accused of carrying out the massacre at Sydney’s Bondi Beach during the recent Hanukkah holiday, appeared overnight Sunday for the first time in an Australian court.
Akram faces 59 charges, including 15 counts of murder and 40 counts of wounding with intent to murder, as well as a terrorism offense, after allegedly killing 15 people alongside his father, Sajid Akram, who was killed at the scene.
According to Australian media reports, the hearing was a procedural case review. Akram appeared via video link from the Goulburn Correctional Centre, a high-security prison southwest of Sydney, where he is being held pending trial.
Wearing a green prison uniform, Akram sat silently for most of the hearing and spoke only to confirm that he had heard arguments regarding an extension of suppression orders on the identities of those killed in the attack. It was the first time he has been seen or heard since the deadly shooting. Australia’s ABC network reported that Akram sat for most of the session with his hands on his thighs. “Yes,” he replied briefly when asked whether he had heard the discussion on extending the suppression orders.
Outside the courthouse, Akram’s lawyer, Ben Archbold, said his client was feeling “as well as can be expected” given the “very onerous conditions” at the detention facility. The defense attorney said it was “too early” to say whether Akram would plead guilty and noted that he had not discussed details of the alleged attack with him. “I have not spoken to him about the attack in that context,” he told reporters. “All we are doing at the moment is beginning the process. We are waiting for the brief of evidence. I have nothing further to add.”
Archbold said he had visited Akram in prison. “He is simply a client, and he is a client who requires representation. We do not allow our personal views to interfere with our professional obligations. The matter has been adjourned. I have nothing further to add.” The case is due back in court in April.
The attack at Bondi took place in December during a “Hanukkah by the Sea” event organized by the Chabad Jewish community in Sydney near Bondi Beach, attended by about 1,000 people. Two terrorists — Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed, 24 — opened fire from a nearby bridge at revelers below. The father was killed at the scene and the son was seriously wounded and arrested. Islamic State group flags and improvised explosive devices were found in their vehicle.
Fifteen people were killed, including Chabad emissaries, elderly attendees and a 10-year-old girl. Dozens more were wounded. Australian authorities described it as the country’s deadliest terrorist attack in about 30 years.
In early January, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced that in the wake of the massacre, his government would establish a Royal Commission — Australia’s highest form of public inquiry — similar to what in Israel is known as a state commission of inquiry. Albanese, who initially opposed the move, saying it would delay the criminal investigation by several years, later told a news conference that the commission was “the right format, at the right time and under the right conditions to achieve the outcome necessary for our unity and national security.”
Last week, President Isaac Herzog visited Sydney in solidarity with the victims. During his trip, clashes erupted between pro-Palestinian demonstrators — thousands of whom took to the streets to protest the Israeli president’s visit — and local police.
At a ceremony held last Tuesday at the Chabad synagogue at Bondi Beach, not far from the scene of the attack, the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency for Israel, on behalf of the State of Israel, granted official recognition to the victims as “victims of hostile acts motivated by antisemitism.”

Milos: Greek island threatened by overdevelopment and a lack of protection
Unknown

Experts warn that ongoing coastal construction could permanently scar the island’s unique volcanic terrain.
Sarakiniko in Milos is a world-famous geological marvel, renowned for its lunar-like landscape, which is considered unique worldwide.
The European Geosciences Union has emphasised the urgent need for legal protection to preserve its fragile volcanic ash and sandstone formations from erosion and the pressures of mass tourism.
Nevertheless, the absence of such protection led last year to the approval of a five-star hotel project, causing irreversible damage to this extraordinary landscape. The residents of Milos reacted strongly and ultimately compelled the government to revoke the permit. However, construction of other hotels continues in different parts of the Greek island, and the coastline is being destroyed as we speak.
"If they keep low density construction, so at least there are no monstrosities [referring to huge hotel complexes], there can be development," says Giorgos Konstantinidis, a mechanical engineer. "That's fair, people here want their island to grow. There needs to be a serious and moderate development. There is no need for the island to become Santorini within five years."
Some argue that overdevelopment may have negative consequences, but at least it creates job opportunities for local residents.
Manolis Psathas, a machine operator at Milos's mines says: "On the other hand, look how many people are working over there to get this [White Coast hotel] built. VAT for the state and revenue. And when the hotel opens, it will bring in money again. People will have jobs."
One year later, there is still no legal protection in place for the island’s landscape, which is a source of concern not only for Milos but for every Greek island. The mayor of Milos has stated that the island’s identity must be safeguarded, while adding that investors who respect this identity are welcome.
"This island has an identity," says the Mayor of Milos Manolis Mikelis. "Its geological uniqueness has made it known around the world. We don't want the island's identity to change. There is room to set up new facilities, to welcome other entrepreneurs, and to build infrastructure. That is what we will support, and we will keep our unique features intact."
Meanwhile, residents opposing development claim that pre-approvals and construction permits are still being issued, even in areas that should be protected under the NATURA 2000 network.

'A drunk woman is shameful': Why women face greater risks but receive less support for alcohol addiction

On the afternoon of Tuesday, December 16, eight women gathered for the meeting at the Moreau de Tours center, one of the addiction care, support and prevention centers at the Sainte-Anne Hospital in Paris. The atmosphere was relaxed, even though their presence there was due to their relationship with alcohol – a subject that still remains largely taboo. The group included social workers, educators, managers, booksellers – all mothers with higher education degrees. Ranging from age 35 to 65, they attend this Women and Alcohol support group led by a care team: nurse Rachida Messen and psychologist Elsa Taschini, who launched the project in 2009 as part of France's first clinic service specializing in women's addictions. "The theme each week is broad enough to encourage them to speak about their life experiences, whether or not they are related to alcohol," explained Taschini. That day's topic was, "How can we help get through the holidays, which are often seen as high-risk situations?"
In a country where "alcohol is everywhere and everyone is exposed to it," as Dr. Marie-Olivia Chandesris pointed out, the stakes are high. Dr. Chandesris led the development of a resource guide of more than 200 pages, published in February 2025, for HAS, France's national health authority. Designed as a resource for healthcare professionals, it addresses the specific ways alcohol affects women. "Alcohol consumption by women has gradually become normalized, even to the point where it is seen as a marker of liberation and emancipation," the HAS report states. "The fact that women face increased health risks is a little-known reality," Dr. Chandesris emphasized. "Because women drank less than men, they were long left out of research in alcohol studies and clinical trials," said Mickael Naassila, president of the French Society of Alcohol Studies and Addictology.

Top neuroscientist Arthur Konnerth leaves Germany for full-time role in China
The Brain Prize winner, known for pioneering brain imaging techniques, joins the rapidly expanding Shenzhen Bay Laboratory
Konnerth pioneered the in vitro brain slice patch-clamp recording method – a technique that has become a cornerstone of modern neuroscience – and made fundamental discoveries in synaptic transmission and plasticity.
The technique uses a glass microelectrode to form a seal against the surface of a brain cell, preventing electricity from leaking away and allowing scientists to measure the electrical currents moving through a single “gate” in the cell’s membrane.
In 1989, Konnerth – working with Bert Sakmann, Frances Edwards and Tomoyuki Takahashi – helped transform the technique from concept to a standard method. They extended its use from isolated cells to neurons still connected within slices of brain tissue. This breakthrough laid the foundation for modern slice electrophysiology.
In 2003, he and his team introduced an imaging method that, for the first time, enabled scientists to watch entire networks of brain cells in action, seeing every individual cell at once. This technique is now widely used to study how the brain controls behaviour.

Israel’s move to register land ‘systematises dispossession’ of Palestinians

Israel’s move to register land ‘systematises dispossession’ of Palestinians
Israeli rights groups say land registration in occupied West Bank will further the Israeli government’s objective of annexing Palestinian territory.
Hebron under Israeli lockdown amid wider West Bank annexation plans
Israel’s decision to resume the land registration processes in the occupied West Bank for the first time since 1967 will facilitate the dispossession and displacement of Palestinians in violation of international law, Israeli rights groups say.
The land registration process – also known as settlement of land title – has been reinstated after nearly six decades, following the government’s approval on Sunday of a proposal submitted by far-right Minister of Finance Bezalel Smotrich, Minister of Justice Yariv Levin, and Minister of Defence Israel Katz.

While Israel has increased the confiscation of Palestinian land through military orders, with the activity reaching record levels in 2025, the new move gives Israel a legal avenue that “systemati[ses] the dispossession of Palestinian land to further Israeli settlement expansion and cement the apartheid regime”, Bimkom, an Israeli human rights organisation that focuses on land and housing rights, said in a statement.
Michal Braier, head of research at Bimkom, told Al Jazeera that land registration will be inaccessible to large segments of the Palestinian population who never had their land formally registered, or who may fail to prove ownership.
In the occupied West Bank, land registration under the Jordanian Administration – which followed British Mandate rule and lasted from 1949 to 1967 – covered about 30 percent of the total area. As a consequence, about 70 percent of the West Bank is “completely unregistered”, Braier said, making it “very hard to determine who actually owns the land”.
Even for those whose land was registered, “the legal bar for proving land ownership is very, very high, in a way that most Palestinians won’t have the proper documents to prove it”, said Braier.
‘Full annexation’
In 1968, Israeli occupation authorities froze most land settlement procedures in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, making transfer of ownership down the family line hard to prove for Palestinians.
Additionally, legal documents could have been lost or stored in homes that are now out of reach to Palestinian refugees displaced by the Arab–Israeli war (1948-49) – when the newly-founded Israel seized control of 77 percent of Palestine – and in the Six Day War of 1967, which ended with Israel capturing the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt and the Golan Heights from Syria, while occupying the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.
The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the newly reinstated process of land registration amounts to a “full annexation” of Palestinian land.
“This is a way for Israel to take control over the West Bank,” Hagit Ofran, a Peace Now member, told Al Jazeera. “The government is asking for papers that are dating back to the British mandate or to the Jordanian time 100 years ago.”
“This is something that, very rarely, Palestinians will be able to prove, and therefore, by default, the land will be registered under [Israel’s] name,” she added.
Israel’s Supreme Court last month rejected a petition opposing the resumption of the land registration process, filed by local human rights groups Bimkom, Yesh Din, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel and HaMoked. The court deemed it “premature” to rule on the implementation of the government’s decision.
‘Totally invalid’
Israeli authorities have provided few details on how the process will unfold. Yet, a similar scenario has already played out in occupied East Jerusalem, where the settlement of land title that began in 2018 resulted in the expropriation of Palestinian land.
Research conducted by Bimkom found that only 1 percent of the East Jerusalem land registered for ownership between 2018 and 2024 was registered to Palestinians, while the rest came under the control of the Israeli state or private Israeli owners.
The move expanded Israel’s de facto annexation over East Jerusalem in breach of international law, including, most recently, an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 2024.
In its landmark ruling, the World Court found that Israel’s “expropriation of land and properties, transfer of populations, and legislation aimed at the incorporation of the occupied section are totally invalid and cannot change that status”.
More broadly, the ICJ ruled that Israel’s long-term occupation of Palestinian territory – comprised of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip – was unlawful, and must be terminated “as rapidly as possible”.
Braier said the Israeli government’s decision was its latest move expand control over Palestinian territory in breach of international law.
“The government is not hiding its intentions. They want to expand settlements and push Palestinians into as small an area as possible.”

Alleged Bondi Beach gunman makes first court appearance

A man accused of opening fire on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach in an attack that killed 15 people appeared in court for the first time on Monday, Australian media reported.
Naveed Akram, 24, faces 59 charges over the December 14 attack, including 15 counts of murder, 40 counts of wounding with intent to murder, and a terror offense.
Police allege he carried out the mass shooting with his father Sajid, 50, who was shot dead at the scene.
During a brief status mention at a Sydney court on Monday, Akram appeared via video link from Goulburn Correctional Centre, a maximum-security prison southwest of Sydney, where he is being held on remand, media reported.
Akram wore prison greens and sat mostly in silence during the proceedings. He spoke only to acknowledge that he heard a discussion about extending non-publication orders for the details of the victims.
Outside court, Akram's lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was doing "as well as he can be" given the "very onerous conditions" in prison.
Too early to know how suspect will plead
Archbold said it was too early to say how Akram would plead and that he had not discussed details of the alleged attack with him.
"I haven’t spoken to him about the attack in that regard," he told reporters.
"All that we’re doing at the moment is starting the process … we’re waiting for the brief to be served, there’s nothing more I can say."
Archbold added that he had visited Akram in prison.
"He’s just a client, and he’s a client that needs to be represented. And we don’t let our personal view get in the way of our professional obligations. The matter has been adjourned, I have nothing more to say."
The case is expected to return to court in April.

Damascus says it took over Ash Shaddadi base as part of US-coordination framework

Syria’s interim authorities said Sunday that government forces have taken control of Ash Shaddadi military base in Al Hasakah Governorate after coordination with the United States, a move they presented as another milestone in the changing US-led coalition posture in the country.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
In a short statement, the defense authority in Damascus said its army assumed control of the facility south of Al Hasakah city. The announcement did not specify when the transfer took place, what units will be stationed there going forward, or how the base will be used under the new arrangement.
The Ash Shaddadi handover comes as reports in recent days have pointed to a reduction or repositioning of US-led coalition forces from several locations in Syria, including the well-known al-Tanf garrison near the Syria-Iraq-Jordan border. Syrian interim officials have described those shifts as coordinated and followed by deployments of pro-Damascus forces and border guard units to fill vacated positions.
A key node in northeastern Syria
Ash Shaddadi has been a key node in northeastern Syria for years. During the campaign against the Islamic State group, the site hosted US and partner forces working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led coalition that has controlled large swaths of territory east of the Euphrates. The base sits near important routes and in an area that has seen recurring security incidents, including attacks attributed to Islamic State cells.
The transfer also fits into a broader political recalibration in the northeast. Damascus and the Syrian Democratic Forces have announced ceasefire and integration understandings intended to reduce clashes and gradually fold local security and administrative structures into state institutions, though the details and timelines have remained contested and uneven across the region.
US officials have not publicly addressed the reported Ash Shaddadi handover. Washington has repeatedly said its presence in Syria is focused on preventing an Islamic State resurgence, even as it reviews force posture and makes adjustments across the Middle East.

Content warning: This article contains disturbing references and descriptions of physical violence and child abuse. Reader discretion is advised.
The Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court released Irina Rimer from custody on Sunday, after she was arrested on suspicion of having abused a 3-year-old child while performing her duties as a nurse at the Reut rehabilitation hospital in Tel Aviv.
Rimer, a 53-year-old Ramle resident, was arrested last week, with investigators saying that the pediatric intensive care unit CCTV captured footage of her crimes, reportedly committed in late January.
Police submitted a further request to extend her detention on Sunday, but it was denied, and she was released. Her defense attorney argued that she does not pose a present danger to those around her, and the court has not yet clarified what offense she will be charged with. For these reasons, the defense argued, she was entitled to go home.
According to the case file, she lifted the sedated, ventilated toddler violently, held him by the hair, slammed his upper body, and then bent his legs in a way that resulted in the injuries.
The judge clarified in a Sunday statement that Rimer is still subject to further legal proceedings, saying that "if an indictment is filed, and she is convicted, she will be punished by the court."
Rimer has practiced medicine for 15 years with no criminal record
Detectives last week opened an immediate probe after a hospital professional filed a complaint flagging possible physical harm.
During the initial investigation, police said the child sustained the fractures during a medical interaction with the nurse.
Police collected material from security cameras that purportedly shows the incident and are examining whether the actions constituted intentional violence or unsafe, aggressive conduct during treatment.
Rimer, a nurse of about 15 years with no prior criminal record, was detained on suspicion of abusing a helpless minor and causing serious injury. Police noted they are also examining the alternative offense of negligent injury pending expert opinions and a full review of the medical documentation.
The child continued to receive care in the hospital while the investigation proceeded.

Afghanistan marks Soviet withdrawal anniversary as Taliban rule draws global scrutiny

Afghanistan marked Liberation Day on February 15, commemorating the 1989 withdrawal of Soviet forces after nearly a decade of war, as Taliban authorities used the anniversary to promote themes of national independence while facing ongoing international criticism over human rights abuses and security concerns.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
The holiday recalls the final Soviet troops leaving Afghanistan across the Friendship Bridge into Uzbekistan, ending a conflict that began with the USSR’s 1979 invasion and reshaping the country’s political landscape. Taliban officials framed the day as proof that foreign powers ultimately fail in Afghanistan, linking the Soviet withdrawal to their broader narrative of resistance against outside intervention.
Yet the anniversary arrives at a time when the Taliban’s governance remains deeply controversial. Since returning to power in 2021, the group has imposed sweeping restrictions on women and girls, barring many from secondary education, limiting employment opportunities, and enforcing strict social rules that human rights organizations say amount to systemic discrimination. Western governments and UN agencies have repeatedly condemned what they describe as one of the most severe crackdowns on women’s rights in the world.
Security concerns also linger. International monitors continue to warn about extremist networks operating inside Afghanistan, including longstanding ties between elements of the Taliban and al-Qaida. Although Taliban leaders insist they will not allow Afghan territory to be used to threaten other countries, many governments remain skeptical, pointing to past cooperation between Taliban factions and transnational jihadist groups.
Resistance to foreign occupation
Historically, Liberation Day has been seen by many Afghans as a symbol of resistance to foreign occupation. The Soviet withdrawal ended a brutal Cold War battlefield that killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions, but it also ushered in years of civil war that eventually led to the Taliban’s first rise in the 1990s.
Today, the anniversary reflects Afghanistan’s complicated legacy: a reminder of past victories against outside forces, but also a moment that raises questions about the country’s future under a government still isolated internationally and facing mounting criticism over its policies at home.

EU needs statements about Navalny's poisoning to ‘cover up’ Epstein affair — diplomat

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. Western countries are trying to divert attention from the Epstein files with their statements about the alleged poisoning of blogger Alexey Navalny (listed as a terrorist and extremist in Russia), Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Commenting on Channel One on European statements and the fact that the US distanced itself from them, the diplomat pointed out that she does not intend to "distance herself from these statements, because she knows what is going on." "This statement was necessary to interrupt the information agenda, which, from the Western perspective, was literally ruined by the publication of the Epstein files," the spokeswoman explained.
"The scale, reaction, and impact they had on the whole world - and I don't mean the political science community, journalists, or those mentioned in one way or another, but rather the entire world - are probably comparable to a global flood," she noted. "Something was needed to direct the international community's attention in a different direction," the diplomat pointed out.
According to Zakharova, Westerners once hyped up the topic of Navalny to the utmost forcing the topic of his poisoning upon the world for many years. "Among other things, there is an element of detective work, conspiracy theories, and so on, which may interest people in some way," she pointed out. All this is necessary in order to "overshadow the Epstein issue," she added.
There is also a second reason, the diplomat noted: the entire Munich Security Conference was devoted to the topic of Russia's alleged aggression. "Something was needed to get the ball rolling, some kind of signal or trigger." "Previously, this role was played by the so-called presidents who represented not Ukraine, but the Kiev regime," she pointed out.
Now, the diplomat emphasized, no one takes these representatives of the Kiev regime seriously: "They are marginalized even by the Western community. Accordingly, a springboard was needed to continue pushing the thesis that Russia is about to attack."
About statement
On February 14, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France released a joint statement. They claimed that Navalny had been poisoned with epibatidine, a toxin found in the skin of an Ecuadorian tree frog. The statement specified that this conclusion was based on the analysis of Navalny's biomaterials. Representatives of the aforementioned countries then accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention.
However, Zakharova told TASS that these allegations are misinformation intended to distract from Western countries' pressing problems.

Kim Jong-un unveils housing for families of North Koreans killed in Ukraine war

North Korea has said it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong-un to honour the war dead.
State media photos showed Kim walking through the new street – called Saeppyol Street – and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju-ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland”.
Kim said the new district in the capital’s Hawasong area symbolised the “spirit and sacrifice” of the dead troops, adding that the homes were meant to allow bereaved families to “take pride in their sons and husbands and live happily”.
Kim said he had pushed to finish the project “even one day earlier” in the hope it might bring “some small comfort” to the troops’ families.
In recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, including the unveiling of a new memorial complex in Pyongyang adorned with sculptures of troops. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.
Kim has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, in recent months to fuel Russian president Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the leaders align in the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.
Kim last week pledged to “unconditionally support” all of Putin’s policies and decisions.
Under a mutual defence pact with Russia, in 2024 North Korea sent about 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 of them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and western sources.
South Korea’s National Intelligence Service believes North Korean forces are benefiting from the war by gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week’s closed-door briefing.
The construction of the new street comes as North Korea prepares to open a major ruling party congress later this month, where Kim is expected to announce his major goals in domestic and foreign policy over the next five years and take further steps to tighten his control.
The timing of the street inauguration is a “highly calculated political move to justify its soldier deployment” ahead of the party congress, said Hong Min, an analyst at the Korea Institute for National Unification.
“It visualises the state providing concrete compensation to the families of fallen soldiers ... as a symbolic showcase,” he said.

India kicks off AI Impact Summit amid rising safety concerns
February 16, 2026New Delhi is set to host a five-day global artificial intelligence summit starting Monday to discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with the technology, amid rising concerns of job security and child safety.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is hosting the summit that kicks off on Monday afternoon.
The annual summit will be the fourth of its kind, with previous meetings being held in France, South Korea and the UK. This is the first time it is being hosted by a developing country.
India has quickly climbed the ranks of AI competitiveness as calculated by Stanford University researchers, landing in the third place last year behind the US and China.
France's Macron and OpenAI's Altman to attend
The India AI Impact Summit 2026 is expected to host over 250,000 visitors with 20 national leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, and 45 ministerial-level delegations planning to attend.
The guest list also includes tech CEOs Sam Altman of OpenAI and Google's Sundar Pichai.
"The summit will shape a shared vision for AI that truly serves the many, not just the few," India's IT Ministry has said.
Modi took to X on Monday ahead of the summit to say: "The AI Impact Summit will enrich global discourse on diverse aspects of AI, such as innovation, collaboration, responsible use and more."
"From digital public infrastructure to a vibrant StartUp ecosystem and cutting-edge research, our strides in AI reflect both ambition and responsibility," he added.
Focus on AI risks at Delhi summit
The meeting in New Delhi comes amid growing safety concerns over AI-generated misinformation, disinformation and deepfakes.
Just last month, Elon Musk's AI tool Grok saw global backlash over generation of sexualized images of real people using simple text prompts. Most of the images generated were of women, some of children.
In November, India released AI Governance Guidelines with core principles of "trust," "safety," "equity" and "innovation over restraint."
However, in January, the government tightened AI rules for social media platforms, which are now required to clearly label what the government calls "synthetically generated information."
This week's summit is being held under the slogan of "people, progress, planet," but some critics are skeptical of what can be achieved.
Industry commitments made at previous events "have largely been narrow 'self regulatory' frameworks that position AI companies to continue to grade their own homework," said Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute.
Kak, who is attending the summit, said he doubts if the leaders would take any meaningful steps to hold AI giants accountable.

Social media searches at the border and English language push: Ley’s leaked migration plan

‘I never agreed’: Top Liberals baulk at Ley’s hardline migration policy
Updated ,first published
A hardline Liberal immigration policy leaked on Monday was supposed to show how former opposition leader Sussan Ley planned to get tougher on migration before she was dumped. It has since been repudiated by the two frontbenchers who were alleged to have authored it.
The party’s immigration spokesman, Paul Scarr, on Monday afternoon said he never agreed to a proposal to ban migrants from terror hotspots in up to 13 countries, which was revealed to be a key element of the policy document with his name on it.
Another central player, home affairs spokesman Jonno Duniam, said the group of MPs working on the policy had not met since December, and the leadership group never signed off on the leaked proposal. “Frankly these were not part of any policy work I was a part of,” he said.
The seven-point policy document was made public three days after Ley was toppled by Angus Taylor, who came in promising to stop “bad migration” to Australia as he seeks to stop voters switching to One Nation. Sources close to Ley said she would have revealed the plan on Monday had she not been rolled by Taylor last week.
Liberal MPs speculated that Ley’s allies had released the document to demonstrate she would have taken a tough position on migration, having been voted out in part over that policy issue. Yet, it also revealed a siloed and muddled policy process under Ley that was first highlighted in last year’s damaging Coalition net zero debate.
The fact Ley was prepared to override Scarr – a moderate she appointed to the immigration portfolio to rebuild the Liberals’ standing in diaspora communities – is another sign of how the former Liberal leader was being pulled to the right on key policies.
Scarr disputed the “so-called leaked Liberal Party policy proposal with respect to banning migration from certain declared regions”.
“I never proposed any such policy. I never agreed to any such policy. I never signed or approved a shadow cabinet submission containing any such policy. I have a range of serious concerns with respect to any such policy,” he said in a statement.
Taken together with the statement from Duniam, an influential right-winger, the pair’s moves to distance themselves from the plan suggest Ley’s office was taking its own initiative to reveal a hardline immigration stance.
Some sources close to Ley said the pair had been briefed on the policies as recently as late January and were familiar with the underlying principles and many of the specifics, accusing Duniam in particular of selective memory. They acknowledge neither Scarr nor Duniam gave final approval. One source close to Ley said Duniam as home affairs spokesman was either absent from the work of policy drafting or was misleading the public.
Ley fast-tracked the migration policy late last year. It was delayed and updated after December’s Bondi massacre.
In addition to the ban on migration from declared terror zones, the policy drafted by the former opposition leader’s office proposed powers to screen phone communications at the border, tougher English language requirements, lower overall migrant numbers and extended bans on foreign home ownership.
The leaked proposals will complicate Taylor’s next steps, as the blueprint has the fingerprints of an old leadership team he has suggested was too soft on migration.
Taylor made shutting the door to “bad migration” a central part of his message as he introduced himself to voters last Friday.
“We shouldn’t discriminate based on race or religion, but we should [discriminate] based on values,” he said at the Centre for Independent Studies on Monday.
“We clearly don’t want to let radical terrorists, Islamist extremists, into the country. I mean that is clear. I think that’s a very widely held view across the Australian community, including the Muslim community.”
Liberal senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price was one of many Liberals out talking about tougher migration laws after Taylor’s leadership victory. While Ley had sent Price to the backbench in part for suggesting Indians were getting visas because they would vote Labor, Price insisted on Sunday she had nothing to apologise for.
Taylor’s next test will be over a stronger policy direction that can stop Liberal voters turning to One Nation without turning others off. On Friday, Pauline Hanson called on Taylor to reveal which countries he would target.
“No one will ever be as strong as One Nation on immigration,” she said.
Labor MP Jerome Laxale said on Sky News that the Coalition was ramping up anti-immigrant rhetoric, pointing out that Australia had welcomed many new migrants from the Philippines.
“What we’re seeing from the Liberal Party is a hardening of rhetoric, mimicking One Nation. For a community like mine, that presents risks, because out on the streets it can embolden prejudice towards people who may look different from those expressing it. That’s a very dangerous place to go,” he said.
The key elements of Ley’s leaked plan
A key tenet of Ley’s seven-part plan was an $80 million taskforce called Operation Gatekeeper, which would be led by a senior intelligence officer and include ASIO, AFP and Border Force.
The body would toughen up screening at the border, including by looking at people’s phones, similar to the controversial US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. According to two sources familiar with the plan, it would also operate in the community to enforce Labor’s new laws on hate crimes and terror symbols.
In drafting the policy, the policy architects thought they risked being perceived as advocating for a body similar to Donald Trump’s ICE agency, whose militarised approach to policing immigration has made it unpopular in the US and led to several deaths of American citizens.
The policy would also deny visas to people from overseas regions controlled by Islamist terrorist groups. These could span up to 37 regions within the nations of Afghanistan, Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Palestine, Philippines, Somalia and Yemen.
The policy would also bolster the power of the Australian values statement that new visa applicants are already required to sign, by making it a condition of keeping a visa.
This would lower the threshold for deporting people because anyone found to breach the principles, which include respecting freedom of religion, equal opportunity and a “fair go”, could have their visa cancelled.
Permanent visa applicants would have to agree to make reasonable efforts to learn English.
The policy sought to fix loopholes in the legal review system that have allowed more than 100,000 people with failed asylum claims to stay in the country. This involved calling on Labor to speed up processing of reviews, something the government is working on for student visas, while committing to make sure people denied visas are deported.
The current ban on foreign ownership of existing homes would be extended for two years, to 2029, while temporary residents would be banned from buying new homes.
The Liberals would also reduce international student numbers further than Labor, make city universities build housing and crack down on dodgy providers – all things the government is working on.
Finally, the Liberals planned to limit net overseas migration to 175,000, pausing visa processing until housing supply and public services caught up. Net migration in the 2024-25 financial year was 306,000.

'Train Dreams' and 'Adolescence' win top prizes at Indie Spirit Awards

Clint Bentley's lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation Train Dreams won the top film award at the Film Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday, February 15, in Los Angeles, while Adolescence dominated the television categories. Both were released on Netflix.
Bentley also won best director for the film starring Joel Edgerton, whom he thanked profusely for "being the heartbeat of our film." "We're so grateful to Netflix," Bentley said. "It's very, very hard these days to film in the United States, but it's worth it and we're proud to be able to pull it off."
Edgerton missed out on the top acting prize, however, which went to Rose Byrne for If I Had Legs I’d Kick You. The organization switched to gender-neutral acting categories in 2022.
Byrne was one of the few actors nominated for both a Spirit Award and an Oscar, for her performance as a mother on the edge. "I share this with Mary Bronstein, my writer-director who fought for eight years to get this movie made," Byrne said. She added that this was a film that could have only been made independently. Her character, she said, is "fierce and ferocious and a middle-aged woman."
Adolescence won new scripted series, best actor for Stephen Graham, best supporting actor for Erin Doherty and the breakthrough prize for Owen Cooper.
Gathering momentum ahead of the Academy Awards
The Secret Agent won the international feature prize. The film is also nominated for best picture and best international film at the Oscars. "I really believe that programming films in the cinemas is more and more a political act," said director Kleber Mendonça Filho. He dedicated the award to the late actor Udo Kier, who was part of the ensemble of The Secret Agent.
Both Train Dreams and The Secret Agent gathered momentum ahead of the Academy Awards.
The Perfect Neighbor, about a deadly shooting incident in Florida constructed primarily from police bodycam footage, won best documentary. Filmmaker and producer Geeta Gandbhir thanked Netflix for "giving us a global platform." It’s also up for the best documentary Oscar.
The awards sometimes overlap significantly with major Oscar contenders and winners, as it did with Anora and Everything Everywhere All At Once. Organizers limit eligibility to productions with budgets less than $30 million, meaning more expensive films like One Battle After Another are not in the running.

Hongkonger denied refund despite HK$170,000 hair transplant ‘falling out’ in a year
Consumer Council warns against exaggerated claims of effectiveness after surge in complaints over scalp inflammation, artificial hair detachment and poor results
A man who paid HK$170,000 (US$22,000) for a hair transplant has complained that “nearly all” of the initial 1,000 artificial strands fell out within a year – far earlier than the company’s claim that the results would last more than six years, Hong Kong’s consumer watchdog has revealed.
The Consumer Council on Monday warned against exaggerated claims of effectiveness after continuously receiving complaints about scalp inflammation, artificial hair detachment and unsatisfactory results.
Complaints related to hair transplant, hair growth, and hair and scalp care services reached 33, 19 and 13, respectively, between 2023 and 2025.
In one case, a man paid HK$170,000 to a company for a treatment involving the implantation of 2,000 artificial hair strands, with the parlour claiming the results could last around six to eight years.
However, after the second treatment session, the complainant developed inflammation, and the area turned red and sore. He later found that nearly all of the 1,000 artificial hair strands implanted in the initial stages of the procedure had fallen out within a year.
Although staff confirmed the inflammation, the parlour only offered scalp care services eight months later and rejected the man’s refund request. It argued that he had been instructed to properly cleanse the implanted hair and had failed to use the free scalp care services, which worsened his condition.

PYONGYANG, February 16. /TASS/. The construction of Saebyul Street ("New Star") in honor of the heroes who fought in the operation to liberate the Kursk Region from Ukrainian fighters has been completed in Pyongyang, the Korean Central News Agency reported.
A group of monuments has been erected on Saebyul Street "to embody the entire nation's determination to eternally pass on the shining, star-like feats of the heroes of the overseas military operation who gave their lives without hesitation for the immortal honor and eternal prosperity of their homeland," the article emphasized. Kim Jong Un previously ordered the construction of a new street for the families of fallen soldiers and supervised the process from start to finish. He attended the unveiling ceremony with the country’s top and senior officials.
In his speech, the North Korean leader noted that "the completion of the Saebyul street, which has found its place in the hearts of citizens as a symbol of the brilliant lives of soldiers, is an exciting moment that inscribes the most heroic era in the history of Pyongyang, embodying the strength, greatness, dignity, and honor of Korea."
Kim Jong Un emphasized that Saebyul Street has become a source of pride for the entire country, not just Pyongyang. He cut the red ribbon symbolizing the completion of construction, then handed over housing orders to the families of fallen soldiers and spoke with them. This was followed by a concert.
On February 10, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov expressed Moscow's deep gratitude to North Korea for helping liberate the Kursk Region from Ukrainian militants. He added that the combat brotherhood between Moscow and Pyongyang will be embodied in mutually beneficial cooperation projects for the benefit of both countries' peoples.

Hot Chili stacks shallow high-grade copper hits in Chile
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Hot Chili is turning up the heat at its La Verde copper-gold discovery in Chile, delivering another remarkable batch of shallow high-grade results that continue to firm up the case for a potential higher-grade starter pit within its flagship Costa Fuego development.
Fresh assays from two diamond tail extension holes have reinforced the emergence of a broad, near-surface zone of stronger copper-gold mineralisation stretching across a 400m by 400m footprint. Crucially, the new results sit immediately beneath shallow gravel cover, suggesting that future overburden removal could be simple and cost-effective.
In one extension hole, a massive intercept of 150m came back with 0.52 per cent copper equivalent, comprising 0.37 per cent copper and 0.21 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from just 30m depth, including 38m grading 0.70 per cent copper equivalent from 117m.
The second hole returned a hefty 220m running 0.47 per cent copper equivalent from 38m depth, including a solid 68m scoring 0.64 per cent copper equivalent from 187m.
These hits stack neatly above a previously reported hole, which coughed up 148m grading 0.82 per cent copper equivalent from 70m depth, reinforcing a growing, coherent high-grade zone that could materially enhance early mine scheduling.
La Verde sits just 30km south of Hot Chili’s planned central processing hub for Costa Fuego in Chile’s coastal Atacama region, home to some of the world’s giant porphyry deposits. The discovery is increasingly shaping as a potential sweetener to the company’s broader development plans, with management flagging that a higher-grade starter pit could significantly reduce payback and improve the key financial metrics posted in a March 2025 pre-feasibility study.
But the shallow story looks set to be only part of the picture.
Deeper drilling is now punching into what appears to be an expanding high-grade core. One of the latest drill holes lit up with plentiful visual copper porphyry-style mineralisation over a width of around 150m between 580m and 730m depth. Geologists have logged the copper sulphide mineral, chalcopyrite, at an average abundance of greater than 1 per cent, with several zones exceeding 3 per cent across the interval. And with 34.5 per cent copper in chalcopyrite, this equates to potential grades worthy of attention.
While assays for this hole are not expected until April, the visual sulphide intensity suggests La Verde’s core may be thickening at depth - a classic porphyry signature that can often underpin scale.
Additional diamond tail extensions are also expanding the system laterally and have pushed the more than 0.4 per cent copper mineralised footprint further east, broadening the overall envelope.
With the raft of new results now starting to deliver, the company is wasting no time accelerating its phase two program, with double-shift diamond drilling underway and a second reverse circulation rig expected to kick off shortly.
Costa Fuego is widely regarded as one of the world’s premier undeveloped copper plays, hosting a colossal 798-million-tonne resource grading 0.45 per cent copper equivalent. The monster inventory packs in 2.9Mt of copper, 2.6 million ounces of gold, 12.9 million ounces of silver and 68,000t of molybdenum.
Metallurgical test work using seawater, consistent with the broader Costa Fuego environmental and economic strategies, has indicated recoveries similar to those achieved at Cortadera, supporting the view that La Verde mineralisation should integrate cleanly into the existing development plan.
Conceptual open pit shells at copper prices of US$3.50/lb and US$6.00/lb have further illustrated the potential scale, although the company stresses that these represent exploration targets rather than defined resources.
As copper prices continue to accelerate due to AI and electrification and gold trades near record highs, La Verde is rapidly emerging as more than just a satellite discovery.
If ongoing drilling continues to grow the shallow, high-grade footprint while thickening the deeper core, Hot Chili may be cooking up a serious addition to the Costa Fuego copper-gold story.

Patriot uncorks 31M ounce Peruvian silver-equivalent resource
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Patriot Resources has uncorked a mighty maiden mineral resource of 31.39 million ounces of silver-equivalent from its polymetallic Tassa silver-gold project in Southern Peru.
The company’s inferred maiden resource estimate clocked in at 18.53 million tonnes at 52.68 grams per tonne (g/t) for the 31.39 million-ounce silver-equivalent booty, with the silver-only component comprising an impressive 25.5 million-ounces at 42.73g/t.
The silver-dominant polymetallic resource comprises silver, gold, copper, zinc and lead. Gold plays second fiddle in the resource, but still contributes a healthy 40,000 ounces at a grade of 0.06g/t.
Patriot says the resource confirms a large-scale epithermal system that extends from surface and, significantly, the mineralisation remains open in all directions. Notably, the resource is slated for extraction using open-pit mining methods, allowing large-scale machinery to operate more efficiently and at a lower cost than underground mining.
‘Delivery of a maiden inferred mineral resource of 31.4 million-ounces silver-equivalent marks a transformational milestone for Patriot.’Patriot Resources executive chairman Hugh Warner
The company is now preparing to ratchet up exploration at the project, with step-out and infill drilling planned to both beef up the resource and upgrade its classification to a higher category.
Management says the Tassa resource was picked up at an equivalent cost of about US$0.04 per silver-equivalent ounce, an impressive result given today’s silver price of US$77.40 per ounce.
Patriot Resources executive chairman Hugh Warner said: “The delivery of a maiden JORC (2012) inferred mineral resource of 31.4 million-ounces silver-equivalent marks a transformational milestone for Patriot and underscores the exceptional value of the Tassa project.”
Warner said the resource represents a portion of a much larger mineralised system that remains open in all directions, with multiple drillholes ending in mineralisation.
The maiden resource, using a 25g/t silver-equivalent cut-off, drew on data from 26 diamond drillholes totalling 8474.5 metres and defines multiple structurally controlled zones that remain open along strike and at depth.
A total of 12 zones have defined mineral resources, with the C1 zone accounting for the bulk, consisting of 8.26 million tonnes grading 55.73g/t silver-equivalent and containing 14.79 million ounces silver-equivalent.
Previous stellar drill intersections at the project include 60m at 224.2g/t silver from 24m depth, including 16m going 383.9g/t silver, a 37m stretch grading 113.5g/t silver from 154m, including 8.7m at 321g/t and a noteworthy gold hit of 81.9m returning 0.41g/t, with a 24m section going 0.8g/t gold from 332m.
Several significant drill intervals ending in mineralisation consisted of a 26m run grading 25.38g/t silver (32.02g/t silver-equivalent) from 226m to end of hole and a 5.6m slice at 49.5g/t silver (56.57g/t silver-equivalent) from 147m to end of hole, illustrating the potential to increase the size of the resource dramatically.
The project’s initial resource comprises only a portion of the broader system defined by geophysics, surface geochemistry and drilling, with historic modelling completed by leading Canadian resource firm, the US$28.7 billion market-capped Teck Resources.
Teck’s modelling outlined a larger conceptual mineralised envelope extending beyond the resource models’ coverage.
Geminas Advisory, the firm that completed the resource number-crunching, has estimated an initial exploration target of 29 million tonnes to 46 million tonnes grading between 43g/t and 59g/t silver-equivalent, for a total of 40 million ounces to 87 million ounces silver-equivalent. The strike length of the exploration target is about 2.8 kilometres.
The company now plans to progress drill permitting and obtain the relevant approvals, complete bulk density tests and undertake further detailed structural logging and modelling.
While Peru is the company’s current focus for its precious metals ambitions, it has locked and loaded a second project into its metals arsenal.
Patriot has its sights on the promising Zambian Mumbwa copper district, holding a complementary base metals project, to load up a one-two punch combination to knock out a commercially economic holding of critical and precious metals.
The Kitumba project lies within the Katanga Supergroup of the Central African Copperbelt, a renowned geological hotspot for major base and precious metal deposits. The project is within a sling shot of Sinomine’s Kitumba operation, which is set to fire up its new plant and smelter later this year.
The company says its Zambian footprint is significant, making it one of the largest landholders in the Mumbwa district.
With twin demands from the continued growth in the AI phenomenon and the acceleration of renewable energy, silver and copper are tipped to be two of the biggest winners, which might just propel Patriot to a much bigger player in the metals space with continued exploration success.

Israel's West Bank 'state property' move is legally void: Palestine
Unknown

03:10:41 UTC
12:10:41 KST

The Israeli government's approval of a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” is legally null and void, the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said on Sunday, warning that the move aims to advance annexation and settlement expansion.
In a statement on X, the ministry condemned the decision “in the strongest terms”.
It also rejected any attempt to transform the lands of the occupied West Bank into state property under the authority of the occupation along with all the consequences that entail attempts to “legitimise the crime of settlement and annexation, and to create pathways that facilitate the seizure, occupation and theft of Palestinian lands and the expansion of illegal settlements”.
It stressed that the measure also constitutes a practical beginning of the annexation process and the undermining of the foundations of the Palestinian state.
The move constitutes a direct challenge to the international legal order and the will of the international community, amounting to a flagrant violation of international peace and security principles, it added.
The ministry said the decision is in “clear contradiction with United Nations resolutions, foremost among them UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which affirmed the illegality of settlements in all of the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem”.
It also cited the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which found Israel’s occupation unlawful.
“The Ministry calls on the international community, the Security Council, and all legal and international bodies to stand firmly against these accelerating unilateral illegal measures,” the statement said.
It also called for urgent action to deter the occupation and halt annexation and settlement policies that “threaten the two-state solution, the international consensus, and undermine security and stability in the region”.
Earlier on Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast swathes of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A of the West Bank is under full Palestinian control and Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61 percent of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B while prohibiting it in Area C.
The latest move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified assaults in the occupied West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, since launching its military offensive in Gaza on October 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation — including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion — as a step towards formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Kallas says Russia is no superpower
EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Kaja Kallas said this during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference on Sunday, Ukrinform reports.
"But let's be clear-eyed about Russia. Russia is no superpower. After more than a decade of conflict, including 4 years of full-scale war in Ukraine, Russia has barely advanced beyond the 2014 lines. The cost? 1.2 million casualties. Today, Russia is broken, its economy in shreds, it is disconnected from the European energy markets, and its own citizens are fleeing," Kallas said.
In her opinion, the greatest threat Russia poses at present is that "it gains more at the negotiation table than it has achieved on the battlefield."
Commenting on potential peace talks on Ukraine, Kallas said that more important than having a seat at the negotiating table is knowing what demands to make.
"Russia's maximalist demands cannot be met with a minimalist response," she said.
In this context, she stressed that if Ukraine's military is to be limited in size, then Russia's should be too. Russia must pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine, there should be no amnesty for war crimes, and Ukrainian children must be returned home, Kallas said.
"This is really the very least Russia should agree to if peace is Russia's goal," she said.
At the same time, she stressed that Europe does not currently see this as Russia’s position.
Kallas also said that EU enlargement has become "the antidote to Russian imperialism."
"Since 1990, states that freed themselves from Soviet domination and joined the EU, have grown more than twice as fast as Russia. In 1990, Russians were twice as rich as Poles. Today, Poles are roughly 70% richer than Russians," she said.
"Today, enlargement is a geopolitical choice and we must say yes," Kallas said.

German and UK military chiefs state case for rearming

German and UK military chiefs state case for rearming
February 16, 2026The defence chief of Germany's Bundeswehr, General Carsten Breuer, and the United Kingdom's chief of the defence staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton, have jointly stated the case for rearming, amid the threat posed by Russia.
The top military officials penned a joint letter, published in The Guardian and German newspaper Welt, in which they said there was a "moral" case to be made for rearming.
What the German and UK military leaders said
Breuer and Knighton said that they were speaking "not merely as the military leaders of two of Europe's largest military spenders, but as voices for a Europe that must now confront uncomfortable truths about its security."
The pair said that Russia's military posture had "shifted decisively westward" and that it was rearming and learning lessons from its invasion of Ukraine while "reorganising in ways that could heighten the risk of conflict with Nato countries."
The military leaders said Russia's military buildup "combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention."
Russia 'may be emboldened' by any perception of a weak Europe
The leaders warned that should Russia perceive weakness or disunity within Europe "it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine."
To this end, the letter stated that "Military readiness must mean a strong defence industry" with the pair highlighting the munitions factories being built in the UK and the stationing of a German combat brigade on NATO's eastern flank, while also mentioning Berlin's efforts to make "essentially unrestricted funding available for defence."
The German government is spending considerably more on defense as it seeks to modernise and strengthen the Bundeswehr — which has seen decades of cutbacks.
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 triggered an about-turn in Germany's security policy that had previously been premised on military restraint.
'Rearmament is not warmongering' defense chiefs say
Their letter added: "There is a moral dimension to this endeavour. Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace. Strength deters aggression. Weakness invites it."
Breuer and Knighton concluded by saying that "a whole-of-society" approach was necessary and that defense could not be shouldered by those in uniform alone.
"Whole-of-society defence requires resilient infrastructure, research and development in hi-tech from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats," the military chiefs said.
"When Europe acts together, we are a formidable force. And we act together, we are not Great Britain and Germany alone."
The military chiefs' warning follows the conclusion of the annual Munich Security Conference, which saw world leaders meet to discuss Europe's defence and the war in Ukraine.

Police ask UK government to hold back key Mandelson email exchange about Epstein

LONDON — Police have asked the U.K. government to hold back from publishing a key exchange in which Downing Street asked Peter Mandelson about his links to Jeffrey Epstein, two people familiar with the discussions told POLITICO.
No. 10’s then-chief of staff Morgan McSweeney emailed Mandelson asking three questions about his ties to the convicted sex offender, before Mandelson was appointed as Britain’s ambassador to the U.S. in December 2024.
The emails on behalf of Prime Minister Keir Starmer were first reported by the BBC last September and included why Mandelson continued contact with Epstein after the sex offender’s 2008 conviction, as well as why he was reported to have stayed in one of Epstein’s homes while the financier was in prison.

No Anzac Day holiday on following Monday for Queensland

No Anzac Day holiday on following Monday for Queensland
Queensland will not mark Anzac Day with a weekday public holiday, with Premier David Crisafulli ruling commemorations will remain on the Saturday of April 25.
The national day of military remembrance falls on a Saturday this year, prompting several states and territories, including NSW, Western Australia and the ACT, to move the official public holiday to the following Monday.
On Sunday, Crisafulli confirmed his government’s decision not to follow suit.
“I do believe that it’s really important that people do keep that day as being sacrosanct … It’s about making sure that we honour those servicemen and women, and that is a really special day for the nation, and I think it’s important that we do it on that day.”
Greens MP Michael Berkman, who posed the question of moving the observed public holiday during question time in parliament last week, said the government didn’t “have a good reason” for the state having one fewer public holidays this year.
“Queensland already moves the Anzac Day public holiday when the 25th falls on a Sunday. If [NSW] can do it, why can’t we?” Berkman told this masthead.
“Nobody is suggesting we move Anzac Day or associated services from the 25th, we’re just saying Monday should be a public holiday.
“Queenslanders are working harder than ever. They deserve a break from work and an opportunity to commemorate Anzac Day.”
In Queensland, if a public holiday falls on a Sunday it is observed on the following Monday. That rule does not apply to most public holidays falling on Saturdays.
Information on the state government website, however, states that if the Australia Day public holiday were to fall on a Saturday or Sunday it would be observed the following Monday.
RSL Queensland released a statement supporting the premier’s decision on Monday, saying the day was “more than a public holiday”.
“A public holiday day in lieu on the Monday is not an agenda RSL Queensland is promoting, our focus is, and always will be, on honouring the service and sacrifice of all who served and the enduring legacy of the ANZAC spirit,” RSL Queensland State President Major General Stephen Day DSC AM said.
Queenslanders interviewed by this masthead were torn whether this was the right decision for the state.
“You’ve got the Saturday to march, you’ve got Sunday to reflect, do you really need Monday? There’s for and against in it all, and I’d hate to think that people only look at it as a free day,” Ray Donovan said.
Sandstone Point retiree Brian Boyd didn’t think it was necessary to have more public holidays, saying there were “more than enough” on the calendar.
Local James Warhurst thought all states and territories should take a united stance, and he didn’t think an additional holiday would detract from the date’s importance.
“We should all be united together over Anzac Day, not divide the country … either we do or we don’t. But I think we should have Monday off.”
There were 10 public holidays, including Ekka holiday, on this year’s calendar.

Walid Saadaoui had once worked as a holiday entertainer, organising dance shows and quizzes at a resort in his native Tunisia. After moving to the UK and marrying a British woman, he became a restaurateur and an avid keeper of birds.
All the while, however – as the Guardian’s community affairs correspondent, Chris Osuh, explains – he was hiding a secret: he had pledged allegiance to Islamic State.
On Friday, Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, were sentenced to life imprisonment after attempting to carry out what could have been one of the deadliest terror attacks in the UK. They had planned a devastating assault on Greater Manchester’s Jewish community. Unbeknown to them, the fellow IS supporter involved in their plot – known by the codename ‘Farouk’ – was in fact an undercover police officer.
Saadaoui’s younger brother, Bilel Saadaoui, was jailed for six years for failing to disclose information about the plan.
Osuh, who has been covering the trial, speaks to Helen Pidd about how the plot was uncovered and the impact it has had on one of the largest Jewish communities in the world.

Right-wing Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is passing new hard-line policing measures to style herself as Italy’s guardian of law and order, but her opponents fear her security decrees are intended to prevent critics — particularly on the left — from legitimately protesting.
Her decree of Feb. 5, which greatly increases police powers, followed on the heels of violent street protests in Turin over the closure of the radical left-wing Askatasuna community center.
Leaving no doubt about how the government views the danger from such clashes, Justice Minister Carlo Nordio said the goal was to prevent “the return of the Red Brigades,” referring to the left-wing terror group active in the 1970s and 1980s.

Accused Bondi Beach gunman Naveed Akram fronts court for first time
Unknown

11:45:46 KST

Accused Bondi terror attack gunman Naveed Akram has made his first remarks in court as his lawyer tempered expectations of swift pleas to dozens of serious charges.
The 24-year-old appeared in Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court via videolink on Monday morning on 59 charges, including murder and terrorism offences.
He is accused of carrying out Australia's deadliest terror attack on 14 December, when 15 people were killed and 40 injured during beachside Hanukkah celebrations at Bondi.
His father, 50-year-old Sajid Akram, was shot dead by police during the shooting.
The younger man spoke after a magistrate on Monday continued suppression orders protecting those victims and survivors of the attack who haven't chosen to identify themselves publicly.
"Did you just hear what I just said?" deputy chief magistrate Sharon Freund asked the accused man.
"Yeah," Akram replied.
Legal Aid solicitor Ben Archbold later asked for time to speak with his client.
"Mr Akram, your solicitor is going to give you a call after," the magistrate said.
"Yep," the accused gunman replied.
Akram was dressed in a green prison-issued jumper, with his hands in his lap as he listened to the otherwise uneventful case mention.
His hair was freshly shaven, while he continued to sport the full-faced short beard he had during the 14 December mass shooting.
Following a call with his client, Archbold told reporters outside court Akram was doing as well as could be expected in Goulburn super-maximum-security prison.
"Everyone knows that [Goulburn's] supermax has very onerous conditions, and that's where people who (allegedly) commit these crimes are," he said.
It was too early to indicate any intention of pleas, Archbold said.
Client-lawyer discussions on Monday and earlier at the prison hadn't addressed the attack or any remorse, while prosecutors were yet to serve the brief of evidence.
Archbold, expecting to see the brief by the next court mention on 8 April, noted the court process could run into 2027.
"When we have the brief, I'll have more to say," he told reporters.
"He's just a client — and is a client that needs to be represented.
"We don't let our personal views get in the way of our professional obligations."
The Bondi Beach attack
The Akrams are accused of carrying out Australia's worst mass shooting since 1996 by targeting the Jewish festival of lights at Bondi Beach.
After parking near a footbridge on Campbell Parade, the men allegedly tossed three pipe bombs filled with steel ball bearings and a tennis ball bomb into the Hanukkah celebration at Archer Park before opening fire.
But none of the pipe bombs detonated, despite preliminary police analysis finding they were viable.
A box-like bomb was found in the boot of their car while two hand-painted ISIS flags were also in the vehicle.
Police allege 55 people were shot during the attack, including 15 fatally, including 10-year-old Matilda, Holocaust survivors and a retired police officer.
A court suppression order allows victim-survivors to choose if and when they go public with their story and join other survivors, such as Arsen Ostrovsky and hero tobacconist Ahmed Al Ahmed, who briefly disarmed Akram's father.
The attack triggered an outpouring of grief and a suite of legal changes addressing gun ownership and extremism as well as throwing a spotlight on rising antisemitism in Australia.
Israeli President Issac Herzog also held a controversial four-day Australian visit in early February to meet and grieve with the local Jewish community.

TMK Energy edges closer to gas flow milestone in Mongolia
Brought to you by Bulls N’ Bears
TMK Energy has successfully navigated another milestone at its wholly owned Gurvantes XXXV coal seam gas (CSG) pilot well project in Mongolia.
The company’s latest pressure build-up tests at its Lucky Fox one and four wells, which were shut in for 14 and 8 days, respectively, have confirmed the reservoir pressure has continued to improve since earlier readings in November.
The latest numbers show that the upper coal seam water pressure is steadily declining towards the all-important critical desorption level required for gas to flow freely. Once enough water is pumped out, methane separates from the coal matrix, flipping the wells from water-dominated to gas-dominated outflow.
The transition represents a make-or-break stage for meaningful CSG production.
‘A formal partnering process commencing after Chinese New Year provides a clear pathway forward for the Company.’TMK Energy Chief Executive Officer Mr Dougal Ferguson
Notably, the observed pressure trends have lined up neatly with TMK’s updated reservoir simulation model, confirming the upper coal seam reservoir pilot project remains firmly on target to hit the targeted desorption pressure.
TMK Energy Chief Executive Officer Mr Dougal Ferguson said: “This is yet another key data point which demonstrates that the coals within our project area are being depressurised and that measurable progress is being made, which will ultimately deliver much higher gas rates once the desorption pressure is reached. A large body of technical work is nearing completion that clearly demonstrates how we see the development plan unfolding.”
Adding further support to its progress, the company says this trend is almost a mirror image of other nearby wells, suggesting not only a quicker arrival at desorption but also that potential gas volumes are already sufficient to support a 2-5 megawatt power generation project this year.
The new data indicate TMK has made steady progress in de-risking the play as the company continues to drive its pilot program forward.
With results marking a solid step for TMK on its critical desorption journey and pressure trends closely tracking expectations from the company’s model, TMK appears poised to keep its momentum alive in Mongolia’s emerging CSG scene.

Waitress ‘put up hell of a fight’ against co-worker accused of attempted murder
A young waitress “put up a hell of a fight” against a co-worker accused of stalking her, who allegedly chased her around a restaurant attacking her with a carving knife, according to her sister.
Cameron William Leslie Clark, a 33-year-old who had been employed as a kitchen hand at the Easts Rugby League Club in Brisbane, has been charged with attempted murder, stalking and wounding.
Clark had been allegedly giving “unwanted and unsolicited attention” to his co-worker Zoe Samson-Wood, which led to him being sacked, Detective Superintendent Andrew Massingham said.
Clark returned to the club in Coorparoo hours later, allegedly concealing a large blade.
Samson-Wood was cut down to the skull and suffered nerve damage requiring reconstructive surgery during the alleged attack, her sister said.
She thanked those who came to her sister’s aid. “Even if it gave Zoe an extra millisecond to get away, you saved her life.”
During the alleged attack, Clark pulled out the knife and “repeatedly stabbed and slashed” at Samson-Wood in a hallway that led to the main service area, police said.
A 61-year-old male chef stepped in and Samson-Wood escaped momentarily to the dining room.
“She was then set upon for a second time,” Massingham said.
Police arrived in minutes, where they found Clark being restrained by staff and a club patron.
Samson-Wood suffered serious cuts to her arm and head, as well a series of defensive wounds, Massingham said.
“It will be alleged the offender went there with a clear intent, and we are just so thankful that that intent was not fully realised.”
The 61-year-old was taken to hospital with a stab wound to the abdomen.
The detective said as many as eight people stepped in to hold Clark down and another woman was also injured.
Clark, who lives in Woolloongabba, remained in hospital on Monday and was awaiting surgery on his hand.
He was also charged with acts intended to cause grievous bodily harm and wounding in relation to two other alleged victims.
The matter was mentioned in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday, where it was adjourned until Friday.

Coles accused of 'planned' campaign to mislead Australians

ACCC accuses Coles of 'planned' campaign to mislead customers
In short:
There has been intense debate about the pricing of more than 200 products at the opening of the landmark ACCC vs Coles court case.
Lawyers representing the consumer watchdog have labelled Coles's price discounts "utterly misleading".
Coles has rejected the allegations as part of its opening remarks, which will continue tomorrow.
Supermarket giant Coles has been accused of a "planned" campaign to mislead customers over price discounts on the first day of a bombshell Federal Court case.
The consumer watchdog, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is suing the supermarket giant in a lawsuit that a former ACCC boss has called "the case of the century".
The opening arguments this morning looked at the prices Coles charged for 245 common household products under its famous "Down Down" promotions. The promotional program has been in place since 2010.
The ACCC's legal counsel, Garry Rich, claimed in his opening remarks Coles had jacked up its prices for a short period before discounting them to a price that was actually more than, or the same as, the regular price.
Mr Rich said Coles customers had been repeatedly deceived by the supermarket and the pricing was not "fair dinkum".
"Why on earth are you telling your customers the price is going down? They're not,"he said.
Evidence would show the conduct was "planned" and Coles had "disguised" price rises as price discounts, he said.
Internal compliance documents from Coles about the "Down Down" program showed there were key changes to policy guardrails on the discount program before the allegedly misleading conduct, he added.
Mr Rich alleged all but one of the promotions would have been prohibited under the earlier policy and the price changes had more to do with the commercial consideration of chasing Woolworths on pricing.
Dog food pricing 'utterly misleading'
There was also intense debate over the meaning of the price of dog food and what a reasonable shopper would have thought, with Justice Michael O'Bryan pushing back on important elements of the ACCC case.
For a period of almost 300 days between April 2022 and February 2023 Mr Rich told the court that Coles offered a 1.2 kilogram loaf of Nature's Gift Wet Dog Food for $4.
Then for seven days the price rose by 50 per cent to $6.
On the eighth day the price was set at $4.50 — 13 per cent more than customers had been paying for all but seven of the previous 303 days — with Coles labelling the product "Down, Down".
Mr Rich said while that statement was "literally true" it was also "utterly misleading".
"It did not disclose that a reasonable consumer would not have understood that Coles had increased the price to $6 for just 7 days, immediately before the promotion, and that for 296 days before that, the price was $4,"he said.
"By making the statement it did, without disclosing those crucial qualifying facts, Coles led reasonable consumers into error.
"It caused them to assume that the "Down, Down" price of $4.50 was a genuine reduction to, or discount from, the previous regular price of the product. That assumption was wrong.
"A reasonable consumer who knew the real facts would not think the price of the dog food has gone down, nor would they think that a price of $4.50 would be a genuine reduction or discount."
Justice O'Bryan pushed back and argued the first, or "regular" price, in the case of the dog food at $4 was "irrelevant".
He said circumstances had changed due to an increase in costs and it was not a reasonable comparison with the "Down, Down" price of $4.50.
Mr Rich did not agree.
"You can't tell that the second price is a short-term price unless you understand the history of the product," he said.
Coles rejects allegations
Coles was able to make a brief response in opening remarks this afternoon.
John Sheahan KC rejected the ACCC's allegations Coles ran a planned campaign to mislead consumers.
He said customers would have been aware they were shopping in an environment of "sudden materially increasing prices".
"Grocery shoppers at Coles are much more attuned to these things than anyone around these tables are likely to be," Mr Sheahan said.
He also said the court should take into account that "ordinary, reasonable consumers know they're in an inflationary environment".
"They know that that means the price of things is changing in an upward direction," he said.
"So when our learned friends says … Coles said prices were going down, in fact they were going up — it completely distorts the perspective with respect of an ordinary, reasonable consumer.
"In that context, what Coles is doing is perfectly natural."
The company will continue with its opening remarks tomorrow.
Coles has reported record profits and been accused of price gouging in recent years, however this case will not offer a verdict on that.
An ACCC report last year found that Australia had one of the most profitable supermarket sectors in the world.
Consumer group CHOICE welcomed the Federal Court action and said supermarket promotions had a "significant influence" on how people made purchasing decisions.
"During a cost-of-living crisis, retailers should be doing all they can to ensure clear, transparent pricing — not obscuring rising prices with confusing promotions," director of campaigns and communications Andy Kelly said.
"This court case is not only a wake up call for Coles, but for other retailers who may be engaging in similar practices."

Opposition was preparing widespread immigration bans under Sussan Ley's leadership

11:34:48 KST

Dumped Liberal leader Sussan Ley was poised to introduce a suite of hardline immigration policies, including widespread bans on immigration from more than a dozen countries considered havens for "Islamist terrorist ideologies".
The policy was formulated largely out of Ley's office in the wake of the Bondi terror attack and would have planned to stop immigration from the occupied Palestinian territories, Afghanistan, parts of the Philippines, parts of Lebanon and Somalia.
Other regions that would've been affected by the policy included Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Yemen.
The ban would have been in place for three years and was expected to get sign-off at a meeting of shadow cabinet on Monday if Ley had remained in the top job, according to a Liberal source familiar with the negotiations.
The policy would've also included an "Australian values" statement that new immigrants would need to adhere to. Immigrants found to be in breach of the statement would face immediate deportation.
The policy would also have seen a proposal to significantly reduce net overseas migration and cut international student visas.
Ley lost the Liberal leadership after nine months in the job last week, following a successful leadership spill by former Opposition defence spokesperson Angus Taylor. Jane Hume was elected as deputy leader.
Opposition immigration spokesperson has 'serious concerns' with policy
Liberal senator Paul Scarr — the Opposition's immigration spokesperson under Ley — said he had neither proposed nor agreed to such a policy.
"I refer to media reports of a so-called leaked Liberal Party policy proposal with respect to banning migration from certain declared regions," Scarr said in a statement on Monday afternoon.
"It is important that I provide the following information for the record. I never proposed any such policy. I never agreed to any such policy. I never signed or approved a shadow cabinet submission containing any such policy.
"I have a range of serious concerns with respect to any such policy," he said.
Angus Taylor prepares to announce immigration policy
Taylor's office told SBS News he hasn't seen the policy Ley had been preparing to announce.
Taylor has nominated immigration as one of his key policy priorities and has outlined plans to "shut the door" to people who "hate" Australia.
He confirmed plans to reduce immigration intake, but hasn't clarified whether this policy to implement widespread bans on certain countries and regions would be carried forward under his leadership.
"We'll respond to policies they announce. Angus Taylor seems to think he can run a debate on the vibe without making a decision," a government spokesperson told SBS News.
Taylor is expected to unveil a full policy "in the coming days", along with a new frontbench.

Power restored after 4-hour outage plunges 760 Hong Kong flats into darkness

Power restored after 4-hour outage plunges 760 Hong Kong flats into darkness
CLP says suspected equipment fault disrupted supply at Ha Kwai House in Kwai Chung Estate on Sunday evening, ahead of Lunar New Year’s Eve
Electricity has been restored after a four-hour outage at a residential high-rise in a Kwai Chung housing estate, caused by a suspected water leak that triggered a power trip ahead of Lunar New Year’s Eve.
The city’s biggest electricity company, CLP Power, said that at around 9.13pm on Sunday, a suspected equipment fault at Ha Kwai House in the Kwai Chung Estate disrupted supply to about 760 households.
The power trip lasted four hours and electricity was restored at 1.30am on Monday.
The Housing Department was “deeply concerned” about the power outage and dispatched staff to the scene immediately after learning of the situation, a government spokeswoman told the South China Morning Post.
“It is preliminarily believed that a short circuit in the building’s electrical machinery room was caused by water seepage from the pipes,” she said, adding that electrical and lift engineers were promptly sent to carry out emergency repairs.
She added that the department had contacted residents requiring special care and confirmed they were safe. One person who relied on a ventilator had moved to a relative’s flat nearby, accompanied by family members.

She was denied a legal abortion and sent to a maximum-security prison over an illegal one

She was denied a legal abortion and sent to a maximum-security prison over an illegal one
A young woman in Zambia was sent to a maximum-security prison after she was denied a legal abortion
- Bookmark
She says she was let down at every step. By a partner who abandoned her when she was pregnant. By a health service that denied her a legal abortion. And by a justice system that sent her to a maximum-security prison for illegally terminating her pregnancy on her own.
Violet Zulu, a house cleaner in Zambia earning $40 a month, was sentenced to seven years in prison in 2024 after representing herself in court with little understanding of the consequences of her actions. She didn't see her two children or other family members for nearly two years.
After word of her case reached international rights groups that helped her file an appeal, Zulu was freed last month. Activists say she represents many women in Africa who take desperate decisions when facing barriers to legal abortion services.
Her story has drawn little sympathy in her southern African nation, where parts of society view abortion harshly. Her own mother said she agreed with her daughter's prison sentence, but said it should have been shorter.
Zulu spoke with The Associated Press as she pieces her life together again at the age of 26.
She said she first attempted to access legal abortion services at a public clinic, which should have given her advice or services but turned her away. She then tried a private pharmacy, which requested 800 Zambian kwacha ($43) for abortion drugs, a month's salary for her.
She was already struggling to feed her two young sons, and she sometimes had to beg food from relatives.
She said her decision to drink an herbal concoction she prepared herself, one known for terminating pregnancies, was taken out of despair. She couldn't bear for her boys to have even less food if she had another child.
“I never wanted to abort my pregnancy, but it is the circumstances at home that forced me to do it," Zulu said in the interview at the two-room rented home with no running water that she shares with her children and parents.
“I was scared (when I took the concoction), but I didn’t really care what would happen to me," she added.
In her court testimony, she explained what happened next: She delivered the fetus in a toilet, placed it in a sack and dropped it in a nearby stream. She said she confided in a friend, but word got out and neighbors reported her to police.
Zulu, who left school in the eighth grade, was never offered free legal counsel despite the right to request it. She represented herself in court and pleaded guilty to the offense of procuring her own abortion. She said she didn’t understand the legality of abortion and thought she would receive a warning.
“This is a system that failed Violet,” said Rosemary Kirui, a legal adviser for Africa for the abortion rights group Center for Reproductive Rights, which campaigned for Zulu’s release and helped with her appeal. “It is not that she did not try. It is that she could not afford the services, yet she should be able to access them as a citizen of Zambia.”
Zulu should have been eligible for a free abortion under a provision that allows doctors in Zambia to consider risks to the well-being of her existing children, said Sharon Williams, country director for the Women and Law in Southern Africa advocacy group.
But Zulu was not aware of that, largely because of the secrecy, stigma and shame around abortion, which is not advertised by Zambia's public health system.
Zambia's health ministry did not respond to questions about her case.
Part of the problem, Williams said, is that Zambia has legalized abortion while also defining itself in its constitution as a strongly Christian country.
Abortions are still largely restricted in Africa, with few countries allowing them for reasons other than threats to the health of the mother or the fetus. Even in countries like Zambia, religious beliefs, conservative values rooted in local cultures or a lack of information make access to legal procedures difficult, according to health and rights groups.
Williams said Zulu’s case ought to lead to a national conversation over whether Zambian authorities should better educate communities over the legal right to abortion.
“I think now that we have this judgment, we’re ready for the conversation," she said.
Activists say desperate women turn to unsafe abortions. Africa and Latin America have the highest proportions of them, with approximately 75% of all abortions in Africa deemed unsafe, according to the World Health Organization.
The Guttmacher Institute health rights organization estimated in a 2019 report that over 6 million unsafe abortions a year occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. It noted that Zambia's abortion law “tended to be a ‘paper law’ rather than one that ensures widespread access.”
In South Africa, which claims to have the most progressive laws on the continent, abortion has been legal for nearly 30 years. It is allowed on request before 13 weeks of pregnancy and for several reasons before 21 weeks.
But studies estimate only 7% of public health facilities there offer abortion services.
In 2023, the case of a 14-year-old who was denied an abortion by South African health workers three times for reasons that were not valid prompted a national reality check. After an urgent court case, a judge ordered that the girl be allowed to have an abortion, which was performed on the last day eligible by law.
At the time, a representative of the social justice group that represented the girl said South Africa's abortion laws were being undermined by "the abuse of medical knowledge by health care professionals" in trying to prevent abortions.
In Zambia, Zulu said she still felt bad about what she did but must now provide for her sons. She was looking for work again, she said.

Police resume search for missing four-year-old boy Gus Lamont at outback property

The search for a missing four-year-old boy has resumed days after police declared the boy's disappearance a major crime and indicated they had identified a possible suspect.
Gus Lamont was last seen by his grandmother playing at the Oak Park Station homestead in outback South Australia on September 27.
On 5 February, police declared someone living at the remote station was a suspect in Gus' disappearance and likely death.
They have confirmed the boy's grandparents, his mother and his younger brother were at the property at the time he disappeared but stressed his parents were not suspects.
On Monday, police announced that officers had returned to the sheep station, 45km south of Yunta in the state's Mid North, to continue searching for evidence and would remain in the area for at least the next two days.
South Australia Police detective superintendent Darren Fielke previously said that a person who lived at the station had withdrawn cooperation in the investigation after "a number of inconsistencies and discrepancies" were identified in the information they provided.
Gus' grandparents Josie and Shannon Murray released a brief statement via their lawyers earlier in February in response to the police allegations.
"We are absolutely devastated by the media release of SAPOL Major Crime," they said.
"The family has co-operated fully with the investigation and want nothing more than to find Gus and reunite him with his mum and dad."
Initial searches were based on Gus walking off the station and becoming lost but the case was later declared a major crime.
The two other investigation options were focused on the preschooler being abducted or whether someone known to him was involved in his disappearance and suspected death.
"We don't believe now that Gus is alive," Fielke said.
Investigators searched the homestead on 14 and 15 January, seizing items including a vehicle, a motorcycle and electronic devices for forensic testing.
Fielke said ground and aerial searches had failed to locate Gus or any items belonging to him and family members had provided information that police had reviewed.
Gus's disappearance sparked intensive searches spanning almost 500sq km and involving hundreds of police and volunteers as well as aerial support and mounted units.

Why do so few people join their union these days?

Opinion
Why do so few people join their union these days?
I’m interested in why so few people join unions any more. I joined a union about five years ago and have been impressed by how helpful it is. I consider my pay and conditions to be fair and know that this is basically due to the hard work of our union. Is there any research into what stops people from joining their union?
A few years ago, a reader told me about a time they’d been invited to a union meeting and felt trepidation about accepting. They described it as feeling like “a child worried about getting in trouble from the adults”.
They ended up not attending and, later, felt ashamed of their decision. The response from the expert I spoke with about that question was fascinating, and worth having a look at.
But the answer to your specific question goes way beyond workers worried that they might be put in a career naughty corner by considering unionism.
I asked Dr Isabella Dabaja, a lecturer in the business school at the University of Sydney, about why union membership is so low in Australia. She said that one of the main reasons is something called the “free rider” problem.
“Workers can and do still benefit from the work of unions even without joining them,” she says. “While the more members a union has, the more resources it has to support bargaining and leverage collective worker power through industrial action like strikes, non-unionised public sector workers still receive the wages and conditions won by [this bargaining and action].
While union members in sectors like education and training are higher than other sectors, they are still low compared with 10 years ago.
“For many workers today, there is a lack of awareness around what a union actually is, and often no clear incentive to become a union member, or an understanding of the moral reason you might join your union even though you don’t technically have to.”
So the free rider problem is exacerbated by a lack of understanding, or in some cases a wariness, of unionism more broadly.
“Years of strategic demonisation of unions by employers and political parties, as well as the consequences of anti-union regulatory reforms, have eroded public understanding of this moral imperative.”
Dabaja said that as these regulatory changes shrank the place for unions in our industrial relations system, what also shrank was an appreciation of union benefits among the public.
Most workers today, for example, are unlikely to be aware that union members take home a median of $251 more a week than non-unionised workers (according to 2025 statistics from the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations). Many are also unaware that union fees are entirely tax-deductible.
In other words, your own experience – as part of which you’re conscious of what unions do and confident about the value of membership – is not the experience of most Australians.
While the proportion of union members in sectors such as education and training, where collective bargaining is common, is higher than in other sectors, this is still low compared with even 10 years ago.
And it is extremely low compared with the late 1940s and early ’50s, when two out of every three Australian workers were part of a union. Recently, however, there has been a small but significant increase in unionisation rates across the whole economy – from 12.5 per cent in 2021 to 13.1 per cent in 2024.
“The largest growth in membership has been among workers aged 15 to 24, most likely the result of young people entering the workforce and realising how little they are paid for their labour after years of low wage growth and rising living costs,” Dabaja says.
This is a particularly interesting trend given that many young people work in workplaces such as pubs or retail stores that tend not to be unionised. And that means they are less likely to have had any contact with union organisers.
However, Dabaja said that it’s now so difficult for younger people to make ends meet that a lack of union presence isn’t necessarily stopping them from joining unions.
“I speak to students about this issue regularly, many of whom are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis as well as rent and housing affordability. Last semester, a student explained to me that they would sometimes need to miss classes just to save the cost of the train fare into university,” she says.
“Without the guarantee of the kind of economic security afforded to previous generations of Australians, and the prospect of home ownership becoming a far off dream for many, young people are looking for solutions to combat social and economic inequality again.”

Dog food the ACCC’s opening salvo in ‘down down’ Coles case

Against the spirit of ‘Down Down’: Coles manager’s warning revealed in trial
Updated ,first published
A top Coles executive warned colleagues that advertising a product’s price as “Down Down” when it was cheaper just four weeks earlier was not in the spirit of the marketing campaign before the supermarket giant went on to do just that.
Lawyers for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission read out the emails in Federal Court during the first day of a blockbuster hearing on whether Coles had misled millions of customers with “illusory” discounts on everyday items.
Using the emails, the regulator painted a picture of Coles as determined to match Woolworths’ even more aggressive use of short-term price rises, followed by “discounts” that increased sales even though the items became more expensive.
The case centres on a sample of items including dog food, Shapes biscuits and Coca-Cola sold between January 2021 and May 2023, which the ACCC’s lawyers said were sold under a strategy that suggested discounts which were “utterly misleading” or a “half truth”.
Coles previously had sold products at a higher price for at least 12 weeks before discounting them. But in internal Coles emails from the time, staff observed how rival Woolworths raised prices for shorter periods. “They (Woolworths) are really pushing the line here,” one email said.
As Coles’ staff considered whether to follow suit with just four weeks before a price change, then-head of pricing and value Chris Reid sent a cautious internal note. Reid said that while a “Down Down” promotion within four weeks of an established price was permitted, it would not be in the “spirit” of the campaign.
Coles proceeded regardless and change the minimum window to four weeks that established prices need to last before a “Down Down” discount.
At the hearing in Melbourne, the ACCC’s lawyers also referenced sales and revenue figures from Coles they say showed how effective the “Down Down” label was in persuading shoppers.
Barrister Garry Rich, SC, leading the ACCC’s case, noted that Karicare baby formula generated about $67,800 in weekly sales revenue when marketed as a “Down Down” special priced at $21, compared with $49,800 per week when priced regularly at $24. “Substantially more revenue is generated when on promotion than not,” Rich said.
In preparing its case, which was launched in 2024 and will go for 10 days in court, the watchdog has filed evidence of 245 products’ prices over 15 months. Of the products in the evidence, their first price was on offer for a median period of a year before being increased to its second price, a median of 28 days, before being reduced to a third “Down Down” price which was higher or equal to the first price.
Coles rejects that this constituted misleading conduct, and says the “Down Down” prices were a genuine discount after suppliers had increased the cost of the products. Coles’ lead barrister John Sheahan, KC, began outlining the supermarkets case late on Monday, making mention of inflation data submitted as evidence.
Woolworths, which is also facing allegations from the ACCC of misleading customers with its discounts, has denied the claims and its case will be heard later this year.
Rich opened with the example of Nature’s Gift Wet Dog Food, which the watchdog alleges was priced at $4 between April 18, 2022, and February 7, 2023. It increased to $6 for seven days – its second price – before Coles introduced its third price, $4.50, advertising it as a discount from $6.
“Despite this, Coles proceeded to tell its customers that … the price was ‘Down Down’,” Rich said. “A reasonable consumer who knew the real facts would not think the price of the dog food had gone down.”
In another example tendered in documents and discussed in court, Shapes biscuits were sold for $5 a packet in 2021, then got as high as $6.50 and went back to $5.50 on a Coles promotion.
Justice Michael O’Bryan said that while he understood the ACCC’s claim, he struggled to believe that “consumers aren’t so naive to believe that the price has no relationship with the cost”. He queried why a product’s initial price was relevant for working out if there was a discount if its cost had fundamentally changed.
Rich, for the ACCC, responded by saying that when viewed over the space of a month, the consumer would have been paying more for the product, not less.
“All the consumer knows [from the label] is that the price is going down ... [but] fundamentally the price has gone up,” Rich said. “What’s said on the ticket is a half-truth.”
Rich argued that before Coles introduced its second, higher price, it had a promotional plan ready to discount it days later, and that it wasn’t related to true price signals from the supplier. “We don’t think that’s fair dinkum,” Rich said.
“There is never a scenario in which price two is going to continue.”
The ACCC’s lawyers argued that even if the true supplier costs of products were increasing, Coles risked a fall in sales as a result of those costs due to customers potentially switching products or buying less. Rich claimed to avoid that risk, “Coles disguised those price increases as discounts”.
“[It] begs the question, why on earth are you telling your customers prices are going down? They’re not.”
At one point during Monday’s hearing, Coles’ earworm “Down Down” TV advertisements were played. Rich argued the screenings were relevant because they demonstrated the alleged misleading conduct on ticket prices was just part of broader messaging to consumers that discounts were genuine.
Chuckles broke out in the court as the ads were first mentioned. “The jingle that sticks in one’s ears for longer than is healthy,” Rich said. “Your honour will notice the large red hand, and that they [the prices] are not only down, but staying down.”
The hearing resumes on Tuesday.

Pepper spray and threat of 'sonic weapons' at protests alarm rights groups

Increased use of pepper spray, police weapons at protests alarm rights groups
In short:
Legal and human rights groups have raised concerns about the increasing use of pepper spray and other weapons at protests.
The NSW Law Enforcement Conduct Commission is investigating the actions of police a week ago during the protest over Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit to Sydney.
What's next?
Human rights groups are calling for a review and possible ban of police use of weapons for crowd control.
When photographer Xavier Diekman was first pepper-sprayed at a protest, the police officer was less than a metre away.
"He dosed me from very, very close," Mr Diekman told the ABC.
"There was the initial pain and shock … It really hurt, like getting a sharp jet of water or liquid straight to the eye."
The 34-year-old Sydneysider said he struggled to breathe, "coughing and spluttering" from the irritant which left him with blurred vision for about 45 minutes.
Mr Diekman was sprayed when taking photos at a protest against the Defence Weapons Expo at Darling Harbour in November.
He encountered those similar feelings — burning skin, coughing and shortness of breath — when pepper spray was deployed on crowds at a Sydney rally against Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit a week ago.
Legal and human rights groups such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Australian Democracy Network have raised concerns about the increased use of pepper spray and so-called "less lethal" police weapons at protests.
These can include baton rounds, rubber bullets and flash-bang grenades.
NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Peter McKenna said police actions at the Sydney Town Hall protest last week were "justified".
But after allegations of excessive use of force, human rights groups have renewed calls for reviews of police weapons for crowd control, saying more "de-escalatory" approaches are needed.
A 'spike' in pepper spray use
Pepper spray, also referred to as capsicum or OC spray, is a hand-held chemical irritant that typically comes in an aerosol or spray bottle, dispersed as a direct stream, a mist or fog.
It is made from high concentrations of capsaicin, the chemical that gives chilli peppers heat, which causes burning and irritation to the eyes and skin.
Symptoms generally last between 45 minutes and 2 hours, but some people may experience more severe effects.
"While chemical irritants are often thought of as causing minimal transient harm, our findings also identify longer-term risks, including permanent disability," according to a report by Physicians for Human Rights.
A NSW Police manual on the use of OC spray says its purpose is "for self-defence to assist in the restraint of a subject, or to limit a subject's actions".
It noted defensive spray may be used for the protection of human life and "a less than lethal option for controlling people, where violent resistance or confrontation occurs (or is likely to occur)".
Emma Ryan is a critical criminologist at Deakin University whose research focuses on police use of less-lethal weapons.
She said pepper spray should only be used under "extreme circumstances" when halting a riot.
"The definition of riot is pretty slippery … If lives are being threatened, then of course police need to step in," Dr Ryan told the ABC.
"But if no-one's lives are being threatened, I really don't see the justification."
The Australian Democracy Network (ADN), along with the not-for-profit legal group Grata Fund, recently published a report on protest policing across Australia between 2019 and 2024.
It found a spike in the use of pepper spray in recent years, noting its use at 11 protests in 2023–24, compared to seven in the five years prior.
It also highlighted at least five incidents involving pepper spray being deployed directly into protesters' faces, contrary to guidelines.
Young people and elderly targeted
Anastasia Radievska, protest rights campaigner at ADN, said there were further instances of the use of police weapons at protests resulting in injury since the report was issued.
And there were growing instances of "really diverse members of the community" being impacted.
"So kids, people in wheelchairs, elderly people," Ms Radievska told the ABC.
"And that's because it's used in this indiscriminate crowd-control manner, in a way that actually makes people panic more."
Faye, a Sydney mother who asked only to use her first name to protect her daughter's identity, became emotional when speaking about her 10-year-old being pepper-sprayed at the Sydney protest last week.
She said the pair were trying to get home when police charged at a nearby crowd and started running in their direction.
"I told her to cover her face. Everyone was coughing and being pepper-sprayed," Faye told the ABC.
"We were relatively OK. [We] coughed a lot and [had] shortness of breath, but we saw an elderly couple having a terrible time with the chemical weapons used."
Human Rights Watch (HRW) was among the groups calling on the NSW government to investigate alleged abuse and "excessive force" used by police at the Sydney protest.
The organisation raised concerns about the use of pepper spray, highlighting the experience of legal observers at the protest who were wearing high-visibility vests to identify their role.
Legal observer Rebecca Payne told HRW that police sprayed her eyes and charged at the crowd, forcing her to shelter in a convenience store and later seek hospital treatment.
NSW Premier Chris Minns has defended the actions of police, saying officers did "everything possible" to avoid violent confrontations.
Assistant Commissioner McKenna said officers were "threatened, jostled and assaulted" during "a number of melees, rolling fights" and "violent behaviour".
'Sonic weapons' seen at protests
The Australian Democracy Network said it was renewing calls for the use of "dangerous" police weapons to be reviewed and even banned at protests.
The group was among 38 legal, human rights and civil society organisations that wrote to the Victorian premier in 2024 after violent clashes at a protest against the Land Forces military conference in Melbourne.
Several people were injured when police fired foam bullets and pepper spray at members of the crowd.
"Data shows that the tactics that are being employed by police tend to be escalatory and can actually cause things like risk of crowd crash," Ms Radievska said.
"There's a need to look at the use of these weapons, the use of these tactics, and if there are more de-escalatory approaches that can be taken."
James Parker, associate professor at Melbourne Law School, was concerned police were also deploying long-range acoustic devices (LRADs) to protests.
Dr Parker, who is the director of a research program titled Law, Sound and the International, said the devices could be used to transmit messages or alarms at high volumes and frequencies.
"The loud, sireny alert sound can cause substantial harm and that harm can be long-lasting," Dr Parker told the ABC.
"Some people have had permanent hearing loss."
LRADs, often referred to as "sonic weapons" or "sound canons", were initially made for militaries but they have been used for policing protests in some parts of the world.
NSW Police confirmed an LRAD was at the Sydney rally after photos were shared by protesters on social media.
A media spokesperson said it was available "to enhance and facilitate communication in areas with high ambient noise".
Dr Parker said even the presence of LRADs at protests would set a threatening tone.
"They are a futuristic, slightly sci-fi looking device, and I do think it can operate as a kind of technique of producing fear," he said
"If I saw an LRAD at a protest, I would be quite fearful and would want to trust that the police were going to use it safely."
Investigation into clashes
The Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (LECC) announced it was "in the public interest" to investigate the violent clashes between police and demonstrators at Town Hall in Sydney.
"Including incidents of alleged misconduct on the part of NSW police officers against persons attending that location for a protest," it said.
When asked about plans to review weapons used at protests, a spokesperson for the NSW minister for police and counter-terrorism said they would be cooperating with the LECC inquiry.
"At this time, the most appropriate course of action is to allow the LECC to carry out its functions independently and without interference," the spokesperson told the ABC.
NSW Police did not provide a statement about how police weapons were used at protests.
A Victorian government spokesperson said there were "no plans to review the methods used by police to maintain safety for everyone".

Leaders gather for New Delhi AI summit as warnings grow over societal risks
A global artificial intelligence summit opens in New Delhi on Monday, tackling issues from job disruption to child safety, though some participants warn its sweeping agenda may hinder firm commitments. Surging demand for generative AI has lifted tech profits and shares, even as concerns mount over social and environmental risks.
A global artificial intelligence summit kicks off in New Delhi on Monday with big issues on the agenda, from job disruption to child safety, but some attendees warn the broad focus could diminish the chance of concrete commitments from world leaders.
While frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits and share prices for many technology companies, anxiety is growing over the risks that it poses to society and the environment.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Monday afternoon inaugurate the five-day AI Impact Summit, which aims to declare a "shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration".
"This occasion is further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology," and it "shows the capability of our country's youth", he said in an X post on Monday.
It is the fourth annual gathering addressing the problems and opportunities posed by AI, after previous international meetings in Paris, Seoul and Britain's wartime code-breaking hub Bletchley.
Touted as the biggest edition yet, the Indian government is expecting 250,000 visitors from across the sector, including 20 national leaders and 45 ministerial-level delegations.
Also in attendance will be tech CEOs including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Google's Sundar Pichai, although unforeseen circumstances have reportedly led Jensen Huang, head of US chip titan Nvidia, to cancel his planned appearance.
Modi will seek to "strengthen global partnerships and define India's leadership in the AI decade ahead" in talks with the likes of France's Emmanuel Macron and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, organisers say.
But whether they will take meaningful steps to hold AI giants accountable is in doubt, Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, told AFP.
Industry commitments made at previous events "have largely been narrow 'self regulatory' frameworks that position AI companies to continue to grade their own homework", said Kak, a former AI advisor to the US Federal Trade Commission who is taking part in the summit.

AI safety
The Bletchley gathering, held in 2023 – a year after ChatGPT stunned the world – was called the AI Safety Summit.
The meetings' names have changed as they have grown in size and scope, and at last year's AI Action Summit in Paris, dozens of nations signed a statement calling for efforts to flank AI tech with regulation to make it "open" and "ethical".
But the United States did not sign, with Vice President JD Vance warning that "excessive regulation ... could kill a transformative sector just as it's taking off".
The Delhi summit has the loose themes of "people, progress, planet" – dubbed three "sutras".
Even so, AI safety remains a priority, including the dangers of misinformation such as deepfakes.
Last month saw a global backlash over Elon Musk's Grok AI tool because it allowed users to produce sexualised pictures of real people, including children, using simple text prompts.
"Child safety and digital harms are also moving up the agenda, particularly as generative AI lowers the barrier to harmful content," AI Asia Pacific Institute director Kelly Forbes told AFP.
"There is real scope for change" although it might not happen fast enough, said Forbes, whose organisation is researching how Australia and other countries are requiring platforms to confront the issue.

AI for 'the many'
Organisers highlight this year's AI summit as the first to be hosted by a developing country.
"The summit will shape a shared vision for AI that truly serves the many, not just the few," India's IT ministry has said.
Last year India leapt to third place – overtaking South Korea and Japan – in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.
But despite plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say the country still has a long way to go before it can rival the United States and China.
Neither Donald Trump nor Xi Jinping will attend the summit, but both countries are sending high-level tech policy officials.
Seth Hays, author of the Asia AI Policy Monitor newsletter, said talk at the summit would likely centre around "ensuring that governments put up some guardrails, but don't throttle AI development".
"There may be some announcements for more state investment in AI, but it may not move the needle much – as India needs partnerships to integrate on the international scene for AI," Hays told AFP.

Russia’s losses in Ukraine boosting reliance on foreign fighters, Britain says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON – Russia is becoming increasingly reliant on foreign fighters in the war on Ukraine as its forces sustain more losses than they are able to replace, British Defence Secretary John Healey said.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov told European counterparts last week that Kyiv was able to inflict more Russian casualties than the Kremlin was able to recruit
This is forcing Russia’s military forces to depend more on thousands of foreign fighters, he said, including recruits from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Cuba, Nigeria and Senegal.
They are “often recruited under false pretences and press-ganged under pressure without necessarily realising that they are destined for the Russian meat machine on the front line of Ukraine”, Mr Healey said.
He put the number of North Korean troops committed to fighting for Russia at about 17,000.
The Russian and Ukrainian militaries have been largely locked in combat along the 1,200km front line, with little territory gained since the first year of the nearly four-year war.
Russia’s mounting losses challenge a narrative projected by the Kremlin – and at times echoed by US President Donald Trump – that Moscow’s victory is inevitable.
Mr Fedorov has outlined an ambition to drive up Russian losses to 50,000 a month by the summer.
Western officials have said that will make it difficult for Russian President Vladimir Putin to replace troops without resorting to some form of mobilisation.
That option has proved deeply unpopular – and Mr Putin has avoided any repeat of his 2022 call-up of 300,000 reservists, which prompted hundreds of thousands to leave the country and triggered a spike in public discontent with the war.
Russia sustained around 9,000 more battlefield losses in Ukraine than it was able to replace in January, Bloomberg reported last week.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky cited a figure of 30,000 Russian personnel killed in action in January.
“Putin is not concerned about this now, but there is a level at which he’ll start to care,” the Ukrainian leader said on Feb 14 at the Munich Security Conference.
Russian officials do not disclose military losses.
Mr Putin and his top generals have publicly insisted that fatalities are much smaller than those suffered by Ukraine.
A different view has been offered by a number of Russian military bloggers, who have lamented excessive losses, citing Russian commanders ordering troops to storm Ukrainian defensive positions.
Russia likely sustained 415,000 casualties – accounting for those killed and wounded – in 2025, a slight drop from the 430,000 in 2024, according to assessments by Western officials, bringing its total to more than 1.2 million over the course of the war.
Casualty rates in December amounted to 1,130 a day and climbed as high as 35,000 for the month, according to the assessments.
The higher numbers have been attributed to more successful Ukrainian drone operations.
Still, Russian forces have been able to gain ground on parts of the front line, including in the cities of Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region.
Russian forces have also relentlessly carried out missile and drone strikes on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure
Western officials believe it is probable that Russia can sustain its combat operations in Ukraine throughout 2026 as a result of its recruitment campaigns, industrial production and support from other nations like China.
Ukraine’s top general, General Oleksandr Syrskyi, told reporters last week that the increased use of drones in combat has widened the area of battle along the front line by as much as 15km to 20km.
Mr Healey said: “This is an important reminder for us all that Ukraine is under huge pressure from Russia, not least their civilians and cities but the front line as well – but they are retaking some territory and some towns.”
Casualty rates have grown from around six to as many as 25 Russian losses for each Ukrainian casualty on some parts of the front line, he said.
Western officials believe that trend, helped by the delivery of more drones to Ukraine, is key to increasing pressure on Russia’s campaign.
Ukraine has said that while Russia appeared to exceed its goals for military recruitment, the number of its troops on the battlefield has remained the same for six months – pointing to as many as 712,000.
“Putin likes to give the impression that they’re making relentless and inevitable progress, but he’s weaker than he has been and more reliant than he has been on foreign fighters,” Mr Healey said. BLOOMBERG

Hong Kong records hottest Lunar New Year’s Eve at 27.9 degrees
Previous record for the warmest Lunar New Year’s Eve was 27.8 degrees in 1953, according to forecaster
Hong Kong has seen its hottest Lunar New Year’s Eve since records began in the 19th century, with the mercury hitting 27.9 degrees Celsius (82.2 Fahrenheit), 0.1 degree above the previous record.
The Hong Kong Observatory said temperatures on Monday were expected to range between 22 and 28 degrees.
The previous record for the warmest Lunar New Year’s Eve was 27.8 degrees in 1953, according to the forecaster, which has been logging climate data since 1884.
“Locally, it was hot in the afternoon, with temperatures in many areas rising to 28 degrees or higher,” the weather forecaster said.
“As of 2.30pm, the maximum temperature recorded at the Observatory was 27.9 degrees, the highest on record for Lunar New Year’s Eve”

UK plans to ban social networks for teens under 16 this year — newspaper

LONDON, February 16. /TASS/. The UK may ban access to social media for children under the age of 16 as early as this year, The Times reported.
According to the newspaper, the ban could be implemented as early as this summer, once consultations on the issue have been completed. The ban will apply not only to social media but also to chatbots. The government also intends to require online platforms to limit the amount of time children spend on apps with endless scrolling.
On Sunday evening, the Cabinet announced that it would begin urgent legislative work on amending the Online Safety Bill on February 16. According to a statement from the office of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the "government will also close a legal loophole and force all AI chatbot providers to abide by the Online Safety Act obligations to remove illegal content" under the aforementioned law.
In this regard, Starmer cited London's action against Grok, a chatbot developed by Elon Musk's company xAI. The communique noted that these efforts "sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass." "Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action. We are acting to protect children’s wellbeing and help parents to navigate the minefield of social media," Starmer will say later on Monday.
The Times noted to speed up the process, the prime minister intends to use "Henry VIII powers," named after the absolute monarch who ruled from 1509 to 1547 and who had the ability to change laws through royal statutes. These powers allow action to be taken through subordinate legislation without full consideration by lawmakers, rather than through basic laws passed by the Parliament.
UK’s investigations into Grok
In February, the UK Information Commissioner's Office launched an investigation into the US social network X and Musk's company xAI over images generated by a Grok-based chatbot. On January 13, the Ofcom media regulator launched a similar investigation. According to The Telegraph, London's dissatisfaction stems from the chatbot's creation of explicit images of women and children at users' request. According to the newspaper, so-called deepfakes have already affected Princess Catherine (Middleton), the wife of the heir to the British throne, as well as other British celebrities, cabinet members, and lawmakers.

‘You’re not lost or alone’: Savannah Guthrie shares striking new plea to her mother’s suspected kidnapper

‘You’re not lost or alone’: Savannah Guthrie shares striking new plea to her mother’s suspected kidnapper
Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her Arizona home two weeks ago
- Bookmark
“Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie has shared a striking new message as the search for her mother, 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, enters its third week.
In a video shared Sunday night, Savannah Guthrie spoke directly to anyone who might have abducted her mother, who was last seen at her home near Tucson, Arizona, on January 31.
“It’s been two weeks since our mom was taken, and I just wanted to come on and say that we still have hope, and we still believe,” she said. “I wanted to say to whoever has her, or knows where she is, that it’s never too late. And you’re not lost or alone, and it is never too late to do the right thing, and we are here.”
“We believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it's never too late,” she added.
This comes after the FBI reportedly said a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie’s home could match the gloves worn by a masked and “armed” suspect seen outside her front door the morning she vanished.
The glove has been sent for DNA testing. While investigators have received the preliminary results, they’re still waiting on official confirmation, the Associated Press reports.
The FBI has described the suspect as a man with an average build who is between 5’9” and 5’10” tall. He was wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack, the agency noted.
The FBI has also announced a reward of $100,000 for information “leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”
The case has sparked a massive search involving state and federal law enforcement agencies.
The 84-year-old relies on daily medication, and there could be “fatal” consequences if she doesn’t take it, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said. When she vanished, police also flagged that she has high blood pressure, a pacemaker and cardiac issues, according to a 911 dispatch audio.
Savannah Guthrie has been outspoken about her mother’s disappearance on social media. Just days ago, she shared an old video of her mother, writing, “We will never give up on her.”
She also shared the footage of the masked man and asked for anyone with information to come forward. “Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home,” she wrote on Instagram.
Investigators “won’t quit” their efforts, even if the search takes years, Nanos told The New York Times.
“Maybe it’s an hour from now,” Nanos said Friday. “Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy."

Can Hong Kong’s 4.8 million MPF members repeat record gains in Year of the Horse?
Volatility looms in the Year of the Horse, analysts forecast, after the Year of the Snake delivered estimated earnings of US$32 billion
The Year of the Horse is set to bring volatility for the investments of Hong Kong’s 4.8 million Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) members, following a record-breaking Year of the Snake that ended on Monday, according to analysts.
The next zodiac year, which begins on Tuesday, is the seventh in the Chinese lunar calendar’s 12-year cycle, each represented by an animal.
The Year of the Snake delivered estimated earnings of HK$251.6 billion (US$32 billion), the highest on record since the MPF was launched in 2000, according to MPF Ratings, an independent pension research firm. Earnings and contributions pushed MPF assets to HK$1.59 trillion at the end of January.
As of February 11, the 378 MPF investment funds had gained 18.8 per cent in the Year of the Snake, much higher than the three preceding years. Members earned 12.3 per cent in the Year of the Dragon in 2024, and suffered losses of 4.5 per cent in the Year of the Rabbit in 2023 and 7.8 per cent in the Year of the Tiger in 2022, according to MPF Ratings.
Francis Chung, chairman of MPF Ratings, said the outlook for the Year of the Horse was “modest and inconclusive”, based on past records. In the last Year of the Horse in 2014, the MPF investment funds earned 2.2 per cent, while in 2002 they lost 0.4 per cent.

South Australian police have arrested a 75-year-old on unrelated firearm offences as they launch a new search for evidence during the investigation into missing four-year-old Gus Lamont.
Gus, short for “August”, went missing on 27 September 2025 from his family’s remote sheep station, sparking one of the biggest and most intense searches in South Australia’s history.
Police said on Monday they had arrested a 75-year-old from Grampus and charged them with firearm offences. The charges are as a result of a previous search at Oak Park Station, Gus’s home, but are not related to Gus’s disappearance or a previous incident at the property involving media, police said.

The Daily Mail reported in October that one of Gus’s grandmothers waved a gun while one of their reporters was there. Police reportedly said the reporter was on private property without permission, and that the gun was to dispatch a snake.
The person has been bailed to appear at the Peterborough magistrates court in May.
Earlier in the day, police said they had returned to Oak Park Station to continue searching for evidence after identifying a suspect in his disappearance. The search was expected to continue on Tuesday.
Gus has been missing since September. He had been playing outside at 5pm but, when his grandmother went to call him inside half an hour later, he was gone, police were told.
Based on information from people living with Gus at Oak Park Station, SA police initially believed he had wandered off.
Drones, divers, dogs and teams of volunteers, police, emergency services and defence force personnel searched the 60,000-hectare property, which is about 300km inland from Adelaide, and beyond.
After advice from survival experts, the hope of finding Gus alive dwindled, and the search became a recovery operation.
Police had consistently said there was no evidence of foul play, though they could not rule anything out, and that the family was cooperating.
But police announced on 5 February that the case was now considered a major crime, alleging that the suspect was someone who lived with Gus, and that they had seized a vehicle, a motorbike and electronic devices in mid-January.
Det Supt Darren Fielke, the officer in charge of major crime, said police had “identified a number of inconsistencies and discrepancies” in the information family members gave them.
“As a result of these inconsistencies, and investigations into them, a person who resides at Oak Park Station has withdrawn their support for the police and is no longer cooperating with us,” he said.
“The person who has withdrawn their cooperation is now considered a suspect in the disappearance of Gus.”
Police had been working on three theories, Fielke said: that Gus had wandered off, that he had been abducted, and that someone known to him was involved with his disappearance.
Their investigations found the first two options were unlikely, leaving them with the third option.
Fielke stressed that the suspect was not one of his parents.
Gus’s two grandmothers released a statement through their lawyers, saying they were “devastated” that the case was now a major crime, that the family has “cooperated fully with the investigation and want nothing more than to find Gus and reunite him with his mum and dad”.
On Monday, police said taskforce Horizon detectives will return to Oak Park station and will be there for at least two days.
“Members attached to taskforce Horizon conducting inquiries into the disappearance of four-year-old Gus Lamont on 27 September 2025 have returned to Oak Park Station to continue searching for evidence,” Sapol said in a statement.
“It is anticipated that taskforce Horizon detectives will remain in the area for at least the next two days.
“An update on the search activities will be provided as they progress.”
Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Great Southern stretches WA gold to 3.5km strike

Great Southern stretches WA gold to 3.5km strike
Brought to you by BULLS N’ BEARS
Perth-based gold explorer Great Southern Mining has continued to build scale and momentum at its Golden Boulder discovery in Western Australia’s gold-rich Duketon belt, extending known mineralisation to an impressive 3.5-kilometre strike along the interpreted Rosemont Shear Zone.
The final assays from last year’s 56-hole RC drilling program have delivered a string of impressive shallow gold intercepts that firm up continuity along the Golden Boulder Main Line trend and open up fresh ground to the south.
Best hits included 5 metres grading a solid 3.5 grams per tonne (g/t) gold from 39m, with another 2m intercept running at 1.1g/t gold from 74m. A third hole coughed up 8m at 1.1g/t gold from 45m and featured a 4-metre slice at 2.2g/t, while a fourth intercept pulled in 2m at a stunning 5.0g/t gold from 86m.
However, the gold story doesn’t end near surface, with drilling below 70 metres delivering solid hits that reinforce the presence of stacked mineralised lodes throughout the shallow system. As most drilling at Golden Boulder remains less than 100m below surface, this leaves substantial depth potential largely untested.
The latest results have poured fuel on the fire, building on earlier reverse circulation (RC) campaigns, which also intersected some quality gold hits such as 5m at an eye-catching 14.57g/t gold from 41m, including a 1-metre slice running at a whopping 70.94g/t gold.
The aptly named Golden Boulder project sits along a prolific north-south structural corridor that houses several multi-million-ounce operations, including Regis Resources’ Rosemont deposit and Genesis Minerals’ Laverton tenure.
The geological architecture is interpreted as a series of stacked lodes within the Rosemont fault zone, a whopping 60-kilometre-long structure that hosts multiple gold deposits owned by ASX-listed Regis Resources. Those include the two-million-ounce Rosemont gold mine and the 380,000-ounce Baneygo deposit, both key parts of Regis’ broader Duketon gold camp.
Gold in the area is hosted in a fractionated dolerite, a doppelganger to Kalgoorlie’s fabled Golden Mile. Great Southern believes that if the stacked lodes occur as regularly and to depth as the lodes do in Kalgoorlie, then Golden Boulder could quickly shift from an interesting discovery to a serious resource candidate.
Notably, historical drilling at the site has only been shallow and sparse at best, with very few holes exceeding 40m. However, the old timers still dug out a hefty 1,915 tonnes running 28.6 g/t gold for 1,761 ounces along a 3.7km strike line, underlining the system’s pedigree.
This time around, the ground is being given a proper workout.
Great Southern Mining managing director Matthew Keane said: “We have successfully achieved all desired outcomes, including significant strike extensions to known mineralisation, improving continuity of mineralisation in the north of the prospect and defining new mineralisation in previously undrilled areas in the south. Importantly, drilling to date is still very shallow. The team are excited for the upcoming EIS co-funded diamond drilling, due to commence in the coming weeks.”
The upcoming diamond program has been successful in securing co-funding through the Western Australian Government’s Exploration Incentive Scheme and will target deeper structural controls, which are assumed to be the drivers behind multiple gold trends across the prospect. More broadly, these holes will deliver an updated stratigraphic and structural model to help with future targeting.
Great Southern will also be back on the ground in early April, pumping out more RC drilling to chase higher-grade extensions and infill areas, working towards a maiden JORC resource.
With gold mineralisation now defined across an impressive 3.5km of strike in one of WA’s most productive gold belts, and most drilling still shallow, Golden Boulder is rapidly shaping into a discovery with legs.
In a buoyant gold price environment, shallow ounces with growth upside in the right postcode tend to attract attention.

Ukraine war briefing: Drone attack on Russian port sparks fires ahead of fresh peace talks

A Ukrainian drone strike ignited fires at one of Russia’s Black Sea ports, officials said on Sunday, ahead of fresh talks aimed at ending the war. Two people were wounded in the attack on the port of Taman in the Krasnodar region, which damaged an oil storage tank, warehouse and terminals, according to regional governor Veniamin Kondratyev. Falling debris from Russian drones, meanwhile, damaged civilian and transport infrastructure in Ukraine’s Odesa region, officials said, disrupting power and water supplies. The attacks came ahead of another round of US-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 February.
-
Ukraine has agreed with European allies on “specific packages” of new energy and military support for Kyiv by 24 February, president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Sunday. He had said earlier after a meeting of the so-called Berlin Format of about a dozen European leaders in Munich that he had hoped for new support, including air-defence missiles. “I am grateful to our partners for their readiness to help, and we count on all deliveries arriving promptly,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Russia had launched about 1,300 attack drones, 1,200 guided aerial bombs and dozens of ballistic missiles at Ukraine over the past week alone.
-
European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Russia was hoping to win diplomatically what it had failed to achieve on the battlefield, and was banking on the US to deliver concessions at the negotiating table. But Kallas told the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Sunday that key Russian demands – including the lifting of sanctions and unfreezing of assets – were decisions for Europe. “If we want a sustainable peace then we need concessions also from the Russian side.”
-
Zelenskyy suggested at the Munich conference earlier that there were still questions remaining over future security guarantees for his country. He also questioned how the concept of a free trade zone – proposed by the US – would work in the Donbas region, which Russia insists Kyiv must give up for peace. He told the conference the Americans wanted peace as quickly as possible and that the US team wanted to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time, whereas Ukraine wanted guarantees for the country’s future security signed first.
-
Russia will not end the militarisation of its economy after fighting in Ukraine ends, the head of Latvia’s intelligence agency said. “The potential aggressiveness of Russia when the Ukraine war stops will depend of many factors: how the war ends, if it’s frozen or not, and if the sanctions remain,” Egils Zviedris, director of the Latvian intelligence service SAB, told Agence France-Presse on the sidelines of the Munich conference, which ended on Sunday. He said lifting current sanctions “would allow Russia to develop its military capacities” more quickly.
-
Slovak prime minister Robert Fico accused Ukraine of delaying the restart of a pipeline carrying Russian oil to eastern Europe via Ukraine in order to pressure Hungary to drop its opposition to Ukraine’s future membership of the European Union. “We have information that [the pipeline] should have been fixed,” he said after meeting US secretary of state Marco Rubio in Bratislava on Sunday.
-
Russian army chief Valery Gerasimov visited Moscow’s troops in Ukraine and said the Kremlin’s forces seized a dozen eastern villages in February, the defence ministry said. The claims could not be independently verified.

India’s solar power push misses targets as red tape, loan refusals hamper transition
India’s efforts to nearly double clean energy capacity to 500 gigawatts by 2030 are being met with reluctance from banks and state utilities
Challenges to plans to increase solar uptake may mean India maintains its reliance on coal-fired power.
India’s Ministry for New and Renewable Energy created its subsidy programme for residential solar panel installations in February 2024, covering up to 40 per cent of the costs. But residential installations at 2.36 million are well below the ministry’s target of 4 million by March, according to data from the programme’s website.
“Banks’ reluctance to lend and states’ hesitance to promote the schemes could derail India’s efforts to transition away from coal,” said Shreya Jai, the lead energy analyst at research firm Climate Trends in New Delhi.

Migrants who breach values would be kicked out under Ley-era policy draft

Senior Liberals deny involvement in draft policy to ban migrants from Gaza
In short:
Visas would be stripped from migrants who failed to comply with an Australian values statement under a draft policy prepared by the Liberals under Sussan Ley's leadership.
A draft of the policy seen by the ABC would strengthen the enforcement of the pledge.
What's next?
New Liberal leader Angus Taylor has signalled a similar crackdown, saying the door should be "shut" to migrants who do not respect Australia's values.
Two senior Liberals responsible for migration policy say they had no input into a leaked proposal to ban people coming to Australia from terror-declared areas.
Senator Jonno Duniam and Senator Paul Scarr, who held the home affairs and immigration portfolios respectively under former Liberal leader Sussan Ley, have denied contributing a plan, reported by some media, to bar entry to people from parts of Gaza, Somalia and the Philippines.
The ABC understands this component of a draft policy proposal was produced within Ms Ley's office and not formally signed off by shadow cabinet prior to the spill that led to Angus Taylor becoming Liberal leader.
However, parts of the proposal were run by the relevant shadow ministers.
Senator Duniam said the Coalition working group of shadow ministers developing an opposition immigration policy last met prior to the Bondi terror attack in December and had not gathered since.
"What seems to have appeared in the public domain are policy ideas that I haven't seen, commented on or contributed to," he said.
"They haven't been to (Liberal) leadership, shadow cabinet or our party room for any discussion.
"So, frankly, these were not part of any policy work I was a part of or that was progressing through our process."
Senator Scarr also released a statement relating to reports it was a Liberal Party proposal to ban migration from certain declared regions.
"I never proposed any such policy," he said.
"I never agreed to any such policy.
"I have a range of serious concerns with respect to any such policy."
The proposal to make the Australian values statement a part of visa compliance, which was revealed by the ABC, was taken through the Liberals' immigration policy working group process.
Proposal threatens deportation for breach of values statement
Under the leaked proposal, migrants who breach an Australian values statement would face deportation.
A copy of the draft policy seen by the ABC outlines plans to "elevate" the current non-binding Australian values component for all temporary and permanent visa applicants, making compliance with the statement a condition of being able to stay in Australia.
The values statement, which is signed by all temporary and provisional visa applicants, is designed to signify understanding of core principles in Australian society like freedom of speech, religion and association.
In signing it the visa holder is also supposed to be noting understanding of Australians' "commitment to the rule of law" and "respect for the freedom and dignity of the individual".
Angus Taylor says he will unite the Liberal Party, but a deeper rift is forming between those who want to overhaul the party's direction and those who believe doing so would mean political death.
Respecting Australia's parliamentary democracy, equality of opportunity for all people "regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, race or national or ethnic origin" is also in the statement.
As is an explanation of the concept of a "fair go" for all which embraces "mutual respect, tolerance" and "compassion for those in need".
The values statement also required permanent visa applicants to commit to making "reasonable efforts" to learn English if it was not their native language.
The leaked draft of the Coalition's immigration policy pledged to "elevate the importance" of the Australian values statement.
"Making compliance with the [values statement] a visa condition will better reflect the expectation of the Australian people that visa holders conduct themselves in accordance with Australian values during their stay," the draft policy said.
"Conduct constituting a breach of visa conditions may result in visa cancellation and persons found in breach of those conditions may be required to leave Australia."
Policy was set to be released this week
Ms Ley, who lost the Liberal leadership to Angus Taylor last Friday, had been preparing to release the Coalition's comprehensive migration plan this week.
But her ousting has resulted in the policy being put on ice for further review by Mr Taylor and his yet-to-be-announced shadow ministry.
During his first few days as leader Mr Taylor has signalled migration will be a major focus of his policy platform.
On Monday Mr Taylor said he did not want migrants who did not accept the "most basic beliefs that have made this country successful".
"We believe that you need to obey the law," he told Channel Seven's Sunrise.
"We believe in basic freedoms of speech and religion, and if people don't accept those things they shouldn't come to our country.
"The door should be shut."
It is understood the Coalition's policy would also have aimed to reduce net overseas migration (NOM) to 170,000 people a year.
The NOM has dropped from 429,000 in 2023-24 to about 306,000 for 2024-25, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics December data.
Labor has an annual NOM target of 225,000 people over the next three years.
The ABC also revealed Mr Taylor was actively discussing a controversial approach to immigration inspired by a recent UK Labour policy.
Senior sources have told Four Corners the Liberals are considering implementing a policy where, if a country refused to take back citizens rejected by Australia, then Australia would blacklist that country — or potentially a zone within it — and ban its citizens from getting a visa.

Syrian army takes control of second US military base in country
This was reported by the Syrian state news agency SANA, citing Syria's Ministry of Defense, Ukrinform reports.
According to the report, the transfer of control over the Al-Shaddadi base to the Syrian government occurred three days after the Defense Ministry announced on February 12 that Syrian forces had taken control of the strategically important U.S. military base Al-Tanf in the central province of Homs, near the borders with Iraq and Jordan. The handover of Al-Tanf also took place by agreement between Syrian and American officials.
In April last year, the United States began withdrawing personnel and military equipment from the base in Al-Shaddadi, which had been under the control of the Kurdish coalition Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). At the end of January, Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi reached an agreement under which Kurdish units would be integrated into government forces, and self-governing institutions established by the Kurds in northeastern Syria would become part of Syrian state structures.
In June last year, U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and Special Envoy for Syria Thomas Barrack stated that the administration of President Donald Trump intended to retain only one of the eight military bases on Syrian territory.
As previously reported, according to the UN Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee, five assassination attempts were carried out last year against Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa and two Syrian ministers.

Accused Bondi beach killer appears in Sydney court for first hearing
Accused Bondi Beach killer Naveed Akram appeared in a Sydney court via video link on Monday for his first hearing, after authorities said he and his father carried out a December attack on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration. Akram faces terrorism and 15 murder charges. His father was shot by police.
Accused Bondi Beach killer Naveed Akram appeared in an Australian court via video link Monday, in his first public hearing since the nation's worst mass shooting in nearly three decades.
Akram and his father Sajid allegedly attacked a Jewish Hanukkah celebration in December in the nation's worst mass shooting in nearly three decades.
Akram has been charged with terrorism and 15 counts of murder. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack.
He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media.
The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said.

Akram wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said.
He reportedly spoke only one word – "yeah" – when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders.
Akram will next appear in court on March 9.
Speaking outside the court, Akram's lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in "very onerous conditions", ABC said.
He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty.
The mass shooting sparked national soul-searching about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen gun laws.
Among the victims of December's attack were an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor, a couple who confronted one of the gunmen and a 10-year-old girl, Matilda, who was described at her funeral as a "ray of sunshine".

Tactical' training
Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier.
Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia's intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat.
Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out "firearms training" in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
They said the suspects "meticulously planned" the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a "tactical manner".
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against "Zionists" while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State jihadist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.

Jeanine Pirro’s inability to secure indictments against Democratic lawmakers seen as a ‘stunning’ failure, report says
US Attorney’s office reportedly tried and failed to indict a group of Democratic lawmakers
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s failed attempt to indict a group of Democratic lawmakers has been described as “stunning” by a former prosecutor in the D.C. office, according to a new report.
A grand jury recently rejected federal prosecutors’ attempt to secure an indictment against a group of Democratic lawmakers who made a video urging members of the military and intelligence communities to refuse illegal orders, according to several media outlets, including The New York Times and Politico.
The video, which was posted in November, enraged President Donald Trump and his allies. On Truth Social, Trump accused the lawmakers of “seditious behavior” and called for their arrests. At one point, he even wrote: “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., which Pirro leads, reportedly pursued the indictment. Now, a former prosecutor who once worked in the Washington office tells Politico Magazine it’s “stunning” for a grand jury to reject an indictment completely.
“The rules are skewed so heavily in favor of the prosecutor that it’s almost comical. But the public is essentially saying, ‘We do not trust you. We are skeptical of you,’” they said.
The former prosecutor described the current Washington office as a “hollowed-out core of increasingly inexperienced and overworked D.C. [assistant U.S. attorneys] spending their time reviewing the [Jeffrey] Epstein files and wondering what their ‘red line’ for resignation is.”
“I think good cases aren’t being brought because people are either afraid or lack bandwidth. D.C. had one of the most prestigious U.S. Attorney’s offices in the country, and to see it become a shadow of itself in a year is sad,” the former prosecutor told Politico Magazine.
Pirro told Politico Magazine her responsibility is to “follow the law.”
“Our system of justice allows grand juries and trial juries to review evidence and make their own decisions, that’s their function, that’s the way the system works,” she said. “All victims matter to us. We are about the law, and we are singularly focused; the passions of others, political and otherwise are irrelevant.”
The Independent has contacted the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C., for comment.
After the failed indictment attempt was revealed, Democratic lawmakers who appeared in the video spoke out against the Trump administration.
Senator Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut and retired U.S. Navy Captain who participated in the video, said the “most patriotic thing any of us can do is not back down.” Senator Elissa Slotkin, a former CIA analyst who was also in the video, said she hopes the grand jury’s rejection “ends this politicized investigation for good.”
This isn’t the first time Pirro’s office has failed to secure a high-profile indictment.
Last year, her office tried and failed to bring a felony charge against a man accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent. The case received nationwide attention, and the man was quickly dubbed “Sandwich Guy.”
The charge was downgraded, and a jury later found him not guilty of misdemeanor assault.

Tallest tower in the Valley proposed as block up for sale
Plans for the tallest tower in Fortitude Valley have been published as the block of land comes up for sale.
Construction on the site has not been approved, but an architect has put together the design to promote the listing of 70-82 Wickham Street ahead of a possible height-limit increase in the suburb.
The block is presently occupied by a well-worn two-storey building called Metro Central, with several tenants including retail stores and Brisbane’s Anarchist Communist Federation headquarters.
Directly opposite Centenary Park, it covers 2416 square metres and has access to Warren Street, Barry Street and Wickham Street.
Seller Colliers said the block was prime for residential redevelopment, and architect Cottee Parker designed plans for a 40-storey tower with more than 350 apartments.
If such a tower was built, it would likely be the tallest in the suburb – a title presently held by the 30-storey No. 1 Fortitude Valley – and have views of the CBD, Botanic Gardens and Brisbane River.
It would also be nearby schools including All Hallows and Brisbane Central State School.
Late last year, Brisbane City Council announced it planned to update its city plan to allow taller buildings in the Valley, as part of a wider push to increase housing supply with new apartments.
Just over 11,000 people live in the suburb.
“Fortitude Valley is already close to transport, jobs and entertainment, and with major Brisbane 2032 venues nearby, it’s the right place to welcome more people to live near where they work and play,” Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said in November.
“This new plan will unlock new housing, boost entertainment options and further activate one of our most vibrant inner-city precincts.”
The 70-82 Wickham Street block is being sold via an expressions of interest campaign closing on March 19.

Finnish FM visits Jerusalem for first time since 2016, discusses regional issues with FM Sa'ar

Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar hosted his Finnish counterpart, Elina Valtonen, at the ministry in Jerusalem during an official diplomatic visit on Sunday.
Valtonen's visit marked the first time a Finnish foreign minister has visited Jerusalem since 2016.
The Foreign Ministry viewed the visit as a significant diplomatic opportunity, particularly against the backdrop of the complex international climate in which Israel is operating and the discussions taking place within the European Union regarding ties with Israel.
Sa'ar and Valtonen first met privately, then held an expanded meeting with delegations from their respective countries. Sa'ar's office described the talks as "substantive and in-depth," focusing on two main tracks: strengthening bilateral relations and recent regional developments.
Sa'ar thanked Valtonen for Finland's support of the EU's decision to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.
"This is the first visit in a decade, and we did not want to miss the opportunity to influence the Finnish government," a source familiar with the details said concerning Israel's goals for the meeting.
Sa'ar attempts to counter criticism of Israel's West Bank bills
Sa'ar also presented Valtonen with a map of Israel, intended to illustrate the country's limited size, amid international criticism of recent decisions regarding Israel and the administration of the West Bank.
The map showed that Israel is approximately one-fifteenth the size of Finland, with Jerusalem officials emphasizing that this relatively small size is central to understanding security constraints.
Valtonen is slated to visit Yad Vashem and the site of the Nova music festival - a focal point of the October 7 massacre - during her visit.
The Foreign Ministry estimates that Valtonen's visit could help shape Finland's positions within the EU and other international forums in the coming period, particularly regarding regional issues and Europe's approach to Israel.

Israeli basketball star Deni Avdija makes history at the NBA All-Star Game

Israeli NBA player Deni Avdija took to the court on Sunday evening as a starter for Team World in the NBA All-Star Game.
"It's a dream come true," Avdija said before the tournament, holding his Team World uniform with the Israeli flag and his number 8.
Avdija scored 5 points in the first game of the tournament; each game lasts only 12 minutes, unlike a standard 48-minute game. Team World played once more in Game III and lost again, eliminating them from the tournament. Avdija did not score in Game III.
Avdija, 25 years old and standing at 6 feet 8 inches, is the first-ever Israeli to be named an NBA All-Star, and it comes on top of what the NBA All-Star website is calling his breakout season, averaging 25.5 points per game for the Portland Trail Blazers. This is Avdija's sixth season in the NBA; he played for the Washington Wizards from 2020 to 2024 before moving to the Trail Blazers last season.
Although he holds both Israeli and Serbian citizenship and his father played for the Yugoslav national basketball team before moving to Israel, Avdija has consistently identified as Israeli. As a teenager, he chose to play for the Israeli national team despite being eligible for the Serbian team. During the All-Star Game on Sunday, Avdija was introduced as representing Israel.
LeBron James: Avdija is playing exceptional basketball
Just before the game began, Los Angeles Lakers star and 22-time All Star player Lebron James was asked about Avdija and said that "I believe he is an All-Star. He's playing exceptional basketball."
James added that he hopes to one day visit Israel, saying, "Hopefully, someday I can make it over there. I've never been...but I've heard nothing but great things."
IDF elite unit wishes Avdija luck
Earlier on Sunday, soldiers from the IDF's 888th Multi-Dimensional "Ghost" Unit wished Avdija good luck through a video published by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit.
"We want to tell you that you chose the right number," the soldiers, whose faces were hidden from view, told Avdija, "and we wish you lots of good luck today in the All-Star!"

Russia-Ukraine war: List of key events, day 1,453
These are the key developments from day 1,453 of Russia’s war on Ukraine.
Published On 16 Feb 2026
Here is where things stand on Monday, February 16:
Fighting
- Russian forces launched attacks across Ukraine on Sunday, wounding six people in the central-eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, three in the northeastern Sumy region, and two in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia, the Ukrinform news outlet reported, citing local officials.
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia has launched about 1,300 drones, 1,200 guided aerial bombs and dozens of ballistic missiles at Ukraine over the past week alone.
- About 1,600 buildings in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, remained without heat on Sunday following recent Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure, officials said.
- Deputy Prime Minister Oleksii Kuleba said Russian strikes overnight on Sunday had damaged railroad infrastructure in the southern region of Odesa and the Dnipropetrovsk region.
- The Ukrainian military said in a statement that it hit a key oil terminal in southern Russia, near the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula, on Sunday. The attack was on the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal near the village of Volna in the Krasnodar region.
- Ukrainian forces also launched a drone attack on the Russian Black Sea port of Taman, which handles oil products, grain, coal and commodities, causing damage and triggering several fires, according to Veniamin Kondratyev, the governor of Russia’s Krasnodar region. He said more than 100 people were working to put out the fires.
- Kondratyev said there were more Ukrainian attacks on the Russian resort city of Sochi and the village of Yurovka, close to the seaside town of Anapa. They caused less significant damage, he added.

- Russian air defences downed five drones approaching the Russian capital, Moscow, according to Mayor Sergei Sobyanin.
- A Ukrainian attack also left five municipalities in the Russian border region of Bryansk and parts of its capital without heat and electricity, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said.
- Russia’s Ministry of Defence said on Sunday that its troops had taken the village of Tsvitkove in the southeastern Zaporizhia region, according to the TASS news agency. Russia controls about 75 percent of the Zaporizhia region, but battle lines had been largely static since 2022 until recent Russian advances.
- Russia’s army chief, Valery Gerasimov, said on Sunday that Russian troops had seized a dozen villages in eastern Ukraine in February. He made the announcement while visiting Russian troops in Ukraine, the AFP news agency reported.
Politics and diplomacy
- Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau arrested the country’s former energy minister, German Galushchenko, who resigned in November amid a huge corruption scandal, as he tried to cross Ukraine’s border.
- Zelenskyy said in a statement that Ukraine has agreed to new energy and military support packages with European allies.
- The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said she felt that the bloc’s governments were not ready to give Ukraine a date for membership into the EU, despite demands from Zelenskyy.
- Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics echoed Kallas’s comments, saying that “there is no readiness to accept a date” for Ukrainian membership. He added that he has little hope of an imminent peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.
- Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has accused Ukraine of delaying the restart of a pipeline carrying Russian oil to Eastern Europe via Ukraine to “blackmail” Hungary to drop its opposition to Ukraine’s future EU membership.
- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un presided over the completion ceremony of a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of troops who died in overseas military operations, state media KCNA reported. It is believed that more than 6,000 North Korean soldiers were killed while fighting alongside Russian troops in Ukraine.
- Russia will not end the militarisation of its economy after fighting in Ukraine ends, the head of Latvia’s intelligence agency, Egils Zviedris, told the AFP news agency on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, which ended on Sunday.

NEW YORK, February 16. /TASS/. US Attorney General Pam Bondi has published a list of over 300 prominent figures mentioned in the files of US financier Jeffrey Epstein, Fox News reported citing her letter to members of the Congress.
According to the TV channel, the letter lists all former and current officials or politically significant figures whose names have been mentioned at least once in the materials published by the US Department of Justice on the Epstein case. Among them are UK’s Prince Harry, American television star and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian, musicians Kurt Cobain and Bruce Springsteen, and other celebrities.
The letter stated that the department published all "records, documents, communications and investigative materials" at its disposal that fall under nine categories, including data on human trafficking, concealment of documents, etc. "No records were withheld or redacted 'on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary," Fox News quoted Bondi’s letter as saying.
Epstein was arrested by New York State law enforcement agencies on July 6, 2019. Prosecutors said there was evidence that between 2002 and 2005, he arranged for dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14, to visit his home in Manhattan. Epstein's circle of friends and acquaintances included current and former officials from the US and many other countries, including former heads of state, as well as major entrepreneurs and show business stars. Criminal proceedings against the financier in the US were terminated after he committed suicide in his prison cell in August 2019.

Opinion | Government must reflect on its failures as we enter Year of the Horse
The past year has been a difficult one and it is important for the administration to assess its performance and embrace change
Reading Time:3 minutes

We are ready to head into the Year of the Horse. But, before we do, let’s take stock of what the Year of the Snake brought Hong Kong.
Some say the Year of the Snake is all about change and not meant to be comfortable. For Hong Kong, the past year has been a difficult one of shedding skin, baring our vulnerabilities for all to see.
Just weeks into the Year of the Snake, Beijing’s point man on Hong Kong and Macau affairs, Xia Baolong, made inspection visits, reinforcing the central government’s demand for progress. It was seen as Beijing officially putting the Hong Kong and Macau governments on notice, basically to get on with the programme – in this case, China’s 14th five-year plan.

Hong Kong, a city that prides itself on its efficiency, had been found wanting. The leadership, however, appears to have learned its lesson and Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu announced this month that the government will formulate the city’s first five-year plan, to align with the new national blueprint.
And it wasn’t just in high-level policy implementation that the government’s performance was lacking. By March, it was also clear that it struggles with low-level communication, seen in the opening of Kai Tak Sports Park. It emerged that touts reportedly got people into the venue through the back door without a valid ticket while breaching security. Shortly after, Hong Kong snooker fans were kicked out while a match was still in progress because of a curfew imposed by the venue for the World Grand Prix. The ridiculous incident made international headlines.

The government then tried to introduce premium taxi fleets to counter services provided by ride-sharing platforms that have been operating in a grey area for years. The legislature did finally pass a law that should have been introduced a decade ago to regulate ride-sharing services. However, the introduction of premium taxi fleets didn’t really take off.

What next for Greenland and Ukraine? Questions after the Munich security conference
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-16
01:22:38 UTC
10:22:38 KST

The Munich Security Conference has been a news-making forum for decades – a place where world leaders meet other politicians, as well as journalists and civil society groups, to discuss the biggest issues facing the planet.
In recent years, it has been the site of seismic speeches that redefine the shape of global politics. From a public spat between Nato allies over Iraq in 2003, to Vladimir Putin’s 2007 address that signalled the start of a new cold war, to JD Vance’s blistering attack on European nations in 2025, each moment had an impact that echoed long after the weekend came to a close.
As the dust settles on this year’s event, here are some questions emerging from the conference:
Will Europe ‘wake up’ to a changing world?
After European leaders were left stunned by the US vice-president’s assault on their values in 2025, many came into this year’s conference with a sense of urgency. In the days before the meeting, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said “this must be the moment of awakening. It is time for Europe to wake up.”
Macron and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, gave speeches at the conference that sought to map a new, independent path for European powers, while striving to maintain the alliance with Washington. Both leaders announced that they had begun talks on a European nuclear deterrent.
On Saturday, the UK’s prime minister, Keir Starmer, made the case for a closer defence relationship with Europe, saying his country was “not the Britain of the Brexit years”.
After calling Europe a “sleeping giant”, Starmer went on to stress that a closer UK-EU defence relationship did not imply any weakening of the UK-US relationship, or of Nato.
Can the US and Europe remain united?
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, struck a more conciliatory tone than that of Vance in 2025 when he took the stage on Saturday.
“[The US is] deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be,” he said.
Outlining how the US under Trump was intent on building a new world order, Rubio said: “We are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, [but] it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe”.
He made the speech a day after a YouGov poll showed that among the six largest European countries favourability towards the US was at its lowest point since tracking began a decade ago.
“A rift has opened up between Europe and the United States,” Merz said in his speech on Friday.
“The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade,” the German chancellor said, drawing applause.
The EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, condemned “fashionable euro-bashing” by the US, saying: “When I travel around the world, I see countries that look up to us because we represent values that are still highly regarded.”
Does Trump still want Greenland?
The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, and her counterpart in Greenland, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, held a 15-minute meeting with Rubio on the sidelines of the conference on Friday, which Frederiksen described as “constructive”.
A day later though, she told a panel discussion on Arctic security that she believed Trump still desires to own Greenland, despite dialling back his recent threats to seize it by force.
“Everybody asks us, do we think it’s over? I mean, no, we don’t think it’s over,” Frederiksen said.
A US-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington’s security concerns in the Arctic, but Frederiksen and Nielsen used their appearance on Saturday to say the pressure on the island’s people had been “unacceptable”.
Is peace in Ukraine any closer?
Rubio skipped a Ukraine-focused meeting with European leaders on Friday, and said little in his speech about the conflict with Russia. However, he found time to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy on the sidelines of the conference.
The US is set to host a trilateral meeting between the two warring sides on Tuesday, but in his speech at the conference Zelenskyy said that Ukraine was doing “everything” to end the war, insisting that viable security guarantees were the only way to get to a deal.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine,” he said.
He said that Kyiv needed security guarantees for a minimum of 20 years from the US before it could sign a peace deal with dignity, and also called for a clear date for Ukraine to be allowed to join the EU.
Which future Democratic hopefuls were there?
Throughout the years, the Munich Security Conference has become a staging ground for future presidential nominees and a chance for them to burnish their foreign policy credentials.
This year, prominent Democrats rolled into Munich with the message that European leaders must stand up to Trump. The governor of California, Gavin Newsom; the Arizona senator Ruben Gallego, and the governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, were all in attendance, but it was the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez that received the most attention, with speculation that her presence might indicate a possible run for the White House in 2028.
Outlining what she called an “alternative vision” for a leftwing US foreign policy, Ocasio-Cortez accused Trump of tearing apart the transatlantic alliance and of seeking to introduce an “age of authoritarianism”.
When asked whether the Democratic party’s next presidential nominee should reconsider the country’s military aid to Israel, Ocasio-Cortez said that “the idea of completely unconditional aid no matter what one does, does not make sense”.

China hopes for a bumper lunar new year as world’s biggest migration begins

Chinese officials are hoping that this year’s extra long lunar new year holiday will provide a boost to the country’s economy, where increasing domestic spending has been identified as a key priority for the year ahead.
The government expects a record 9.5 billion passenger trips to be made across China during the 40-day spring festival period, up from 9 billion trips last year. Hundreds of millions of people will be crisscrossing the country to make what is often their only trip home to see their families for the Chinese new year celebrations.
Although China is no longer the world’s most populous country, losing that title to India in 2023, China’s annual chunyun, or “spring transportation” is still the world’s largest mass migration of people.
The official lunar new year holiday will be nine days this year, rather than the typical eight, giving people a longer break to spend their holiday hongbao, red packets of cash given to relatives during the festive period. The holiday period runs from 15-23 February, with New Year’s Day falling on 17 February.
China will be ushering in the year of the horse, said to represent optimism and opportunity, following the year of the snake, a period that represents transformation akin to the reptile’s habit of shedding skins.
An article recently published by Jiangsu province’s propaganda department made the government’s hopes for the festive period clear: “Driven by holiday consumption, the spring festival cultural and tourism consumption month is leading the way in activating domestic demand”. The holiday would help to “unleash the surging vitality that propels China’s economy forward”, the department wrote, using an idiom that literally means “ten thousand horses galloping forwards”.
To help translate this astrological power into reality, the central government said it would issue more than 360m yuan ($52m) in consumer vouchers in February.
“There is no question that [lunar new year] provides a huge lift for retailers and providers of consumer services who might otherwise have had a pretty boring February,” said George Magnus, research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre.
But on a macro level, China’s economy still suffers from Chinese households saving an unusually large share of their income – around a third – while GDP growth is propped up by exports to other countries.
Last year, national retail sales, a metric for consumer spending, grew 3.7%, below the 5% overall GDP growth rate.
Boosting demand at home will be a priority of China’s next five-year plan, the economic planning document that will be approved by the country’s parliament in March. The Communist party has already said that it will be focused on “vigorously boosting consumption”.
In January, the national development and reform commission said it would be formulating an action plan to expand domestic demand over the next five years.
One area of opportunity is the service sector, such as elderly care, entertainment and healthcare, which grew by 5.5% last year. Those sectors are relatively undeveloped compared with consumer goods, meaning there is more room for growth.
The cinema is a particularly popular new year’s activity. Last year, Ne Zha 2, an animation about a demon child, was a runaway hit, earning 4.8bn yuan in its first week at the Chinese box office after a lunar new year release. It went on to earn more than 14bn yuan, becoming the best-performing film in Chinese cinema history.
It remains to be seen whether this year’s releases – the comedy-action film Pegasus 3 and Scare Out, a national security themed blockbuster – will replicate Ne Zha 2’s success.
One service that had a brief moment of popularity was offered by a delivery platform, UU Paotui. The courier services company recently launched a product called “proxy Chinese new year visits”. For 999 yuan ($145), a user could book someone to visit elderly relatives and perform the traditional kowtowing rituals that children do for their parents, while livestreaming the encounter to the customer. But after an outcry about the degradation of traditional rituals, the company withdrew the service.

Over 20,000 Gaza patients await evacuation as Israel continues to restrict Rafah crossing

More than 20,000 sick and wounded Palestinians in Gaza are waiting to travel abroad for treatment as Israel continues to operate the Rafah crossing border with Egypt under tight restrictions, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said.
In a statement on Sunday, the ministry said it is closely monitoring the continued partial and constrained operation of the crossing amid worsening health conditions in Gaza.
Israel reopened the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing on February 2 after occupying it since May 2024, but under highly restricted conditions.
The ministry said more than 20,000 patients and wounded people are registered on travel lists, including critically ill cancer, heart and kidney failure patients.
Many of the injured require advanced surgical procedures unavailable inside Gaza due to the blockade and repeated targeting of the health care system, the ministry added.
Although Israel announced the reopening of the crossing, the number of people allowed to travel remains limited and disproportionate to the scale of the health catastrophe, it said.
The ministry said it had also received “harrowing testimony” from patients and wounded individuals who managed to leave for treatment abroad, reporting restrictive measures and unjustified complications imposed by Israel, further compounding their psychological and physical suffering.
On February 5, the UN Human Rights Office in the occupied Palestinian territory said returnees told it that after crossing, armed Palestinian men supported by the Israeli military took them to an Israeli military checkpoint, where some were handcuffed, blindfolded, searched, threatened and had their belongings confiscated.
In response to the accounts, two Israeli human rights organisations, Adalah and Gisha, called for an end to “a policy of abuse and unlawful restrictions” imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return through Rafah, warning that the measures amount to “forced displacement”.
Deepening humanitarian crisis
The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza warned that continuing the restricted mechanism at Rafah, limiting the number of travelers and slowing medical evacuations threatens the lives of thousands of patients and deepens the humanitarian crisis.
It urged that the crossing be opened permanently and regularly to ensure that patients and wounded individuals can travel without restrictions or delays.
The ministry also called for the urgent evacuation of critical cases and an increase in the number of travelers in line with accumulated medical needs, urging international and humanitarian bodies to intervene to guarantee patients’ right to treatment and travel under international law.
Quasi-official figures also show that 80,000 Palestinians have registered to return to Gaza, underscoring widespread refusal of displacement and insistence on returning despite the destruction.
Before the war, hundreds of Palestinians crossed Rafah daily in both directions under a mechanism managed by Gaza’s Interior Ministry and Egyptian authorities, without Israeli involvement.
Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Israel was supposed to fully reopen the crossing when the truce took effect on October 10, 2025, but it has failed to do so.
The ceasefire ended Israel’s two-year war that began on October 8, 2023.
Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90 percent of civilian infrastructure.
The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 601 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,600 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza.

Starmer vows to enforce crackdown on children’s online activity
- Keir Starmer is vowing to enforce a crackdown on children and teenagers using smartphones to enhance online safety within months.
- Proposed reforms include a minimum age limit for social media, restrictions on “infinite” scrolling, and preventing children from using VPNs for illicit content or interacting with online chatbots.
- Ministers are taking steps to swiftly implement powers and will close a legal loophole to force all AI chatbot providers to comply with the Online Safety Act.
- A government consultation on new social media protections will launch in March, guided by feedback from parents and children.
- The plans also include amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill to ensure chatbots protect users from illegal content and to preserve children's social media data, inspired by Jools' Law.

Taliban will offer aid to Tehran if US strikes Iran, group spokesperson confirms

The Taliban will aid and assist the Islamic Republic of Iran in the event of US strikes on the country, the group's spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid told Radio Iran's Pashto-language service on Sunday.
Afghanistan's people would show sympathy and possibly cooperate with Iran if requested, Mujahid clarified, noting that this would not automatically pull the Sunni group into joining a retaliatory war against the US.
Additionally, the Taliban's message is that they do not want conflict between the US and Iran, and would prefer to pursue diplomatic measures and continued negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.
Further, Iran "won" the 12-day war with Israel and the US in June, Mujahid affirmed, and will "win again" if the US attacks.
Iran will be able to "win again" as it "has the capability, is in the right, and has the right to defend itself," he stated.
The Taliban, at the time, condemned Israel's strikes on the Islamic Regime's nuclear enrichment facilities, military leadership, and other strategic locations.
Iran, Taliban relations remain tense due to Shia-Sunni split
Tensions have existed between the respective Islamic Regimes of Iran and Afghanistan, largely following fault lines splitting Shia and Sunni, with Iran following Twelver Shia and the Taliban following a militant form of Sunnism.
However, the two governments have cooperated since the Taliban reclaimed leadership over the country.
In January 2025, the Taliban's Foreign Minister, Mawlawi Amir Khan Muttaqi, hosted a delegation in Kabul led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to discuss multiple issues, including water resources, Afghan migrants, and security of the shared borders.
Araghchi also met with the head of the Taliban government, Mohammad Hassan Akhund, during his visit.
Nevertheless, Iran has hosted several million Afghan refugees who fled over the past 25 years, particularly since the Taliban regained control in August 2021.
Some of these were accused of being Israeli spies, with Tehran alleging that they aided Mossad in gathering information for the Israeli operations in June.

The IDF killed terrorist Ahmad Bayouk, who filmed himself infiltrating Re'im base as part of the October 7 massacre, during a series of military actions in the Gaza Strip on Sunday, the military confirmed.
Israeli forces attacked terrorists in the northern Gaza Strip, as well as Gaza City in the central region and Khan Yunis in the south.
This flurry of activity is a response to ceasefire violations on Saturday in which several armed Gazans emerged from the rubble of a building about two kilometers east of the Yellow Line, the IDF noted.
The armed group, spotted near an IDF post in Beit Hanun, appeared to have entered the territory in the eastern section of the Gaza Strip via subterranean tunnels, the IDF stated.
The IDF also announced on Sunday that they killed Azem Abu Huli, head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad's Nukhba Array in the central region, during last week's operations in the strip.
The IDF also struck Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in the Majdal Anjar area in central Lebanon - an area which borders neighboring Syria.
Drone smuggling attempt
Meanwhile, IDF Observers and the Aerial Control Center intercepted a drone attempting to smuggle three M-16 rifles into Israel on Friday, the military announced on Saturday.
The drone, which was identified as entering Israeli territory from Egyptian territory, was located by troops and discovered to be carrying rifles.
The weapons were transferred to security forces for processing, the IDF stated.

'Mass obstruction' — Draft officers injured in Odesa following confrontation with 'civilian group'
Multiple enlistment officers were hospitalized after a "group of civilians" allegedly carried out an attack on the personnel in Odesa on Feb. 15, the Odesa Oblast Regional Recruitment Center reported.
The officers were escorting a "violator of military registration" when they were confronted by an unspecified number of civilians that engaged in "aggressive physical pressure" against the officers, the recruitment center said in a Facebook post.
The group of civilians used physical force and deployed tear gas against the servicemen, causing a variety of injuries, including chemical burns to the cornea, against the officers. The attack also damage a military vehicle and cameras.
"Instead of complying with the lawful demands of representatives of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the crowd engaged in mass obstruction of state activities in the field of mobilization preparation," the Odesa Oblast Territorial Recruitment Center said.
Specifics were not provided as to how many officers were injured or the extent of the injuries sustained.
No arrests were reported and the full details of the incident were not immediately clear. The Kyiv Independent cannot immediately verify the details surrounding the incident.
Since the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, incidents targeting recruitment officers and centers have occurred in various parts of Ukraine.
As Ukraine steps up its mobilization efforts, draft offices are often accused, at times justly, of forced conscription without compliance with fundamental civil rights and ill-treatment of conscripts.
Ukraine's Human Rights Ombudsman, Dmytro Lubinets, told parliament on Feb. 9 that he had received 6,127 complaints in 2025 over possible violations committed by enlistment officers. The number of complaints is nearly twice as high as in 2024, when the ombudsman received 3,312 appeals. In 2023, 514 people filed similar complaints, compared with just 18 in 2022.
Moscow has capitalized on controversies surrounding mobilization, often using propaganda to help escalate social tensions in Ukraine and further damage Ukraine's recruitment efforts.
Personnel shortages have dogged Ukraine throughout its fight against Russia. Although Ukraine adopted a major bill reforming the draft in April 2024, mobilization has slowed considerably compared to the early stages of the full-scale invasion.
In the summer of 2025, Russian forces launched several strikes on enlistment offices in the cities of Kryvyi Rih, Poltava, Kremenchuk, Kharkiv, and Zaporizhzhia, damaging infrastructure and causing civilian and military casualties.
These attacks were viewed as an escalation in tactics, aimed at disrupting Ukraine’s mobilization efforts and fueling social unrest.

Intermittent fasting 'no better than doing nothing at all', review finds

Benefits of intermittent fasting 'fail to match the hype', major review finds
In short:
Researchers reviewed 22 studies that looked at the benefits of intermittent fasting.
They found little to no improvement in weight loss for people who were overweight or obese compared with having regular dietary advice or doing nothing at all.
Other experts say intermittent fasting can be hard to study and there may be some benefit, but it may not reduce metabolic health risks or be sustainable in the long term.
Intermittent fasting has become a popular phrase in dieting, promising to boost metabolism, shed body fat, and even help reduce the risk of diabetes, hypertension and obesity.
From the 5:2 diet to the eight-hour feeding window, it has become a hot topic for researchers to study and internet personalities to promote.
But intermittent fasting regimes "fail to match hype" for significant weight loss and reducing health risks in people who are overweight, according to a major review of studies by the Cochrane Collaboration.
Review author and physician Eva Madrid, a professor at the University of Valparaiso, said intermittent fasting was no better than following regular dietary advice — or, in fact, doing nothing at all — for losing weight.
"The key takeaway is that intermittent fasting is not a miracle solution, but it can be one option among several for weight management,"she said.
What is intermittent fasting?
The phrase is an overarching term for cycling periods of normal eating and drinking with times during which little to nothing is consumed.
Fasting is promoted by some wellbeing personalities for its ability to encourage the body into "metabolic switching", where the body relies more heavily on fat stores for energy.
Intermittent fasting is not recommended by health experts for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, people with eating disorders, people with diabetes or children.
"Given that obesity is a major public health challenge, we wanted to assess, rigorously and independently, whether intermittent fasting actually offers meaningful benefits compared with more conventional dietary advice," Professor Madrid said.
The types of fasting looked at in the review included the 5:2 diet, popularised by TV presenter Michael Mosley, which encourages participants to eat their usual calories five days a week, but restricts calorie intake to about 500 calories on the other two days.
Other strategies examined were abstaining from food for 16 hours a day in a method called "time-restricted eating" and fasting on alternate days.
How intermittent fasting studies stack up
The Cochrane team analysed evidence from 22 randomised clinical trials involving 1,995 adults across North America, Europe, China, Australia, and South America.
The review compared the effects of fasting strategies for overweight and obese people with traditional dietary advice that emphasises calorie restriction and eating fruit, vegetables, and whole grains, or with no dietary guidance at all.
According to the analysis, intermittent fasting made little to no difference in weight loss and little to no difference in quality of life compared to the other two approaches.
The authors also raised concerns about the study designs, including how people were randomly assigned to groups and adherence to the diets.
Most studies were also limited to white populations in high-income countries, so results couldn't be extrapolated for other groups.
In addition, most trials included in the review lasted fewer than 12 months, limiting conclusions about the long-term sustainability of intermittent fasting.
The authors recommended that future research include information about participant satisfaction, diabetes status, and long-term loss of lean body mass (weight loss that does not include body fat).
Weight loss doesn't equal other health improvements
Leonie Heilbronn, who leads the Obesity and Metabolism Lab at the University of Adelaide, said intermittent fasting often provided similar outcomes to reducing calorie intake.
"When you do either a fasting diet or a daily reduction in calories, both of them result in about the same amount of body weight loss. So no arguments there," she said.
But she said intermittent fasting had some additional benefits that surpassed simple calorie restriction.
"Having that more prolonged fasting period … increases fat burning and allows more rest-and-repair-type mechanisms to start repairing the body."
However, she thought some methods were less effective than others.
"I think time-restricted eating is a milder intervention than intermittent fasting, in terms of weight loss."
Luigi Fontana, a professor of medicine and nutrition at University of Sydney, said it could be difficult to interpret studies about intermittent fasting, particularly when managing compliance by participants.
Professor Fontana, who studied diets similar to 5:2, said his research showed that people on intermittent fasting did lose some weight, but health risk factors such as blood pressure, glycaemic control and inflammation did not improve.
"Unlike with moderate daily caloric restriction with optimal nutrition, losing weight through intermittent fasting did not automatically translate into broader metabolic benefits," he said.
Diets alone not answer to long-term benefit
All diets, whether they involve calorie restriction or intermittent fasting, may only deliver short-term results, Professor Heilbronn said.
"They are really hard to maintain long-term, and it's not just because you don't have the willpower."
She said changes in hunger, hormones and energy expenditure could conspire to make you regain weight.
"It's your body fighting back."
Loading...Professor Fontana recommended combining dietary interventions with regular exercise for longevity of results.
"Whenever you lose weight with any type of diet, you are lowering your resting metabolic rate and are more prone to regaining weight.
"If you want good results, combine three days per week of resistance exercise like weightlifting and another two or three days a week of endurance.
"Whether that's running, biking, swimming, cycling — whatever will increase your resting heart rate and your respiratory rate."
Ultimately, for someone seeking weight loss, it's about calorie intake and energy output.
"The broader takeaway is that sustainable results come from how consistently a diet can be followed and from the overall nutritional pattern — not from fasting per se,"Professor Fontana said.

Intermittent fasting no better than typical weight loss diets, study finds

Intermittent fasting is no better for shedding the pounds than conventional diets and is barely more effective than doing nothing, according to a major review of the scientific evidence.
Researchers analysed data from 22 global studies and found people who are overweight or living with obesity lost as much weight by following traditional dietary advice as when they tried fasting regimes such as the 5:2 diet popularised by the late Michael Mosley.
The approach was hardly better for weight loss than not dieting at all, the review adds, with people losing only about 3% of their body weight through fasting, far below the 5% that doctors consider clinically meaningful. The studies were all short term, looking at improvements over 12 months at most.
“Intermittent fasting is not a miracle solution, but it can be one option among several for weight management,” said Dr Luis Garegnani, the lead author and director of the Cochrane Associate Centre at the Italian hospital of Buenos Aires in Argentina. “Intermittent fasting likely yields results similar to traditional dietary approaches for weight loss. It doesn’t appear clearly better, but it’s not worse either.”
Intermittent fasting, where people restrict their eating to set hours, or fast on certain days, has soared in popularity amid claims it can help people lose weight, boost their physical and cognitive health and even slow ageing.
The Cochrane review used gold-standard techniques to analyse evidence from randomised clinical trials involving 1,995 adults across Europe, North America, China, Australia and South America. The trials examined different kinds of intermittent fasting, such as fasting every other day, the 5:2 diet where people fast for two days a week, and time-restricted eating.
Beyond the minimal benefits for weight loss, the researchers found no strong evidence that intermittent fasting improved people’s quality of life more than other diets.
Garegnani said it was important to clarify the evidence around fasting diets given their enormous popularity and widespread promotion in the media. Many of the studies are short-term and of poor quality, making it hard to reach firm conclusions on the possible benefits. Surprisingly, none of the 22 studies asked people how satisfied they were with intermittent fasting, Garegnani added.
Dr Zhila Semnani-Azad at the National University of Singapore, said the benefits of intermittent fasting may be affected by timing, since the body’s circadian rhythms are so deeply connected to metabolism. Studies in animals suggest fasting can change how fat reserves are used, improve insulin sensitivity – which is important for diabetes – and reduce inflammation and oxidative stress. It may also be good for ageing and longevity, she said, by triggering a process called autophagy, the body’s recycling mechanism. One problem is that there is no universal definition of intermittent fasting, making it hard to understand its effects, she added.
Maik Pietzner, a professor of health data modelling at the Berlin Institute of Health at Charité, was surprised that weight loss from fasting was so small compared with doing nothing. But he said the finding fits with evidence that people are less physically active when fasting and that weight loss is hard without drugs.
The findings also line up with his own work that shows short periods of complete fasting, even up to two days, has little effect on our bodies and that people need to fast for much longer to see changes that may drive benefits later on. In one of his studies, people consumed only water for seven days, but widespread changes to proteins in their blood only occurred after three days.
“If people feel better on such diet regimens, I wouldn’t stop them, but this work, along with others in the field, clearly shows that there’s no robust evidence for positive effects beyond a possible moderate weight loss,” Pietzner said. “Our bodies have evolved under constant scarcity of food, and can deal really well with prolonged periods without it, but that does not mean that we perform any better once these evolutionary conserved programmes kick in.”

Is this Sydney’s worst speed hump?

Is this Sydney’s worst speed hump?
A speed hump in Sydney’s south-west designed to improve pedestrian safety has confused residents, who think it’s a crossing.
In November last year, Georges River Council installed a speed hump on Belmore Road in Riverwood. But locals began confusing it for a crossing as it’s sandwiched between two bus stops and on the doorstep of several grocery stores.
One local even attempted to prevent people from dangerously crossing the hump by looping wrapping plastic between signage poles at either end.
While the plastic was replaced with orange and yellow mesh sheeting in early January – along with a sign telling pedestrians to use the crossing 60 metres down the road – the hump continues to be used as a crossing.
Residents and workers on the strip told the Herald that the hump has raised safety concerns, particularly since it also sits in front of an NDIS and aged-care facility.
“People think it’s a zebra crossing. It’s a huge risk,” said Saheb Khan, who works at the fruit shop in front of the hump. “Five to 10 people complain about it each day.”
Khan believes the hump should be converted into a crossing after witnessing many pedestrians almost hit by passing vehicles daily.
“It’s poor planning. There wasn’t a speed hump before, and we didn’t have any issues.”
Council received almost $3 million from Transport for NSW to upgrade high-pedestrian areas in Riverwood with more crossings, speed humps and refuge islands – including the speed hump at the corner of Belmore Road and Coleridge Street – as traffic speed dropped to 40km/h.
Permanent fencing for the speed hump has been ordered by the council, who said it will be installed as soon as it arrives.
Mark Coure, NSW opposition spokesman for roads and Riverwood’s state MP, said council’s high-pedestrian planning “could have been done better” and has called for a traffic study to address the suburb’s congestion.
“If you are going to put a speed hump in, you need to have the appropriate safety fencing to ensure that people don’t mistake it for a pedestrian crossing. That’s the nuts and bolts of this,” Coure said.
The council said it investigated whether to convert the speed hump into a crossing or eliminate it but found neither option would benefit the community.
“The speed humps will remain as they help deliver a self-enforcing low-speed environment,” a council spokesperson said.
“This location is not suitable for a zebra crossing because there is an existing signalised pedestrian crossing about 50 metres to the north. Adding a zebra crossing so close would create an extra conflict point between people walking and vehicles and could disrupt traffic flow.”
The council also said it had received one formal complaint and five fix-it requests about the hump being used as a crossing.
Hadi Charbine, a pharmacist on the strip, said the speed hump was installed with good intentions to improve pedestrian safety but had failed.
“It’s in a congested area,” Charbine said. “We have an ageing population with a high multicultural population who don’t speak English. It’s easy for them to mistake it as a crossing.”

Chinese man wins iPhone at company’s party, finds tiles inside box instead, demands apology
Employee keeps unopened ‘iPhone’ box prize until he gets home to show wife; is dumbfounded to find ceramic slabs, chocolates, lollipops inside
A Chinese man experienced an emotional roller coaster as he discovered the latest iPhone model he won at his company’s year-end party turned out to be just tiles.
The man, known as Jiang Jiang, said his firm played the prank by announcing him as the winner of its year-end party’s grand prize, an iPhone 17 Pro Max.
Jiang, from southern China’s Guangdong province, was ecstatic to receive the prize and decided to wait until he got home to open the box and surprise his wife.
According to a video he posted online, the prize came with an authentic-looking iPhone 17 Pro Max box, a shopping bag from the brand and a printed invoice and receipt showing the price of 9,988 yuan (US$1,450).
The company’s head even announced the prize along with the price at the party. Jiang said everyone believed he had won an iPhone.
But when he opened the box at home, he found nothing but two chocolates, three lollipops and some tiles.

WASHINGTON, February 16. /TASS/. The Russian embassy in Ottawa has rejected accusations by the Canadian authorities in connection with statements by European countries about the poisoning of blogger Alexey Navalny (listed as a terrorist and extremist in Russia).
"We categorically reject the allegations made by the Canadian side. They are unfounded and lack any supporting evidence. The Canadian government is engaging in political point-scoring over a person’s death. This is both cynical and immoral," Russian Ambassador to Canada Oleg Stepanov said in a statement released by the embassy's press service.
"Furthermore, the Canadian government has no right to comment on Russia’s internal affairs. Russia does not interfere in Canada’s domestic matters and calls on Canada to adhere to the same principle," the Russian diplomat emphasized.
On February 14, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France released a joint statement. They claimed that Navalny had been poisoned with epibatidine, a toxin found in the skin of an Ecuadorian tree frog. The statement specified that this conclusion was based on the analysis of Navalny's biomaterials. Representatives of the aforementioned countries then accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention.
However, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS that these allegations are misinformation intended to distract from Western countries' pressing problems.

How banned Uber drivers are reinstated, while passenger evidence goes unheard

How banned Uber drivers are reinstated, while passenger evidence goes unheard
Uber drivers accused of sexual harassment and threatening behaviour are being allowed back on the roads through unfair termination cases because the ride-sharing giant is not asking alleged victims to testify about their experiences.
New laws introduced by the Albanese government a year ago allowing gig economy workers to claim unfair dismissal-style protections have triggered a flood of appeals from Uber drivers claiming bans on them were unwarranted, and that the company’s investigation processes were insufficient.
In multiple cases seen by this masthead, the Fair Work Commission has ordered that a driver’s access to Uber must be reinstated largely because the company did not offer first-hand testimony from the passenger who complained.
The $210 billion company argues that letting the predominantly female passengers testify would risk re-traumatising them, but the company’s practices have prompted concerns from anti-sexual harassment and women’s rights advocates.
They say the ride-share giant must do more to investigate complaints so that evidence can be properly tested during appeals, ensuring potentially unsafe drivers don’t get back behind the wheel and threaten passenger safety. The government is looking at how its unfair dismissal code is working with accusations of serious misconduct.
Before the avenue of appeal was introduced, drivers who had their accounts deactivated by Uber found themselves suddenly out of work – sometimes after just one complaint alleging behaviour that they denied – with no avenue for recourse once the company had made its decision.
The worker protections brought in by Labor granted gig economy workers the right to appeal their deactivation from a platform if they believed it was unfair or did not follow due process, and to seek a commission-ordered resolution similar to conventional unfair dismissal rules.
Proponents say the reforms recalibrated the power dynamic in the gig economy away from large companies and towards the contractors they assign jobs to, after years of frustrations among workers who claimed they had never been able to talk to a real person or been granted the opportunity to air their side of the story.
“It’s not unreasonable to expect a review of a decision to essentially sack or suspend a gig worker to be made by a real person, not a robot,” then-employment minister Murray Watt said ahead of the reforms.
Since the laws came into effect last February, dozens of cases appealing Uber deactivations that have been referred to the commission have followed a similar pattern: a customer lodges a brief complaint about a driver, alleging inappropriate behaviour through an in-app chat, Uber then notifies the driver of the claim, the driver denies the claim, and then Uber ultimately deactivates their account, effectively barring them from working.
Some of the drivers then appeal to the commission. Drivers have at various points claimed that racism or discrimination, as well as grumpy or drunk passengers seeking refunds from Uber, are behind false complaints.
Many cases are thrown out because drivers don’t meet the eligibility threshold – for example, they did less than six months’ regular work for Uber, or they lodged their appeal after the 21-day limit had passed.
But drivers that have met the eligibility threshold for their appeals to be considered by the commission have met little resistance from Uber.
In dozens of cases, Uber has reinstated drivers before their cases get to the commission. Michael Kaine, national secretary of the Transport Workers’ Union, said Uber had restored access to 53 workers when his organisation got in contact on their behalf. “They don’t reach a hearing because we call Uber and they just reactivate it.”
When Uber does take cases to the commission, they have often been unsuccessful.
In one case that ended up before the commission in October, a driver was deactivated after a rider complained that he was masturbating, though she claimed she did not see him doing this from the back seat but inferred it from his behaviour. It was the fourth complaint lodged against the driver in his years on Uber; other allegations included sexualised comments and dangerous driving.
When the matter was heard, the driver denied the allegation. “I do touch my hair and beard, my weight is 114kg, due to big tummy I do adjust my seatbelt most of time,” the driver told Uber. “How the hell I know customer is thinking who is sitting behind me.”
Uber “brought no direct evidence from the rider”, Fair Work deputy president Ian Masson’s decision noted, which made the commission’s finding all but inevitable. The deputy president found in the driver’s favour, ordering reinstatement and that $6073 in lost earnings be paid.
Another appeal, heard in January, was lodged by a food delivery driver who Uber banned after two customer complaints. One woman claimed he had offered her $100 to kiss him while withholding her meal outside. The other, occurring the following year, claimed that during a middle-of-the-night delivery, he asked if she was alone, had family nearby and what her Snapchat was.
The driver denied the allegations at the hearing.
Commissioner Damian Sloan found that Uber had “failed to provide any information to enable (the driver) to understand and properly respond to the allegations against him”. An allegation “was never squarely put to him”.
The commission ordered Uber, which had brought a written account from the female customer to the hearing, to reinstate the driver and pay him lost wages.
Uber even lost the very first case under the new rules. It was heard by the commission in September, from an Adelaide driver who was banned after customers complained that he had threatened them with a baseball bat.
The driver, who had achieved a positive rating of 4.99 out of 5 from more than 6000 trips, denied this. He said he had demanded his passengers stop using drugs and leave his vehicle. He claimed they assaulted him as they exited, and the driver immediately reported the incident to police.
Six weeks later, and only after he lodged the appeal, did Uber reactivate his account. He continued to seek remedies through the FWC, which heard the matter and ordered Uber repay lost wages.
“(The driver’s denial) was not challenged in cross-examination, and there is no reason to doubt its reliability,” the full bench decision said.
Uber relied on the initial written complaints from each customer. None provided further evidence for use at the tribunal or appeared at the hearing.
This masthead has decided not to name these drivers, nor does it suggest the allegations against them are true. Rather, these cases are detailed to draw attention to the broader issue of how misconduct allegations are examined under the new laws and Uber’s legal approach. Several further appeals are continuing through the commission.
An Uber spokesman said its “robust case review processes are human-led by a specialist” team, including “outreaching to all parties”. The company cannot compel alleged victims to testify at the commission.
The spokesman said the company, which has not gathered further evidence from complainants in the matters reported, said that since the laws came into effect, it had become concerned about the “evidentiary standards regarding serious misconduct and safety cases” in some of the Fair Work Commission’s decisions.
“We are especially worried by statements made by members of the commission that written or verbal complaints by victims hold ‘no weight’ and that Uber is required to call victim-survivors as witnesses in order for a deactivation to be upheld,” the spokesperson said.
“This runs counter to expert guidance, including by our long-standing partners WESNET, on survivor-centric responses to reports of sexual assault. We will continue to rigorously defend our commitment to a victim-first approach, prioritising safety and protecting the dignity, privacy and wellbeing of those who come forward,” Uber’s spokesperson said.
Transport union boss Kaine said the legal change to give more protections to drivers has been broadly positive. In an interview, he acknowledged that “genuine driver misconduct is of course out there”, but he said such problems plagued many sectors.
Only a small minority of drivers engage in serious misconduct, Kaine said, while deactivations stemming from false complaints continue to be a large problem. But, having represented several drivers, Kaine said there were stark flaws in Uber’s approach.
“They know the systems they put in place are totally inconsistent with providing the package of evidence they need to satisfy a tribunal,” he said.
Tara Hunter, director of clinical and client services at sexual violence prevention advocate Full Stop Australia, said that fears of sexual harassment, assault and violence were common among women using ride-share apps.
Hunter noted that reporting rates for sexual assault are below actual occurrences because “people often don’t feel safe to come forward”, but said she wanted to see Uber and other ride-share companies have strong complaints processes.
She said this was especially true where drivers banned for serious allegations are being reinstated due to a lack of evidence.
”Unless Uber sets up systems that are proactive and trauma-informed to meaningfully gather complaints and do something with those complaints, it will be hard to gather evidence for a fair hearing,” Hunter said.
Observers said Uber’s decision not to ask victims to provide live testimony at unfair terminations hearings to avoid re-traumatising them also fits in with its broader legal strategy.
The company has long argued in a range of legal contexts, from wage deals to working conditions, driver misbehaviour to refusals to accept assistance pets, that its drivers are contractors, not employees. It has mostly succeeded.
In general, contractors get much more flexibility than employees, such as choosing when to work and offering their services to multiple companies, but they receive very few legal protections, making them cheaper to use.
Uber also maintains that it is not a transport services company, but rather a technology company that provides users with a smartphone application that matches riders with independent contractor drivers and facilitates payments.
“This is a company that never wanted to play the game of regulation, that wanted to bend the rules to suit it,” says Dr Michael Rawling, an associate professor of law at the University of Technology Sydney who has authored a book on regulating gig economy work.
Rawling says that “it looks as though Uber is completely unfamiliar with what’s required of them under the deactivation code”. “They’re not doing their due diligence on complaints, it could be because they don’t want to be subject to this regulation or that they also don’t want to generate the internal processes required to do it properly.”
Uber employed 507 staff in Australia at the end of 2024, its most recent documents lodged with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission show, a number dwarfed by the roughly 150,000 active riders and drivers on its apps.
Rawling said: “They’re trying to minimise back office workforce, so it can be an attractive thing for Uber if the commission does this work for them.”
Alex Veen, professor of employment relations at the University of Sydney’s business school, said the fact that Uber’s behaviour at the FWC was so consistent suggested the company had a deliberate strategy that could be based in part on weighing up the cost of fighting cases against losing them.
While traditional unfair dismissal appeals can lead to compensation payments, the deactivation appeals for gig economy workers only allow for lost wages.
“It could be a deliberate strategy, a case that it’s not worthwhile defending the matter,” Veen said, noting an order in one case for $6000 in lost pay pales in comparison with a salary for just one full-time employee to bolster its complaint investigation team.
However, Veen cautioned that a company would be unwise to make such decisions solely on cost. “There is significant reputational risk for an organisation if they don’t deal with such complaints properly,” Veen said.
In response to questions sent to Employment Minister Amanda Rishworth, a spokesperson for the government said it was “carefully considering these matters, including how the deactivation code enables platforms to address serious accusations of this nature”.
“Everyone should be safe while catching an Uber or utilising Uber’s services,” they said.

Trump is lying about who is really paying for his war on the world

Opinion
Trump is lying about who is really paying for his war on the world
The Trump administration is reportedly considering changes that would lower the effective rate of tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium. Why would it alter the tariffs if they are being paid for by the exporting countries?
The tariffs of steel and aluminium were among the first that Donald Trump announced, virtually the moment he regained office last year. Initially, the rate was 25 per cent, but within months it was raised to 50 per cent.
The tariffs applied, not just to raw steel and aluminium, but to “derivative” products – the foreign metal content in any imported product – which meant it applied to a percentage of the imported prices of a wide range of consumer goods, including washing machines, ovens, pipes, chains, mattresses, tins used for baking, food and drink cans and bicycles.
Not surprisingly, importers have been complaining about the complexity of the calculations required. Also, as was the case last year when Trump exempted a range of food imports from pre-existing tariffs, the administration has been showing an increased sensitivity to the impact of its tariffs on consumer prices as this year’s midterm elections draw closer.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed that the administration was considering a “clarification” of the tariffs last Friday, but didn’t expand on that comment.
The steel and aluminium tariffs were imposed under a different and less vulnerable legislative authority than the “reciprocal” tariffs that are being challenged within the US Supreme Court, so any lowering of them would tend to point to heightened concerns about affordability issues. The metals tariffs are insidious, feeding into an extraordinarily wide range of imported goods prices.
While the inclusion of the metals downstream usage does make administration of the tariffs more complex, it wouldn’t be as pressing an issue if it were exporters shouldering the tariffs’ costs and generating the massive revenues Trump continually boasts about.
Despite Trump’s and Bessent’s continuing assertions that the exporters do pay the tariffs (Bessent now says he was mistaken when, before joining the administration, he said tariffs were inflationary) and despite it being an article of faith among the MAGA faithful that it is the case, a series of studies – two of them last week – have contradicted that stance.
The first was a study last month by Germany’s Kiel Institute which, after analysing more than 25 million shipment records covering about $US4 trillion ($5.7 trillion) of imports, concluded that foreign exporters absorbed only about 4 per cent of the tariffs’ costs. It said that trade volumes collapsed as exporters redirected their sales to other markets, but the prices charged by the exporters didn’t fall.
Then, last week, New York Fed economists produced their own analysis, which found that – after Trump (who always chickens out) walked back many of the tariffs he announced on “Liberation Day” last April and exempted some products – the average US rate had increased from 2.6 per cent to 13 per cent at the end of last year.
The analysis of the pass-through of the tariffs concluded, like the Kiel Institute’s, that the bulk of the tariff incidence continued to fall on US companies and consumers.
For the first eight months of the year about 94 per cent of their cost was incurred by US importers, although it said that in the final months of the year that had reduced to 86 per cent.
That might suggest that US importers have renegotiated prices with their suppliers and/or reorganised their supply chains.
It has been notable that exports to the US from China have fallen markedly, but those from Mexico and Vietnam, with lower tariffs, have risen sharply. There may be a significant amount of transshipment, or the re-routing of Chinese products through other jurisdictions, occurring.
The Fed said, given that the average tariff rate in December was 13 per cent, its results implied that import prices for goods covered by the tariffs increased by 11 per cent more than for those goods not subject to the tariffs.
Also last week, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) opined on the “higher and frequently changing” tariffs put in place last year, saying they would temporarily raise the US inflation rate, reduce real investment, lower the level of real GDP and reduce employment, relative to what would have occurred without them.
It said higher tariffs would directly increase the cost of imported goods and, because many imports are inputs to domestic production (like steel and aluminium), would also indirectly raise costs. American businesses that produced goods that competed with imports would also increase their prices because of the reduced competition.
The CBO’s assessment was that US businesses would absorb 30 per cent of the import price increases by reducing their profit margins, with the other 70 per cent passed through to consumers via increased prices.
Price increases from domestic businesses protected from import competition would fully offset the 30 per cent of price increased absorbed by importing companies, so the net effect of the tariffs, it said, was to raise US consumer prices by 100 per cent of the costs of the tariffs borne domestically, which it estimated to be 95 per cent of their cost.
Those three analyses from authoritative sources, all with similar conclusions, ought to put to bed the debate over who pays for the tariffs.
What they don’t do is explain why, if almost all their cost is ultimately being borne by US consumers, there hasn’t been a more marked impact on the US inflation rate.
Last week’s CPI was surprisingly benign, with the headline number coming in below expectations at 2.4 per cent. In December, headline inflation was 2.7 per cent.
While the core inflation number preferred by the Federal Reserve Board – the personal consumption expenditures index – has been stuck at 3 per cent, the official inflation rate does appear to be subsiding.
Three analyses from authoritative sources, all with similar conclusions, ought to put to bed the debate over who pays for the tariffs.
It might, of course, have been even lower had the tariffs not be raised last year, given that the rate was falling steadily even before Trump retook the White House. Most economists believe the impact of the tariffs on inflation would be – and may well have been – close to a percentage point.
It’s also possible that there is some “noise” in the way the rate has been calculated, given that there are two months of data missing because of last year’s US government shutdown, and also because of the way health insurance costs, which are surging at more than twice the inflation rate, are calculated.
For the inflation data, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the retained earnings of health insurers, rather than the premiums paid by consumers, to calculate health insurances’ contribution to the CPI.
Conventionally, countries that raise their tariffs rate experience an appreciation in their currency, which helps blunt the effects on domestic prices by making imports cheaper. That hasn’t happened – the US dollar has fallen 11.4 per cent against the currencies of its major trading partners since Trump’s inauguration – so the full effect of the tariffs should have shown up in the inflation data.
In some respects it has, as goods and food inflation rates are higher than the overall numbers. But the relatively modest exposure of the US to imports – its proportion of global imports is in the low double digits – and Trump’s repeated walking back of his announced rates, the absorption of much of the initial price impacts through a pre-tariffs build up of US companies’ inventories and, perhaps, a lower pre-tariff underlying rate of inflation might explain why they haven’t (yet?) been more visible within the CPI data.

Two-bedder cracks $1 million as Nundah property market comes of age

Two-bedder cracks $1 million as Nundah property market comes of age
By Sarah Webb
When the price hit $1 million, the crowd laughed.
Not because it was cheap – but because even in Brisbane’s red-hot market, no one quite believed a two-bedder in Nundah had just crossed that line.
A couple of minutes later, just $3000 on, the hammer fell and the laughter turned to cheers – leaving six battered bidders who’d slugged it out for a two-bedroom Nundah unit close to shell-shocked.
The reaction was justified. It’s one of the highest prices ever paid for a two-bedroom pad in a suburb where only a handful of units have cracked seven figures. Less than 10 years ago the apartment sold for about half that – and five years ago Nundah’s median unit price was $385,000.
Today, it’s $715,000 – up 19 per cent in the past 12 months, according to Domain’s latest House Price Report.
And at the Friday auction of 603/1 York Street, Nundah, the seven-figure sale price cemented just how far the former bridesmaid suburb has come.
“I think the crowd was in disbelief when the price hit $1 million,” said Ray White New Farm’s Simon Petrie.
“People started laughing … they didn’t expect it to go over $850,000.
“But while Nundah might not be as flashy as your New Farms and Teneriffes, it’s a genuine lifestyle suburb with a village feel. And people clearly love that.”
Sold on Friday as part of Ray White Collective’s two-day auction event, the home attracted seven registered bidders, spanning first home buyers to downsizers.
Bidding opening at $700,000 and rose in $25,000 bids to $850,000 and was called on the market at $880,000 – just over the reserve.
Three bidders pushed up the price in largely $1000 rises until a “mature investor” buying a city base nabbed the keys.
“It went beyond our expectations,” Petrie said.
“But buyers just loved the positioning and natural light and the fact that the Toombul cricket field is just across the road and the floor plan felt homely.”
Petrie said Nundah’s coming of age had long been brewing.
“I broke the Nundah townhouse record back in 2023 for a sale over $1 million and back then we thought this is an area you have to be aware of,” he said.
While the Nundah unit was far from being Brisbane’s top sale - that title went to 19 Wordsworth Street, Bulimba, which fetched $5.5 million – Ray White Collective principal Haesley Cush said apartments were the surprise packets of the weekend.
“I believe we’ll see more and more plus $1 million sales like this. The fact that there was a buyer within $1000 of the final amount tells the buyer the price he paid has been validated,” said Cush.
“And that’s the benchmark.
“First home buyers are really hotting the market up it’s lifted that market.”
The home was among 149 scheduled auctions across South East Queensland. By Saturday evening, Domain recorded a preliminary clearance rate of 54.5 per cent from 99 reported results, with 14 homes withdrawn.
In Coorparoo, a land-banking parent paid $1.155 million for a two-bedroom cottage on 405 square metres at 7 Riddings Street - outmuscling nine active bidders in front of a chocolate-and-champagne Valentine’s Day crowd.
Bidding opened at $900,000 and climbed in quick $20,000 rises to $1 million before two parties pushed it to $1.155 million, just over reserve. The underbidder was an investor.
“It was a pretty crazy auction … the investor who bought it was earmarking it for their young child and that’s what more people are doing now. They’re buying for their toddlers,” said Joanna Gianniotis, of Place Camp Hill.
The vendors bought the property in 2010 for $475,000.
At 57 Bellata Street, The Gap, a buyer burst into tears when her final bid of $2.11 million secured a four-bedroom home backing onto Mount Coot-tha Reserve – setting a street record.
Bidding for the home, which sits on a 607 square metre block, started at $1.5 million, with five local punters trading $100,000, $50,000 and $10,000 bids.
“The reaction of the buyer was just beautiful. She cried and her husband was on a plane heading overseas as the hammer came down but she managed to tell him got it,” said Jessie Hall, of Ray White Wilston.
“She just knew it was the one and she could imagine living there with her tweens.”
The vendors, who paid $925,000 in 2019 and renovated the kitchen, bathroom and laundry, were downsizing.
“I showed just over 120 groups through this home and that’s because it’s on the border of Ashgrove, but you get a lot for your money here than just down the road,” she said.
LJ Hooker head of research and economics Matthew Tiller said the year had started solidly, with listings lifting.
“The rate rise hasn’t affected sales volumes but what we are now seeing is a little bit of a slowdown in the speed at which new buyers are moving because they’ve had to go back and readjust financing,” he said.
“But in saying that, it’s still very active. We’ve seen a fair bit of appraisal activity come through and that might be because vendors are deciding to list now in case there’s another rate rise and a market slowdown.
“It’s still going to be a pretty healthy year for Brisbane and South East Queensland because we’ll see more listings but I don’t think buying activity will drop off.”

Hundreds of Malaysians rally to demand arrest of anti-corruption head: ‘enough is enough’
The protest against Azam is the biggest since Malaysians rallied in October to demand government action against Israel over the Gaza war
The crowd of mainly young people waved black flags and placards as they assembled outside a shopping centre in the heart of Kuala Lumpur, with a major road temporarily shut to accommodate the demonstration.
“We are gathering because the dignity of the law has been toyed with, and the country’s dignity has been trampled on,” opposition politician Amira Aisya Abdul Aziz told the cheering protesters.
“Enough is enough, Malaysia’s youth, Malaysia’s citizens, won’t sit quiet and close their eyes, nor will they stop demanding Azam Baki be arrested.”
The event marked the biggest street protest since Malaysians rallied in October to demand the government take action against Israel over its actions in Gaza, and is the second demonstration against Azam since 2022.

Why Coles' Down Down promo is facing court for allegedly misleading customers
Unknown

09:53:46 KST

The first day of a landmark federal court case testing whether Coles deceived customers with "illusory" discounts on 245 products has ended, with the consumer watchdog arguing that Coles' previously given justification is irrelevant to its case.
The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) alleges that Coles' Down Down campaign misled customers about the pricing of 245 products between February 2022 and May 2023.
Coles, which faces significant fines if it loses the case, has strongly denied the claims, arguing inflationary pressures drove initial price spikes before products were discounted.
Speaking in court today, ACCC barrister Garry Rich said that argument was irrelevant because the "consumer doesn't know anything about that commercial justification".
"They're just told the price of this product is down. And we say that's not fair dinkum," he said.
'The case of the century'
The ACCC launched the case in September 2024, alongside a separate proceeding against Woolworths, alleging that both had violated consumer law by misleading shoppers on hundreds of popular supermarket items with their Down Down and Prices Dropped campaigns.
The watchdog alleged that both supermarket giants increased the prices of hundreds of products before dropping them to prices that were lower than the inflated prices but still higher than the regular price that applied before the price spike.
When announcing the lawsuit, the ACCC said Woolworths and Coles had sold tens of millions of the allegedly misleadingly discounted goods and derived "significant revenue" from these sales.
Speaking to SBS News on Monday, former ACCC chair Allan Fels said the lawsuit was "the case of the century".
"It affects millions of Australian consumers and households in hundreds of stores around Australia," he said.
Rich said in court on Monday that Coles' Down Down campaign was implemented in 2010 and had since been promoted widely and regularly across various channels, including print catalogues, social media and television and a "jingle that sticks in one's ear longer than is healthy".
Its widespread use was "proof of its commercial effectiveness", he said.
Consumer protection law expert Jeannie Marie Paterson told SBS News that what the ACCC was arguing was essentially: "When we're thinking about what's misleading, we need to take into account the expectation that has been created in consumers by a long, ongoing marketing campaign."
"Coles, on the other hand, will effectively be arguing that, well, it's a supermarket, it's entitled to increase prices," she said.
"In fact, it will say it has held prices on the particular products down for a long period of time to look after consumers, and at some point it had to raise the prices, and it did raise the prices, and subsequently it discounted them."
Among the 245 products related to the ACCC's case against Coles are Arnott's Shapes biscuits, Band-Aids, Cadbury chocolates, Colgate toothpaste, Danone yoghurt, Dettol multi-purpose wipes, Fab laundry liquid, Kellogg's snack bars, Kleenex tissues, Maggi two-minute noodles, Palmolive shampoo, Sakata rice crackers, Sanitarium Weet-Bix cereal, Strepsils lozenges, and Whiskas cat food.
During Monday's hearing, Rich cited the example of Rexona antiperspirant deodorant.
He said it was offered for $5 between March 2021 and April 2022, before increasing to $6.50 for around 30 days. It was then lowered to $6 and promoted under the Down Down promotional campaign for almost a year, with campaign material highlighting a 50-cent discount.
Coles rejects allegations, cites inflationary pressures
ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said in September 2024 that the discounts were not only "illusory" but pre-planned.
"We also allege that in many cases both Woolworths and Coles had already planned to later place the products on a Prices Dropped or Down Down promotion before the price spike, and implemented the temporary price spike for the purpose of establishing a higher 'was' price," Cass-Gottlieb said.
Those claims were echoed by Rich on Monday: "Nobody ever intended to charge full price for these products, beyond the spike ... this is planned, and the only reason the spike happens is because, in the lingo, they need to establish a higher price. It's the only reason."
In a statement released at the time, Coles said the initial price rises occurred because "Coles was receiving a large number of cost price increases from our suppliers and, in addition, Coles' own costs were rising, which led to an increase in the retail price of many products".
"Coles sought to strike an appropriate balance between managing the impact of cost price increases on retail prices and offering value to customers through the recommencement of promotional activity as soon as possible after the establishment of the new non-promotional price," Coles company secretary Daniella Pereira said in a statement.
Woolworths also rejected the allegations, with a spokesperson saying at the time that "the suggestion is that Woolworths initiated temporary price spikes and that's not correct factually".
Rich told the court that the ACCC rejected the notion that inflationary pressures justified Coles' promotional strategies.
"It doesn't matter whether there's a proper commercial justification for the price spike that occurred in the middle [of a price increase and subsequent decrease], because the consumer doesn't know anything about that commercial justification.
"They're just told the price of this product is down. And we say that's not fair dinkum. We say that's a half-truth apt to mislead consumers."
Fels told SBS News he shared that sentiment: "Quite possibly the price increases were genuinely needed to cover inflation, but that is not a defence to allegations that consumers were misled and deceived."
Possible penalties and reputational risk
Both Fels and Paterson suggested the outcome of the case — through which the ACCC is seeking a declaration of wrongdoing by Coles and financial penalties — would have wide-ranging consequences.
Fels said: "For Coles it's a huge reputation issue, also potentially fines in the hundreds of millions ... and there is high-level executive involvement, possible board involvement, so nothing could be more important for Coles."
"And for other businesses, it's also important to get an understanding of the difference between a fake discount and real one."
Paterson said that, should the ACCC's case be upheld, it would have economy-wide impacts on fair and transparent pricing practices, which she said was particularly important amid the ongoing cost-of-living crisis.
While the precise amount Coles could be fined remains unclear, fines previously levied on corporations found to have misled customers can be significant.
In September 2025, the Federal Court ordered Optus to pay a $100 million fine after the ACCC launched a case over sales tactics targeting hundreds of vulnerable customers, including First Nations Australians.
A year earlier, Qantas was slapped with a $100 million penalty for selling tickets for flights it had already decided to cancel.
The Coles Group reported a net profit after tax of over $1 billion for the 2024-2025 financial year, meaning that a fine similar to that levied on Qantas or Optus would take a roughly 10 per cent chunk out of the company's annual profits.
Fels said: "I would expect, if the allegations are upheld, a very hefty fine — much more than $150 million."
Paterson said that, if Coles was found to be liable for the alleged wrongdoing, it would face a penalty of at least $50 million. However, she stressed there were too many factors that a judge would have to consider to meaningfully predict the size of such a fine.
"The penalties are in principle extremely large, but my comment would be that the federal court rarely imposes a maximum penalty, but it still can impose quite significant penalties," she added.

Starmer under fire over Labour think tank probe into journalists
- Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is facing pressure to launch an inquiry into Labour Together, a think tank that helped him become party leader, over its reported investigation into journalists.
- The think tank allegedly paid PR consultancy Apco £36,000 in 2023 for a report that contained "deeply personal and false claims" about journalist Gabriel Pogrund, including his Jewish background.
- Government minister Josh Simons commissioned the 2023 report, which was informally shared with Labour figures, including cabinet ministers, in 2024.
- The Conservative Party has urged Labour to investigate Mr Simons's role and that of other Labour Together directors, calling for the party to suspend all engagement with the think tank.
- Senior Labour figures, including former chancellor John McDonnell and MP Karl Turner, have also called for an independent inquiry into the affair, with Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty supporting a probe.

Like Trump, US embassies are raising cash for lavish July Fourth parties

Like Trump, US embassies are raising cash for lavish Fourth of July parties

SINGAPORE – From his desk at the White House in December, US President Donald Trump announced a campaign to organise a series of Fourth of July celebrations for America’s 250th birthday, saying it would be “the most spectacular birthday party the world has ever seen”.
On the other side of the world, embassies and consulates are echoing the President’s message and pitching executives to hand over large donations for splashy events.
In Hong Kong, companies have received America 250 forms from the US Consulate soliciting donations.
In Japan, companies have heeded the call and committed to tens of millions of dollars in contributions.
In Singapore, the US ambassador pressed for donations before a room full of executives at a dinner at one of the city-state’s most expensive hotels.
The solicitations from the diplomatic outposts come as the President’s allies are aggressively raising money for a host of events and projects around the 250th anniversary of US independence.
“I think there is a competitive environment between some of the ambassadors right now of who can raise the most,” said Mr Ted Osius, a former long-time diplomat who served as US ambassador to Vietnam from 2014 to 2017.
On Feb 5, over a five-course meal at the Capella Singapore, Dr Anjani Sinha, the US ambassador to Singapore
He said the funds would be for a series of celebratory events, including an American rodeo and a Rockefeller Christmas tree lighting.
The dinner was hosted by Dr Sinha and promoted to attendees as an opportunity for him to “share his vision and welcome your partnership in” events to mark the 250th anniversary, according to a copy of the invitation reviewed by the Times.
Dozens of executives from American companies, including Citibank, Coinbase, Harley-Davidson and 3M, attended.
The Capella Singapore hotel
Citibank declined to comment, while Coinbase, Harley-Davidson and 3M did not respond to requests for comment.
Dr Sinha told the audience that another US embassy in the region had already raised US$37 million (S$46.7 million) and pressed the room to raise more, according to the recording of his remarks.
He did not name the country, nor did he say how much his embassy had raised.
But one person familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity in discussing non-public information, said that the embassy in Japan had raised about US$35 million.
The ambassador tried to appeal to the competitive instincts of the local executives in the room.
“Singapore is a better country than that,” he said, according to the recording. He added: “There are better people here making more money.”
Dr Sinha, who made a US$1 million donation to a Trump-backed super political action committee in 2025, was among several future ambassadors who contributed to Mr Trump’s favoured groups and causes during his presidency.
Details about the dinner were also confirmed by two people who were in attendance but requested anonymity because Dr Sinha told attendees not to take pictures or make recordings of the private event.
The US embassy in Japan in January announced that, in celebration of America’s 250th anniversary, it would stage more than 70 “cultural, educational, and sporting programmes and events”, including snow and ice sculptures during a Snow Festival on the northern island of Hokkaido.
The mission’s publicly announced donor list features more than 20 American and Japanese corporate sponsors, led by Toyota Motor and SoftBank Group, both of which have worked to build close ties to the Trump administration.
Some companies had given around US$1 million or more in donations, according to the person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss non-public information.
The announcement bore the logo of a non-profit group, America250, which was created in 2016 and is raising private money to commemorate the anniversary of the nation’s independence.
America250 did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier, in a letter sent to prospective donors, Mr George Glass, the US ambassador to Japan, wrote that he was seeking “significant financial support for Mission Japan’s America 250 celebrations”, according to a copy of the correspondence viewed by the Times.
“President Trump has tasked me with ensuring this celebration in Japan is the greatest celebration in the world outside of the United States,” Mr Glass wrote.
There is a long history of US embassies raising private funds to supplement their Fourth of July celebrations, though donations have typically been relatively modest.
The fund raising heading into the 250th anniversary of the country’s independence has been particularly aggressive.
Asked for comment, the US embassies in Singapore and Japan, as well as the Hong Kong and Macau Consulate pointed to the State Department.
In a statement, a senior State Department official said the department had set policies that “cover fund raising and accepting donations” for celebrating the anniversary.
The donations, the official said, would be used for multiple events and programmes.
During the Feb 5 dinner in Singapore, photos of the event seen by the Times show, several screens around the room displayed the logo for Freedom 250, a group started by Mr Trump’s allies to carry out celebrations and projects that, in some cases, have less obvious connections to the nation’s founding and instead reflect Mr Trump’s political agenda and his penchant for spectacle, personal branding and legacy.
They include the construction of an arch overlooking Washington, an IndyCar race through the nation’s capital, a national prayer event and a UFC match on the White House lawn to coincide with the President’s 80th birthday.
Donors who give US$1 million or more to Freedom 250 are being offered access to the President and other perks.
And because the group is housed inside a non-profit group, donations are tax deductible for US companies and individuals.
Ms Danielle Alvarez, a spokeswoman for Freedom 250, said that the group was not involved in the Singapore dinner, and that funds raised in connection with it will not be conveyed to Freedom 250.
The group, she said, is not soliciting or accepting foreign funding.
She said the Freedom 250 name and logo had been embraced across the administration, and suggested that embassies might be using it as shorthand for their own semiquincentennial initiatives that are not directly related to the group.
The Singapore dinner was sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore, Philip Morris and the Milken Institute, according to Dr Hsien-Hsien Lei, chief executive of the chamber.
The Milken Institute is a non-profit think tank founded by financier Michael Milken, who went to prison in 1991 for securities law and other violations and was pardoned by Mr Trump.
Ms Michelle Stevenson, a spokeswoman for the Milken Institute, said that it paid US$5,000 directly to the Capella Singapore to sponsor the dinner, but that the organisation was not planning to donate to Freedom 250 or America 250.
Philip Morris did not respond to a request for comment.
After the dinner in Singapore, the embassy followed up with a brief document, bearing the Freedom 250 logo and reviewed by the Times, thanking attendees for their potential contributions that would fund a series of “marquee events designed to resonate with the Singaporean public”.
Those events included a rodeo, a gift to the Singapore zoo and an American musical act.
It said the embassy hoped to hear back about financial support by March 5.
Dr Lei, the head of the chamber in Singapore, said in a statement: “The American business community is proud to be a part of the Fourth of July celebrations in Singapore because it is a wonderful way to show Singapore and Singaporeans the best of America.”
She added that the celebrations coincided with the commemoration of 60 years of US-Singapore diplomatic relations.
The embassies’ aggressive push has been met with shock from some executives, who have been on the receiving end of the solicitations, and spoke on background about their reactions.
Experts said the scope of the campaign is unusual.
“I wonder if that is helpful for the image of the United States, given that it feels like you may be buying access,” Mr Osius said. “We certainly avoided in the past any hint that we might be treating people differently based on how much money they contributed.”
Mr Osius said during his tenure as the top envoy in Vietnam, he had been involved in raising no more than tens of thousands of dollars for Fourth of July events.
Mr Blair Hall, a retired State Department official who served in Japan, India and Singapore over a decades-long career, said the magnitude of the fund raising was well out of step with his experience in government.
He said the most he had raised for Fourth of July events was around US$200,000.
“This seems aberrant given the American emphasis, in the past, has been on trying to have ethical business practices and the perception that the government is not open for sale or influence. This does erode that perception.” NYTIMES

Europe tells Trump: You have it wrong on our ‘decline’

Europe tells Trump: You have it wrong on our ‘decline’
London: The European Union has hit back at the Trump administration for predicting the “civilisational erasure” of the continent from social and economic change, highlighting a rift on security after disputes over Greenland and Ukraine.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas dismissed the American claim and outlined plans for more partnerships to bolster defence, including a looming pact with Australia.
“Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilisational erasure,” Kallas told a major security summit in Munich.
“In fact, people still want to join our club.”
The remarks came one day after US Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a reassuring message to the same summit about the need for the US and Europe to work together, but her comments confirmed a stark disagreement with the US on strategy.
US President Donald Trump complained in December that European leaders were too “weak”, and his administration’s national security strategy warned that European economies were not growing enough.
“This economic decline is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure,” the US strategy document said.
Rubio appeared to acknowledge that America faced some of the same threats as Europe, as he called for the two sides to co-operate on a “sane” foreign policy.
“It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilisational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike,” he said.
“So in a time of headlines heralding the end of the trans-Atlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish – because for us Americans, our home may be in the western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
Europe hits back at MAGA
Rubio’s remarks contrasted with a strong criticism of Europe from US Vice President JD Vance at the same summit one year ago.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, a social and economic conservative, rejected the agenda pursued by Trump’s support base and declared on Friday: “The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours.”
French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe needed to become a stronger “geopolitical power” in its own right, and he and Merz aired plans to share a nuclear deterrent to counter rivals such as Russia.
Europe relies heavily on US weapon suppliers, and cannot replace the 85,000 US troops on European soil under the NATO pact. Germany, France and other European nations are struggling to recruit enough young people to reach their targets to expand their defence forces.
Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are due to continue talks about a ceasefire in Ukraine at meetings in Geneva on Tuesday, but there is growing frustration among EU leaders at the way they have been shut out of the talks.
“We are now paying for this war. The American outlay for the war last year was zero. We are buying American weapons to deliver to Ukraine,” Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said at the conference.
“There is no package in the US Congress, and there isn’t even the prospect of a package.
“If we are paying, if this is affecting our security, not just Ukraine’s, then we deserve a seat at the table.”
Kallas used her address to argue for a tougher line in the negotiations because of the risk that Russian President Vladimir Putin would gain concessions from the US that he could not gain on the battlefield.
“Russia is no superpower. After more than a decade of conflict, including four years of full-scale war in Ukraine, Russia has barely advanced beyond the 2014 lines. The cost? 1.2 million casualties,” she said.
“Today, Russia is broken, its economy in shreds, it is disconnected from the European energy markets and its own citizens are fleeing.
“In fact, the greatest threat Russia presents right now is that it gains more at the negotiation table than it has achieved on the battlefield.
“And on the topic of negotiations, what matters more than having a seat at the table is knowing what to ask when you are sitting there.
“And how I see it is simple: Russia’s maximalist demands cannot be met with a minimalist response.”
Rubio mentioned Ukraine once in his address to the summit, offering no notable support for its sovereignty, though he expressed hope for peace when asked in a question-and-answer session.
“What we can’t answer – but we’re going to continue to test – is whether there is an outcome that Ukraine can live with and that Russia will accept,” he said.
Also attending the Munich summit was one of Trump’s most acerbic Democrat critics, Californian Governor Gavin Newsom, who called on European leaders to stand up to the US president.
“I hope, if there’s nothing else I can communicate today: Donald Trump is temporary. He’ll be gone in three years,” Newsom said.
Kallas, who is a vice president of the European Commission and was previously the prime minister of Estonia, signalled that a defence agreement with Australia was imminent.
“On top of trade, we are creating partnerships on security and defence – 10 so far, including India and Australia this year alone,” she said.
The EU defence partnership with Australia is expected to be announced alongside a trade agreement discussed in Brussels last week.

‘One of the best spots in Clovelly’: Six families fight for $10.4m home

A five-bedroom, beachside home with direct access to Clovelly beach sold for $10,425,000 at auction on Saturday, with the entire proceeds, including any agent commission donated to The Smith Family.
The generously sized deceased estate at 9 Surfside Avenue sold under the hammer above its $9 million reserve. Channel Nine news cameras were filming the charity auction as six local families fiercely fought for the upsizing opportunity before a crowd of 80 people. Nine owns this masthead.
It was the wishes of the deceased owner, cardiovascular physician, researcher and scientist Karen Duggan, that the proceeds go to charity, so the residence was given to The Smith Family, who sold it at auction. The home was most recently in the name of executor Russell Graves and was transferred to The Smith Family without monetary consideration before being auctioned, records show.
Duggan was an associate professor of medicine at the University of NSW from 1995 to 2008 and co-founded Vectus Biosystems, where she was medical and scientific director, focusing on treatments for fibrosis and high blood pressure. She was born in the Surfside Avenue home and her parents owned it before her.
The donation will support more than 1000 students for five years each.
The price guide was $7.75 million. There is no legal requirement for a vendor’s reserve to be in line with their property’s price guide.
Bidding opened at $8.2 million and rose in $100,000 increments for the majority of the way, with a few $25,000 bids in between.
Selling agent Alexander Phillips from PPD said: “They just loved the position being on the beach. And they just came across the sign. Well, that’s how they found it – going down to the beach one day.
“This is under 800 square metres of land, the position right on the beach, like, it’s an amazing spot where it is. It’s one of the best spots in Clovelly.”
Phillips said that while the market is “a bit patchy … it’s almost like a recession-proof property” due to its location.
The buyer is from Queens Park.
The property was one of 1009 scheduled auctions in Sydney last week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 69.8 per cent from 649 reported results, while 127 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
Elsewhere, a five-bedroom, deceased estate that had grass growing on the roof, and a swamp-like swimming pool of rainwater, sold under the hammer for $5.58 million, which was $480,000 above its $5.1 million reserve.
Twelve parties registered for the “very run down” Strathfield property at 9 Birnam Grove, guided at $4.6 million.
Bidding opened at $4.5 million, and six parties actively increased the pace in $100,000 and $50,000 increments before slowing to $20,000 and $10,000 bids. Most were developers, along with some owner-occupiers looking to knock it down and rebuild.
Selling agent Jerrie Harris from McGrath Strathfield said: “I think twenty grand, just shy of $5.6 [million] ... is insane for just a piece of land.”
“The home was uninhabitable. There’s grass on the roof,” he said, adding: “It’s been vacant and empty for a while, so I think all the water that’s inside [the swimming pool] now is rainwater.
“The reason why it sold for such an amazing price is just because of the land value. It’s one of the highest points in Strathfield.” Based on previous tri-level sales on the street and the land value, Harris said a luxury build could fetch $12 million to $13 million.
The buyer is a developer from Strathfield who plans to build a trophy home.
In Northbridge, a two-bedroom apartment with no parking was guided at $1 million. The freshly painted unit was one of four flats within the apartment building at 3/270 Sailors Bay Road.
According to selling agent Nicolas Boot, an Englishman in the 1920s built six apartment buildings in a row that contained four units in each and gave each apartment building to each of his six daughters as an investment.
“A good start in life,” Boot said. “They’re heritage-listed, and they’re all pretty much the same.”
Four parties registered, three were active, and two were first home buyers. Bidding opened at $980,000 and jumped in $20,000 and $10,000 rises; it rapidly hit its reserve of $1.1 million, and shorter advances of $5000 and $2000 were meted out before a winning $6000 bid secured the flat for $1,218,000.
Boot said: “Anything under $1.5 [million] is probably really doing well. Lots of first-time buyers are very, very active with their parents in tow.”
Auctioneer Ed Riley from the eponymous agency said that “motivated buyers are willing to compete aggressively for quality property in tightly held pockets such as Northbridge”.
The buyer was an investor from Bellevue Hill. The vendor, an interior designer, was “thrilled”.
The property last traded for $510,000 in 2009, records show.
In Surry Hills, a two-bedroom terrace with no parking and an internal area of 100 square metres at 32 Bennett Street sold for $2,575,000. The adorable home set on a cobblestone laneway was spread over three levels.
Guided at $2.4 million, just one buyer registered as a couple of curious onlookers watched on.
Negotiations of $2.5 million, $2,525,000, $2,550,000 and $2,575,000 were managed between the agent and auctioneer and buyer and vendor over a 25-minute period until it sold under auction conditions to a downsizer from Randwick. The reserve of $2.6 million was adjusted to sell.
Selling agent David Smith-Cameron from BresicWhitney said: “A lot of properties in this price point are having price adjustments before actually selling. So I am seeing buyers waiting for price adjustments before engaging and really showing the interest.”
The vendor purchased the property for $1.9 million in 2021, records show.
AMP chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said Domain’s clearance rate of 69.8 per cent for Sydney was “quite a sharp fallback”.
“I suspect that what you saw at the start of the year was just a bit of a bounce. Pent-up demand … that seems to be now falling back to earth,” he said.
“The market’s somewhat torn between the opposing forces of low levels of supply and the threat of even higher interest rates.”
Oliver predicts that “it’s likely to be a softer year than we saw last year. So in that sense, I wouldn’t be surprised if the clearance rate slowed further.”

LONDON, February 16. /TASS/. The launch of a factory to produce artillery shells to replenish shortages in the UK armed forces and send them to Ukraine has been delayed for six months, The Guardian reported.
According to the newspaper, the plant is located in Glascoed, a town in South Wales. Authorities hope the plant will increase the UK's production of 155mm shells sixteenfold. The factory was supposed to start operating last summer, but this did not happen.
The UK's BAE Systems defense company, which owns the factory, explained that the delay was due to a decision made during construction to double the plant's production capacity. The company also assured that the fully automated Glascoed factory is structurally complete and is currently undergoing "testing." "After construction began, we took the strategic decision to double the output capacity beyond our original design to increase our 155mm production capacity by up to sixteenfold, which had an impact on the schedule," a BAE Systems spokesperson told the newspaper.
The Guardian noted that the company previously produced between 3,000 and 5,000 shells of this caliber per year. Even with the promised increase in capacity, this means that the UK will produce no more than 80,000 shells annually. For comparison, the newspaper noted that Rheinmetall's new plant in Germany, launched last year, is expected to reach an annual production of 1.1 million shells by 2027.

Witkoff, Kushner to represent US in Iran nuclear talks in Geneva
US President Donald Trump's top envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner will head to Geneva this week for talks with Iranian negotiators over Tehran's nuclear program, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to AFP that the two men, who have been Trump's lead Iran negotiators, would represent Washington for the talks.
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi will represent Tehran in the negotiations, his ministry reported earlier. He will also meet with his Swiss and Omani counterparts and the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Tehran and Washington restarted negotiations in Muscat on February 6, months after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June that started a 12-day war.
The United States joined that war, carrying out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Iran said the Geneva talks would be "indirect", as the previous round in Oman had been.
The latest talks came with Washington having threatened Tehran with military action and deploying an aircraft carrier group to the region following Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
After the Iran talks, Witkoff and Kushner are expected to participate in US-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva.

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. The issue of an energy ceasefire will be raised at the talks on the Ukrainian settlement in Geneva, a Western source told TASS.
"The issue of an energy ceasefire will undoubtedly be raised," he noted.
The first round of trilateral security consultations between Russia, the US and Ukraine took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. The second round was held in the UAE capital on February 4-5. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that the next round of negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement will also take place in a trilateral Russian-American-Ukrainian format on February 17-18 in Geneva. According to him, the Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Russian industry and export sectors are at maximum risk of bankruptcy, intelligence service reports
According to Ukrinform, the Foreign Intelligence Service of Ukraine reported this.
The total amount of losses reached $97.3 billion, an increase of 8.1%. The highest concentration of problem enterprises was recorded in the coal mining, coke chemical, metallurgical, tobacco, and leather industries.
Payment discipline is deteriorating. Overdue wage arrears at the end of December 2025 increased to $26.2 million, up 14.5% for the month and 130% for the year. Of this amount, $22.1 million is attributable to debts arising from enterprises' own-funds shortfalls, indicating liquidity problems. The highest levels of arrears were recorded in construction (23.7%), health care and social services (16.6%), and manufacturing (15.4%).
Amid sanctions pressure and the Russian Central Bank's tight monetary policy, large businesses are facing shrinking markets, declining demand, and falling purchasing power. In the short term, this means an increase in bankruptcies and a further weakening of the corporate sector.
In 2026, market contraction and tight financial conditions will keep the pressure on. Profitability will decline, and bankruptcy risks will increase, especially in industrial and export sectors.
As reported by Ukrinform, the Russian authorities are trying to fill the gaps in the state budget, which is suffering from the war against Ukraine, by increasing the use of punishment through confiscation of property.

Iran hints at compromise as US warns a nuclear deal will be ‘very hard to do’

Iran hints at compromise as US warns a nuclear deal will be ‘very hard to do’
Iran is seeking a nuclear agreement with the US delivering economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat reportedly said on Sunday, days before another round of talks aimed at easing tensions between the two countries.
On Saturday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said US President Donald Trump would prefer to do a deal with Iran, but that achieving one would be “very hard to do”.
Trump said on Friday that the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Middle East, and said regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen”.
Iran has threatened to strike American bases in the Middle East if it is attacked, but on Sunday took a conciliatory line.
“For the sake of an agreement’s durability, it is essential that the US also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,” Foreign Ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
“Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,” Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured US economic interests.
In 2018, Trump withdrew the US from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program, and re-applied tough economic sanctions.
The two countries renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute and avert a new military confrontation. Washington will soon have two aircraft carriers in the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Speaking in Slovakia, Rubio said: “We’re dealing with radical Shia clerics. We’re dealing with people who make geopolitical decisions on the basis of pure theology. And it’s a complicated thing.
“No one’s ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we’re going to try”.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that an American delegation would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official.
Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner “are travelling right now, to have important meetings, and we’ll see how that turns out,” Rubio said, without providing further details.
While talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator.
Iran’s Foreign Minister, Abbas Araqchi, had left Tehran for Geneva to take part in the indirect nuclear talks with the US and meet the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and others, his ministry said.
Iran ready to compromise
Meanwhile, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister,Majid Takht-Ravanchi, signalled Tehran’s readiness to compromise on its nuclear program, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal”.
Takht-Ravanchi referred to the Iranian nuclear chief’s statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran’s flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons.
In June, the US joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites.
The US is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the US would work to reduce Iran’s oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80 per cent of Iran’s oil exports, so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran’s oil revenue.

Four investors fight for $2.25m Malvern East home, pushing it $600,000 above reserve

An investor bought a Malvern East deceased estate that had been in the family for decades at auction on Saturday for $2.25 million, which was $600,000 above its reserve.
The three-bedroom house at 18 Chadstone Road was listed with a price guide of $1.55 million to $1.65 million and a reserve of $1.65 million.
Lead agent and auctioneer Tom Grieve from Ray White Bentleigh said the auction went “very well” with strong bidding between four investors.
Bidding opened at $1.5 million, and once the property was called on the market at $1.65 million, Grieve said there was a “flurry of bidding.”
“It went from $1.7 million to $1.95 million in about thirty seconds,” he said.
The corner position and proximity to Chadstone were the two major drawcards.
“You can see the social courtyard of Chadstone through the back fence,” Grieve said.
The female investor who initiated proceedings secured the property and plans to develop it for family members.
“Because it was Valentine’s Day, we gave her a bunch of flowers and chocolates for making the first bid, and then because she also bought the home, she got a bottle of champagne,” said Grieve.
The underbidder was a man who had only seen the property earlier that day.
The property was one of 828 scheduled auctions in Melbourne last week. By Saturday evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 68.4 per cent from 601 reported results, while 72 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
In South Yarra, a two-bedroom apartment, never seen by the new owner, was sold under the hammer for $730,000.
The unit at 3/19 Kensington Road had a guide price of $600,000 to $640,000 and a reserve of $640,000.
Selling agent Luke Saville from Savvi said they had more than 150 groups inspect the property during the campaign. Interest was also high on auction day, with a crowd of over 70 people, nine registered bidders and five active bidders.
“There was a mix of first-home buyers bidding and Sydney investors,” he said.
“The purchaser was a dad bidding on behalf of his daughter, a first home buyer who was on holiday overseas and who hasn’t seen the property.”
Bidding opened at $640,000 and rose to $700,000 in less than a minute.
“It was a super quick, competitive auction,” Saville said.
The first-floor apartment with a north-facing balcony has a “good layout, with a lock-up garage, also a bonus you don’t normally get,” Saville said.
In South Yarra, Saville said that the apartment market is “on another level.”
“I’m not quite sure what it is about South Yarra, but it is attracting a lot more interest than other suburbs like Hawthorn, especially from interstate investors.”
PRD’s chief economist Dr Diaswati Mardiasmo, said the clearance rate is “really good.”
“This means that the Melbourne market is holding stable and strong when it comes to auction clearance rates, despite the recent cash rate hike,” she said.
“It shows that people are still thinking Melbourne has a lot of opportunities, and it being on the recovery road is still attracting quite a lot of buyers.”
Mardiasmo said there were promising signs for the market.
“At this rate, demand should still be going strong for the next few weeks, unless there are further changes to the economy or cash rate.”
Meanwhile, in Yarraville, a fully-renovated Victorian was passed in at auction for $1.94 million and sold later that day for $2 million after private negotiations on site.
The four-bedroom home at 20 Ovens Street was listed with a price range of $1.8 million to $1.95 million, and a reserve of $2 million.
There is no legal requirement for a vendor’s reserve to be in line with their property’s price guide.
Selling agent Matthew John from Buxton Inner West said the quality of the renovations undertaken by the vendors - an architect, and a builder - as well as its position in the heart of Yarraville Village, attracted the two bidders.
“The home was stripped back to its bones and completely renovated by the sellers,” he said.
“There is always demand for these sorts of homes, despite whatever else is going on in the market.”
The underbidder was a young couple who lost to an upsizing family.
“The family live locally in a townhouse but has two teenagers and wanted more space,” said John.
A crowd of younger families and couples watched the auction, something John has noticed happening more frequently over the past few weeks.
“I think people are trying to get a read on the market, especially after the rate announcement,” he said.

Exclusive | Epstein funded AI pioneer, helped him get HK$8.9 million in Hong Kong government grants
US government documents show financier’s funding support for Ben Goertzel, who once led AI and robotics projects in city
Email exchanges in the Epstein files showed that the late convicted sex offender provided at least US$113,000 to support OpenCog, Goertzel’s open-source AI framework, for at least five years from 2010 to 2015, and unlocked millions of Hong Kong dollars in government funding.
In 2015, as Goertzel sought an additional US$25,000 in financing after Epstein’s underage sex activities returned to the headlines, the scientist wrote to the financier that the allegations could possibly be “an occurrence among reasonably mature people who mutually consented at the time”.
There is no evidence that connects Goetzel with the illegal acts committed by Epstein, who had embedded himself in the worlds of elite politics, academia and science. Rather, the correspondence sheds light on how the scientist curried favour with Epstein to tap into his vast wealth.
Asked by the SCMP about the relationship, Goertzel said he wished he had never associated with the late financier and denied having any knowledge of his illegal activities.

The Melbourne suburbs where the most part-time workers live
Stark differences in employment trends exist throughout Melbourne, with enclaves of part-time workers on the coast contrasting with clusters of full-timers in the city.
Almost half of all workers who live in Parkville (48.6 per cent), Clayton (48 per cent) and Carlton (45 per cent) worked part-time, analysis of census data reveals.
Many neighbourhoods with the highest concentration of full-timers were clustered in inner-city suburbs like Fitzroy, Collingwood and Richmond. The tiny suburb of Cremorne is the Melbourne suburb with the lowest rate of part-timers (21.6 per cent).
RMIT University urban economist Jago Dodson said there were various forces behind the employment trends.
He theorised the high concentration of part-timers in Parkville, Clayton, Carlton, Burwood (42.3 per cent) and Bundoora (40 per cent) is probably due to a large number of university students living on campuses in those locations.
“That would be my supposition: Where you get a high concentration of students in the workforce you get a higher proportion of part-time work,” Dodson said.
The inner-city suburbs more densely populated with full-time workers – Fitzroy, Richmond, Collingwood – were probably home to a higher proportion of white-collar workers and skilled migrants, he said.
“Once you get a reasonable distance outside that to Richmond, South Yarra, Prahran, Windsor – you’re getting less of a student population and younger [population], possibly a high proportion of skilled migrants and better-educated population, probably living in rental properties.”
What are the average full-time hours in your line of work? Type your job into the box below to find out. If you follow the prompts to our visual story you can also explore the average part-time hours for your line of work, its ratio of full-time and part-time workers, the average hours people work in your area, and more.
Robert Hall, chief economist at Informed Decisions, said the high cost of housing was also a factor and there were more households reliant on two full-time incomes.
“[There’s] sort of less kids within those particular areas and if you do [have kids], then you get very high incomes in that area,” he said.
This contrasted with outer suburbs full of young families and different industries.
“I think you see that come out pretty clearly in that northern corridor, in the growth areas around Mickleham, Wallan and Beveridge, that’s got higher childcare responsibilities,” said Hall.
“But it’s also the nature of the jobs, particularly in that area, a lot of healthcare jobs, a lot of retail and hospitality as well. So that sort of increases your part-time share, given those industries [have a] high propensity for part-time employment.”
The Mornington Peninsula is home to higher rates of part-timers than most of Melbourne, which Hall attributes to the tourism industry and a semi-retired workforce.
This stretches from Mount Eliza (40.6 per cent) down through Mornington (40.4 per cent), Mount Martha (42.1 per cent), Safety Beach (41.5 per cent), Dromana (42.6 per cent), to Rosebud and Rye (44.8 per cent each).
“I think … in coastal locations, tourism-type industries, you see high shares of part-time employment, and people are living around that to access those sorts of jobs,” said Hall.
“But you’ve also got … an older resident profile, and the older residents in the peninsula have a higher propensity to work in part-time roles, largely because of the type of jobs that are there, but it could also be the [lifestyle] shift out of Melbourne [with people] still working part-time – so even that sort of 50-plus, like pre-retirement [demographic] starting to ease down with that coastal kind of shift.”
In the outer west and north, new or fast-growing suburbs such as Manor Lakes, Strathtulloh, Thornhill Park, Fraser Rise and Kalkallo all recorded lower percentages of part-time workers. These are all areas that are largely home to young families in which one or both parents work full-time.
Crossing supervisor (98.7 per cent) is the occupation with the highest percentage of part-timers, with sports umpire (97.9), newspaper deliverer (94.3 per cent), busser (92.2 per cent) and swimming coach (91.7 per cent) rounding out the top five.
The census, collected in August 2021, asked people to estimate how many hours they worked across all their jobs over the previous week, although some results may have been affected by the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic at the time.
Some jobs tend to have shorter hours during the winter months, which affects the data. Lifeguards rank 18th when it comes to having the highest percentage of part-time workers, but if the census had been carried out during the height of summer, then the results may have been different.

Men lose their Y chromosome as they age. Now we know why this matters

Men lose their Y chromosome as they age. Now we know why this matters
Men tend to lose the Y chromosome from their cells as they age. But because the Y bears few genes other than for male determination, it was thought this loss would not affect health.
However, evidence has mounted over the past few years that the loss is associated with serious diseases throughout the body, contributing to a shorter lifespan.
New techniques to detect Y chromosome genes show frequent loss of the Y in tissues of older men. The increase with age is clear: 40 per cent of 60-year-old men show loss of Y, and 57 per cent of 90-year-olds. Environmental factors such as smoking and exposure to carcinogens play a role.
Loss of Y occurs in only some cells, and their descendants never get it back. This creates a mosaic of cells with and without a Y in the body. Y-less cells grow faster than normal cells in culture, suggesting they may have an advantage in the body – and in tumours.
The Y chromosome is particularly prone to mistakes during cell division – it can be left behind in a little bag of membrane that gets lost. So we would expect that tissues with rapidly dividing cells would suffer more from loss of Y.
The human Y is an odd little chromosome, bearing only 51 protein-coding genes (not counting multiple copies), compared with the thousands on other chromosomes. It plays crucial roles in sex determination and sperm function, but was not thought to do much else.
The Y chromosome is frequently lost when cells are cultured in the lab. It is the only chromosome that can be lost without killing the cell. This suggests no specific functions encoded by Y genes are necessary for cellular growth and function.
Indeed, males of some marsupial species jettison the Y chromosome early in their development, and evolution seems to be rapidly dispensing with it. In mammals, the Y has been degrading for 150 million years and has already been lost and replaced in some rodents.
So the loss of Y in body tissue late in life should surely not be a drama.
However, despite its apparent uselessness to most cells in the body, evidence is accumulating that loss of Y is associated with severe health conditions, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Loss of Y frequency in kidney cells is associated with kidney disease.
Several studies now show a relationship between the loss of Y and cardiac disease. For instance, a large German study found men over 60 with high frequencies of Y loss had an increased risk of heart attacks.
Loss of Y has also been linked to death from COVID-19, which might explain the sex difference in mortality. A tenfold higher frequency of loss of Y has been found in Alzheimer’s disease patients.
Several studies have documented associations of loss of Y with various cancers in men. It is also associated with a poorer outcome for those who do have cancer. Loss of Y is common in cancer cells themselves, among other chromosome anomalies.
Figuring out links between loss of Y and health problems is difficult. They might occur because health problems cause Y loss, or perhaps a third factor might cause both.
Even strong associations can’t prove causation. The association with kidney or heart disease could result from rapid cell division during organ repair, for instance.
Cancer associations might reflect a genetic predisposition for genome instability. Indeed, whole genome association studies show loss of Y frequency is about one-third genetic, involving 150 identified genes largely involved in cell cycle regulation and cancer susceptibility.
However, one mouse study points to a direct effect. Researchers transplanted Y-deficient blood cells into irradiated mice, which then displayed increased frequencies of age-related pathologies, including poorer cardiac function and subsequent heart failure.
Similarly, loss of Y from cancer cells seems to affect cell growth and malignancy directly, possibly driving eye melanoma, which is more frequent in men.
The clinical effects of loss of Y suggest the Y chromosome has important functions in body cells. But given how few genes it hosts, how?
The male-determining SRY gene found on the Y is expressed widely in the body. But the only effect ascribed to its activity in the brain is complicity in causing Parkinson’s disease. And four genes essential for making sperm are active only in the testes.
But among the other 46 genes on the Y, several are widely expressed and have essential functions in gene activity and regulation. Several are known cancer suppressors.
These genes all have copies on the X chromosome, so both males and females have two copies. It may be that the absence of a second copy in Y-less cells causes some kind of dysregulation.
As well as these protein-coding genes, the Y contains many non-coding genes. These are transcribed into RNA molecules, but never translated into proteins. At least some of these non-coding genes seem to control the function of other genes.
This might explain why the Y chromosome can affect the activity of genes on many other chromosomes. Loss of Y affects expression of some genes in the cells that make blood cells, as well as others that regulate immune function. It may also indirectly affect differentiation of blood cell types and heart function.
The DNA of the human Y was fully sequenced only a couple of years ago – so in time we may track down how particular genes cause these negative health effects.

MUNICH – Four years ago, US officials arrived at the Munich Security Conference armed with satellite photographs of massing Russian troops and intercepts of conversations among Russian generals, arguing that an invasion of Ukraine was imminent. Most senior European officials dismissed the evidence, declaring that Russian President Vladimir Putin was bluffing.
The war for Ukraine, which this week enters its fifth year, started a few days later.

The Trump administration is in discussions about potentially assisting a British resident who burned a Quran outside the Turkish Embassy in London and later faced prosecution, according to a report Sunday in The Telegraph.
The newspaper reported that officials at the U.S. State Department are preparing to help Hamit Coskun leave the United Kingdom if he loses an ongoing legal case.
Coskun, a Turkish citizen who was granted asylum in Britain, set fire to a Quran near the Turkish Embassy in February 2025 and shouted denunciations of Islam, including calling it a “religion of terror,” according to the report. During the incident, a Muslim bystander, Musa Kadri, attacked Coskun and attempted to stab him. Kadri later received a 20-month suspended prison sentence.
Coskun was initially charged with harassment against the “religious institution of Islam,” but the charge was later amended after supporters argued that he was effectively being prosecuted for blasphemy, an offense that has not existed in Britain for 18 years. Prosecutors from the Crown Prosecution Service, the main public body responsible for criminal prosecutions in England and Wales, said Coskun was charged not for burning the Quran but for a public order offense.
He was convicted last year of a religiously aggravated public order offense and fined 240 pounds (about $300). However, the conviction was later overturned on appeal. The court ruled that Coskun had the right to behave in a manner that may “offend, shock or disturb” under the principle of freedom of expression.
Despite the successful appeal, the Crown Prosecution Service filed its own appeal with the High Court last week. A senior U.S. administration official told The Telegraph that Coskun’s case is “one of several” that the administration has taken note of.
Coskun told the newspaper that if he loses the case, he may be forced to “flee” Britain and seek protection in the United States. “As a victim of Islamic terror, I cannot remain silent,” he said. “I may have no choice but to leave Britain and move to the United States, where President Trump has stood firm for freedom of speech and against Islamic extremism.”
He added that if he is compelled to leave, it would signal that Britain has “fallen victim to Islamism and the restrictions on expression they seek to impose on the non-Muslim world.”
The report comes a month after The Telegraph said the Trump administration was discussing the possibility of offering asylum to British Jews amid a rise in antisemitism in the country. President Donald Trump’s personal attorney, Robert Gerson, told the newspaper that Britain is “no longer a safe place” for Jews and said he had held discussions with the State Department in Washington about granting asylum to Jews fleeing antisemitism in Britain.
The Telegraph noted that such political intervention could further strain U.S.-British relations, amid claims that freedom of speech has been curtailed under the government of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
Lord Young of Acton, secretary-general of the Free Speech Union, a British advocacy group assisting Coskun, said that if prosecutors prevail, it will deal a “death blow” to free speech in Britain.
“If the CPS wins, breaking the Islamic blasphemy code — whether by desecrating a holy book or showing images of Muhammad to a class of children — will become a serious religiously aggravated offense,” Young said. Referring to threats made by Kadri during the attack, he added: “We’ve heard the veto he imposed. Losing this case would create a ‘stabber’s veto.’”

Rampant AI demand for memory is fuelling a growing chip crisis

Rampant AI demand for memory is fuelling a growing chip crisis
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
SAN FRANCISCO – A growing procession of tech industry leaders, including Mr Elon Musk and Mr Tim Cook, are warning about a global crisis in the making: A shortage of memory chips is beginning to hammer profits, derail corporate plans and inflate price tags on everything from laptops and smartphones to cars and data centres – and the crunch is only going to get worse.
Since the start of 2026, Tesla, Apple, and a dozen other major corporations have signalled that the shortage of DRAM, or dynamic random access memory – the fundamental building block of almost all technology – will constrain production.
Mr Cook warned it will compress iPhone margins. Micron Technology called the bottleneck “unprecedented”.
Mr Musk got to the intractable nature of the problem when he declared Tesla is going to have to build its own memory fabrication plant.
“We’ve got two choices: Hit the chip wall or make a fab,” he said in late January.
The fundamental reason for the squeeze is the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) data centres. Companies like Alphabet and OpenAI are gobbling up an increasing share of memory chip production – by buying millions of Nvidia Corp.
AI accelerators come with huge allotments of memory – to run their chatbots and other applications. That has left consumer electronics producers fighting over a dwindling supply of chips from the likes of Samsung Electronics and Micron.
The resulting price spikes are starting to look a bit like the Weimar Republic’s hyperinflation.
The cost of one type of DRAM soared 75 per cent from December to January, accelerating price hikes throughout the holiday quarter.
A growing number of retailers and middlemen are changing their prices every day.
“RAMmageddon” is the term some use to describe what is coming.
“We stand at the cusp of something that is bigger than anything we’ve faced before,” said Mr Tim Archer, chief executive of chip equipment supplier Lam Research, at a conference in South Korea in February.
“What is ahead of us between now and the end of this decade, in terms of demand, is bigger than anything we’ve seen in the past, and, in fact, will overwhelm all other sources of demand.”
What is worrying about the trend is that prices are soaring and supplies are running dry even before the AI giants really get going with their data centre construction plans.
Alphabet and Amazon.com just announced plans for a construction blitz in 2026 that could reach US$185 billion (S$233.5 billion) and US$200 billion, respectively, more money than any company in history has poured into capital expenditures in a single year.
Mr Mark Li, a Bernstein analyst who tracks the semiconductor industry, warns that memory chip prices are going “parabolic”.
While that will bring lavish profits to Samsung, Micron and SK Hynix, the rest of the electronics sector will pay a painful price in the months ahead.
“This structural imbalance between supply and demand is not simply a short-term fluctuation,” said Mr Yang Yuanqing, CEO of Lenovo Group, in an interview after earnings on Feb 12 as he explained that the crunch will last at least through the rest of the year.
The disruption is threatening the profitability of entire product lines and upending long-term plans.
Sony Group is now considering pushing back the debut of its next PlayStation console to 2028 or even 2029, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking.
That would be a major upset to a carefully orchestrated strategy to sustain user engagement between hardware generations. Close rival Nintendo, which contributed to the surplus demand in 2025 after its new Switch 2 console drove storage card purchases, is also contemplating raising the price of that device in 2026, people familiar with its plans said.
Sony and Nintendo representatives did not respond to requests for comment.
A manager at a laptop maker said Samsung Electronics has recently begun reviewing its memory supply contracts every quarter or so, versus generally on an annual basis.
Chinese smartphone makers including Xiaomi, Oppo and Shenzhen Transsion Holdings are trimming shipment targets for 2026, with Oppo cutting its forecast by as much as 20 per cent, Chinese media outlet Jiemian reported. The companies did not respond to requests for comment.
“Right now, we’re kind of in the middle of a storm that we are dealing with hour by hour and day by day,” Mr Steinar Sonsteby, CEO of Norwegian IT firm Atea ASA, told analysts in February.
Cisco Systems cited the memory squeeze when it gave a weak profit outlook last week that led to its worst share loss in nearly four years.
Qualcomm and Arm Holdings both warned of more fallout ahead.
At Sunin Plaza, the do-it-yourself PC mecca in Seoul, the usual weekday buzz has evaporated.
The labyrinth of stalls, once a high-energy hub for gaming graphic cards and motherboards, is now engulfed in an eerie quiet.
“It’s actually wiser to hold off doing business today, as prices are almost certain to be higher tomorrow,” said Mr Suh Young-hwan, who runs three DIY PC shops in Seoul and frequently does business with stalls at Sunin Plaza. “Unless Steve Jobs rises from the dead to declare that AI is nothing but a bubble, this trend is likely to persist for some time.”
The premium and DIY PC segment was hit hard when US chipmaker Micron decided in 2025 to end its popular Crucial brand of consumer memory sticks, after three decades in operation.
Mr Kelt Reeves, CEO and founder of custom PC maker Falcon Northwest, said Crucial’s demise started a “stampede” to secure as much inventory as they could, driving memory prices to new highs in January.
Across 2025, Falcon Northwest’s average selling price rose by US$1,500 to roughly US$8,000 for each custom-made computer.
All of this has echoes of one of the biggest supply chain disruptions in recent memory: the Covid-19-era shortages of cheap, basic auto and power chips that paralysed carmakers from Ford Motor to Volkswagen AG, forced smartphone makers to stockpile at exorbitant prices and galvanised a global movement, including in the US, to attract and build local chip manufacturing.
Back then, it was because of an unexpected surge in demand for products from people working from home and trying to minimise contact.
This time round, the shortages stem from the memory industry’s pivot towards AI.
Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet are throwing astronomical sums at data centres that can train and host AI algorithms, hiking spending from US$217 billion in 2024 to about US$360 billion in 2025 – to an estimated US$650 billion in 2026.
That splurge – rivalling the costliest human endeavours in history – is borne out of ambitions to outdo their giant rivals in a field that could determine their futures. The big four tech firms are paying top dollar for the components, resources and human talent that will make all that AI infrastructure possible.
Few sectors have been transformed by that headlong rush more than global memory. In the three years since ChatGPT, Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron have diverted the bulk of their manufacturing, research and investments toward the HBM used in AI accelerators from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That means less plant capacity to make plain-vanilla DRAM for basic electronics like phones.
The three companies are prioritising HBM over DRAM because of simple maths.
For every Nvidia AI accelerator that the hyperscalers buy, these companies also need high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, to power their efforts. Such chips are made up of intricately packed DRAM, often stacked in layers of eight or 12.
Nvidia’s latest Blackwell comes with 192 gigabytes of RAM, or six times the amount that a powerful modern PC would need.
An integrated AI server system dubbed the NVL72 boasts 72 Blackwell chips and 13.4 terabytes of RAM. Each NVL72 rack-scale system sold uses enough memory for a thousand high-end smartphones, or a few hundred beefy PCs.
The demand for HBMs will increase 70 per cent year over year in 2026 alone, Taipei-based consultancy TrendForce estimates. Meanwhile, HBM will take up 23 per cent of total DRAM wafer output in 2026, up from 19 per cent in 2025, according to the consultancy.
They also – during normal times – yield better margins simply because Samsung and all can charge more given the imbalance in supply and demand.
Micron’s revenue is expected to more than double in the fiscal year ending in August. SK Hynix’s sales more than doubled in 2024 and are likely to double again in 2026.
But that wave of HBM business spells trouble for memory consumers. It is leaving the rest of the world bereft of the memory that people need to store cellphone photos, steer cars, download movies and run computer programs.
GF Securities estimates that there is a 4 per cent gap between the supplies and demands for DRAM and 3 per cent for NAND, but those figures do not yet factor in low inventories in some industries, so the actual imbalance is likely bigger.
“DRAM shortages are set to persist across the electronics, telecommunications and automotive industries throughout the year,” Counterpoint analyst MS Hwang said. “We are already seeing signs of panic buying within the auto sector, while smartphone manufacturers are pivoting towards more cost-effective chip alternatives to mitigate the impact.”
It is unlikely that the supply of basic memory will rebound anytime soon.
Samsung, SK Hynix and Micron have together have endured multiple boom-bust cycles in memory chip demand. While they are racing to increase supply, it will take years to build and outfit the new chip facilities needed to make more memory chips.
“This is the most significant disconnect between demand and supply in terms of magnitude, as well as time horizon, that we’ve experienced in my 25 years in the industry,” Micron executive vice-president of operations Manish Bhatia told Bloomberg News in December.
Mr Bhatia may be referring to a growing view that the industry is experiencing a so-called “super-cycle” of AI demand.
That refers to a wave of technology adoption so vast and broad that it is skewing or even eradicating the memory sector’s decades-long cycle of boom and bust, where chipmakers build capacity to chase rising prices, only to overdo things and precipitate a downturn. This time, the upswing is clear, and few – least of all the hyperscalers – are gambling on an end.
Electronics companies from Xiaomi to Samsung and Dell Technologies have all warned consumers to brace themselves for higher price tags in 2026, ahead of key midterm elections in the US, when inflation could become a focal point.
Skyrocketing memory costs mean DRAM could soon account for as much as 30 per cent of low-end smartphones’ bill of materials – tripling from 10 per cent in early 2025. The biggest impact would be on cheaper handsets that lack pricing power, Counterpoint Research said.
“Memory is now the new gold for the AI and automotive sector, but clearly it’s not going to be easy,” AMD partner Arista Networks chief executive officer Jayshree V. Ullal told analysts in February. “It’s going to favor those who planned and those who can spend the money for it.” BLOOMBERG

'Donald Trump floods the political and media landscape, even in France, where domestic issues suddenly seem trivial'

He is the elephant in the room. As time passes, he grows larger and larger until he is all anyone sees. With each decision and excess – be it tariff threats, ambitions toward Greenland or the brutal enforcement of his anti-immigration policy – Donald Trump has flooded the political and media landscape, even in France, where domestic issues suddenly seem trivial.
This impression has been heightened by the paralysis of the French government, which, lacking a majority, has been unable to enact reforms. The void in France contrasts sharply with the abundance of action over there: A forceful assertiveness, paired with lies, outbursts and overall brutality, orchestrated by a "genius at capturing attention," in the words of Pierre-Yves Bocquet, former speechwriter for former French president François Hollande. "The world is under a spell," said former prime minister Dominique de Villepin, while advisers to the current French president, Emmanuel Macron, note that "the average French living room has become oval."
In the face of the upheavals unleashed, such as the fracturing of the world order and the erosion of democratic principles, everyone must take a position. The French have done so. According to Frédéric Dabi, director general of the IFOP polling institute, a majority now believe that the US will be a "military threat" to France in the coming years. For political leaders, the American president acts as a catalyst.
Complex positioning
Former prime minister Gabriel Attal rarely spoke about international affairs until recently. He seized on the January 3 abduction of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela to articulate a doctrine about the futility of international law and the need to reclaim "power" in a world where might makes right. Attal was immediately contradicted by his predecessor at Matignon, Elisabeth Borne, who condemned "allegiance to force as the new standard in international relations" and called for a continued commitment to the rule of law. Meanwhile, far-right leader Marine Le Pen surprised observers by calling for respect for international law and insisting that the sovereignty of states is "never negotiable." Everyone has been caught off guard. Trump is shifting the political boundaries.

Experts explain why intermittent fasting may not be worth the hype
Research suggests intermittent fasting is unlikely to lead to greater weight loss in overweight or obese adults than eating a healthy diet or doing nothing
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Intermittent fasting has surged in popularity with huge enthusiasm for the diet on social media – but research suggests simply fasting is unlikely to lead to weight loss.
The diet trend promises to hack biology without counting calories. Instead, it involves fasting for an extended period and then eating breakfast, lunch and dinner in a condensed eight-hour window.
Obesity is a significant public health problem that has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries. In 2022, 2.5 billion adults were overweight; of these, 890 million were living with obesity. In England, more than two-thirds of adults are estimated to be overweight or obese.
Being overweight or obese is a leading cause of cancer, second only to smoking, and is linked to at least 13 types of the disease.
But intermittent fasting is unlikely to lead to greater weight loss in overweight or obese adults than traditional dietary advice or doing nothing, a new Cochrane review has found.
“Intermittent fasting may be a reasonable option for some people, but the current evidence doesn’t justify the enthusiasm we see on social media,” said Luis Garegnani, lead author of the review from the Universidad Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires Cochrane Associate Centre. “Intermittent fasting just doesn’t seem to work for overweight or obese adults trying to lose weight.”
The review analysed evidence from 22 randomised clinical trials involving 1,995 adults across North America, Europe, China, Australia, and South America.
The trials examined multiple forms of intermittent fasting, including alternate-day fasting, periodic fasting, and time-restricted feeding. Most studies followed participants for up to 12 months.
Researchers found intermittent fasting does not have a clinically meaningful effect on weight loss compared to standard dietary advice or doing nothing.
“Intermittent fasting is not a magic solution for weight loss,” Kim Pearson, a nutritionist specialising in weight loss, told The Independent. She explained that while it can help people reduce their calorie intake, as shown in the review, improving overall diet quality is more likely to help with weight loss.
“More aggressive approaches are often difficult to sustain and do not address the root causes of weight gain, such as poor diet quality, excess ultra-processed foods and blood sugar instability,” she said.
Instead, she urges people to focus on eating protein, fibre and healthy fats while reducing ultra-processed foods, sugar and refined starchy carbohydrates.
“This helps regulate appetite naturally, supports stable blood sugar and allows the body to burn stored body fat more efficiently,” she added.
Rob Hobson, registered nutritionist and author of the low appetite cookbook, also suggests eating minimally processed foods, protein and fibre. He warns that fasting can lead to overeating later.
He told the Independent: “Where fasting can fall down is adherence because restrictive eating windows or very low-intake days can ( in some people) lead to compensatory overeating, low energy, or simply not being sustainable over the long term, and it’s long-term consistency that really drives results when it comes to weight loss.”
Dr Earim Chaudry, chief medical officer at online pharmacy Voy, added that weight loss isn’t a “matter of willpower” and while fasting can help in the short term, it’s not more effective than changing your diet and lifestyle.
“Limiting eating windows does not address the biological drivers of appetite, metabolic adaptation and weight regain, and it is often difficult to sustain,” he told The Independent.
However, Ms Pearson explains there could be some benefits to fasting because not eating overnight for 12-14 hours “aligns with our circadian biology and gives the body time to move out of a constant fed state”, she said. But she stressed there is no need for extreme fasting.

Incredible picture of the Milky Way wins photography competition
‘Ancient Light’ by Michael Harris was awarded the top prize at the South Downs annual astro-photography competition

An "incredible" photograph capturing the Milky Way above the South Downs has been crowned the winner of the national park’s annual astro-photography competition. The contest, which drew more than 130 entrants, was held to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the park’s designation as an International Dark Sky Reserve.
The top prize was awarded to Michael Harris for his striking image, "Ancient Light," which beautifully frames the Milky Way over an abandoned barn in Balsdean Valley, near Brighton, East Sussex. Dan Oakley, a dark skies expert and astro-photographer who served as a judge, praised the shot, stating: "I think this is an incredible and realistic photo of what the South Downs Dark Skies experience is. It’s beautifully framed."
Mr Harris, from Brighton, reflected on the historical significance of his chosen location. He noted: "The site has had a long history with Roman occupation, as a medieval hamlet, use as accommodation during the Second World War and for farming. All of which have long since come and gone in the time it has taken for the light from the Milky Way above to reach us, which is approximately 26,000 years."
In the "Life At Night" category, Richard Murray’s photograph, "Snail Trail To The Stars," depicting a snail beneath The Plough asterism, took first place. Judge Elinor Newman, who organises the national park’s Dark Skies Festival, which runs until 22 February, commented: "This really does encapsulate life at night, with the snail, flora and lichen. The image has incredible detail, captures a moment and takes me to another place. A very inspiring image."
Mr Murray, from Waterlooville, described the meticulous effort behind his winning shot: "The shot took a lot of patience and a surprising amount of suspense, waiting for the exact moment when my tiny, mucus-powered model lifted both antennae toward the cosmos above. Eventually, the stars, the snail, and the timing all lined up and I got the shot I’d been hoping for."
The new "South Downs To Deep Space" category was won by Nigel Stanbury, of Haslemere, Surrey, for his image titled "Jellyfish Nebula," which captures a supernova located 5,000 light years away. Mr Oakley remarked: "It looks like a jellyfish, but it’s not, it’s the remains of an exploding star. It looks straight out of Star Trek."
Mr Stanbury elaborated on his subject: "The image is of the so-called Jellyfish nebula located in the constellation of Gemini, the twins. It is the remains of a star larger than our sun, that exploded as a supernova many thousands of years ago, blowing off a cloud of gas that has been expanding ever since and glows as it collides with surrounding gas and dust. The image was taken over three nights, and needed 22 hours of exposure to bring out the colours and show the finer details of the faint structure. It has taken light 5,000 years to reach us so the image shows the object as it appeared 5,000 years ago."

More than 5,000 violent incidents towards teachers reported in Scottish schools over five years
Data obtained by the Scottish Conservatives through Freedom of Information requests shows 5,222 incidents were recorded between the 2019/20 and 2024/25

More than 5,000 violent incidents have been reported in Scottish schools over the past five years, with hundreds of teachers requiring medical attention as a result, new figures reveal.
Data obtained by the Scottish Conservatives through Freedom of Information requests shows 5,222 incidents were recorded between the 2019/20 and 2024/25 academic years. Of these, 225 required staff members to attend hospital or visit a GP. The true scale of the problem may be higher, as some local authorities did not respond to the FOI requests.
The opposition party described the numbers as "deeply alarming" and criticised the Scottish National Party’s approach to school discipline. Miles Briggs, the Scottish Conservatives’ education spokesman, stated: "These deeply alarming figures show how teaching staff are being betrayed by the SNP’s soft-touch approach to school discipline. Nobody should fear being assaulted in their workplace, yet that is the appalling reality for far too many teachers and support staff."
He added: "This is why we have pledged to give headteachers the power to permanently exclude the most violently disruptive pupils from their school. They know what is best for their school, rather than unelected council officials. Our plans would restore some much-needed discipline to Scotland’s schools."
Mr Briggs further criticised the government, saying: "The SNP’s guidance on violence in schools is full of waffle, and they have failed to act for too long on this issue. That’s left teachers, support staff and other pupils fearing they will be next to be attacked."
The Scottish Government has been approached for comment regarding the findings.
More than four in five (81 per cent) teachers feel the number of pupils exhibiting violent and abusive behaviours has increased, according to a 2025 poll by the NASUWT teaching union.
The survey, of more than 5,800 NASUWT members in the UK last year, suggests two in five (40 per cent) have experienced physical abuse or violence from pupils in the last 12 months.
A fifth (20 per cent) of respondents said they had experienced being hit or punched by pupils in the last year, while 38 per cent said they had been shoved or barged.
Around one in six (16 per cent) said they had been kicked by pupils, while 9% said they had been spat at, according to the NASUWT poll.
One teacher who responded to the survey said: “I have had two children use a fire hydrant as a weapon. One at my head, another to my foot.”
Another said: “This morning I was told to, ‘go die, I hope you die.’”

Average price tag on a home falls by £12 in February after record January jump
Early year price growth was front-loaded into January, Rightmove said.
- Bookmark
The average price tag on a home edged down by £12 month-on-month in February following a record jump of nearly £10,000 in January, according to a property website.
Across Britain, the average asking price for a home coming on the market in February is £368,019, Rightmove said.
In January, the average price tag on a home was £368,031.
Rightmove previously said the £9,893 average asking price increase seen in January 2026 was the biggest for the month of January in its 25 years of house price studies.
Over the past decade, asking prices in February have typically increased by 0.8% month-on-month.
But despite the average asking price standstill in February, January’s record asking price increase for the time of year means that 2026 is still the strongest start to a year for asking prices since 2020, with prices up by 2.8% since December, Rightmove said.
It said early year price growth was front-loaded into January as confidence rebounded after a prolonged period of uncertainty surrounding the autumn budget.
Colleen Babcock, property expert at Rightmove, said: “Virtually flat prices in February really needs to be viewed alongside what happened in January.
“After the prolonged uncertainty in the run up to the late November budget, plus the usual Christmas slowdown, we saw activity pick up again from Boxing Day.
“Many sellers, some of whom had been holding back because of the budget, came to market in early 2026 with renewed confidence, which helped to drive that bumper January price rise.
“But the market fundamentals haven’t changed. There are still lots of homes for sale, and buying activity isn’t as strong as this time last year, when many buyers were rushing to move before the stamp duty increase in England.

“So in February, sellers have taken a more cautious approach by holding onto January’s gains rather than pushing prices higher, at a time when competition is high and the market is still very price-sensitive.”
Rightmove said that, this time last year, a looming stamp duty deadline at the end of March was affecting the market in England, as buyers rushed to complete sales.
It said that, compared with 2024, current trends look stronger.
The number of newly listed properties for sale is 11% higher than two years ago, while the number of sales agreed is 9% higher than at this time in 2024.
Ms Babcock added: “2026 is shaping up to be a good year to buy. Over the last three years average wages are up by around 17%, significantly outstripping property prices which are up by just 1.5% over the same period.
“A more favourable mortgage rate and lending environment are both also helping to improve buyer affordability. For those who are ready to move soon, February could offer a useful window of opportunity to act before the peak spring selling season, when prices usually rise.”
Matt Smith, a mortgage expert at Rightmove, said: “Last year’s review of the loan-to-income cap and reminder to lenders about stress testing flexibility by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), have had the intended positive outcome of enabling the typical buyer to borrow more.
“On top of this, there continues to be a strong focus from lenders on helping first-time buyers, with many lenders creating new products to help eligible buyers to borrow larger sums.”
Craig Webster, managing director, Tiger Sales & Lettings in Blackpool, said: “Sellers are becoming more realistic as competition remains high, but demand remains resilient.
“For buyers, conditions are improving. Mortgage rates are trending down, lenders are increasingly competitive and importantly wage growth has outpaced house price growth in recent periods, helping affordability.”
He added: “As we head into the busy spring market, those who are prepared and decisive are likely to be in the strongest position.”
Katie Griffin, director at Sawdye & Harris in Dartmoor, said: “Spring is always our busiest time, and I think we’ll see improved activity if sellers continue to price sensibly. There’s genuine buyer demand out there – people have just been waiting for the right moment and the right property at the right price.”
The report was released as research from property firm Savills estimated the total value of homes across the UK now stands at £9.18 trillion.
It took into account the total value of properties owned outright, with a mortgage, social housing and the private rented sector.
The total value of the UK’s housing stock grew by an additional £136 billion in 2025 but this was smaller than £268 billion added in value the year before, Savills said.
Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, said: “Although the total value of UK housing has continued to edge up over the past year, the capital appreciation of £336 billion since the end of 2022 is the lowest we have seen for a three-year period since 2013.
“That partly reflects the initial pressure put on prices as mortgage costs rose over the course of 2023.
“But equally the housing market has been slow to respond to recent cuts in (the Bank of England) base rate.
“This combined with an absence of price growth across London and the South East, where values are highest, and falling levels of house building has kept a lid on the aggregate number.”
Despite the North of England and the devolved nations accounting for only 27% of the value of all UK homes, they have contributed 60% of total growth since 2022, Savills said.
It said the top performing region is the North West, which has seen the total value of its housing stock increase by £63 billion since 2022.

Everyday’s a ‘battle’ for sales, says 142-year-old firm betting on TikTok Shop
Chief executive Jonathan Myers said PZ Cussons has to ‘battle every day to win every purchase’.

The maker of Imperial Leather and Sanctuary Spa has said reaching shoppers on platforms like TikTok Shop was as important as Tesco, as the 142-year-old business vies to compete with a rising cohort of social media-savvy brands.
PZ Cussons – the consumer goods giant that was founded in 1884 and is behind a swathe of beauty, hygiene and baby products – said it had been investing more into innovation and building its brands.
Chief executive Jonathan Myers said the business has to “battle every day to win every purchase”.
“There’s hardly a store in the country that sells a washing and bathing product that doesn’t sell a PZ Cussons product,” he told the Press Association.
But he said the company had been trying to be at the forefront of online shopping trends that many newer brands are tapping into.
“If you look at the way that most of the insurgent brands are arriving, it’s through social media, and that blurs into e-commerce platforms, for example TikTok Shop,” he said.
“It’s about making sure that we’re present, that we’re growing fast, and that we’re stealing our share of purchases there, just as we would a Tesco Express down the street.”
TikTok Shop, the e-commerce arm of the video-sharing social media platform where users can buy and sell products, has grown rapidly over recent years.
Major retailers like Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury’s are now selling products on the marketplace alongside thousands of smaller businesses and brands.
TikTok Shop recently said it had become the fourth-largest beauty retailer in the UK, according to data from NielsenIQ, while beauty sales on the platform soared by 60% year-on-year in 2025 fuelled by trends such as Korean skincare.
Mr Myers highlighted PZ Cussons’s activity in Indonesia – where it has been experimenting with new sales tactics, including a live-streaming channel from its factory.
He said: “We run three shifts of live-streamers who are driving demand for our brands that is then fulfilled through marketplaces like TikTok Shop, and delivered on the back of a moped.”
TikTok sales in Indonesia have increased more than 600%, where PZ Cussons currently operates a TikTok Shop.
The chief executive said he could “definitely see the rise of quick commerce” in urban areas of the UK, accelerated by the “blurring” of social media and shopping channels.
Mr Myers stressed that there was no room for “complacency”, adding: “Competition is good because it keeps us on our toes.”

Grieving father calls for Scotland to pursue driving licence reform
Alan Knox launched his campaign following the death of his son, Lewis, who was among three teenagers from Lochaber who died in a collision on the A830
- Bookmark

A grieving father, whose son was one of three teenagers tragically killed in a car crash, is urgently appealing to Westminster to grant Scotland the authority to implement graduated driving licences. Alan Knox is pushing for the UK Government to extend the same opportunity to Scotland as it has to Northern Ireland, which is set to introduce the new licensing system later this year.
Mr Knox, a paramedic, launched his campaign following the death of his son, Lewis, last year. Lewis, a player for Fort William Shinty Club, was among three teenagers from Lochaber who died in a collision on the A830 road between Mallaig and Arisaig in the Highlands.
Northern Ireland’s infrastructure minister, Liz Kimmins, has hailed the upcoming change, due from October 2026, as the "most significant reform to driver licensing and testing in almost 70 years". Announcing the scheme earlier this year, she stated: "These changes are aimed at young drivers who are sadly most likely to be killed or seriously injured on our roads."
Mr Knox has already raised the critical issue with Scottish Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop, who has echoed his call for the UK Government to "give Scotland the powers needed to pilot graduated driving licences". Ms Hyslop added that such measures could "help save young lives and cut serious injuries" on the roads.
The campaigning father highlighted the widespread impact of such tragedies, saying: "Too many families across the UK have suffered the unutterable pain of losing a child on the road." He pointed to international evidence, asserting: "The international evidence clearly shows that graduated driving licensing works, reducing the prospect of fatal collisions involving young people."
Mr Knox questioned the disparity, adding: "As Northern Ireland takes forward a pilot, I would urge the UK Government to give Scotland the same opportunity. It is not clear why the devolved administration at Holyrood isn’t being afforded a chance to pursue reform in this area."
Mr Knox advocates for several specific measures, including a ban on newly qualified drivers carrying young passengers for six months after passing their test, believing this could alleviate peer pressure. He also supports fitting black box devices to new drivers’ cars to monitor speed and driving style, alongside temporary restrictions on late-night driving.
He explained his rationale: "Young people are not taught to drive at speed in adverse driving conditions like ice and snow and at night-time on rural roads. A car full of excited friends can be highly distracting to those who lack experience behind the wheel."
He concluded: "It makes sense to place reasonable limits on new drivers. Plates to advise other road users, limits on late night driving and passenger numbers, a no alcohol rule, and other measures can reduce fatal mistakes." Citing international examples, he noted: "Systems in other countries speak for themselves. Canada witnessed a more than 80% reduction in deaths in 16 to 19-year-old drivers after it brought in graduated driving licences. Similar reductions have been observed in New Zealand and Australia."
However, a Department for Transport spokeswoman indicated a different approach from the UK Government. She stated: "We want to keep young people safe while supporting their access to work, education and social opportunities."
She clarified the department’s stance: "That’s why we’re not introducing blanket restrictions on new drivers, such as limits on passengers or night‑time driving. Instead, we’re focusing on better preparation before the test, including consulting on a minimum learning period." The department confirmed it is currently consulting on a minimum learning period to allow young people more time to develop essential driving skills.

Average house price falls in February after January’s huge surge
Across Britain, the average asking price for a home coming on the market in February is £368,019, Rightmove said
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The average asking price for a home in Britain saw a marginal dip of £12 in February, following a substantial surge of nearly £10,000 in January, according to new data from property website Rightmove. This slight decrease brings the average asking price across the country to £368,019, down from £368,031 the previous month.
The January increase, which saw prices jump by £9,893, marked the largest rise for that month in Rightmove’s 25 years of house price analysis. Despite February’s near-stagnation, the robust start to the year means 2026 has recorded the strongest opening for asking prices since 2020, with a 2.8 per cent increase since December. Rightmove attributes this early year growth to a rebound in confidence after a prolonged period of uncertainty surrounding the autumn budget.
Colleen Babcock, a property expert at Rightmove, emphasised the need to view February’s figures in context. "Virtually flat prices in February really needs to be viewed alongside what happened in January," she explained. "After the prolonged uncertainty in the run up to the late November budget, plus the usual Christmas slowdown, we saw activity pick up again from Boxing Day."
Ms Babcock added: "Many sellers, some of whom had been holding back because of the budget, came to market in early 2026 with renewed confidence, which helped to drive that bumper January price rise. But the market fundamentals haven’t changed.
There are still lots of homes for sale, and buying activity isn’t as strong as this time last year, when many buyers were rushing to move before the stamp duty increase in England. So in February, sellers have taken a more cautious approach by holding onto January’s gains rather than pushing prices higher, at a time when competition is high and the market is still very price-sensitive."
Compared to two years ago, the market shows signs of strengthening, with the number of newly listed properties 11 per cent higher than in 2024, and sales agreed up by 9 per cent.
Ms Babcock suggested that 2026 could be a favourable year for buyers. "Over the last three years average wages are up by around 17%, significantly outstripping property prices which are up by just 1.5% over the same period," she noted. "A more favourable mortgage rate and lending environment are both also helping to improve buyer affordability. For those who are ready to move soon, February could offer a useful window of opportunity to act before the peak spring selling season, when prices usually rise."
Matt Smith, a mortgage expert at Rightmove, highlighted the positive impact of regulatory changes. "Last year’s review of the loan-to-income cap and reminder to lenders about stress testing flexibility by the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), have had the intended positive outcome of enabling the typical buyer to borrow more," he said. "On top of this, there continues to be a strong focus from lenders on helping first-time buyers, with many lenders creating new products to help eligible buyers to borrow larger sums."
Local agents echoed this sentiment. Craig Webster, managing director at Tiger Sales & Lettings in Blackpool, observed: "Sellers are becoming more realistic as competition remains high, but demand remains resilient. For buyers, conditions are improving. Mortgage rates are trending down, lenders are increasingly competitive and importantly wage growth has outpaced house price growth in recent periods, helping affordability." He advised that those "prepared and decisive are likely to be in the strongest position" as the busy spring market approaches.
Katie Griffin, director at Sawdye & Harris in Dartmoor, added: "Spring is always our busiest time, and I think we’ll see improved activity if sellers continue to price sensibly. There’s genuine buyer demand out there – people have just been waiting for the right moment and the right property at the right price."
In related research, property firm Savills estimated the total value of homes across the UK now stands at a staggering £9.18 trillion, encompassing properties owned outright, with a mortgage, social housing, and the private rented sector. The total value of the UK’s housing stock grew by an additional £136 billion in 2025, though this was less than the £268 billion added in value the year prior.
Lucian Cook, head of residential research at Savills, noted that the capital appreciation of £336 billion since the end of 2022 is the lowest for a three-year period since 2013. He attributed this to initial pressure from rising mortgage costs in 2023, the housing market’s slow response to recent Bank of England base rate cuts, an absence of price growth in London and the South East, and falling levels of house building.
Interestingly, despite accounting for only 27 per cent of the total value of UK homes, the North of England and the devolved nations have contributed 60 per cent of the total growth since 2022. The North West emerged as the top-performing region, with the total value of its housing stock increasing by £63 billion since 2022.

Study finds one in three workers are unhappy in their jobs
Around one in three workers feel less satisfied and engaged in their job, impacting their productivity, research suggests

Around one in three British workers feel less satisfied and engaged in their jobs, impacting their productivity, new research suggests.
A similar number report being stressed at work, while one in five complain of high workloads and a lack of recognition for their efforts.
More than six in 10 of 2,000 workers surveyed by the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS) agreed that having an opportunity to use their skills and expertise for community benefit would increase job satisfaction and engagement.
The RVS said its study suggests a growing sense of detachment among UK workers, as it launched GoVo for Business, described as an employee volunteering platform.
This platform supports organisations in tackling workforce issues such as employee engagement, wellbeing and productivity.
Carole Urey, chief revenue officer at the RVS, said: "Disconnected and disengaged employees can be costly for employers. These feelings not only reduce productivity but can impact brand reputation and retention. Volunteering through workplace programmes is a proven way to improve wellbeing, connection and productivity, whilst contributing to society."
In 2022, the real estate industry which scored the lowest for job satisfaction in a survery conducted by Indeed – followed by management, consulting and automotive.
At the other end of the scale, education was deemed the happiest sector – with workers scoring high on having a clear sense of purpose.
This was followed closely workers in aerospace and defence, and government and public administration which also scored high on work contentment.
In 2018, a survey revealed that job satisfaction also varied significantly among professions, with the highest proportion of dissatisfied workers in customer service roles:
1. 37% of customer service executives
2. 34% of hospitality employees
3. 34% of administrators
4. 33% of shop workers
5. 28% of nurses and care workers
6. 24% of teachers
7. 24% of van and truck drivers
8. 16% of construction workers
Researchers surveyed more than 2,000 UK workers to determine the extent of job dissatisfaction, revealing that levels vary depending on industry and location.
They also identified the four cities where Brits are most unhappy at work, with Wolverhampton, Sunderland, Carlisle and Walsall topping the pile.

Dogwalker dies after falling through ice in Cape Cod, as search for her husband is suspended
Police believe a husband and wife fell through the ice of Bee’s River in Eastham, Massachusetts

A couple fell into an icy river while walking their dog, leaving one of them dead and the other missing.
A husband and wife are believed to have fallen through the ice on Bee’s River in Eastham, Massachusetts, while walking their dog Saturday morning, according to a statement from the local police department. Eastham is a small beach town located on Cape Cod.
Officers were first called to the scene after someone reported a loose dog that was wet and “appeared to be in distress,” the Eastham Police Department said. An officer who responded found a woman in the river who had been screaming for help.
The officer attempted to rescue the woman, but the ice gave way, leaving them both “completely submerged,” according to the agency. A second officer made his way out onto the ice to help, but it broke again, and he was submerged up to his waist.
Both officers made it back to shore and were transported to a nearby hospital, the police department said. Rescue officials then searched for the woman, who was found under the ice and pronounced dead at the scene.
The woman’s husband, who is believed to have been with her at the time of the incident, is still missing.
“Based on items located in their vehicle and a check of their residence, it was determined that it was possible that the husband may have fallen through the ice prior to the officer’s arrival,” the police department said Saturday.
Police launched a six-hour search effort, which included multiple divers and an “underwater remotely operated vehicle,” the agency said. Investigators were forced to pause their efforts once it became dark and resumed their search Sunday morning with a drone and on-foot teams.
The man remains missing, and investigators have suspended their search efforts. The search will resume “when changes to the ice conditions occur, allowing access for public safety personnel,” the police department said Sunday.
The couple’s names have not been released at the request of their family.
“Our thoughts continue to be with the entire family in the aftermath of this tragic incident,” the police department said.
Community members are now contributing to a growing memorial for the couple near Bee’s River, local network WCVB reports. Resident Wanda McCutcheon believes the community will come together to support the couple’s family, she told the outlet.
"I just can’t get them out of my mind, to be honest with you. I hope the family knows that," she said.

Indonesia’s US$1.67 billion China-backed dam is in limbo. Why?
Even energy regulators were kept in the dark about the abrupt crackdown that has spooked renewables investors
North Sumatera Hydro Energy (NSHE), the developer of the US$1.67 billion Batang Toru hydroelectric project, was among 28 companies whose permits were revoked on January 20 over allegations of forest damage. The cancellations followed an expedited audit of companies operating in forest areas across Aceh, North Sumatra and West Sumatra provinces by the Forest Area Regulation Task Force.
“Two days ago, I led a cabinet meeting by Zoom from London, and we decided to revoke the licences of 28 corporations that had licences over 1.01 million hectares because we found them violating laws. They were building plantations on protected forests,” Prabowo said.
“Combined with the 4 million hectares of plantations already confiscated, we have in fact enacted the boldest, the most daring forest law-enforcement effort in the history of Indonesia.”

Hillary Clinton considers Washington's failure to extend New START big mistake

MUNICH, February 16. /TASS/. The US administration's decision not to extend the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) is a big mistake, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, she noted that allowing the document to expire was a big mistake. The politician also called for efforts to reach agreements on nuclear weapons limitations.
The New START Treaty, the last international legal restriction on the deployment of nuclear weapons, expired on February 5 due to Washington's refusal to extend it.
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced in September 2025 at a meeting with the Security Council that Moscow is ready to continue adhering to the quantitative restrictions under New START for another year after its expiration. However, he noted that this measure would only be viable if Washington acted in a similar manner. Responding to a TASS question on October 5, 2025, US President Donald Trump called Putin’s proposal a good idea. However, the US has not taken any practical action in response to Russia's proposals.

Bondi Beach terror accused appears in court

Bondi Beach terror accused appears in court
Accused Bondi Beach gunman Naveed Akram has made his first public appearance since allegedly carrying out the worst terror attack in Australia’s history that left 15 people dead.
Akram, 24, and his father Sajid, 50, allegedly opened fire on a Jewish celebration at the iconic beach on December 14, 2025 using rifles and shotguns.
Police returned fire, killing Sajid and gravely injuring Akram. The pair were motivated by Islamic State and targeted the Jewish community deliberately, investigators say.
By then, 15 innocent people were dead – including a 10-year-old girl.
Akram spent weeks in Long Bay prison hospital before being taken to Goulburn Supermax prison, which is reserved for the highest risk prisoners.
Akram dialled in to the Downing Centre Local Court using a videolink from a drab, grey room in Goulburn on Monday morning for a few moments.
His lawyer had told the court that Akram did not need to appear – but the word had not reached prison staff before the link activated.
The court hearing was brief; non-publication orders over the details of victims were extended, the timeline of evidence to change hands was discussed.
Akram sat mostly silently, looking alert and wearing a dark green prison jumper. His only reply was “yep” when asked, by Deputy Chief Magistrate Sharon Freund, if he had heard the exchanges.
The link was quickly terminated, and the matter will return in March for another administrative hearing.
Court documents, obtained by this masthead shortly after Akram’s arrest, allege that he and his father rented a hideout in Campsie in October – a small Airbnb – to plan their attack.
That month, they recorded a video of themselves in front of an image of an Islamic State flag, with four long-arm guns with ammunition rounds, hanging on the wood-panelled wall behind them.
In that video, Naveed appears to recite a passage from the Koran in Arabic. Then, in English, both men allegedly talk about their motivation for the Bondi attack and condemn the acts of Zionists.
“[They] appear to summarise their justification for the Bondi terrorist attack,” say the allegations contained in a police fact sheet released by the NSW Local Court in December.
According to the fact sheet, they had amassed six guns, including two single-barrel shotguns and a Beretta rifle (Sajid had a NSW licence for firearms). They had made three pipe bombs, one tennis ball bomb, and a large IED bomb, police allege.

Unused laws leave low-income energy support gathering dust

Unused laws leave low-income energy support gathering dust
Victorians on low incomes are missing out on big discounts for air conditioners and heaters because the state government has failed to introduce reforms intended to provide energy bill support to those in the greatest need.
Almost a year after amending its Victorian Energy Upgrades [VEU] program so it could become more accessible to vulnerable consumers, the Allan government is yet to enact the changes.
While the financial support the VEU program was supposed to provide sits unused, a new report by the Brotherhood of St Laurence shows there are significant benefits on chronic conditions, financial security and overall health by undertaking the energy upgrades it is supposed to provide.
The Brotherhood has called on the state to make these programs more accessible, with upfront costs a significant barrier to their uptake.
Under VEU program, households can receive discounts on new electric appliances if they are replacing gas or less energy-efficient models. But the program has been criticised at times for being most beneficial to those with higher incomes because of upfront costs, including a $200 co-payment scheme designed to stop rorting of the program for products such as cook tops and heat pumps.
In legislation introduced last year, the Allan government appeared to acknowledge this issue by adding a clause that allowed for future discounts “specifically for vulnerable and low-income consumers”.
“This will enable greater access to participate in the VEU program in future, especially as cost-of-living pressures continue,” Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio said.
But as rising costs continue to trouble many across the state, Brotherhood of St Laurence climate lead David Bryant said the upfront spending requirements continued to limit the program’s take-up.
“We’re very supportive of existing supports and subsidy programs for upgrades, but it is important people with low incomes and health conditions are not left behind,” he said.
“A lot of people don’t have money lying around to upgrade their homes even though it would lower their bills and help them live more healthily in the longer term.”
“[The VEU] In particular, doesn’t have any particular focus on low-income people, so we definitely support measures to have some sort of low-income stream or additional incentives.”
A pilot program delivered by the Brotherhood saw solar, airconditioning and insulation upgrades provided in 126 homes for people on low incomes with chronic health conditions.
About 90 per cent of participants in the Climate Safe Homes pilot reported better temperatures indoors and half reported lower energy bills. Solar upgrades cut annual bills by $100 on average.
However, more than two-thirds of those who received solar or reverse-cycle airconditioning said they wouldn’t upgrade without the support of the program.
Bryant said there were some people who simply couldn’t afford a co-payment or upfront cost to afford energy upgrades, creating gaps in the rollout of modern living standards.
He said the additional rebates flagged by the government were a good idea, while other states also had “priority groups” which meant a certain percentage of upgrades had to be delivered for people in these groups.
The introduction of $200 co-payments in the VEU was partly driven by installers who rorted the scheme.
In 2023, dozens of display fridges were dumped outside businesses by installers looking to claim lucrative green certificates without actually replacing ageing appliances.
Bryant said this showed the rebates needed to be managed carefully, with truly free appliances only available to those who need it most.
Victoria Johnson, who managed the scheme for the Brotherhood, said they hoped to show that energy upgrades programs could be targeted at lower income earners suffering from poor temperature conditions.
“People reported really strong outcomes, with their health improved or maintained,” she said.
A government spokesperson said the VEU is available to all Victorians and there were currently additional supports ready for families feeling financial stress, including a $100 Power Saving Bonus.
Ceiling insulation will also be available under the VEU this year, which is expected to cut installation costs by up to $1500.

Qld’s new top cop ‘one of the best policing minds in Australia’
Updated ,first published
A former state and federal deputy police commissioner has been parachuted into Queensland’s top law enforcement job after the shock announcement its outgoing boss will leave the role again.
Brett Pointing will take up the role of Queensland police commissioner on a 12-month interim basis from next week, taking over as Steve Gollschewski retires to focus on his health.
Appearing with Police Minister Dan Purdie at a media conference announcing his appointment in Brisbane on Monday morning, Pointing said the role felt like “coming home”.
Pointing is from a police family and previously rose to the rank of deputy commissioner in the state police force before moving to the same rank in the Australian Federal Police.
He spent the past 18 months as one of four members of the panel driving the recent 100-day review of Queensland police.
Gollschewski said Pointing had “one of the best policing minds in Australia”.
“I’m very blessed that I’m not starting from scratch,” Pointing said, declining to answer many questions until he received a briefing from Gollschewski this week.
Pointing said he would apply for the full-time role.
Purdie said Pointing was decided by he and Gollschewski over coffee last Friday, when the latter advised him he would bring forward the end to his term, originally set to be 2029.
“The Queensland Police is heading in the right direction, and Brett Pointing is the best person to continue that,” Purdie said.
“But my messaging to all police is that, you know, he is picking up the work of Steve Gollschewski.”
Answering other questions at the media conference, Purdie would not be drawn on his support for the new police integrity unit called for by the 2022 Richards Inquiry, deferring questions about its progress to Attorney-General Deb Frecklington.
While Purdie also said the government “don’t want people at a protest or elsewhere” chanting pro-Palestinian phrases set to be banned under proposed new laws, he said the “viability” of enforcing the ban on a large crowd would be up to police.

Kim Jong un opens new housing district for families of North Koreans killed in Ukraine war
North Korea says it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine
- Bookmark
North Korea said Monday it completed a new housing district in Pyongyang for families of North Korean soldiers killed while fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine, the latest effort by leader Kim Jong Un to honor the war dead.
State media photos showed Kim Jong Un walking through the new street — called Saeppyol Street — and visiting the homes of some of the families with his increasingly prominent daughter, believed to be named Kim Ju Ae, as he pledged to repay the “young martyrs” who “sacrificed all to their motherland.”
In recent months, North Korea has intensified propaganda glorifying troops deployed to fight in Russia’s war against Ukraine, such as establishing a memorial wall and building a museum. Analysts see it as an effort to bolster internal unity and curb potential public discontent.
Kim in recent months has sent thousands of troops and large quantities of military equipment, including artillery and missiles, to fuel Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine, as the leaders align i n the face of their separate confrontations with Washington.
South Korea’s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers last week it estimates that about 6,000 North Korean troops were killed or wounded during their deployment in the war, but did not provide a breakdown of fatalities. The agency said last year it believed roughly 600 had died.
The spy agency believes North Korean forces are benefiting from the war by gaining modern combat experience and Russian technical support that could improve the performance of their weapons systems, according to lawmakers who attended last week’s closed-door briefing.

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. The Munich Security Conference was held under the banner of mobilizing the Old World for its confrontation with Russia, failing to bring peace in Ukraine any closer, Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the Russian State Duma Committee on International Affairs, said.
"The Munich Conference in Germany did not bring peace any closer. On the contrary, European globalists effectively presented a 'road map' for the militarization of Europe and the continued support of the terrorist regime in Kiev. Most European leaders' and Brussels bureaucrats' speeches were steeped in Russophobia and filled with revanchist rhetoric. Mutual support instead of realistic assessments and common sense. <...> Driving Europeans into a military concentration camp under the pretext of threats from the East, mobilizing the entire Old World and plunging it into direct conflict with Russia is the dream and, at the same time, the number one goal of the 'Eurohawks,' under whose auspices the Munich Conference on ‘security’ was held," the lawmaker wrote on his Telegram channel.
Slutsky noted that European leaders are eager to sit down at the negotiating table to settle the conflict in Ukraine but all they can offer is a continuation of the war leading to a "Euro-apocalypse." According to the lawmaker, in this regard, Vladimir Zelensky has taken up the militaristic spirit by "pushing the idea of Ukraine's NATO membership while making rude comments along the way."

Democrats prepare to spend millions in Virginia redistricting effort, top lawmaker says
This aggressive push for new voting maps is part of an increasingly partisan approach to redistricting

The Democratic Party is preparing to invest tens of millions into a redistricting initiative in Virginia, aiming to secure an additional four seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries confirmed the party's commitment, stating on CNN's State of the Union program that Democrats will do "whatever it takes" to ensure a Virginia ballot initiative succeeds in an April voter referendum.
This aggressive push for new voting maps in Virginia and Maryland is part of an increasingly partisan approach to redistricting. It seeks to bolster Democratic representation in Congress and offset similar efforts by Republicans, who have already enacted new district lines in states such as Texas, Missouri, Ohio, and North Carolina.
These strategic maneuvers come ahead of November's midterm elections, with Republicans currently holding a slim majority in the House.
Voters in California approved a Democratic-backed redistricting measure. Some Democrats also hope to redraw the congressional map in Maryland to eliminate its sole Republican-held seat, but the state Senate president, Democrat Bill Ferguson, said there is not enough support in his chamber and that he does not plan to hold a vote on the bill.
Jeffries on Sunday said he had not recently spoken to Ferguson, but would have a conversation with him "at some point" if he continues to oppose the redistricting proposal.
The effort to redraw districts comes months ahead of the November midterm elections, where Democrats will try to wrest control of the U.S. Congress from Republicans. In response to a question about what Democrats would spend on the Virginia effort, Jeffries told CNN the party will do "whatever it takes" to win that April referendum.
The U.S. Supreme Court in 2019 stripped federal courts of their power to police partisan voting maps, opening the door to state-by-state battles to craft congressional districts. Last year, Republican President Donald Trump demanded that his party redraw the maps to their benefit, sparking a battle with Democrats who in turn adopted a more aggressive approach to the issue.
The Virginia Supreme Court said on Friday it would allow a Democratic-backed redistricting effort to head to a voter referendum in April.
"We're striking back," Jeffries told CNN. "We're going to make sure that there's a fair national map."
U.S. Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, said on CBS News' "Face the Nation" that he worried about his party's ability to maintain control in the House, partly because of redistricting.

A new diagnosis of ‘profound autism’ is under consideration. Here’s what parents need to know
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

08:41:01 KST

When it comes to autism, few questions spark as much debate as how best to support autistic people with the greatest needs.
This prompted the Lancet medical journal to commission a group of international experts to propose a new category of “profound autism”.
This category describes autistic people who have little or no language (spoken, written, signed or via a communication device), who have an IQ of less than 50, and who require 24-hour supervision and support.
It would only apply to children aged eight and over, when their cognitive and communication abilities are considered more stable.
In our new study, we considered how the category could impact autism assessments. We found 24% of autistic children met, or were at risk of meeting, the criteria for profound autism.
Why the debate about a ‘profound autism’ category?
The category is intended to help governments and service providers plan and deliver supports, so autistic people with the highest needs aren’t overlooked. It also aims to re-balance their under-representation in mainstream autism research.
This new category may be helpful for advocating for a greater level of support, research and evidence for this group. But some have raised concerns that autistic people who don’t fit into this category could be perceived as less in need and excluded from services and funding supports.
Others argue the category doesn’t sufficiently emphasise autistic people’s strengths and capabilities, and places too much emphasis on the challenges that are experienced.
What did we do?
We conducted the first Australian study to examine how the “profound autism” category might apply to children attending publicly funded diagnostic services for developmental conditions.
Drawing on the Australian Child Neurodevelopment Registry, we examined data from 513 autistic children assessed between 2019 and 2024. We asked:
-
How many children met the criteria for profound autism?
-
Were there behavioural features that set this group apart?
Because we focused on children at the time of diagnosis, most (91%) were aged under eight years. We described these children as being “at risk of profound autism”.
What did we find?
About 24% of autistic children in our study met, or were at risk of meeting, the criteria for profound autism. This is similar to the proportion of children internationally.
Almost half (49.6%) showed behaviours that were a safety risk, such as trying to run away from carers, compared with one-third (31.2%) of other autistic children.
These challenges weren’t limited to children who met criteria for profound autism. About one in five autistic children (22.5%) engaged in self-injury and more than one-third (38.2%) showed aggression toward others.
So, while the category identified many children with very high needs, other children who didn’t meet these criteria also had significant needs.
Importantly, we found the definition of “profound autism” doesn’t always line up with the official diagnostic levels which determine the level of support and national disability insurance scheme funding children receive.
In our study, 8% of children at risk of profound autism were classified as level 2, rather than level 3 (the highest level of support). Meanwhile, 17% of children classified as level 3 did not meet criteria for profound autism.
Our concern
We looked at children when they first received an autism diagnosis. Children were aged 18 months to 16 years, with more than 90% under the age of eight. This aligns with our earlier research showing that the average age of diagnosis in public settings is 6.6 years.
From a practical perspective, our biggest concern about the profound autism category is the age threshold of eight years. Because most children are already assessed before age eight, introducing this category into assessment services would mean many families would need repeat assessments, placing additional strain on already stretched developmental services.
Second, modifications will be needed if this criteria is going to be used to inform funding decisions as it didn’t map perfectly on to level 3 support criteria.
On balance, however, our results suggest the profound autism category may provide a clear, measurable way to describe the needs of autistic people with the highest support requirements.
Every autistic child has individual strengths and needs. The term “profound autism” would need to be promoted with inclusive and supportive language, so as to not replace or diminish individual needs, but to help clinicians tailor supports and obtain additional resources when needed.
Including the category in future clinical guidelines, such as the national guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism, could help ensure governments, disability services and clinicians plan and deliver supports.
What can you do in the meantime?
If you’re concerned your child requires substantial support, here are some practical steps you can take to ensure their needs are recognised and addressed:
Explain your concerns
Not all clinicians have experience working with children with high support needs. Be as clear as possible about behaviours that affect your child’s safety or daily life, including self-injury, aggression or attempts to run away. These details, while difficult to share, help give a clearer picture of your child’s support needs.
It can also be a challenge to find and access clinicians with appropriate expertise. Another potential benefit of having a defined category is that it can better help families navigate care.
Ask about support for the whole family
Our studies show that many caregivers want more support for themselves but don’t always ask. Talk with clinicians about supports for yourself as well, including respite care or family support groups.
Reach out
Coming together with other carers and families can reduce your own isolation and normalise many of the unique challenges you face. Connecting with like-minded people can provide a supportive, empathetic and empowering community.
Plan for safety
For children with high support needs, prioritise safety planning with your child’s care team. This can include strategies to reduce risks, as well as planning how best to support your child’s interactions with health, education and disability services.

‘Hello girls!’: Epstein donated to Harvard student group for years after sex conviction
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK - Long after Jeffrey Epstein was known as a convicted sex offender, he was also a top contributor to an elite cluster of groups founded by Harvard University students. For years, he was able to fill a table with “girls” at an annual gala that featured celebrities, billionaires and cultural luminaries.
Annual donations of at least US$50,000 to the Hasty Pudding Institute of 1770 – a nonprofit umbrella for a social club, theater troupe and a cappella singers – qualified him as a “Guardian of the Sphinx” at Order of the Golden Sphinx galas in New York from at least 2013 to 2019. His final invitation came just months before he was charged with federal sex-trafficking crimes and then hanged himself in a Manhattan jail.
Documents released by the Justice Department, including e-mails sent by an assistant, indicate Epstein would often fill his table with female acquaintances.
“Hello girls! Jeffrey would like you all to attend the Hasty Pudding Gala on April 13 at the Plaza Hotel,” Epstein’s assistant wrote in 2015 to recipients whose identities were redacted. “Let me know if you can go and who else we can invite to make the 10 (with JE approval of course ;)”
To one invitee, the assistant touted a chance to “wear a fancy dress and shoes”.
The vast trove of e-mails in the DOJ files
The social club is “a cornerstone of the Harvard experience”, according to the organisation’s website. It’s the oldest club of its kind in the US and counts five former US presidents among its membership. “There is no other collegiate organisation quite like it in the world,” the website says.
A spokesperson for Harvard did not respond to requests for comment about Epstein’s involvement with the Hasty Pudding Institute.
From 2013 until his death, Epstein donated at least US$375,000 to the organisation, the Justice Department documents show. That figure was reported earlier by the Harvard Crimson.
E-mails in the documents indicate that in 2018, Epstein asked Mr Andrew Farkas, a real estate titan and Harvard booster who chairs the Hasty Pudding Institute, if he wanted his table of 10 at the gala. Mr Farkas replied “yes pls”. Mr Farkas and Epstein exchanged nearly 2,000 messages that were released as part of the DOJ trove and their relationship spanned more than a decade.
The Hasty Pudding Institute said in an e-mailed response to questions that it is “perpetually focused on doing right”. The organisation said that it has made donations to a charity that supports trafficking victims in an amount that “far” exceeds contributions that Epstein made to the club.
“I deeply regret ever having met this individual, but at no time have I conducted myself inappropriately,” Mr Farkas said in an e-mailed statement. “There has been no evidence of any wrongdoing or impropriety.”
Harvard has known for years that it has a Jeffrey Epstein problem and has launched multiple probes into its ties to the sex offender. Epstein chatted and collaborated with major Harvard benefactors, corresponded with university professors and offered advice on admissions to associates and their children, the DOJ files show. In e-mails, Epstein and his assistants frequently mentioned plans to be on campus for meetings.
While Epstein’s broad involvement with Harvard has been known, the extent of his ties with Hasty Pudding has not been as well documented. The organisation – like many others Epstein donated to – is a symbol of status and tradition, and Epstein used his support to help launder his reputation. In a press release from March 2014, he framed his donations as an extension of his Harvard giving.
Epstein was asked by his assistant in March of 2019 if he wanted to invite guests to the gala that year or donate the table for others to use, according to the DOJ files. He appears to have begun coordinated to fill his table but ultimately gave it away. In July 2019, Epstein was arrested, with prosecutors in New York alleging he had abused girls as young as 14. Epstein was found dead a month later.
Other invitations to “girls” to sit at Epstein’s table at the Hasty Pudding gala include a last-minute request in 2015 after the event had already started to add “another girl” to fill in for someone who was not able to attend.
“Thank you for including me last night,” wrote one attendee after the 2014 gala. “It was fun to catch up with all the girls.”
That same year, Epstein’s assistant asked the financier if one of the invitees should be flown to New York for the event. “No have her come straight to isalnd,” he replied.
In 2018, an event organiser asked Epstein if his donation that year should be labeled as coming from “Anonymous” in the printed program, but Epstein responded “full name,” according to e-mails released by the Justice Department.
At the gala, Guardians of the Sphinx attendees receive a prime table for speeches, award presentations and performances from undergraduate and alumni members of the institute’s theater and a cappella groups, alongside access to a VIP after-party. Guests are served dinner and the traditional Hasty Pudding dessert.
Hasty Pudding has feted prominent figures at annual events for centuries, with the likes of Marc Anthony, Neil Patrick Harris and Dr Oz present in recent years.
A report published by Harvard in 2020 showed the university received more than US$9 million in gifts from Epstein between 1998 and 2008 – when he pleaded guilty to Florida state charges that included procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution – to support research and faculty activities. No gifts were received from Epstein following his conviction.
Harvard in November said it would reexamine its connections to Epstein after an earlier batch of documents showed significant correspondence with Dr Larry Summers, a professor at the school and its former president. Dr Summers, who has said he regretted his relationship with Epstein, took a leave of absence from teaching and stepped back from other public roles.
That ongoing review includes donors to the university mentioned in the Epstein documents, according to university spokesperson Jason Newton.
Harvard in 2011 announced it would rename its New College Theatre “Farkas Hall” in recognition of contributions from Mr Farkas, an 1982 graduate of the university. He is also listed as pledging at least US$100,000 to Harvard’s Stem Cell Institute in 2013.
That’s the same year he started the gala for the Hasty Pudding Institute. The impact on its finances show up in the group’s tax filings. In 2012, the institute reported US$197,898 in contributions. In 2013, the amount jumped to almost US$1.6 million.
Mr Farkas made Epstein a partner in a small marina in 2007, and began contacting Epstein about donating to Hasty Pudding at least as early as 2012. In 2013, Epstein’s assistant said it was not necessary for the men to talk on the phone, because Epstein would donate “no matter what :).” That year he gave US$75,000 through two separate payments.

"Overnight, U.S. forces conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding of the Veronica III without incident in the INDOPACOM area of responsibility," the statement said.
It noted that the vessel "tried to defy President Trump's quarantine" and hoped "to slip away."
"We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.," the statement emphasized.
We defend the Homeland forward. Distance does not protect you.

The Defense Department also warned that it has the "reach, endurance, or will" for such pursuits.
"International waters are not sanctuary. By land, air, or sea, we will find you and deliver justice," the message stressed.
The Pentagon stated that it will "deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain."
According to Ukraine's Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense, the VLCC-class tanker Veronica III was involved in the illegal transportation of hundreds of thousands of metric tons of sanctioned Iranian oil on behalf of the sanctioned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC).
As Ukrinform previously reported, on January 7 the Pentagon together with the United States Department of Homeland Security detained the sanctioned shadow fleet tanker M/T Sophia in the Caribbean Sea.

WA news LIVE: WA announces tough new laws to stamp out ‘tobacco thugs’

Great Northern Highway to remain closed until at least Wednesday
By
A main arterial highway in WA’s north will be closed until at least Wednesday as flooding cuts off parts of the Kimberley and Pilbara.
The Great Northern Highway closed on the weekend due to rising flood levels across the north, and has remained closed throughout Monday.
The Fitzroy River is currently 11.3 metres and rising, with the river height expected to reach a top of 11.7 metres on Tuesday.
The Department of Fire and Emergency Services said they are helping with re-supply drops throughout the surrounding remote communities, and told locals they did not expect the floodwaters to impact their homes.
Parts of the Fitzroy Crossing town site have been cut off as the river rises, as the tropical low continues to move across the town.
The last time Fitzroy Crossing and the surrounding Fitzroy Valley experienced flooding to this degree was in 2023, when the river reached 14.32 metres.
A number of homes were destroyed in the flood, including the town’s main bridge.
WA Police have announced they have charged 19 people with a total of 65 offences through Taskforce Maverick – set up to stop the supply of illicit tobacco and vapes.
A Geraldton fisher has chained himself to the roof of the local fisheries office to protest the WA government’s new demersal ban.
Tens of thousands of West Australian teenagers younger than 18 will miss out on an average of $655 each in superannuation this year, according to an advocacy body that argues new polling shows overwhelming support to change “outdated” super laws.
We look back at a cold case from here in Perth: the story of Gwenneth Graham. The next part in the series will drop online on Wednesday.
One Nation has drawn level with the Coalition for the first time, setting up a fierce battle for Australia’s conservative vote and making clear the enormous challenge confronting newly installed Liberal leader Angus Taylor.

Geraldton fisher protests demersal ban by chaining self to roof of fisheries office
By
A Geraldton fisher has chained himself to the roof of the local fisheries office to protest the WA government’s new demersal ban.
Shark fisher John Higham, who runs Higham Fresh Fish in Geraldton, took the stand on Monday morning, claiming in a Facebook post: “one man, one sign, one demand”.
He said he could no longer use his valid shark license because of potential demersal bycatch, and demanded Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries Jackie Jarvis to return his license so he can “go back to work”.
Fishing advocacy groups claimed they were blindsided by the state government’s decision to enforce a sweeping demersal fishing ban, effective from January 1, 2026, without proper consultation.
Many fishers say they’ve lost their livelihoods overnight with a legal challenge mounted in the Supreme Court of Western Australia, including Higham.
“It’s just been kicked in the guts really, like, how am I gonna pay my mortgage now?” he said at the time.
WA Police said they were aware of Higham’s protest and have attended the scene.
It comes after three men were charged after dumping shark heads and fish remains outside the Margaret River electoral office of Jarvis’ over the bans in December, with one later fronting court dressed as a shark.

‘Dimwitted’: Teens arrested over planned attack on Perth tobacconist
By
Turning back to the news of the day – the illegal tobacco trade – and vision of a car chase which led to the arrest of a teenager who was allegedly planning to attack a Rockingham convenience store has been released.
The vision shows an allegedly stolen vehicle, being pursued by multiple police cars, losing control before flipping several times.
Detective Acting Senior Sergeant David Knight, from the Transnational Serious Organised Crime Squad, said police will allege a 15-year-old boy became involved in an evade police incident in a stolen Toyota Hilux.
Further inquiries then allegedly identified his intentions to carry out an attack on the Rockingham business.
A 16-year-old boy was also arrested over his alleged involvement at a home in Queens Park, and a 24-year-old Clarkson man has also been charged with one count of attempting to pervert the course of justice.
Officers also arrested an 18-year-old man at a home in Gosnells over his alleged involvement in three separate instances at tobacco stores in Beechboro, Ballajura and Rockingham in January.
Knight said organised crime syndicates were promising cash incentives for others to carry out their dirty work, including attacking convenience stores.
“These syndicates will use anybody they can find that’s dumb enough to be involved in this,” Knight said.
“Cash incentives are often promised by organised crime groups for others to carry out their dirty work for them, including the acts of violence, damaging property and intimidating others.
“But let me be clear about this, no one has ever been paid – for all those people we’ve charged, they all report they haven’t been paid a cent.
“You need to question whether the prospect of spending 25 years in prison over vapes and cigarettes is really worth it.”
Knight said it was “dimwitted people” carrying out the offences, and that the firebombings were not always successful, but the ability for the plans to cause widespread harm meant it “deserves the resources we’re throwing at it”.

Injured star Matt Rowell won’t give Origin the finger
By Justin Chadwick
Brownlow medallist Matt Rowell has thrown his support behind State of Origin football despite being one of several players injured in Victoria’s 24-point win over Western Australia on Saturday.
Rowell is set to undergo further assessments after injuring a finger on his left hand in Victoria’s 18.17 (125) to 15.11 (101) win in front of 58,141 fans at Optus Stadium.
The star Gold Coast midfielder, who tallied 17 disposals and three clearances before going off injured in the second half, wasn’t the only one left worse for wear.
Carlton vice-captain Jacob Weitering was taken to hospital after Port Adelaide’s Mitch Georgiades fell on him during a marking contest.
Weitering has since been cleared of any neck, spinal or major internal injuries, but he still has a sore chest and is in doubt for Carlton’s season opener against Sydney on March 5.
Georgiades, Adelaide recruit Callum Ah Chee and GWS defender Sam Taylor all failed to finish the game for WA due to slight hamstring niggles.
Despite the risk of injury, Rowell gave State of Origin his full support.
“I’m still all for it,” Rowell replied when asked if he felt any differently about the concept after being injured.
“Given the way it was played, hopefully we can keep doing it every year and even grow it more.
“All the players are for it. WA and Victoria got right behind it.
“The city of Perth and WA as a whole got behind it, so it means a lot to a lot of people.”

WA MP tipped to return to frontbench as Taylor eyes new team
By Rob Harris
One you may have missed from yesterday, as the fallout from Angus Taylor’s successful Liberal leadership challenge continues to reverberate around Canberra...
Taylor is poised to bring back exiled conservative figures including WA’s Andrew Hastie and NT Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price to frontline politics as he attempts to salvage the Coalition’s record-low standing in opinion polls.
Taylor is expected to announce his new frontbench in the coming days as he attempts to move on from weeks of bitter infighting and debate that led to Friday’s toppling of Sussan Ley after just 276 days in the job. The Coalition trails Pauline Hanson’s One Nation in several major polls after recording its lowest-ever primary vote at last year’s federal election.
Victorian MP Tim Wilson is widely expected among his Liberal colleagues to be appointed shadow treasurer to take on an economic fight with the Albanese government.
Hastie, who resigned from Ley’s frontbench in October over immigration policy, was being touted by colleagues as a candidate for the industry portfolio.
He’s a steam train: Why Charlie Cameron rates Waterman
By Justin Chadwick
He’s already a cult hero at West Coast, and it seems Jake Waterman won over another new fan in State of Origin - Brisbane premiership star Charlie Cameron.
While Jesse Hogan deservedly won most of the plaudits for his five-goal haul that almost dragged Western Australia over the line against Victoria, Waterman played an important cameo as the home side fought tooth and nail to stay in the contest.
Waterman kicked two goals – including a tough 50m set shot from an angle in the third quarter – as WA mounted a comeback from 30 points down.
Victoria eventually held on for a 24-point win, but Waterman’s return of 2.2, eight marks and 12 disposals didn’t go unnoticed.
Cameron played with fellow WA stars Kysaiah Pickett and Shai Bolton in the Indigenous All-Stars match last year.
He said playing alongside Patrick Cripps, Aaron Naughton and Tom Barrass in Origin was also special.
But it was the man with the mullet who truly captured Cameron’s attention at a sold-out Optus Stadium on Saturday night.
“Probably my favourite was Jake Waterman,” Cameron said.
“He’s a cult figure for West Coast. When he gets up and about, he’s a steam train. It was pretty cool to see him get going.
“I played (under 18s) state football with Crippa and Tom Barrass back in 2013, so a while ago.
“But mixing with some of the best players, it was pretty cool and I’m just grateful I had the opportunity.”
Waterman earned his first All-Australian honours in 2024 after kicking 53 goals from 20 games in a struggling West Coast side.
A dislocated shoulder ended his 2025 campaign after just eight appearances, but the 27-year-old’s strong showing in the State of Origin clash bodes well for the year ahead.
Cameron also looks primed for a strong season after kicking three goals and having two score assists in an impressive display against Victoria.
Brisbane are attempting to complete a hat-trick of flags this year, and Cameron again looms as a crucial figure in attack.
The 31-year-old was thrilled to take part in the first State of Origin match since 1999, and is backing the concept to thrive into the future.
There’s even a case to play two State of Origin matches next year, featuring Victoria, WA, South Australia and the Allies.
“I think it’s only going to get better and stronger, and I think a lot of players are going to come back,” Cameron said.

WA teenagers missing out on hundreds of dollars in super under ‘outdated’ law
By
Tens of thousands of West Australian teenagers younger than 18 will miss out on an average of $655 each in superannuation this year, according to an advocacy body that argues new polling shows overwhelming support to change “outdated” super laws.
Currently, workers younger than 18 are only legally guaranteed super if they work more than 30 hours a week, a rule brought in to prevent fees eroding low-balance super accounts.
However, the Super Members Council argues fee protections on smaller super balances means the argument doesn’t stand up.
And it points to a Pyxis survey which shows 73 per cent of Australians support changing the law so workers get paid super at all ages.
It also follows a report from the council in December that showed scrapping the 30-hour threshold would help close the gender super gap.
The council said about 54,000 under-18s in WA alone would miss out on $655 each on average this year. About 515,000 workers nationally will be excluded from a combined $405 million.
Council chief executive Misha Schubert said it was time to fix the “outdated rule”.
“The sooner you get super, the more it’ll look after you. Missing out on super before 18 can cost some young people $11,000 by retirement,” she said.

Multiple people charged over supply of illicit tobacco, vapes
By
To crime news now, but sticking with the topic of illicit tobacco, and WA Police have announced they have charged 19 people with a total of 65 offences through Taskforce Maverick – set up to stop the supply of illicit tobacco and vapes.
Police have released a statement revealing they have observed an escalation in offending by organised crime groups who import and sell the products.
“Increased consumer demand for cheap cigarettes and e‐cigarettes, combined with regulatory gaps in importation and retail controls, has been exploited by these groups who employ violence, intimidation and extortion tactics against competitors and legitimate vendors,” their statement read.
Most recently, Taskforce Maverick have charged several individuals regarding their alleged involvement in the planning of an attack on a tobacco and convenience store in Rockingham,
In a separate incident, on February 6, detectives attended a unit on Focal Way in Bayswater and seized more than 3.9 million cigarettes, 3900 vapes and 288 kilograms of loose tobacco – one of the largest seizures to date in WA.
The total retail value of these items was approximately $4.5 million dollars.
Serious and Organised Crime Squad Detective Superintendent Rob Scantlebury said police would be “relentless in our efforts to shut these operations down and hold those involved accountable by putting them before the courts”.
“Individuals tempted to engage in acts of violence, damaging property and intimidating others need to decide whether it’s worth the risk of going to jail for twenty-five years to life over vapes and cigarettes,” he said.

WA announces tough new laws to stamp out ‘tobacco thugs’
By
To breaking news first up, the state government has announced new laws aimed at stamping out the illicit tobacco and vape trade, on the first sitting day of Parliament for 2026.
Under the proposed changes to the Tobacco Products Control Act 2006, the maximum penalty for possession of a large commercial quantity of illicit tobacco and vaping products will be $4.2 million for an individual or $21 million for a company, and 15 years imprisonment.
Store closure orders of up to 90 days will also be introduced, meaning businesses supplying illegal products will not be able to operate while investigations take place.
The changes will mean WA has some of the strongest penalties in Australia.
Premier Roger Cook has said these new laws are aimed at stopping “tobacco thugs”.
“New legislation being introduced this week will help crush the dangerous illegal tobacco and vape trade – and drive criminals out of business,” he said.
“The changes are in addition to a range of new measures, including our newly expanded compliance unit which has already seen an increase in seizures of illicit products.”
Police Minister Reece Whitby said over the summer, multiple WA businesses selling tobacco had been targeted by organised crime networks.
“Police have seen the impact of the illicit tobacco trade, and these tougher laws will help disrupt this criminal activity,” he said.
“These new laws that will give both the Department of Health and WA Police additional powers to shut down illegal shops and increase penalties for those who break the law.”

Israel bombs Lebanon-Syria border, kills four people
Lebanese authorities say Israeli forces bombed a vehicle near the border, killing at least four people.
Israeli forces have bombed a vehicle near Lebanon’s border with Syria, killing at least four people, according to the Lebanese Ministry of Public Health.
The Israeli air strike took place early on Monday morning, it said in a statement.

Lebanon’s National News Agency said one of the victims was a Syrian national named Khaled Mohammad al-Ahmad.
The Israeli military confirmed the air strike, claiming in a post on X that it targeted members of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in Lebanon. It did not provide evidence for its claim.
The Israeli military said the raid took place in the Majdal Anjar area of Lebanon.
There was no immediate comment from the PIJ.
The PIJ is an armed group in the occupied Palestinian territory, fighting alongside Hamas in Gaza for the establishment of a Palestinian state. It is also an ally of the Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah, which launched attacks on northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians after the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza in 2023.
Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a ceasefire in November 2024, but the Israeli military has continued to carry out near-daily attacks on Lebanon, in violation of the United States-brokered truce.
According to the United Nations, the Israeli military launched more than 10,000 air and ground attacks in the year since it agreed to halt hostilities.
The UN’s rights office said in November last year that it verified at least 108 civilian casualties from Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, including at least 21 women and 16 children.
At least 11 Lebanese civilians were also abducted by Israeli forces during that time period, the office said.
Lebanon filed a complaint with the UN last month about the repeated Israeli violations, urging the UN Security Council to push Israel to end its attacks and fully withdraw from the country.
The complaint said Israel violated Lebanon’s sovereignty at least 2,036 times in the last three months of 2025 alone.
Israel also continues to occupy five areas in Lebanese territory, blocking the reconstruction of destroyed border villages and preventing tens of thousands of displaced people from returning to their homes.

Iran urges US to negotiate independently of Israeli influence in nuclear talks

Iran has urged the US to assess its interests independently of Israeli influence in negotiations over Tehran’s nuclear programme.
In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, said the negotiation process is continuing and that regional countries are also making efforts to help the talks succeed.
Addressing a letter sent via Omani Foreign Minister Badr bin Hamad al-Busaidi conveying Tehran’s positions to the US, Larijani said that no official response has been received.
He emphasised that Iran remains open to cooperation in the negotiations and continues to support talks, noting there was common ground between Tehran and Washington on Iran not possessing nuclear weapons, which it insists it is not pursuing.
Stressing that the negotiation process should not be prolonged, Larijani said Iran’s missile programme will not be part of the negotiations, as including other topics could disrupt the process.
“Our missile programme stands entirely separate from the nuclear one. It is a domestic matter, basically linked to our national security. As such, it cannot be part of these negotiations,” he said.
He also said the notion of Iran reducing its uranium enrichment to zero was “not on the table”.
“It is impractical for a country that has already mastered this technology to reduce it to zero,” he said, citing the need for enriched uranium for purposes such as health research and treatment.
Larijani also stressed that Iran is prepared for any potential threats and accused Israel of attempting to interfere in the negotiations and destabilise the region.
“Our negotiations are exclusively with the United States. We are not engaged in any talks with Israel,” he said. “However, Israel has inserted itself into this process, with their intent on undermining and sabotaging these negotiations.”
He noted that Iran is ready to cooperate with Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Türkiye to maintain regional stability.
Commenting on the 12-day war with Israel in June last year, Larijani conceded that Iran’s intelligence apparatus was not as strong as portrayed but noted that security measures have been strengthened and Israel’s attack fostered national unity.

From mink coats to Miami trips, cold wave in New York City spurs winter splurges

From mink coats to Miami trips, cold wave in New York City spurs winter splurges
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK – The cold plunge that has enveloped New York City and the north-east for weeks has many well-heeled residents coping the best way they know how: spending money.
At Madison Avenue Furs & Henry Cowit Inc in Manhattan’s Garment district, US$1,500 (S$1,895) mink jackets and raccoon coats are selling at unusual levels for the doldrum weeks of winter.
Spa appointments for sauna and jacuzzi treatments across the city are surging.
And four-figure “mercy trips” to warm destinations have normally cost-conscious travellers pulling out their credit cards.
In New York City, a nine-day stretch of below freezing temperatures from late January into early February was the longest since 2018, according to the National Weather Service.
New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani declared last week that local temperatures were colder than some parts of Antarctica.
The weather has come with grave costs.
More than two dozen people died during the stretch of subfreezing temperatures, city officials said.
And higher heating bills will stretch budgets for many, as National Grid has warned customers of unusually high heating bills.
In local stores, the cold spurred demand for winter essentials from Uniqlo Heattech items to snow pants, even as consumers reined in discretionary spending more broadly.
And though the long weekend is forecast to bring slightly warmer temperatures, those tired of the cold are making last-minutes escapes to warmer destinations.
Ms Alex Berman, 24, a marketing strategist who lives in New York, spent much of the January cold stretch in Miami, visiting her brother with her parents.
All told, she said their trip cost around US$5,000 for flights and lodging, excluding their rental car, spa and restaurant bills.
“I honestly don’t remember a winter that’s this cold,” Ms Berman said.
In two weeks, she’s splurging on another trip to the sunny Dominican Republic with her grandfather.
Travellers from cities affected by 2026’s cold front, including New York, Chicago and Boston, are fuelling a surge in bookings to warmer destinations, said Mr Jamie Lane, the chief economist and senior vice-president of analytics at AirDNA, a short-term rental data analytics firm.
Short-term rentals in Sarasota, Florida, and Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic saw a 31 per cent jump in December and January, compared with a year earlier, according to AirDNA data.
The trips come as average airfares in January for urban consumers hit US$279.69, up 6.5 per cent from January’s busy holiday season, according to CPI data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics.
For others, investing in warmer pieces of clothing was their way to fight the cold.
Ms Cinthia Mendez, 30, spent US$2,400 on a mink fur coat as an upgrade to her winter gear.
While she already had a heavy-duty Canada Goose jacket, the paralegal from New York wanted a nicer option that would be warm enough for the trek to dinner spots across Manhattan.
“The mink coat makes me feel warm and confident,” Ms Mendez said.
Sales at clothing and accessories stores nationally were up over 9 per cent year-over-year in January – and a slight month-over-month improvement after a strong holiday season, according to data from the CNBC/National Retail Federation Retail Monitor.
The record-low temperatures have driven more customers into winter gear establishments.
At Madison Avenue Furs & Henry Cowit, where fur coats sell from US$300 to US$40,000, owner Larry Cowit said sales in January were up 20 per cent from the same month in 2025.
“We were very active even before the storm, but with the cold we had this year I’m selling furs I haven’t in years like beaver and raccoon coats,” Mr Cowit said.
“It’s the coldest winter we’ve had in 20 years and fur is very nice to have when it’s this cold.”
Sales at restaurants in the New York Metro area were down by almost 20 per cent year-over-year the week the snowstorm hit in January, while retail activity was down 7.2 per cent, according to the Fiserv Small Business Index.
Instead, the low temperatures kept people cooped up at home and stocking up on groceries.
Foot traffic to restaurants and retail stores across the storm-impacted north-eastern states trailed, while activity at grocery stores spiked, according to data from Placer.ai.
Others have been resorting to warmer options closer to home, like the local spa.
After the snow and cold temperatures kept her indoors most days during the past few weeks, Ms Alena Coats, a 26-year-old nurse, treated herself to a spa day at the Bathhouse in Manhattan.
The weather has also pushed her to use ride-hailing applications more, “so I can be in a warm car,” she said.
QC New York Spa, located in Governor’s Island, saw a 12 per cent increase in sales in January, compared with 2025, according to managing director Daniela Masala.
Ms Inga Gordon, a manager at Great Jones Spa in East Village, estimated as much as a 20 per cent increase in visits to the spa’s water lounge with a jacuzzi, steam room and sauna.
Passes for the lounge start at US$60, and massages, scrubs and other treatments are around US$150 to US$300.
“We definitely saw a spike during the cold weather since we do have a really hot sauna and nice, warm jacuzzi,” Ms Gordon said. “We transform the cold New York into a sunny island.” BLOOMBERG

Indictment filed against Jerusalem man over alleged attempt to burn minor on bus

A Jerusalem resident has been indicted for allegedly attempting to set a 12-year-old minor on fire during a bus ride earlier this month, according to a statement issued by the State Attorney’s Office.
The indictment, filed Sunday by attorney Hili Bergman with the Jerusalem District Court, identified the suspect as Yaakov Yisrael Berkowitz, 31.
Berkowitz allegedly poured gasoline on the victim while on the bus following an earlier confrontation with the victim's father over supposed harassment toward children at a local synagogue they both attend.
According to the indictment, in the months preceding the incident, the defendant repeatedly harassed children who attended the synagogue where he prayed. The victim’s father later confronted him about the behavior on an unspecified date.
Plotting his revenge
This confrontation led Berkowitz to start planning his revenge earlier this month, according to the indictment.
"The defendant decided to harm either the minor or his father, obtained a bottle filled with gasoline, followed the family, and later boarded a bus on which the minor was traveling," read the indictment.
Berkowitz allegedly produced a lighter and attempted to set the boy on fire multiple times, but the device malfunctioned, allowing the victim to move away with only minor injuries to his hands, according to a police report.
Passengers who noticed the commotion alerted the bus driver, who immediately stopped the bus, unintentionally allowing the defendant to flee the scene. He was later apprehended by an Israel Police Special Patrol Unit (YASAM) officer and IDF troops operating in the area.
The indictment charges the defendant with attempted murder, attempted arson, and unlawful assault.

‘Adolescence’ and ‘Train Dreams’ win top prizes at Film Independent Spirit Awards
‘Adolescence’ and ‘Train Dreams’ win top prizes at Film Independent Spirit Awards
Clint Bentley’s lyrical Denis Johnson adaptation “Train Dreams " won the top film award at the Film Independent Spirit Awards on Sunday in Los Angeles, while “Adolescence” dominated the television categories. Both were released on Netflix.
Bentley also won best director for the film starring Joel Edgerton, whom he thanked profusely for “being the heartbeat of our film.”
“We’re so grateful to Netflix,” Bentley said. “It’s very, very hard these days to film in the United States, but it’s worth it and we’re proud to be able to pull it off.”
Edgerton missed out on the top acting prize, however, which went to Rose Byrne for “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” The organization switched to gender-neutral acting categories in 2022.
Byrne was one of the few actors nominated for both a Spirit Award and an Oscar, for her performance as a mother on the edge.
“I share this with Mary Bronstein, my writer-director who fought for eight years to get this movie made,” Byrne said.
She added that this was a film that could have only been made independently. Her character, she said, is “fierce and ferocious and a middle-aged woman.”
“Adolescence” won new scripted series, best actor for Stephen Graham, best supporting actor for Erin Doherty, and the breakthrough prize for Owen Cooper.
The show, which serves as a fundraiser for Film Independent’s year-round programs, was held at the Hollywood Palladium for the first time since 1994, as its longtime beachside perch in Santa Monica undergoes renovations. Comedian and “Saturday Night Live” veteran Ego Nwodim hosted the celebration of independent film and television, which was livestreamed on YouTube.
“In the spirit of independent filmmaking, we don’t have a permit,” Nwodim said in her opening. “If I shout ‘cameras down,’ you know what to do.”
“The Secret Agent” won the international feature prize. The film is also nominated for best picture and best international film at the Oscars.
“I really believe that programming films in the cinemas is more and more a political act,” said director Kleber Mendonça Filho.
He dedicated the award to the late actor Udo Kier, who was part of the ensemble of “The Secret Agent.”
“The Perfect Neighbor,” about a deadly shooting incident in Florida constructed primarily from police bodycam footage, won best documentary. Filmmaker and producer Geeta Gandbhir thanked Netflix for “giving us a global platform.” It’s also up for the best documentary Oscar.
Eva Victor won the screenplay prize for “Sorry, Baby.” Naomi Ackie also won the supporting award for Victor’s film, over fellow nominees like Zoey Deutch (“Nouvelle Vague”), Kirsten Dunst (“Roofman”), Nina Hoss (“Hedda”) and Archie Madekwe (“Lurker”).
The awards sometimes overlap significantly with major Oscar contenders and winners, as it did with “Anora,” and “Everything Everywhere All At Once,” and sometimes not. Organizers limit eligibility to productions with budgets less than $30 million, meaning more expensive films like “One Battle After Another” are not in the running.

Tyler Reddick wins the Daytona 500 for Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing

Michael Jordan’s Daytona 500 ring: Tyler Reddick’s 1-lap lead delivers NASCAR’s biggest win
Michael Jordan’s Daytona 500 ring: Tyler Reddick’s 1-lap lead delivers NASCAR’s biggest win
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Michael Jordan, six-time NBA champion, is now a Daytona 500 winner, too.
Tyler Reddick won “The Great American Race” on Sunday with a last-lap pass at Daytona International Speedway that sent Jordan into a frantic celebration. The NBA Hall of Famer bear-hugged Reddick in victory lane and then jointly hoisted the Harley J. Earl trophy with the 23XI Racing driver.
Jordan, who turns 63 on Tuesday, will get a Daytona 500 ring for his birthday and made it known in victory lane he wears a size 13.
“It feels like I won a championship, but until I get my ring, I won’t even know,” Jordan said.
The moment captured the message team co-owner Denny Hamlin — who finished 31st in Sunday’s bid to become the third driver in history to win four Daytona 500s — delivered to 23XI employees in a team meeting ahead of NASCAR’s season opener.
“He loves his race team,” Hamlin said, adding he reminded the team of the fulfillment they saw in Jordan when Reddick won at Talladega in 2024. “I was like ‘You know, you guys understand the responsibilities you have, that you have the power to bring joy to Michael Jordan. You have that power and nobody else can do it.’
“There’s nothing else that can bring him the joy that seeing what his team can do and they took it to heart.”
Reddick, in a Toyota, led only one lap Sunday: the one to the checkered flag. He was the 25th different driver to lead a lap for a new Daytona 500 record.
“Just incredible how it all played out. Just true Daytona madness,” Reddick said. “I’ve already lost my voice from screaming. Never thought I’d be Daytona 500 champion.”
Reddick, a 30-year-old from Corning, California, won for the ninth time in the Cup Series and first time since late in the 2024 season. Winless last year, Reddick was primarily focused on his infant son, who was found to have a tumor in his chest that affected his heart. Reddick opened last year with a runner-up finish in the Daytona 500.
He snapped the 38-race losing streak by finishing one place higher Sunday and winning to start a celebration that included multiple stars of NASCAR. It included Jordan, a global icon, and Hamlin, at 45 the oldest full-time driver in the Cup Series.
Reddick is teammates with Bubba Wallace, who went to victory lane in tears after leading a race-high 40 laps before finishing 10th. Jordan wrapped his arms around Wallace from behind and spoke closely into Wallace’s ear in a brief speech of encouragement.
“I don’t want my emotions to take away from the monumental day they just accomplished. Happy birthday, MJ. That’s a massive birthday present,” Wallace said. “I thought this was our week, the best 500 I’ve ever had, and come up short, sucks.
“Led a lot of laps, lap leader, I believe. It was a good day for us, but damn. Try again next year.”
Hamlin, who drives for Joe Gibbs Racing, was involved in the final caution when he and teammate Christopher Bell collided with nine laps remaining. It set up the final push to the finish over the final four laps.
Elliott grabbed the lead at the start of the final lap when Carson Hocevar was spun off the track. Reddick made a huge surge with an assist from teammate Riley Herbst, made contact with Elliott that caused Elliott to crash, then sailed past to give Jordan a victory in NASCAR’s biggest event of the year.
“It’s stuff you dream of as a kid,” said Reddick. “Now, I definitely didn’t look into the future and know that I would drive for Michael Jordan. But to be able to have someone like Michael Jordan believe in me enough, someone like Denny Hamlin.
“I’m just trying to do my best to live on the promises that I made to them and vice versa.”
Jordan was the face of the December federal antitrust lawsuit that NASCAR settled on the ninth day of trial. The settlement changed the revenue-sharing model in the United States’ top motorsports series.
Jordan watched the win from a suite overlooking the superspeedway built by the France family — NASCAR founders and private owners — that he just beat in federal court. NASCAR chairman Jim France, who was personally a defendant in the suit, went to victory lane to congratulate the winners.
“I can’t even believe it. It was so gratifying,” Jordan said of the victory. “You never know how these races are going to end. You just try to survive. We hung in there all day. Great strategy by the team, and we gave ourselves a chance at the end. Look, I’m ecstatic.”
The victory marked a Daytona sweep for three team owners heavily involved in the trial. Bob Jenkins, who joined 23XI in suing NASCAR, opened the weekend with a victory when Chandler Smith won the Truck Series opener on Friday night for Front Row Motorsports.
Richard Childress, who testified on behalf of 23XI and Front Row and was the subject of disparaging text messages by since-departed NASCAR chairman Steve Phelps, was the winning team owner Saturday when Austin Hill won.
Then it was time for Jordan and Hamlin, the two front-facing litigants, as they got their first Daytona 500 victory together.
“All we do is win,” shrugged Hamlin, who called the trio of weekend winners “coincidence.”
Former race winners Ricky Stenhouse Jr. and Joey Logano finished second and third as Toyota, Chevrolet and Ford each placed a driver on the podium. Elliott wound up fourth and sat dejected and in disbelief on the outside wall of the track after climbing from his car.
“We ended up kind of getting gifted the lead ... and then at that point in time, you’re just on defense. Man, that’s a really, really tough place to be, truthfully,” Elliott said. “Obviously looking back, you can run it through your mind 1,000 times, do you do something different?”

UK's Starmer seeks greater powers to regulate online access

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will seek broader powers to regulate internet access, which he said on Sunday was needed to protect children from fast-changing digital risks.
Britain's government said last month it would consult on an Australian-style social media ban for children under 16. Spain, Greece, and Slovenia have since said they plan bans.
"Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up," Starmer said in a statement.
The new powers are likely to lead to reduced parliamentary scrutiny of future curbs. Starmer's office said this was required so that after the review, "we can act fast on its findings within months, rather than waiting years for new primary legislation every time technology evolves."
More AI chatbots will also be covered by a ban on creating sexualised images without the subject's consent, after measures against Elon Musk's Grok, the government said.
These will be introduced as an amendment to existing crime and child-protection legislation being considered by parliament.
While aimed at shielding children, such measures often have knock-on implications for adults' privacy and ability to access services, and have led to tension with the US over limits on free speech and regulatory reach.
Imgur already blocking UK users
Websites such as image-hosting site Imgur, used to make memes and provide images for many general online discussion forums, blocked access to all British users last year and gave them blank images instead, after tighter age-verification rules.
Some major pornography websites have also blocked access for British users rather than verify their age, which they said was invasive of privacy and potentially insecure.
However, such geographic restrictions can be circumvented by using readily available virtual private networks, and the British government said its consultation on child safety would include potential age restrictions for VPNs.

Republican senator calls Trump ‘irresponsible’ over Greenland threats
President’s threats to occupy Greenland sparked wave of condemnations from European allies, and drew exasperation from Congress
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A Republican senator who has become one of Donald Trump’s most frequent critics on the issue of foreign policy called his threats towards Greenland a mistake on Sunday.
Sen. Thom Tillis told CBS News that the president was “irresponsible” for seeking anything beyond a reaffirmation of previous agreements giving the U.S. the ability to project naval power across the arctic.
“The reality is, to me, it was irresponsible to go anywhere other than figuring out how we modernize the 1951 Agreement, where Greenland and Denmark agreed to more or less give us unfettered access in Greenland to project power in the Arctic,” said the senator.
Tillis appeared on CBS’s Face the Nation for an interview on Sunday with Ed O’Keefe. During the interview, he blamed both the president and European leaders for using “hyperbolic language” to describe the situation with Greenland and NATO, in response to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declaring that the post-war liberal international order was “over” during a speech to the Munich Security Conference, where he declared that “this order, as flawed as it has been even in its heyday, no longer exists.”
“Only if the chancellor allows it to [end],” Tillis responded.
The North Carolina senator experienced a falling-out with Trump in 2025 over passage of the Republican “Big, Beautiful Bill”. Since then, he has been one of Trump’s strongest critics from the right on the issue of support for Europe and the NATO alliance, as well as on other issues like his mass deportation operation headed up by Kristi Noem and Tom Homan.
On Sunday he asserted that the U.S. and its European allies could reach a friendlier dynamic around the issue of NATO and Greenland if NATO countries acknowledged that the years of not making a 2% GDP benchmark of defense spending was a mistake. That benchmark, not required until 2024 and only a loose guideline prior to 2014, is now being met by every country in the alliance according to NATO data.
“If the NATO countries who came up short for decades would just admit that that was a mistake and then double, redouble their efforts, I think this goes away just like the hyperbolic language around Greenland,” said Tillis. “They’re not wrong to point out the deficiencies of the past.”
“Let’s just have an honest discussion with family members, and get the family right,” Tillis said.
President Trump’s threats to Greenland resumed in January and quickly caused a political earthquake across the Atlantic. The president asserted to Norway’s prime minister in a letter that he was considering using force to take the territory as a result of being snubbed for the Nobel Peace Prize. He later told reporters on Air Force One that “if we don’t take Greenland, Russia or China will. And I’m not letting that happen.”
He added that the territory would become a U.S. possession “one way or another,” and refused to elaborate. In the days following, his aides Stephen Miller and Karoline Leavitt caused further alarm by refusing to rule out military force when questioned directly by journalists. The president also threatened to mount 10% flat import tariffs against the U.K. and other European nations until Greenland was formally traded to the United States.
But he later backed down in a speech to the World Economic Forum in Davos, vowing that military force was off the table as an option. His announcement drew sighs of relief, and worries that enough damage to the U.S. 's standing with its NATO allies had already been done. The White House also walked back threats to impose new tariffs.
During Trump's second term last year, the NATO alliance pledged to make a new 5% GDP benchmark for defense spending by 2025. At least one country, Spain, says it will likely not meet this new goal.
The U.S. spent around 3.2% of its GDP on defense spending last year.

FBI confirms DNA recovered from glove found near Nancy Guthrie's home

08:22:43 KST

Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from a glove that was found near Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted two weeks ago, the FBI said on Sunday.
Results from the glove could potentially lead to what forensic experts call a "hit" as early as Monday after they have conducted a national database search on the DNA specimen, the FBI indicated in a statement.
The preliminary findings from a private crime laboratory in Florida were received by the FBI on Saturday and were awaiting "quality control and official confirmation" on Sunday before the results are submitted for comparison with known DNA profiles taken from individuals and crime scenes and stored in the national database, the FBI said.
The process of running a specimen through CODIS, short for the Combined DNA Index System, typically takes 24 hours from when the Federal Bureau of Investigation receives a DNA sample.
The glove is one of roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days in a roadside field about two miles from the Tucson-area residence of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US television journalist Savannah Guthrie. Most of the gloves recovered by investigators turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the vicinity, the FBI said.
But the one submitted for DNA analysis is "different and appears to match the gloves" worn by the man in a ski mask seen trying to disable Guthrie's door camera in the early morning hours shortly before she was abducted, according to the FBI statement.
Hours after the DNA announcement, Savannah Guthrie posted a video message on social media saying, "we still have hope" and urging whoever has her mother or knows her location "to do the right thing."
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Friday he was certain the person in the video, who was also wearing a gun in a holster and an overstuffed backpack, was the primary suspect investigators were looking for to solve the high-profile case.
Nancy Guthrie missing for over two weeks
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when family dropped her off at her home near Tucson after she had dined with them, and relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities have said.
Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.
At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them delivered initially to news media outlets. But there has been no known direct contact between Guthrie's presumed captors and her family, or with authorities.
Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA tests to have come from Guthrie, officials said last week. Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also had a pacemaker.
The sheriff said on Friday that DNA not from Nancy Guthrie or anyone close to her had also been collected from her property, but there has been no official word on any lab findings from those samples.
Savannah Guthrie, 54, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show "Today," has posted several video messages, along with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie, pleading for their mother's return and appealing for the public's help in solving the case. In one video, they expressed a willingness to meet ransom demands.
In her latest Instagram video, two weeks to the day after her mother was reported missing and directed to "whoever has her or knows where she is," the broadcast journalist said, "We believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it's never too late."
Nanos told Reuters on Friday no proof of life had surfaced since the abduction but added: "There's not been any proof of death either."
Acting on a federal court-ordered warrant in connection with the Guthrie case on Friday night, sheriff's deputies and FBI agents searched another house in an affluent neighborhood less than two miles from her home, authorities confirmed over the weekend.
The sheriff's office also said a person was questioned that night in a related traffic stop, but no arrests resulted from either incident.
The presumed kidnapping has drawn intense media attention as well as expressions of sympathy and support from US President Donald Trump.

Online savings: When gamification of investing becomes a risk

More than $7.5 million (about €6 million) in fines for launching virtual "confetti" at investors: That is the penalty the American brokerage platform Robinhood paid in January 2024 in the United States. This put an end to legal action by the Massachusetts financial markets regulator, which accused Robinhood of making trading seem like a game with these digital rewards. The regulator found that this encouraged young and inexperienced customers to take on risky transactions.
Researchers refer to these features as digital engagement practices (DEP): animations that cover your screen with each completed transaction, or virtual trophies awarded for making a profit. In the United Kingdom, a study by the financial services regulator found that such rewards, inspired by video games, led investors to increase their purchase volumes by over 10%.
A similar finding emerged from a study conducted in France by Marie-Hélène Broihanne, professor of finance at the University of Strasbourg. If investors received a bronze, silver or gold cup each time they took more risks, they would continue to increase their risk-taking. The opposite also held true. "If those who save prudently are rewarded, they will continue to do so," Broihanne said, regretting that platforms use gaming "only to encourage further investment."
Since the pandemic
This study was commissioned by France's Financial Markets Authority (AMF) in 2023. The French stock market regulator found that, since 2019, a growing number of people in France had turned to financial markets, especially since the Covid-19 pandemic. "More than 1.5 million new investors appeared, with a large share under the age of 35," said France Mayer, director of investor relations and protection at the AMF. To better support them, the Authority sought to understand their behavior.
At its request, Broihanne examined "copy trading," a practice that involves "copying another investor who has achieved very good results," said Emmanuel Sackmann, France director of the online broker eToro. The site, created in 2007, allows subscribers to invest in all types of assets, such as stocks and cryptocurrencies, or to copy the strategy of its 4,000 "top-investors" – star traders featured on the site's homepage, much like a leaderboard of top players.

Warner Bros reportedly considering restarting sale talks with Paramount
Members of Warner Bros' board are discussing whether Paramount's revised proposal offers a superior deal

- CommentsGo to comments
Warner Bros Discovery is reportedly considering reopening sale talks with rival Hollywood studio Paramount Skydance after an enhanced offer, a move that could affect its current deal with Netflix.
Members of Warner Bros' board are discussing whether Paramount's revised proposal offers a superior deal, Bloomberg reported, citing sources. The board has not yet decided how to respond and may still adhere to its current deal with Netflix.
Paramount's updated bid, submitted last week, includes provisions to offer shareholders additional cash for every quarter the deal remains unclosed beyond the current year. The CBS owner has also committed to covering any breakup fee Warner Bros would owe Netflix should it withdraw from their existing arrangement, though the per-share offer itself has not been increased.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the report. Paramount, Warner Bros and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment.
Paramount said it has offered shareholders a 25-cent-per-share quarterly "ticking fee" (about $650 million) in cash starting in 2027 until closing and agreed to cover Warner Bros’ $2.8 billion breakup fee to Netflix. However, it did not raise its $30-per-share offer, valuing the deal at $108.4 billion including debt.
In a statement, Paramount CEO David Ellison said that the “additional benefits” announced earlier this week “clearly underscore our strong and unwavering commitment to delivering the full value WBD shareholders deserve for their investment.”
Both Netflix and Paramount covet Warner Bros for its leading film and television studios, extensive content library and major franchises such as Game of Thrones, Harry Potter and DC Comics superheroes Batman and Superman.
Activist investor Ancora Holdings, which has built a nearly $200 million stake, last week said it plans to oppose the Netflix deal, arguing the board did not sufficiently engage with Paramount over its rival bid, which includes cable assets like CNN and TNT.

Winter Olympics hit by 'double-touching' curling controversy

Winter Olympics hit by 'double-touching' curling controversy
February 16, 2026The curling competitions at the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, Italy, were mired in controversy this weekend after some athletes accused each other of cheating by illegally "double-touching" the stones as they were released down the ice.
The most recent case came in a game between Britain and Germany on Sunday, with Scottish curler Bobby Lammie being accused of double-touching with his team eventually winning 9-4.
How did the Winter Olympics' curling controversy start?
The issues began on Friday night when Sweden's men's team accused their Canadian opponents of the infraction, triggering a heated clash between players and a subsequent media frenzy.
On Saturday, World Curling deployed additional officials to monitor the so-called "hog line" — the point at which curlers must let go of the stones during delivery — resulting in Rachel Homan of Canada's women's team having a stone disqualified against Switzerland after she allegedly touched it twice.
Curlers insist the double-touching infraction has never been called out with this level of intensity in past competitions, saying it can be difficult to tell if someone is guilty of it.
Canada slam 'despicable' decision, 'untrained' officials
Canadian men's captain Brad Jacobs said he believed he and his compatriots were being unfairly targeted following the initial Swedish complaints.
"What happened with [Homan's] rock was despicable," he said. "I felt immediately as Canadian curlers we were targeted. To go out and pull her rock like that, I think it was a tragedy."
Canadian coach Paul Webster questioned World Curling's decision to set officials at the hog line who he said were not adequately prepared for the role.
"I think we have untrained people doing things that they've never done before," he said. "I have a lot of respect for people that are here volunteering their time but we're not at some bonspiel in Saskatchewan just trying things out," he said in reference to regular curling tournaments, "we're at the Olympics."
British stone removed vs. Germany
World Curling reversed its decision to ramp up officiating on Sunday but not before even more controversy, as British curler Bobby Lammie also had a rock removed from play against Germany.
Asked about this incident, Canada's Jacobs said: "If he threw that rock that way against us, personally I would never ever want that rock to be removed. He did nothing wrong in my opinion."
But he at least felt it wasn't just the Canadians being targeted — "which is good," he said.
Curling: should referees use video replays?
Meanwhile, the controversy has launched a debate about the use of video replays in curling.
"If they bring that in, I think it probably disrupts the speed of play," said Sweden's Johanna Heldin. "We've always been a sport that tries to play by the rules and have a high level of sportsmanship, so hopefully we can figure that back out."
Tara Peterson of the United States had a different view, saying she would "absolutely" support video replays. "There are instances where an instant replay would be huge," she said.

Gisèle Pelicot moved to tears by messages of support from women in powerful TV interview
French rape survivor Gisèle Pelicot became visibly emotional as she watched video messages from women thanking her for her courage during a powerful Newsnight interview broadcast on Sunday (15 February).
In December 2024, her husband, Dominique Pelicot, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping Ms Pelicot and allowing other men to assault her while she was unconscious. Pelicot waived her right to anonymity, meaning the trial was held in public.
Presenter Victoria Derbyshire introduced the specially recorded tributes, handing Pelicot a tablet to view them. She listened intently as one woman said, “Thank you for the new generation,” and another added, “As women, we are proud of you.”
Calling the messages “powerful” and “truly exceptional,” Pelicot thanked the women for their solidarity.

Tennis champ locked in to serve up Perth’s sport news
Former grand slam doubles champion and Olympic medallist Alicia Molik has been picked as 9News Perth’s new sports presenter following the departure of Fremantle Dockers great Matthew Pavlich.
Molik, whose career highlights include a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics and grand slam doubles titles at the Australian Open and Roland Garros, is set to begin her role as weekend sport presenter on Saturday.
Since retiring from professional tennis, Molik has built a career in media, and helped anchor Nine’s recent coverage of the Australian Open, and has been a broadcaster with Wide World of Sports. Nine is owned by Nine Entertainment, also the owner of this masthead.
The Adelaide-born tennis champion said she was excited to join the team to deliver sport news in the city she has called home for the last 16 years.
While tennis “still runs through my veins”, Molik was also anticipating the start of the AFL season, as well as other big sport stories including Perth’s entry into the NRL with the revived Bears team.
“Sport is woven into the DNA of this city, and I look forward to connecting with our viewers every weekend to share the triumphs and the biggest stories in the sporting world,” she said.
“Joining the 9News sport team is a natural fit. I’m thrilled that I’ll still be courtside covering the Australian Open and Wimbledon for the 9Network – it’s truly the best of both worlds.”
9News Perth news director Michael Genovese said Molik was a “world-class talent”, and described her addition to the sports team as a massive win for viewers.
“With Paddy Sweeney leading our weekday coverage and Alicia anchoring our weekends, viewers will see Perth’s best sports coverage every day,” he said.
Fremantle stalwart Pavlich had been presenting sport news at 9News Perth since 2018 until last year, when he took up the role of chief executive at the Sydney Swans - joining another West Australian in a top posting at the club, with former Eagles premiership player Dean Cox currently the team’s coach.

Trump border czar dismisses Democratic demands to reform ICE
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - White House border czar Tom Homan on Feb 15 brushed off Democratic demands to reform ICE amid mounting backlash over the agency’s tactics and a partisan deadlock over homeland security funding.
Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers doubled down on their calls for changes to the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, even as Republicans accused them of grandstanding by refusing to back a funding Bill for the Department of Homeland Security.
On CBS News’ Face The Nation programme, Mr Homan called Democratic legislators’ ICE demands “unreasonable”, while stressing that he personally was not part of the discussions over a Bill to fund Homeland Security in exchange for reforming ICE.
Democrats sent a list of 10 demands to the top Republican lawmakers in Congress earlier in February that included ICE halting racial profiling in its policing, prohibiting masks and stopping officers from entering private homes without a judicial warrant.
Mr Homan denied that ICE officers engage in racial profiling, saying they make stops based on “reasonable suspicion”.
A Supreme Court ruling in 2025 allowed officers to use factors such as brown skin or speaking Spanish as grounds for a stop.
Mr Homan said ICE officers need masks to hide their identities for protection, although opponents note that the vast majority of US law enforcement officers work without them.
DHS entered a partial shutdown on Feb 14, but largely continues to operate since most of its functions are deemed essential.
On Fox News Sunday, US Senator Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, credited “outcry from Americans” for convincing the White House to negotiate over ICE now even though DHS still has funding for some time.
Republican Senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told CNN’s State Of The Union that Democrats are engaging in “political theatre” and are not negotiating in good faith.
Talks between Democrats and Republicans could remain stalled as both chambers of Congress will be on break this week. REUTERS

WASHINGTON – The racist online video that US President Donald Trump recently shared and then deleted generated a bipartisan furor because of its portrayal of former president Barack Obama and his wife Michelle as apes. What was little remarked on was how it presented Mr Trump himself – as the “King of the Jungle”.
After a year back in the White House, Mr Trump’s efforts to promote himself as the singularly dominant figure in the world have become so commonplace that they no longer seem surprising.

Quick hits: Dads dominate the dual dais ahead of winter weather warning

Winter Olympics 2026: Matt Graham on dual moguls 'dad podium' as weather forces reschedule — quick hits from day nine
A trio of dads fill the dual moguls podium as an "unfavourable" forecast leaves things up in the air at the Winter Olympics.
Here are the quick hits from day nine of the Milano Cortina Games.
1. Aussie Graham fills out 'dad podium'
Two-time Australian Winter Olympic medallist Matt Graham said before these Games that his daughter Ada "makes the bad days easier to get over and makes the good days even sweeter".
Day nine at Milano Cortina was certainly one of the latter, as Graham added a dual moguls bronze to his moguls silver from the 2018 Pyeongchang Games.
And, as an extra special motivation, he shared the podium with two men who know the difficulties of being a parent while travelling the world for their job.
"Mikael [Klingsbury, gold medallist] and Ikuma [Horishima, silver medallist] had already locked in their podium spots, and me, being the third dad, I needed to execute to make sure we could fulfil that dream of having a 'dad podium'," Graham said.
"I was really happy with the way I skied, and I knew when I crossed the line, I was happy with the run and knew it would be hard to beat. When I saw the score come up, I was very relieved, a little bit shocked and also very satisfied.
"It was just great to bounce back from the other day. It was a little bittersweet finishing fifth and knowing that I could have done more, but today, the sun is shining, the course is skiing really well, and I was just really happy to be able to just repeat run after run."
2. No-one has more than this Norwegian
Norway, comfortably the most decorated nation in Winter Olympic history, is sitting at the top of the 2026 medal tally after nine days, and is trying to be number one for the fourth straight Winter Games.
And it's thanks to folks like Johannes Høsflot Klaebo.
The cross-country skiing star is still only 29 but already has more gold medals than any other Winter Olympian in history.
Coming into the Games with three golds in 2018 and two in 2022, he won the 10 kilometre interval start, the 10km + 10km skiathlon and the sprint classic to draw level with Marit Bjørgen, Ole Einar Bjørndalen and Bjørn Daehlie with eight golds.
Then, in the 4 x 7.5km men's relay, Einer Hedegart handed over to him with Team Norway leading by 12.2 seconds, and Høsflot Klaebo took them home to a historic gold medal.
"I've just tried to enjoy the moments today. Being able to do that and take the ninth one with the team is special, and it couldn't be a better way to do that," he said.
3. Weather causes uncertainty for Aussie
The forecast for Monday in Milan is "unfavourable", prompting some rescheduling.
Expectations of a massive snowfall, rather than delivering some sick pow, forced the women's snowboard slopestyle qualifying to be rescheduled.
It was moved ahead by a day, with Australians Tess Coady and Mela Stalker missing out on a spot in the final, while compatriot Ally Hickman qualified sixth for the final, currently scheduled for Tuesday night (AEDT).
"There's been a lot of schedule changes, but now we are competing, I still don't know when," Hickman told Channel Nine after qualifying.
She added that there was a lot of uncertainty about when or whether they'd be able to train ahead of the final.
4. Bowing down to the comeback queen
Simply making it to these Olympics would have marked Federica Brignone's return from a devastating leg injury suffered at the Italian championships just 10 months ago, but she went one better by winning super-G gold and backing it up with victory in the giant slalom on day nine.
So it was fitting when she finished her run that joint silver medallists Sara Hector and Thea Louise Stjernesund bowed down to the Italian superstar.
"If there is one person I would want to give a gold to at these Olympics, it is Feda, so it makes me very happy to see her win," Hector said.
Stjernesund said it was "a beautiful podium" to be a part of, with Brignone clearly appreciating the love, laughing and smiling as the silver medallist genuflected on the snow.
"There is a special respect amongst us. They are great girls. Yes, there is competition, but not too much. I'm trying always to be kind and just myself. Maybe that's why they kneeled, I don't know," Brignone said.
5. Chinese superstar has a crack at organisers
Chinese star Eileen Gu took a big swipe at organisers for a schedule that means she will miss a training session ahead of the start of her ski halfpipe campaign.
Gu won gold in the halfpipe and big air, as well as silver in slopestyle in Beijing four years ago. She is attempting the same packed schedule in Italy, after already winning another silver in the slopestyle a week ago.
The 22-year-old is in the big air final on Tuesday at 5:30am AEDT, but it has been scheduled at the same time as a training run in the halfpipe, which has "disappointed" and "saddened" Gu because she will miss that session ahead of the halfpipe qualifying at 5:30am on Friday.
"I have asked for fair options, like joining one training with the snowboarders, or getting even one hour alone to train, but to no avail," she wrote on Instagram.
"No other woman in the halfpipe field is competing in another event, and for good reason — Halfpipe is different from slope and big air, and demands its own training time accordingly.
"Daring to be the only woman to compete in three events should not be penalised — making finals in one event should not disadvantage me in another.
"What kind of message does this send to future athletes who love skiing for its essence and want to compete in every event? This was a totally avoidable issue, and I am saddened by the hardline stance FIS has chosen to take."
FIS communications director Bruno Sassi, in a statement to Chinese state media agency Xinhua, said Gu was one of five female athletes who were invited to a halfpipe testing event today.
"Gu has been hand-picked as one of the athletes — five men and five women — invited to a one-hour halfpipe testing session," he said.
"They have been chosen based on their ability to give constructive feedback about the construction, shape, and ride-ability of the pipe."
Sassi also said organisers had scheduled three training runs in the pipe as opposed to the two that were normally available at World Cup events.

Russia brings Europe back into play by moving talks to Geneva — Swiss politician

GENEVA, February 16. /TASS/. By moving the negotiations to Geneva, Russia is bringing Europeans back into the game, allowing them to rejoin the Ukrainian settlement process, Swiss politician, journalist, writer, and member of the Geneva parliament Guy Mettan said.
He recalled that Turkey and the Persian Gulf countries have been mediating the negotiations on Ukraine until now. "They will undoubtedly continue to play this role in the future, as we have seen with the exchange of prisoners and bodies," he said in an interview with TASS.
"But by moving [the negotiations] to the center of Europe, we are sending a signal to the Europeans. We are bringing them back into the game but also holding them accountable. It is not enough for them to maintain their belligerent position by supplying Ukraine with more weapons and means to wage war. Instead, they must work for the sake of peace, which is incomparably more difficult and requires greater effort," Mettan explained.
The first round of trilateral security consultations between Russia, the US and Ukraine took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. The second round was held in the UAE capital on February 4-5. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that the next round of negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement will also take place in a trilateral Russian-American-Ukrainian format on February 17-18 in Geneva. According to him, the Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Winter Olympics recap: Brignone's double gold after broken leg, Klaebo sets a medal record
Federica Brignone and Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo have glided into history at the Winter Olympics in very different ways
- Bookmark
Federica Brignone and Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo glided into history at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Sunday in very different ways.
Host nation Italy was delighted as Brignone's sensational comeback continued with a second gold medal of these Games. She's still in pain after a badly broken leg last year.
Klaebo has the most gold medals of any Winter Olympian in history with nine after taking gold with Norway's cross-country men's relay team.
Brignone does it again
Winning one gold medal in super-G made Brignone feel like she was living in a movie.
What do great movies get? A sequel.
The Italian skier known as “the Tiger” was unbeatable in the giant slalom for her second gold of the Olympics and fifth career medal, breaking her own record as the oldest women's Alpine skiing Olympic champion.
There were two silver medalists as Sara Hector and Thea Louise Stjernesund finished in exactly the same time and bowed to Brignone to mark her victory.
After breaking multiple bones in March, Brignone needed two surgeries and 42 stitches to put her leg back together. She only returned to skiing in January.
Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States was 11th and has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic races since Pyeongchang in 2018.
Record ninth gold medal for Norwegian skier
Klaebo stands alone as the most successful Winter Olympian in history after winning his ninth career gold medal in cross-country skiing.
Norway’s prime minister was watching as Klaebo anchored his team's relay gold Sunday. That broke a tie at eight gold medals with three other Norwegians: cross-country skiers Marit Bjoergen and Bjoern Daehlie and biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen.
Klaebo could get into double figures by the end of the Milan Cortina Games. His next chances for a 10th gold are in the team sprint on Wednesday or the 50-kilometer race on Saturday. Also, he's only 29 years old.
Norway ended Sunday with a Games-leading 26 medals, 12 gold. Host nation Italy reached 22 on Sunday, its best-ever Winter Olympic medal haul. The U.S. and Japan have 17 apiece.
More controversy rocks curling
The typically calm world of curling has been rocked by a controversy over double-touching, and it broadened Sunday as the British men's team had a stone removed for the violation.
Until Sunday, the Canadian men's and women's teams had been in the focus of scrutiny. An expletive-laden outburst by Canada's Marc Kennedy after an accusation of a double touch against Sweden on Friday highlighted the problem. A double touch is when a player touches a stone again after releasing it.
U.S. and Canada win again in men's hockey
In men’s hockey, the U.S. and Canada both made sure of quarterfinal spots with convincing wins in the final game of group play. Canada routed France 10-2 and took the top seed on goal differential. Canada will play either Czechia or Denmark in the quarterfinals.
The U.S. beat Germany 5-1 and is set to face the winner of the qualification round game Tuesday between Sweden and Latvia.
Another win for the moguls king
Mikael Kingsbury of Canada has won almost everything there is to win in moguls skiing. When a new Olympic event was added, he won that, too.
Kingsbury took gold, his fifth career Olympic medal, in the inaugural dual moguls event Sunday, three days after settling for silver in the traditional moguls event, won by Australian Cooper Woods.
Dutch speedskater Jutta Leerdam won another medal but it was silver, not gold, as her teammate Femke Kok won the women's 1,000 meters. Miho Takagi of Japan was third and defending champion Erin Jackson of the U.S. fifth.
Britain won its first snow-sport Olympic gold in history, a victory for Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale in team snowboardcross. There was another British gold in team skeleton hours later.
Biathlon saw a first Olympic gold for Italy as Lisa Vittozzi won the women's pursuit, hours after Sweden's Martin Ponsiluoma took a surprise gold in the men's event.
Norwegian ski jumper Anna Odine Stroem won the first-ever Olympic women's large hill event to finish the Games with two gold medals and a silver.
German figure skaters Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin lead the pairs event after the short program after other gold-medal contenders made mistakes. The free skate is Monday.

New think tank launched to bridge talent gap in Hong Kong studies
Hong Kong Future Economy Institute’s director says focus on global topics at local universities has led to fewer people researching pressing local issues
A group of scholars, professionals and former government officials has formed a new think tank in Hong Kong that aims to fill what it calls a talent gap in the shrinking field of local studies.
The newly established Hong Kong Future Economy Institute also pledged to conduct studies on housing planning, population policy and impact assessments of policymaking.
Michael Bolin Wong, founding director of the institute and an assistant professor at the University of Hong Kong’s (HKU) business school, said few scholars at the city’s institutions were interested in studying local topics, leading to a shortage of talent in policy research in the area.
“Hong Kong universities are continuing with internationalisation and so are their teachers. But when they increasingly focus on topics with more international attention, fewer people are researching Hong Kong,” he said in a media briefing last week.
“Universities may not be able to address such a shortage … so we need a new model to offer the policy research that Hong Kong requires.”
Among various policies, Wong highlighted the need for the government to devise more housing policies friendly to young people, whom he said received less support from authorities compared with previous generations.

DOJ tells US lawmakers Epstein file redactions complied with law
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The Justice Department sent a letter to US lawmakers summarising redactions in the so-called Epstein Files
The explanation for redactions was required by a law passed in 2025 that has forced the public release of millions of pages of material.
Although that legislation required a broad swath to be made public, it allowed for redactions or the withholding of information in certain instances.
In its six-page Feb 14 letter to leaders on the House and Senate judiciary committees, the department said it didn’t redact or withhold documents to protect anyone’s reputation or over political sensitivities.
Officials moved to redact materials to protect victims privacy and for other specific reasons allowed for by the law, according to a copy of the letter seen by Bloomberg News.
While reams of material related to Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell have been released since December, some lawmakers have blasted the department for heavy redactions.
The Justice Department says that it hasn’t improperly withheld information.
A representative for the Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
The letter also included a list of dozens of government officials, celebrities
The names ranged from US President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton to Elvis Presley and Janis Joplin.
The department didn’t include context of how the names are referenced in the material.
Inclusion in the so-called Epstein files doesn’t mean that someone engaged in wrongdoing.
In its letter to the lawmakers, the department explained that peoples’ names appear in a variety of contexts.
For example, the department said, some people had direct email contact with Epstein or Maxwell, while others are just mentioned in press articles and in ways that appear unrelated to matters involving either of the sex offenders. BLOOMBERG

You need more than a great name to be a great band.
But it certainly doesn't hurt — just ask Chris Freeman.
"A few of us put together an all‑gay tribute to The Go‑Go's, we were called The Gay-Gays," the American musician says.
"When The Go‑Go's announced their final tour, we got asked to play the after party for their last show. We thought, 'Well, let's take that as a sign and we'll break up as well.'"
Only, The Gay-Gays didn't really want to call it a day. They still played brilliantly together, still loved the chaos and camaraderie that come with being in a band. So the scheming began.
"One of us started playing Back in Black, the riff, and said, 'How about GayC/DC?'"
Dirty Deeds, Done Properly
GayC/DC — billed proudly as "the world's first (and only) all‑gay tribute to the music of AC/DC" — may have begun with a joke name, but the band is built on genuine reverence for Australia's rock'n'roll titans.
Every member is a true believer, and they know any AC/DC tribute will be scrutinised by diehards who miss nothing.
"Right from the very beginning, we knew that the music had better be good," Freeman says.
"We took about six months of woodshedding to make sure we got this. Because AC/DC sounds simple, but it's not."
That discipline mattered for two reasons.
First: they weren't about to put their name on anything that fell short. And second: there were certain parts of the AC/DC live spectacle they knew they couldn't replicate.
"We don't look anything like AC/DC," Freeman says. "Our Angus is 240 pounds of solid muscle; there's no way he's going to get on my shoulders.
"So, we took the look aspect of it and turned it around."
They also have fun with the lyrics: TNT becomes PnP (look it up), the word "rock", a constant throughout AC/DC's work, becomes something quite different with one letter change, while turning Whole Lotta Rosie into Whole Lotta Jose is a whole lotta fun.
Behind this camp and chaos is something genuinely heartfelt, though.
"We thought, 'What if we heard the lyrics growing up as young gay kids that we'd always wanted to hear?'" drummer Brian Welch says.
"As hard rock and metal fans and being gay, all we heard was about women, girls, fast cars … Great! But really, it didn't speak to the whole of us. There was something missing."
We salute you
Much like the band they honour, GayC/DC does not deal in subtlety.
Their shows are loud, joyful and deliberately outrageous, which means they're often stepping boldly into spaces where they don't know how they'll be received.
"It's always a 'what are we going to run into tonight?' situation," Freeman says. "Every show, we don't know who's going to be in the audience, who needs to be turned around.
"Most of the time when we're playing, we're using a lot of humour, which we find is the sweetener for the bitter pill, if you will."
The strategy works. They routinely convert purists who arrive unconvinced and leave euphoric.
"When we tour the US, we get the folks in the back of the club with their arms folded, waiting to see what we're gonna do," Welch says.
"By the end of the last song, they're up front, they're singing, and they hang around after the show to thank us.
"One guy said, 'I came here with my girlfriend, and I did not see this coming. I don't think I ever need to see AC/DC again, but I will see you every time you come through town'. That means a lot."
For all the irreverence, their devotion to AC/DC is unwavering.
"We are never taking the p**s out of AC/DC or their music.
"We worship them. They run in our DNA," Welch says.
"We make sure the crowd knows from the very first song that they're in on the fun. We bring them along for the ride."
Welch estimates roughly 70 per cent of their audience is straight — not surprising when heavy rock still sits outside the musical diet of many queer fans.
"Here in the US, a big part of the LGBTQIA+ community wants track artists, they want drag queens, they want lip syncing, they want top 40," he says. "They don't want older guys playing rock'n'roll.
"But the older guys that love rock'n'roll, the gay bears, the gay rockers, the gay bikers, they come to the shows and they love it, and they bring their friends."
Still breaking barriers
Chris Freeman may not be a household name, but he is a bona fide punk icon.
His band Pansy Division was a pioneering punk act when it emerged in the early 1990s.
They were unapologetically, loudly queer at a time when the punk and hardcore scenes were awash with macho aggression.
"I think the crossover for people who like GayC/DC that liked Pansy Division is pretty slim. I'm not sure why," Freeman considers.
"We do see them, people come up and tell me they are a Pansy Division fan, but I don't know if that's a lot of our audience."
At this point, Welch jumps in, determined to ensure Freeman's impact is recognised.
"We wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't for Pansy Division," he says. "They kicked open a lot of doors for gay musicians to be who they are.
"They were the first out gay punk band on an arena tour opening for Green Day. Chris has had more things thrown at him on stage … and I say that with love because he took all the hits for us.
"This band would not be able to stand on the shoulders of giants if they hadn't come before us and said, 'This is who we are. This is what we do. This is what we play. If you like it, great, stick around. If you don't, change your channel.'"
Audiences in 2026 are more open-minded, but the band understands why some diehard AC/DC fans might side eye a queer reinterpretation of their sacred texts.
"If you don't like the way we look, if you don't like the song titles, that's fair," Welch says.
"But after the show, let's have a drink and talk about what was the first tour you saw AC/DC on. Or your favourite song. Let's talk as AC/DC fans. There's common ground there.
"I wish more people, especially here in [America], would see that there's common ground that if you take just a half hour out of your day and talk about music. Both parties can walk away going, 'You know what? That guy's not so bad.'"
And sometimes it flips entirely — they're not only converting AC/DC purists, they're creating brand new AC/DC fans out of people who never connected with the band before.
"I think we've had more people come up to us and say, 'I came because of Pansy Division or the gay element, but I wasn't really an AC/DC fan, but now I am'. We've actually had people go, 'Wow, now I think I like AC/DC after watching you guys.'"
GAYC/DC starts its Australian tour in Brisbane on Thursday before shows in Southport, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Sydney.

'Air defense is a daily necessity' — Zelensky says additional aid packages expected by Feb. 24 following return from Munich
Editor's note: This story has been updated with a timeline for the expected deliveries announced by President Volodymyr Zelensky.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address on Feb. 15 that Kyiv expects to receive additional aid packages, primarily air defense support, in the near-term following talks held at the Munich Security Conference.
"There were many meetings, and most importantly – there will be new support packages for Ukraine. The key priority is missiles for air defense, for protection against ballistic missiles," Zelensky said.
In a separate statement, Zelensky said he agreed on "specific packages of energy and military aid" with "leaders of the Berlin Format" to be provided by Feb. 24, the date marking the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The comments come following Zelensky visit to Germany where he held talks with world leaders and their representatives, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Zelensky said he discussed additional support for Ukraine's air defense needs with "virtually every leader who can truly help us."
"We hope the agreements will work as needed. Air defense is a daily necessity," he added.
Throughout the winter, Ukrainian cities including Kyiv have contended with mass missile and drone attacks on energy and civilian infrastructure amid freezing cold temperatures. The attacks have directly contributed to a nationwide energy crisis affecting much of the country.
Zelensky said during his evening address that he anticipates holding meeting aimed at delivering "new energy packages" for Kyiv in the next week, which would focus on "recovery after strikes and the necessary equipment."
The remarks come as the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia are expected to resume trilateral peace talks in Geneva on Feb. 17–18. The question of control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region remains as one of the most pressing topics.
In a briefing after his speech at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Zelensky told journalists that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee, but that Kyiv was looking for a longer-term pledge.
Warning Ukrainians of the potential for additional large-scale attacks in the coming days, Zelensky said the Kyiv is "in constant contact with all partners, emphasizing that each such threat, each such risk, only worsens the overall prospects for ending the war."
"Several more cold days lie ahead, and everyone has already seen how the Russians exploit this," Zelensky concluded.

Israeli shipping giant ZIM to be sold for $4.2 billion to German, Israeli capitals - Calcalist

The Israeli shipping giant ZIM will be sold to a German-Israeli partnership comprising Hapag-Lloyd and FIMI Opportunity Funds for approximately $4.2 billion, the Israeli business news site Calcalist reported on Sunday.
According to the report, the German firm, which is currently the world's fifth-largest shipping company, will acquire ZIM’s international operations, while FIMI will take charge of local Israeli operations.
Under the deal, Hapag-Lloyd will begin operating ZIM’s 99 chartered ships, while FIMI will take ownership of the 16 Israeli-flagged vessels currently operated by ZIM.
The inclusion of FIMI as an Israeli partner was intended to bypass the "golden share" owned by the Israeli government, which would have likely vetoed a fully international takeover.
Potential backlash over ZIM acquisition
According to a report by Globes, the acquisition was initially expected to be valued at $3 billion, slightly above ZIM’s current $2.7 billion market value. Calcalist reported that the ZIM board has since approved the $4.2 billion price tag.
Globes also noted that both employees and political officials have opposed the deal, with the workers' committee stating it was surprised to learn the deal had closed.
Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav also opposed the move, telling Globes that “ZIM Shipping Company, headquartered in Haifa, is no longer part of the Israeli economy.”
“This is a company whose existence is of strategic significance to the economy and security of the State of Israel, and which has thousands of employees - a large part of whom live in Haifa. The transfer of its ownership to foreign hands, even if an Israeli investment fund is involved, is problematic to say the least and harms national security, and could also lead to the dismissal of thousands of workers,” he explained.
“I demand that the Israeli government stop the move and prevent the sale - it is impossible for the State of Israel not to have a shipping company in Israeli hands, it is part of its economic and security existence,” he added.
A December report by Globes regarding a potential sale also met strong opposition from ZIM workers and Israeli political figures, but the Calcalist report suggests these differences may have been resolved.

US military boards another oil tanker in Indian Ocean after tracking it from the Caribbean
WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an effort to target illicit oil connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said Sunday.
Venezuela had faced U.S. sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. President Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure then-President Nicolás Maduro before Maduro was apprehended in January during an American military operation.
Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast in the wake of the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The Defense Department said in a post on X that U.S. forces boarded the Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding.”
“The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine — hoping to slip away,” the Pentagon said. “We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.”
Video posted by the Pentagon shows U.S. troops boarding the tanker.
The Veronica III is a Panamanian-flagged vessel under U.S. sanctions related to Iran, according to the website of the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Panama Maritime Authority said Sunday in a brief statement that the ship was no longer registered there and had been canceled in December 2024.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on Jan. 3, the same day as Maduro’s capture, with nearly 2 million barrels of crude and fuel oil, TankerTrackers.com posted Sunday on X.
“Since 2023, she’s been involved with Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil,” the organization said.
Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, told The Associated Press in January that his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers left the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of the Venezuela’s oil. The Pentagon did not say in the post whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under U.S. control, and later told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond that post.
Last week, the U.S. military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II. The ship was being held while its ultimate fate was decided by the United States, according to a defense official who spoke last week on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing decision-making.

Palestine’s Foreign Ministry has welcomed the decision of the 39th African Union (AU) Summit to support full UN membership for Palestine and reject plans for the forced displacement of Palestinians.
In a statement on Sunday, the ministry described the clear and firm positions expressed at the summit as encouraging, reflecting the African continent’s support for the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people.
Palestine also expressed appreciation for the summit’s call to end the Israeli occupation and accelerate recognition of the State of Palestine’s full UN membership, emphasising that this demand is a legitimate and natural political and legal right.
The AU concluded its 39th session in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa on Sunday with a comprehensive final statement calling for granting the State of Palestine full membership in the UN, affirming that this step represents a legitimate right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.
The summit statement also strongly condemned any attempts to forcibly displace the Palestinian population, describing such actions as a “severe violation of international law”.
Palestine holds the status of a “non-member observer state” at the UN, which was granted by the UN General Assembly on November 29, 2012.
In May 2024, the General Assembly also adopted a resolution supporting Palestine’s application for full UN membership.

Searchers find missing ship in Lake Michigan, over 150 years after it sunk

Searchers recently discovered the wreck of one of the “most sought-after missing ships” in Lake Michigan, that had sunk to the bottom of the lake over 150 years ago.
A shipwreck hunter and scuba diver named Paul Ehorn made the discovery after having searched for the Lac La Belle passenger steamer for nearly 60 years. Shipwreck World, a group that works to locate shipwrecks around the globe, announced on Friday that the team led by Ehorn found the wreck about 20 miles (32km) offshore between Racine and Kenosha, Wisconsin.
Ehorn’s Lac La Belle discovery took place in October 2022. The announcement was delayed because his team wanted to include a three-dimensional video model of the ship, but poor weather and other commitments kept his dive team from going back down to the wreck until last summer, he told the Associated Press in an interview.
Ehorn, 80, has been searching for shipwrecks since he was 15 years old. He said that he’s been trying to pinpoint the Lac La Belle’s location since 1965. He used a clue from fellow wreck hunter and author Ross Richardson in 2022 to narrow down his search grid and found the ship using side-scan sonar after just two hours on the lake, he said.
“It’s kind of a game, like solve the puzzle. Sometimes you don’t have many pieces to put the puzzle together but this one worked out and we found it right away,” he said. The finding left him “super elated”.
Ehorn declined to discuss the clue that led to the discovery.
Richardson said in a short telephone interview on Sunday that he learned that a commercial fisherman at a “certain location” had snagged what Richardson called an item specific to steamships from the 1800s. He declined to elaborate further on how competitive shipwreck hunting has become and how the information could alert searchers to another way to conduct research.
The luxury passenger steamer, called the Lac La Belle, set off from Milwaukee to Grand Haven, Michigan, one October night in 1872, with 53 passengers and crew as well as a cargo of 19,000 bushels of barley, 1,200 barrels of flour, 50 barrels of pork and 25 barrels of whiskey, according to Shipwreck World.
About two hours into the trip, the ship began to leak uncontrollably. The captain turned the ship back to Milwaukee, but huge waves came crashing over, extinguishing its boilers. The storm drove the ship south. At around 5am, the captain ordered lifeboats lowered and the ship went down stern first.
One of the lifeboats capsized on the way to shore, killing eight people. The other lifeboats made landfall along the Wisconsin coast.
According to an account on Shipwreck World, the Lac La Belle was built in 1864 in Cleveland, Ohio. The massive 217ft (66-meter) steamer ran between Cleveland and Lake Superior but sank in the St Clair River in 1866 after a collision. The ship was raised in 1869, and reconditioned.
According to Ehorn, the ship’s exterior is covered with mussels and the upper cabins are gone, but the hull looks intact and the oak interiors are still in good shape.
The Great Lakes are home to anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 shipwrecks, most of which remain undiscovered, Discover reported. Shipwreck hunters have been searching the lakes with more urgency in recent years out of concerns that invasive quagga mussels are slowly destroying wrecks.
The Lac La Belle is the 15th shipwreck Ehorn has located, the Associated Press reports.
“It was one more to put a checkmark by,” Ehron said. “Now it’s on to the next one. It’s getting harder and harder. The easier ones have been found.”
Ehorn will be presenting the discovery in person at the 2026 Ghost Ships Festival in Wisconsin in March, along with video and more images of the wreck.

FBI says DNA from glove may link suspect to Nancy Guthrie abduction
Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from a discarded glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home that appears to match gloves worn by a masked prowler seen on video before her abduction two weeks ago, the FBI said Sunday. The preliminary results await quality control and confirmation before further analysis.
Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from a discarded glove that was found near Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in video footage caught by her doorbell camera before she was abducted two weeks ago, the FBI said on Sunday.
Results from the glove could potentially lead to what forensic experts call a "hit" as early as Monday after they have conducted a national database search on the DNA specimen, the FBI indicated in a statement.
The preliminary findings from a private crime laboratory in Florida were received by the FBI on Saturday and were awaiting "quality control and official confirmation" on Sunday before investigators run the results through a national database of known DNA profiles, the FBI said in a statement.
The process of running a specimen through CODIS, short for the Combined DNA Index System, typically takes 24 hours from when the Federal Bureau of Investigation receives a DNA sample.
The glove was one of roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days in a search zone within two miles of the Tucson-area residence of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US television journalist Savannah Guthrie.

Most of the gloves collected by investigators for examination turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the vicinity, the FBI said.
But the one with a DNA profile recovered from it is "different and appears to match the gloves" worn by the man in a ski mask seen trying to disable Guthrie's door camera in the early morning hours shortly before she was abducted, according to the FBI statement.
Hours after the DNA announcement, Savannah Guthrie posted a video message on social media saying, "we still have hope" and urging whoever has her mother or knows her location "to do the right thing".
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Friday that he was certain that the man in the video, who was also wearing a gun in a holster and an over-stuffed backpack, was the primary suspect investigators were looking for to solve the high-profile case.
Search enters third week
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when family dropped her off at her home near Tucson after she had dined with them, and relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities have said.
Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.
At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them delivered initially to news media outlets.
Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA tests to have come from Guthrie, officials said last week. Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also had a pacemaker.
The sheriff said on Friday that DNA not from Nancy Guthrie or anyone close to her had also been collected from her property, but there has been no official word on any lab findings from those samples.

'Do the right thing'
Savannah Guthrie, 54, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show "Today," has posted several video messages, along with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie, pleading for their mother's return and appealing for the public's help in solving the case.
In one video, they expressed a willingness to meet ransom demands. In her latest Instagram video, two weeks to the day after her mother was reported missing and directed to "whoever has her or knows where she is", the broadcast journalist said, "We believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it's never too late."
Nanos told Reuters on Friday no proof of life had surfaced since the abduction but added: "There's not been any proof of death either."
Acting on a federal court-ordered warrant in connection with the Guthrie case on Friday night, sheriff's deputies and FBI agents searched another house in an affluent neighborhood less than two miles from her home, authorities confirmed over the weekend.
The sheriff's office also said a person was questioned that night in a related traffic stop, but no arrests resulted from either incident.
The presumed kidnapping has drawn intense media attention as well as expressions of sympathy and support from President Donald Trump.

Israeli activist group decries 'aggressive policy on the Temple Mount' ahead of Ramadan

Israeli activist group Ir Amim issued a warning on Sunday against “the government and police's aggressive policy on the Temple Mount” ahead of the 2026 Islamic holiday of Ramadan holiday.
Ramadan, which begins on Wednesday, is a month-long Muslim holiday during which, on a daily basis, “more than 200,000 worshipers are expected to arrive at the [Temple Mount] compound during peak hours,” Ir Amim said.
The group decried what it described as recent “violations” of the status quo, which, up until recently, banned Jewish people from praying at the site where the First and Second temples stood before the Dome of the Rock was built.
Policies imposed since October 7, 2023, including “expanding Jewish prayers in the compound, granting permission to bring prayer sheets to Jews..., and continuing significant restrictions on the entry of Muslims” are cited as such violations.
Ir Amim claims 'systematic deterrance' of Muslim worshippers
In its condemnation of such changes to the status quo, Ir Amim drew attention to police data from 2025, claiming that the data shows that “the number of Muslim worshippers on the Mount was less than half of their number a decade ago,” a decline the organization stated reflects “systematic deterrence” of Muslim worshippers.
Ir Amim additionally criticised a “time-sharing” policy that allows both Muslim and Jewish worshippers to visit the Temple Mount at separate times as something that “could lead to widespread harm, especially during the sensitive month” of Ramadan.
Ir Amim issued a series of recommendations for the police and government aimed at relaxing what the group called “extensive restrictions on the freedom of worship of Muslims” at the Temple Mount.
The group implored Israeli authorities to take measures such as “avoiding limiting the number of worshipers,” “reinstating the ban on Jewish prayer in the compound in accordance with the status quo,” and “closing the Mount to non-Muslims during the last ten days of Ramadan.”
Aviv Tatarsky, a researcher at Ir Amim, said he believes “the prayers and all aspects of religious worship throughout the month are part of what makes Jerusalem a holy city.”
“The entire Muslim public deserves to make a pilgrimage to the Al-Aqsa Mosque without interference,” Tatarsky said. “In the face of calls from within the coalition to disrupt Ramadan, we call on the police to allow the Muslim public to enter the holy place smoothly."

In fuel-starved Cuba, the e-tricycle is king
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
HAVANA – A green revolution is taking place on the streets of Havana, but it is by necessity rather than design.
Faced with a severe fuel crisis that intensified after the US placed the island under a de facto oil blockade
“Because of the gasoline and oil situation, we’ve had to resort to this alternative,” said Mr Eduardo Romano, a father of two, while waiting for customers in a park in central Havana.
Cuba, already contending with years of crippling fuel shortages, has reached a breaking point after US President Donald Trump moved to starve the communist nation of oil.
The flow of crude from top ally Venezuela dried up after the US ousted its leader Nicolas Maduro, and Mr Trump has threatened tariffs on any other country stepping in to fill the breach
To conserve energy, the government has announced a series of fuel rationing measures and slashed public transport services.
As the days pass and fuel supplies dry up, the number of taxis cruising the streets of Havana has dwindled. The few drivers left fill up at an eye-popping US$5 (S$6.30) per litre on the black market, which has led fares to triple.
“It’s a difficult situation for people,” Mr Romano said.
Six- and eight-seater e-trikes, which cost around one-third of a taxi fare, have become a lifeline for cash-strapped Cubans. “Right now, tricycles are the kings of the road,” Mr Romano joked.
But there is a catch.
The vehicles have to be charged – a constant headache in a city battling power outages of up to 12 hours a day, due to a lack of fuel for generating stations.
Like the even more ubiquitous e-scooter, e-trike owners have to wait for the lights to come back on to start their engines – or plug in at the home of a friend or relative endowed with a generator or solar panels.
Two- and three-wheelers
The dearth of public transport is another nail in the coffin of the sputtering economy.
“There are people who have even had to quit their jobs because they can’t afford transportation,” said Mr Ignacio Charon, a 48-year-old tyre repair shop employee.
He has been inundated with customers wanting to have old bikes patched up.
Dr Roselia Lopez, a 54-year-old dentist who was waiting for an e-tricycle to take her mother to a cardiology appointment, described the transportation situation as “disastrous”.
“We offer an alternative,” said tricycle owner Ariel Estrada, 54, while acknowledging that Havana’s fleet of three-wheelers was grossly unequal to Cubans’ needs.
Next to his shop is a parking lot for cycle rickshaws, another crisis-proof mode of transportation.
Faced with the US oil siege, some rickshaw owners have rushed to install electric engines on their “cars”, as they refer to their vehicles.
Mr Orlando Palomino, a 44-year-old who pedals up to 70km a day as he ferries people from town to town, boasted that he had work “from Monday to Monday”. AFP

Paris's Grand Mosque releases guide on adapting Islam to France

The idea had been on his mind since he took over as head of the Grande Mosquée de Paris in 2020. After several years and hundreds of hours of hearings, consultations and reflection, the teams led by Chems-Eddine Hafiz, the rector of this prominent Muslim place of worship in the French capital, presented on Tuesday, February 10, their new guide, titled "Muslims in the West." Its goal is to adapt Muslim religious discourse to French society and culture. The 1,000-page volume is described as a "road map," as Hafiz explained, so that Muslims can live out their faith in France peacefully.
According to the mosque's rector, the project originated from his perception of a "disastrous image of Islam" in the eyes of the general public. France has emerged from a decade marked by Islamist attacks, where terrorists used religion to justify their violence. As a result, he noted that practicing Muslims are often mistakenly associated with these acts and become victims of suspicion despite themselves.
At first, when the project got underway in January 2023, the main aim was to engage in a collective reflection on the points of friction between Islam and the Republic. This took the form of a glossary of terms covering Muslim concepts that are often misunderstood. "My idea," Hafiz said, "was to debate these points of tension.

Hundreds of buildings without heat in Ukraine capital Kyiv

KYIV - Around 1,600 buildings in Kyiv remained without heat on Feb 15 after a barrage of Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, officials said, as Ukraine’s army claimed a strike on a key oil terminal in Russia.
Authorities in the Ukrainian capital say around 1,100 residential buildings and 500 other buildings were still without heat in Kyiv, in the midst of a gruelling winter of war.
Russia’s recent attacks have triggered Ukraine’s worst energy crisis of the nearly four-year-old war, leaving hundreds of thousands of homes without heat
Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said overnight that Russian strikes had also damaged railroad infrastructure in the southern region of Odesa and central-eastern region of Dnipropetrovsk.
Ukraine has also targeted Russian energy infrastructure with drone strikes, targeting the oil and gas industries helping to fund the invasion Moscow launched
The governor of the Russian border region of Bryansk said five municipalities and part of the regional capital had been left without heat and electricity by an “enemy attack” on Feb 15.
Ukraine’s army meanwhile said it had hit a key oil terminal in southern Russia near Moscow-annexed Crimea.
“An oil terminal in southern Russia and the Pantsir-S1 air defence system in the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea has been hit,” Ukraine’s General Staff said in a statement.
The attack was on the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal near the village of Volna in the Krasnodar region.
Volna is home to the Black Sea port of Taman, used for Russian oil, coal and grain shipments.
Ukraine said the strike was part of “measures to reduce the offensive and economic potential of the Russian aggressor”.
Krasnodar governor Veniamin Kondratyev had earlier said a Ukrainian attack had damaged an oil storage facility in Volna and wounded two people.
More than 100 firefighters had been deployed to extinguish “several fires”, he added.
A house in Russia’s Black Sea resort of Sochi – largely spared from the attacks other southern cities have seen – was also damaged, Mr Kondratyev said. AFP

Too early to talk about thaw in Russia-Switzerland relations — Geneva lawmaker

GENEVA, February 16. /TASS/. Despite the transfer of talks on the Ukrainian settlement to Geneva, it is still too early to talk about a thaw in the relations between Russia and Switzerland, Swiss politician, journalist, writer, and member of the Geneva parliament Guy Mettan said.
"It is still too early to talk about a thaw. For this to happen, Russia must be met with a similar gesture of goodwill from Switzerland," he said in an interview with TASS. According to the lawmaker, negotiations that have been ongoing since the Trump administration took office in the US have been "characterized by progress which was immediately followed by a setback on the part of the US, Ukraine, and Europe."
"Based on this, the Russian side expects concrete steps from Switzerland: a partial lifting of sanctions, refusal to introduce the next package of European sanctions, statements, new proposals, anything in general," Mettan noted.
Despite its neutral status, Switzerland, which is not a member of the EU, has followed the alliance's lead with regard to sanctions against Russia and Belarus imposed in connection with the special military operation in Ukraine. On December 12, 2025, the Swiss government announced that it would join the EU's 19th package of anti-Russian sanctions. In March 2022, the Russian government approved a list of foreign states and territories that are engaging in unfriendly actions against Russia, its companies, and its citizens. Switzerland is on this list.

Details: Drones were intercepted between 20:00 and 23:00 over Bryansk, Kaluga, Tula and Ryazan oblasts as well as over the Moscow region.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Sunday afternoon that 13 drones heading towards the capital had been downed.
Restrictions have also been introduced at several Russian airports, with flights suspended in Kostroma, Yaroslavl and Nizhny Novgorod.
In addition, a missile strike caused significant damage to energy infrastructure facilities in the city of Belgorod.
Gladkov first warned of a missile threat and later said that Belgorod and the surrounding district had come under what he described as a large-scale attack.
Early reports indicated that energy infrastructure sites had been seriously damaged.

EU warns Iranian regime's protest crackdowns may constitute crimes against humanity

The European Parliament warned on Sunday that the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown on protests in the country may constitute crimes against humanity and called for the reports of the death toll to be documented and confirmed by the UN.
The European Parliament's statement made clear that the MEPs condemned the violence “particularly targeting civil society actors, protesters, women, minorities, and communities.” It also called for the immediate release of women currently detained, including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi.
The parliament said it adopted a resolution calling for an end to the violence and repression, “including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, and torture.”
The resolution also calls for an end to the harassment and prosecution of doctors and healthcare workers providing treatment to the injured.
Calls for UN documentation
MEPs expressed concern over reports estimating that the death toll may amount to approximately 35,000 victims, according to the statement, which would meet the threshold for crimes against humanity.
They called for the atrocities “to be independently documented by UN bodies,” with evidence preserved for any future prosecution.
The parliament stressed the need for accountability through international judicial systems.
It also called for expanded targeted sanctions and for the EU and its member states to develop strategies to support the families of detainees to prevent the regime's use of hostage diplomacy.

Canada shooter's online activity shows fascination with violence, expert says

Online activity of Canada school shooter shows a fascination with mass violence and violent content, expert says
The online activity of the 18-year-old behind the deadly shooting inside a Canadian high school last week revealed an interest in firearms, mass violence and a history of consuming violent "gore" content, according to expert analysis.
The shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, spent time in dark corners of the internet, posting about her struggles with substance use and mental health. Van Rootselaar referred to gore content as "addictive" in posts shared with CBS News by analysts at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.
She was active on the website WatchPeopleDie, which hosts material portraying graphic violence against people and animals. The site has become a common thread between perpetrators of mass violence, CBS News has previously reported, with several other school shooters frequenting the site. Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News that Van Rootselaar's digital footprint revealed a visit to the WatchPeopleDie page of 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow, who shot and killed a student and a teacher at a school in Wisconsin in 2024.
Zoschak said these online communities can exacerbate typical teenage emotions like loneliness and desperation. In the digital era, teens feeling isolated can opt into online spaces where they might receive validation from strangers, instead of seeking help within their communities. But these spaces can be a dangerous echo chamber with ill-intentioned strangers, he said.
"The worst influence you could have was the worst kid in your school. Now, the worst influence you can have is the worst person on the internet," Zoschak said. "There's a big difference in the degree between those two."
By comparing social media profile elements and usernames and cross-referencing photos and content posted online, ISD analysts were able to identify accounts associated with Van Rootselaar and pinpoint when the shooter's online activity began to take a troubling turn.
Zoschak said ISD was able to trace Van Rootselaar's activity across various online accounts spanning from 2019, when the shooter would have been around 12. Posts began with discussions about video games, and then, in 2021, there was a post with a photo of a gun that Van Rootselaar claimed to own. Around 2023, Van Rootselaar began posting about drug use and mental health struggles. Zoschak said Van Rootselaar had a year of possible inactivity in 2024, with no traceable posts. Then, about five months ago, Van Rootselaar created an account on WatchPeopleDie, which revealed comments made on dozens of gore posts.
In addition, independent media company 404 Media recently reported on a mass shooting simulation game created on Roblox that online sleuths linked back to Van Rootselaar. It was not immediately clear when that simulation was created.
"We have removed the user account connected to this horrifying incident as well as any content associated with the suspect," Roblox said in a statement to CBS News. "We are committed to fully supporting law enforcement in their investigation."
The game was in a separate app called Roblox Studio, which could only be accessed by coders and developers, so the game only had seven visits. But these types of games and other grim content have made their way onto the main platform before with recreation games of the school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
As Van Rootselaar descended into violent content online, mental health concerns also unfolded at home, with police responding to mental health calls at Van Rootselaar's family residence over the last several years.
During a news conference last week, police said Van Rootselaar was apprehended on different occasions under the Mental Health Act, which in British Columbia allows police to apprehend someone experiencing a mental health crisis that may need treatment.
Six people were killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School — most of them younger than 13. Van Rootselaar's 11-year-old brother and mother were also found dead at a residence. The shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School was Canada's deadliest since 1989, when 25-year-old Marc Lepine shot and killed 14 women at Montreal's École Polytechnique before taking his own life.

Keir Starmer promises smartphone crackdown for under 16s within months
Measures could include a minimum age limit for social media, restrictions on infinite scrolling and preventing children from speaking with online chatbots
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Keir Starmer is vowing to enforce a crackdown on children and teenagers using smartphones within months to help keep them safe online.
Reforms could include a minimum age limit for social media and restrictions on so-called “infinite” scrolling.
Children could also be prevented from using virtual private networks (VPNs) to illicitly access pornography, and from speaking with online chatbots under proposals in a government consultation.
Ministers are taking steps now to bring in powers that mean they can act swiftly and respond to its results within months.
Before that, they will act now to close a legal loophole and force all AI chatbot providers to abide by the Online Safety Act or face the consequences of breaking the law.
It follows a war of words between ministers and Elon Musk after his Grok AI chatbot was used widely to make fake nude images of women.
The PM pledged that no online platform would get a “free pass” when it comes to children’s safety on the internet.
Sir Keir said: “As a dad of two teenagers, I know the challenges and the worries that parents face making sure their kids are safe online. Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up. With my government, Britain will be a leader, not a follower, when it comes to online safety.
“The action we took on Grok sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass.
“Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action. We are acting to protect children’s wellbeing and help parents to navigate the minefield of social media.”
The consultation into new social media protections will launch in March and be guided by what parents and children say they want to see.
Ministers also plan to introduce powers through the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill to speedily change the law in reactions to changing online behaviours.
Elsewhere, amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill will be used to ensure chatbots protect users from illegal content.
Technology secretary Liz Kendall said: “I know that parents across the country want us to act urgently to keep their children safe online. That’s why I stood up to Grok and Elon Musk when they flouted British laws and British values.
“We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media.
“We are determined to give children the childhood they deserve and to prepare them for the future at a time of rapid technological change.”
The Crime and Policing Bill will also be updated to include measures which will preserve children’s social media and online data, as called for by the campaign group Jools’ Law.
The campaign was started by Ellen Roome, when questions about the death of her 14-year-old son Jools could not be answered as records of his digital activity could not be accessed.
Lord Nash, a Conservative former minister who has been campaigning in the Lords for tighter social media controls for children, welcomed the adoption of Jools’ Law by the government.
He added: “However, we have a moral duty to try and ensure it is never needed in future by avoiding future tragedies.
“There are too many children who are still being catastrophically harmed by social media every day, and this announcement will not prevent that. This consultation is just delay dressed up as process.
“Instead of more deliberation, the government must raise the age limit to 16 for the most harmful platforms now and has the opportunity to do so when the amendment effecting this – which passed overwhelmingly in the House of Lords – returns to the Commons. For every day we delay, the more children we fail.”
The Tories accused ministers of inaction and said the announcement was “more smoke and mirrors”.
Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary, added: “Claiming they are taking ‘immediate action’ is simply not credible when their so-called urgent consultation does not even exist.“
Australia became the first country in the world to prohibit social media for children in December.

Liz Truss shares photo with Donald Trump: ‘Right about everything’
Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister blames end of premiership on ‘deep state’

- CommentsGo to comments
Liz Truss has met with Donald Trump at his residence in Mar-a-Lago, sharing a photo of the moment on social media.
Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister captioned the image “right about everything” as she stood beaming next to the US president, reaffirming her Maga allegiance in the photo on X.
President Trump has yet to mention the interaction with the former leader on his social media.
Since her seven-week stint in office in 2022, Ms Truss has expressed enthusiastic support for Mr Trump and the Maga movement while also blaming the end of her own premiership on “the deep state”.
In December, she vowed to spark a “Trump-style counterrevolution” against attacks on the free world on her podcast, The Liz Truss Show.
“The deep state tried to destroy me, but now I’m back and excited to launch this show,” she said.
Last year, as she visited the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland, she said that her own country was “failing” as she urged Elon Musk and his “nerd army of Muskrats” to examine the “British deep state”.
She has also claimed that Britain needs its own version of Donald Trump, calling for a movement in the UK similar to the Maga movement.
Under Ms Truss’s premiership, the pound fell to a 37-year low after the City was “spooked” by a massive borrowing package to fund the biggest tax cuts for half a century.
The photo comes after President Trump has faced allegations of racism for sharing a video depicting ex-leader Barack Obama and his wife Michelle Obama as apes, which was removed from Truth Social 12 hours after it was posted.
A senior White House official said a staffer posted it “erroneously” and the president refused to apologise as he said he “didn’t see the whole thing.”
Mr Obama broke his silence about the video in an interview with political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen. He replied: “First of all, I think it’s important to recognise that the majority of the American people find this behaviour deeply troubling.
“It is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, as I’m travelling around the country, as you’re travelling around the country, you meet people – they still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness.”

British PM Starmer seeks greater powers to regulate online access
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON – British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will seek broader powers to regulate internet access, which he said on Feb 15 are needed to protect children from fast-changing digital risks.
Britain’s government said in January that it would consult on an Australian-style social media ban for those under 16
Spain, Greece and Slovenia have since said they plan bans.
“Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up,” Mr Starmer said in a statement.
The new powers are likely to lead to reduced parliamentary scrutiny of future curbs.
Mr Starmer’s office said this was required so that after the review, “we can act fast on its findings within months, rather than waiting years for new primary legislation every time technology evolves”.
More artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots will also be covered by a ban on creating sexualised images without the subject’s consent, after measures against Mr Elon Musk’s Grok, the government said.
These will be introduced as an amendment to existing crime and child-protection legislation being considered by Parliament.
While aimed at shielding children, such measures often have knock-on implications for adults’ privacy and ability to access services and have led to tension with the US over limits on free speech and regulatory reach.
Websites such as the image-hosting site Imgur – used to make memes and provide images for many general online discussion forums – blocked access to all British users in 2025 and gave them blank images instead after tighter age-verification rules were introduced.
Some major pornography websites have also blocked access for British users rather than verify their age, which they said was invasive of privacy and potentially insecure.
But such geographic restrictions can be circumvented by using readily available virtual private networks (VPNs), and the British government said its consultation on child safety would include potential age restrictions for VPNs.

New anti-government chants in Tehran after giant rallies abroad: Reports
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
PARIS - Some residents of Tehran on Feb 15 chanted slogans against the clerical leadership from balconies and windows, reports said, a day after Iranians abroad staged giant opposition rallies
The Islamic republic under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was shaken by a protest movement that peaked in January and which according to rights groups was repressed by security forces in a crackdown that left thousands dead.
While the street protests have petered out in the face of the crackdown, last week residents of Tehran and other cities began shouting slogans against the leadership from the relative safety of their own homes inside vast apartment blocks.
In a new night of chants, residents of the eastern Tehran district of Ekbatan on Feb 15 shouted “death to Khamenei”, “death to the Islamic republic” and “long live the shah”, according to the Shahrak Ekbatan social media account which monitors the area.
Mr Reza Pahlavi, the son of the shah ousted by the Islamic revolution, had urged people inside the country to stage such actions in parallel with protests abroad over the weekend.
Police in the southern German city of Munich said 250,000 people attended a rally there in Feb 14 which in an unusual move was personally addressed by Mr Pahlavi.
Other major pro-monarchy rallies were held in diaspora strongholds including Los Angeles and Toronto.
Mr Pahlavi’s office said on X that over a million people had attended such rallies worldwide but it was not immediately possible to confirm the figure.
Speaking in Munich, Mr Pahlavi hailed the rally as the biggest such in years and said he was ready to lead a transition in Iran.
Monarchist supporters were also gladdened by an extremely rare public appearance at the rally by his sole surviving full sibling, his sister the former princess Farahnaz.
Persian-language TV channel Iran International, which is based outside Iran, reported similar actions taking place in other parts of Tehran on Feb 15, broadcasting images of people chanting “this is the final battle, Pahlavi is coming back” and “death to the Guards” in reference to the authorities’ ideological army the Revolutionary Guards.
Slogans hostile to the authorities were also chanted in other cities including Shiraz in the south and Arak in the centre of the country, it added.
It was not immediately possible for AFP to verify the videos.
The new actions come two days ahead of talks on Feb 17 between the US and Iran focused on the Iranian nuclear programme in Geneva which are seen as crucial to determining if Washington goes ahead with military action against Tehran.
According to the latest toll issued by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, over 7,000 people were killed during the protests, the vast majority protesters shot dead by security forces.
Almost 54,000 people have been arrested in a crackdown that is ongoing, it added. AFP

Kremlin expands property seizures to replenish Russia's war-strained budget – intelligence

Kremlin expands property seizures to replenish Russia's war-strained budget – intelligence
That is according to Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service, Ukrinform reports.
"In Russia, the number of court rulings in criminal cases involving property confiscation rose from 11,000 to 31,000 between 2023 and 2025," the statement said.
According to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, in 2022, confiscation sentences were handed down to 4,195 individuals, while in 2024, the figure reached 24,078. Compared to 2020, the number has increased by 9.3 times.
At the beginning of this year, Chairman of Russia's Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, also stressed the need to expand the number of cases involving confiscation.
According to him, over the past year, investigators seized property worth approximately 24.5 billion rubles. These figures are 25% higher than in 2024.
Defendants in criminal cases "voluntarily" transferred property, funds, and valuables worth 4.7 billion rubles after criminal proceedings were initiated.
"Confiscation" as a special measure was reintroduced into Russia's Criminal Code in 2006. At that time, it was primarily applied in corruption and economic crimes as a mechanism for compensating damages.
Following the start of the so-called "special military operation," confiscation provisions were expanded to cover new offenses, including cooperation with foreign organizations, sabotage, "fake news" about the Russian army, and crimes against state security.
Late last year, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation authorized the confiscation of even a person's sole residence, including property legally purchased by relatives or third parties connected to a case.
"The determination and zeal of Russia's repressive apparatus to increase the use of property confiscation tied to certain events is explained solely by the Kremlin's attempts to plug holes in the state budget suffering from the war against Ukraine," Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service said.

Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon kills four, targets Islamic Jihad
Lebanon said an Israeli strike near the Syrian border on Sunday killed four people, while Israel said it targeted operatives from the Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad. Despite a November 2024 truce intended to end over a year of Israel-Hezbollah hostilities, Israel has continued carrying out regular strikes in Lebanon.
Lebanon said an Israeli strike on Sunday near the Syrian border in the country's east killed four people, as Israel said it had targeted operatives from Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad.
Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon, usually saying it is targeting the Iran-backed group but occasionally also targeting its Palestinian ally Hamas.
It appeared to be the first strike Israel has claimed in Lebanon against Islamic Jihad, which is also allied with Hezbollah, since the truce.
An Israeli drone "targeted a car on the Lebanese-Syrian border", the state-run National News Agency said, adding that "four bodies" were inside the vehicle.
Lebanon's health ministry confirmed the toll in a statement.

The Israeli military in a statement said it "struck Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in the Majdal Anjar area".
Fighters from Islamic Jihad were among those killed in Lebanon during hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which erupted in October 2023 over the Gaza war.
The Palestinian group and Hamas both claimed some attacks and infiltration attempts from Lebanon during the hostilities.
More than 370 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire, according to an AFP tally of health ministry reports.
In line with the 2024 truce, the Lebanese army announced in January that it had completed the first phase of a government plan to disarm Hezbollah, covering the area near the Israeli border.
As part of the Lebanese government's push to disarm non-state groups, some Palestinian factions in Lebanon handed over weapons in several refugee camps last year to the Lebanese authorities.
Hamas and its Islamic Jihad ally have not announced plans to disarm in Lebanon.

Makers of AI chatbots that put children at risk face big fines or UK ban

Makers of AI chatbots that put children at risk will face massive fines or even see their services blocked in the UK under law changes to be announced by Keir Starmer on Monday.
Emboldened by Elon Musk’s X stopping its Grok AI tool from creating sexualised images of real people in the UK after public outrage last month, ministers are planning a “crackdown on vile illegal content created by AI”.
With more and more children using chatbots for everything from help with their homework to mental health support, the government said it would “move fast to shut a legal loophole and force all AI chatbot providers to abide by illegal content duties in the Online Safety Act or face the consequences of breaking the law”.
Starmer is also planning to accelerate new restrictions on social media use by children if they are agreed by MPs after a public consultation into a possible under-16 ban. It means that any changes to children’s use of social media, which may include other measures such as restricting infinite scrolling, could happen as soon as this summer.
But the Conservatives dismissed the government’s claim to be acting quickly as “more smoke and mirrors” given the consultation has not yet started.
“Claiming they are taking ‘immediate action’ is simply not credible when their so-called urgent consultation does not even exist,” said Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary. “Labour have repeatedly said they do not have a view on whether under-16s should be prevented from accessing social media. That is not good enough. I am clear that we should stop under-16s accessing these platforms.”
The moves come after the online regulator Ofcom admitted it lacked powers to act against Grok because images and videos that are created by a chatbot without it searching the internet are not in the scope of the existing laws, unless it amounts to pornography. The change to bring AI chatbots under the Online Safety Act could happen within weeks, although the loophole has been known about for more than two years.
“Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up,” said Starmer. “The action we took on Grok sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass. Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action.”
Companies that breach the Online Safety Act can face punishments of up to 10% of global revenue and regulators can apply to courts to block their connection in the UK.
If AI chatbots are used specifically as search engines, to produce pornography or operate in user-to-user contexts, they are already covered by the act. But they can be used to create material that encourages people to self-harm or take their own lives, or even generate child sexual abuse material, without facing sanction. That is the loophole the government says it wants to close.
The chief executive of the NSPCC, Chris Sherwood, said young people were contacting its helpline reporting harms caused by AI chatbots and that he did not trust tech companies to design them safely.
In one case, a 14-year-old girl who talked to an AI chatbot about her eating habits and body dysmorphia was given inaccurate information. In others, they have seen “young people who are self-harming even having content served up to them of more self-harming”.
“Social media has produced huge benefits for young people, but lots of harm,” Sherwood said. “AI is going to be that on steroids if we’re not careful.”
OpenAI, the $500bn San Francisco startup behind ChatGPT, one of the UK’s most popular chatbots, and xAI, which makes Grok, were approached for comment.
Since the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine took his own life after, his family allege, “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”, OpenAI has launched parental controls and is rolling out age-prediction technology to restrict access to potentially harmful content.
The government is also to consult on forcing social media platforms to make it impossible for users to send and receive nude images of children – a practice that is already illegal.
Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, said: “We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media.”
The Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up by the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing harmful content online, called the steps “a welcome downpayment”. But it called on the prime minister to commit to a new Online Safety Act “that strengthens regulation and makes clear that product safety and children’s wellbeing is the cost of doing business in the UK”.

Burkina jihadist attacks on army leave at least 10 dead
Suspected Islamist militants attacked an army unit in northern Burkina Faso Sunday, the latest in a series of alleged jihadist attacks that have killed at least 10 people in four days, security sources told AFP.
The west African country, ruled by a military junta since a 2022 coup, has been plagued with violence from militants allied to Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State group for more than a decade.
Social media has been awash with speculation that the spate of attacks may have killed dozens of soldiers, but AFP has been unable to independently verify those claims.
The junta, which seized power on the promise to crack down on the violence, has ceased to communicate on jihadist attacks.
On Sunday, militants carried out a major attack on a military detachment in the northern town of Nare, two security sources told AFP.
The previous day, the Burkinabe army's unit in the northern city of Titao was "targeted by a group of several hundred terrorists", one of the sources said.
While the source did not give a death toll for either attack, they said part of the military base in Titao had been destroyed.
The interior minister of Ghana, which borders Burkina Faso to the south, said the government had "received disturbing information from Burkina Faso of a truck carrying tomato traders from Ghana which was caught in a terrorist attack in Titao".
Jihadist 'coordination'
According to the same security source, another army base in Tandjari, in the east of the country, was also attacked Saturday, and several officers killed.
"This series of attacks is not a coincidence", the source said. "There seems to be coordination among the jihadists".
A separate security source told AFP that a "terrorist group attacked the (military) detachment in Bilanga", in the east of the country, on Thursday.
"Much of the detachment was ransacked", the source said, giving a toll of "about 10 deaths" among the soldiers and civilian volunteers fighting alongside the army.
A local source confirmed the attack, adding there was damage in the town of Bilanga, and that the assailants had stayed at the scene until the following day.
Despite the junta's vow to restore security, Burkina Faso remains caught in a spiral of violence.
According to conflict monitor ACLED, the unrest has killed tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers since 2015 - and more than half of those deaths have come in the past three years.

No online platform gets ‘free pass’ when it comes to child safety, says Starmer
The Prime Minister was speaking as he set out plans to bolster the protection of young people online.

No online platform will get a “free pass” when it comes to children’s safety on the internet, Sir Keir Starmer has said, ahead of setting out new plans to prevent harms.
Children could be prevented from using virtual private networks (VPNs) to illicitly access pornography, and limited from speaking with online chatbots under proposals being floated by the Prime Minister to bolster online safety.
The Government also plans to consult on banning children from social media, and restricting infinite scrolling.
Sir Keir will meet parents and young people on Monday to insist that the Government will do all it can to keep children safe online.
The Government is vowing to close legal loopholes which have allowed chatbots to create deepfake nude images, and is planning further curbs on social media.
This follows the war of words between ministers and Elon Musk earlier this year, after his Grok AI chatbot – embedded into the social media site X – was used widely to make fake nude images of women.
Ahead of launching the consultation, the Prime Minister said: “As a dad of two teenagers, I know the challenges and the worries that parents face making sure their kids are safe online.
“Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up. With my Government, Britain will be a leader, not a follower, when it comes to online safety.
“The action we took on Grok sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass.
“Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action.
“We are acting to protect children’s wellbeing and help parents to navigate the minefield of social media.”
The consultation into new social media protections will launch in March and be guided by what parents and children say they want to see.
Ministers also plan to introduce powers through the Children’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill to speedily change the law in reactions to changing online behaviours.
Elsewhere, amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill will be used to ensure chatbots protect users from illegal content.
Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said: “I know that parents across the country want us to act urgently to keep their children safe online. That’s why I stood up to Grok and Elon Musk when they flouted British laws and British values.
“We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media.
“We are determined to give children the childhood they deserve and to prepare them for the future at time of rapid technological change.”
The Crime and Policing Bill will also be updated to include measures which will preserve children’s social media and online data, as called for by the campaign group Jools’ Law.
The campaign was started by Ellen Roome, when questions about the death of her 14-year-old son Jools could not be answered as records of his digital activity could not be accessed.
Lord Nash, a Conservative former minister who has been campaigning in the Lords for tighter social media controls for children, welcomed the adoption of Jools’ Law by the Government.
He added: “However, we have a moral duty to try and ensure it is never needed in future by avoiding future tragedies.
“There are too many children who are still being catastrophically harmed by social media every day, and this announcement will not prevent that. This consultation is just delay dressed up as process.
“Instead of more deliberation, the Government must raise the age limit to 16 for the most harmful platforms now and has the opportunity to do so when the amendment effecting this – which passed overwhelmingly in the House of Lords – returns to the Commons. For every day we delay, the more children we fail.”
Shadow education secretary Laura Trott said the announcement was “more smoke and mirrors from a Government that has chosen inaction when it comes to stopping under-16s accessing social media”.
She said: “Labour have repeatedly said they do not have a view on whether under-16s should be prevented from accessing social media. That is not good enough. I am clear that we should stop under-16s accessing these platforms.
“The evidence of harm is clear and parents, teachers and children themselves have made their voices heard. Britain is lagging behind while other countries have recognised the risks and begun to act.”
Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Munira Wilson said: “There is no time to waste, but the Government continues to kick the can down the road. We need a much clearer, firm timeline for when they will take action.
“Parliament deserves a real say and the chance to properly scrutinise the Government’s plans. Instead, the Prime Minister is desperate to buy himself time with his MPs with an approach that will limit oversight now and in the future.”
Andy Burrows, chief executive of the Molly Rose Foundation, said: “This a welcome down payment but the Prime Minister must now go further.
“Sir Keir Starmer should commit to a new Online Safety Act that strengthens regulation and makes clear that product safety and children’s wellbeing is the cost of doing business in the UK.”

Hamas standoff threatens Gaza stabilization, IDF poised to act

Ahead of an expected announcement on the establishment of the ISF stabilization force, the proposed multinational force for the Gaza Strip, contacts are under way with several countries regarding their principled participation, including Greece and Albania.
Israel would welcome the presence of troops from both countries as a counterweight to Turkey and its soldiers. Greece maintains deep ties with Israel and has strengthened military cooperation within the Eastern Mediterranean alliance framework. Albania, a Muslim-majority country, is seeking to expand economic and tourism ties with Israel. Both nations are also wary of Turkish expansionism in the Eastern Mediterranean and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's aggressive policies.
A diplomatic source said the two were friendly countries preferable to others mentioned, foremost Turkey. They stressed that this did not constitute permission or an opening for Turkish troops to join the force slated for deployment in Gaza, and that Israel's opposition to such a move remained unchanged. At the same time, they acknowledged that the practical establishment of the force was still far off, as were agreements among all parties on its deployment.
For now, any celebration would be premature. The countries' statements amount only to declarations in principle. They are expected to be added to a list that President Donald Trump is set to announce this week at a Board of Peace meeting in the US, a list that currently exists only on paper.
Troops in Gaza only after Hamas disarmament
All countries that have agreed to be included on the list have made clear they will not send troops into the Gaza Strip before Hamas is disarmed. In practice, the upcoming announcement is therefore likely to be largely declarative, or at most involve the dispatch of military experts in various fields to a joint headquarters in Kiryat Gat. That headquarters has reportedly thinned out in recent weeks amid a lack of progress toward the second phase in Gaza.
In Israel, officials believe Hamas' refusal to disarm will continue to delay and obstruct any negotiations over the full conclusion of the war and the reconstruction of Gaza. Without a viable agreement on disarmament and the creation of an enforcement mechanism, Israel will not consent to the deployment of other forces on the ground.
Because no such breakthrough appears imminent, the prevailing assessment is that once the ultimatum period granted to Hamas ends, the IDF will renew military pressure on the terrorist organization.
Beyond its demand to retain light weapons, Hamas has conditioned its agreement to the next phase on leaving thousands of its "police" personnel within the framework of a new police force in Gaza. It has also conditioned the transfer of civilian governance to a national committee, a technocratic government, on keeping Hamas-affiliated civil servants in their positions.
Thus, just days before the convening the Board of Peace in the US, the deadlock in negotiations persists. Efforts to persuade Hamas to retract its demands have so far failed. A compromise proposal under which a small group of Hamas guards would remain armed to protect the organization's senior leadership was rejected by a leadership determined to retain its status, even if behind the scenes, and above all to maintain control over its weapons.

Kristi Noem snaps back amid anger over her claim she’ll ensure the ‘right people’ elect the ‘right leaders’ in midterms
Homeland Security Secretary brushed off concerns about her assertion, claiming critics ‘manufactured outrage’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem doubled down on her assertion that her department assists in election security Sunday, telling critics that they were creating fake outrage after she asserted the “right people” would elect “the right leaders.”
Over the weekend, lawmakers, democracy advocates and political commentators raised alarm bells at Noem’s claim that her department, which oversees domestic security and immigration, played a role in safeguarding elections “to make sure we have the right people voting, electing the right leaders.”
But Noem brushed off those concerns, telling CNN anchor Jake Tapper and ABC News’s White House Correspondent Jonathan Karl: “It must be exhausting to regularly manufacture outrage even over the most commonsense statement.”
The secretary insisted she was referring to preventing non-citizens from voting through election infrastructure. It is already illegal for non-citizens to vote.
“The choice of who to vote for is obviously up to the voters themselves,” Noem said.
Democratic lawmakers had questioned whether Noem’s comment about electing “the right leaders was a suggestion that DHS could utilize its resources to force people to vote for certain candidates.
“... she will make sure they vote for ‘the right leaders?’” Senator Mark Warner questioned.
“This is Trump’s idea of democracy: leaders get to select their voters instead of the other way around,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear told CNN, “Kristi Noem’s statements are wild, and they are un-American.”
When asked by CNN what Noem meant by “electing the right leaders,” even Border Czar Tom Homan said, “I don’t know.”
Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, echoed Noem’s statement, saying, “Oh please, stop with the faux outrage.”
“The Secretary’s obvious point is that we need an election infrastructure to enable eligible American citizens to vote securely and conveniently and prevent non-citizens, including illegal aliens, from voting… Who people vote and deem ‘right’ is of course up to the voters themselves,” McLaughlin said.
Noem also asked Tapper and Karl: “Do you actually support allowing people who are in this country illegally to vote in our elections?”
President Donald Trump’s allies have often repeated the unproven claim that a large number of non-citizens vote in U.S. federal elections. The claim comes from a series of falsehoods that Trump has made to dispute the fact that he lost the 2020 presidential election to former President Joe Biden.
After conducting a review of non-citizen voting allegations, the Center for Election Integrity and Innovation found that cases of non-citizens voting were “rare” and there was no evidence to support sweeping claims suggesting otherwise.
But Noem, other cabinet members and Republican lawmakers have been focused on narrowing voter eligibility to make it harder for people to vote. Rumors have swirled that the administration will deploy Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to polling stations in the midterms to check for noncitizens.
“To have ICE agents, these thugs, be by the polling places. That just flies in the face of how democracy works,” Schumer told CNN Sunday, calling Noem’s assertion about election security “a lot of bull.”
Democrats have raised concerns that Republicans’ efforts will disenfranchise eligible voters under the guise of preventing ineligible people from voting. That includes requiring voters to present proof of citizenship each time they vote.

Trump's border czar says 'small' security force will remain in Minnesota after enforcement rollback
France

07:24:35 KST

White House border czar Tom Homan said Sunday, February 15, that more than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota's Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge.
A "small" security force will stay for a short period to protect remaining immigration agents and will respond "when our agents are out and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control," Homan told CBS News. He did not define "small."
He also said agents will keep investigating fraud allegations as well as the anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church service. "We already removed well over 1,000 people, and as of Monday, Tuesday, we’ll remove several hundred more," Homan said. "We’ll get back to the original footprint."
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's "Operation Metro Surge." The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and proved successful. But the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile and two US citizens were killed.
Protests became common. A network of residents worked to help immigrants, warn of approaching agents or film immigration officers’ actions. The shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a "significant drawdown" was already underway and would continue through this week.
Homan said enforcement would not stop in the Twin Cities and that mass deportations will continue across the country. Officers leaving Minnesota will report back to their stations or be assigned elsewhere. When asked if future deployments could match the scale of the Twin Cities operation, Homan said "it depends on the situation."

Iran’s top diplomat has arrived in Geneva ahead of a second round of negotiations with the United States, Iranian state television said on Monday, as Washington keeps up pressure on the Islamic republic.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation are in the Swiss city after the first round of indirect talks took place in Oman last week.
Oman would mediate Tuesday’s talks in Geneva, the IRNA state-run news agency reported on its Telegram channel on Sunday.

Similar talks last year broke down after Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran, that included the US bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear programme. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump has also threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests.

US forces board second sanctioned oil tanker in Indian Ocean
US forces boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that violated President Donald Trump’s blockade of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean and fled the region, the Pentagon said on Feb 15.
The Panamanian-flagged Veronica III “tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down,” the Pentagon said on X.
The post included a video of US forces boarding a helicopter and then boarding the tanker ship.
The Pentagon intercepted the Aquila II in similar fashion about a week ago.
Poland should develop its own nuclear defences, says president
Poland should look at developing its own nuclear weapons in light of the growing threat from Russia, President Karol Nawrocki said in an interview with Polsat News television.
“I am a big supporter of Poland joining a nuclear project,” Mr Nawrocki said in the interview, adding that he cannot say if or when Poland will start work aimed towards having its own nuclear weapons.
“We are a country right on the border of an armed conflict, and we know what the attitude of the aggressive, imperial Russian Federation toward Poland is,” Mr Nawrocki added.

FBI confirms DNA recovered from glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s home
Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from a discarded glove that was found near Ms Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in video footage caught by her doorbell camera before she was abducted two weeks ago, the FBI said on Feb 15.
The preliminary findings from a private crime laboratory in Florida were received by the FBI on Feb 14 and were awaiting "quality control and official confirmation" on Feb 15 before investigators run the results through a national database of known DNA profiles, the FBI said in a statement.
The process typically takes 24 hours from when the Federal Bureau of Investigation receives a DNA sample.

Geneva MP calls transfer of talks to Switzerland ‘gesture of goodwill’ on part of Russia

GENEVA, February 16. /TASS/. Swiss politician, journalist, writer, and member of the Geneva parliament Guy Mettan believes that Russia's decision to hold negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement in Geneva is a gesture of goodwill.
He told TASS that "this is indeed the first time since 2022 that serious official talks involving Russia have been held in Geneva." Mettan also pointed to the visit of a high-level Russian parliamentary delegation in July 2025 to participate in the World Conference of Speakers of Parliament. At that time, Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko and State Duma Deputy Speaker Pyotr Tolstoy arrived in Geneva to take part in the event. This visit "was not related to negotiations," the politician noted.
Mettan recalled that Moscow had previously "given preference to Geneva" as a venue for negotiations. This is evidenced by the 2021 summit between the presidents of Russia and the United States and the 2022 meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers. However, after February 24, 2022, Russia "was very disappointed" by Switzerland's actions, as it "unilaterally supported Ukraine, compromising its neutrality and putting forward meaningless arguments," the lawmaker noted. "Thus, the resumption of these negotiations on Swiss soil can be seen as a gesture of goodwill on the part of Russia," he concluded.
The first round of trilateral security consultations between Russia, the US and Ukraine took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. The second round was held in the UAE capital on February 4-5. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that the next round of negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement will also take place in a trilateral Russian-American-Ukrainian format on February 17-18 in Geneva. According to him, the Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.
The Swiss authorities have repeatedly expressed their desire to host negotiations on the Ukrainian conflict on their territory. In response, the Russian side pointed out that the country lost its neutral status by joining the EU's illegal anti-Russian sanctions. The unacceptability of Bern as a mediator was also demonstrated by the failed conference on Ukraine in Burgenstock, organized in June 2024 on the initiative of Kiev, to which Russia was not invited.

Chalmers mocks Taylor's proposal for bipartisan budget savings taskforce
In short:
New Liberal leader Angus Taylor has urged the prime minister to establish a bipartisan taskforce to find savings in the budget — a move Treasurer Jim Chalmers has labelled a "predictable stunt".
It comes as the International Monetary Fund issues a report on Australia's economy, suggesting wideranging tax reform.
What's next?
Mr Chalmers will hand down his next federal budget in May.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers has mocked a proposal from the new opposition leader to establish a bipartisan taskforce that could scour the federal budget looking for savings.
Angus Taylor wrote to the prime minister to pitch the plan just days after being elected leader of the Liberal Party, warning that "urgent and credible budget repair" was needed.
The former shadow treasurer suggested the taskforce be made up of equal numbers of government and opposition representatives, who would identify "practical, responsible and jointly supported measures for spending restraint".
"This structured, bipartisan mechanism offers a credible pathway to restoring fiscal discipline, rebuilding confidence, reducing the high rate of inflation and helping to ease pressure on interest rates," Mr Taylor wrote in the letter.
Under the opposition leader's proposal, Coalition members of the taskforce would have access to briefings from government officials, and any policies determined by the group would remain subject to usual parliamentary and party processes.
He also said the Coalition "will not consider higher taxes".
The treasurer mocked the idea, labelling it a "predictable stunt".
"Angus Taylor promised 'change or die', and instead he's delivered a strongly worded letter," Mr Chalmers told reporters on Monday.
"This just shows how bereft the Liberal Party is of economic credibility."
Earlier this month he indicated the May federal budget would focus on spending restraint, productivity and tax reform, as the government considers whether to rework the capital gains tax break for investment properties in a bid to address intergenerational inequality.
A proposal to have a 50 per cent discount on the tax was discussed at the economic roundtable in August. Mr Taylor over the weekend rejected any changes to the tax break, warning that it would result in fewer homes being built.
"If you tax something, you get less of it, and they seem to want less homes," he told reporters.
Mr Chalmers did not rule out changes to the policy on Friday, but reiterated that Labor's tax and housing policy had not changed.
"There are intergenerational issues in our budget and in our economy, and we've got other ways of addressing them," he said.
"In housing, by building more homes and making it easier to save a deposit, and in the tax system, by cutting income taxes and boosting the low-income superannuation tax offset."
IMF report floats tax reform
Scrapping the capital gains tax exemption was among a list of suggestions to "create a more equitable tax system" outlined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its yearly report on Australia's economy, released yesterday.
The international agency also flagged an increase to the goods and services tax rate and removal of exemptions, changes to corporate income tax and the phasing out of superannuation concessions as options.
It also found Australia's economy had managed a "soft landing" in the wake of the pandemic, with "economic recovery expected to continue in the near-term".
"A high reliance on direct taxes and a relatively high effective cost of capital hinders investment and productivity growth and suggests there is scope for tax reform," the report read.
"A comprehensive reform package should aim at improving the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of the tax system."
Mr Chalmers described the IMF report as a "very positive" review of the government's economic performance, but acknowledged that there was more work to do.
"As always with these kinds of reports, the government won't pick up and run with every idea," he said.
"But obviously a lot of it is consistent with our thinking and with our economic reform agenda."

New anti-government chants in Tehran after giant rallies abroad: reports
Some residents of Tehran on Sunday chanted slogans against the clerical leadership from balconies and windows, reports said, a day after Iranians abroad staged giant opposition rallies in Europe and North America.
The government under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was shaken by a protest movement that peaked in January and which according to rights groups was repressed by security forces in a crackdown that left thousands dead.
While the street protests have petered out in the face of the crackdown, last week residents of Tehran and other cities began shouting slogans against the leadership from the relative safety of their own homes inside vast apartment blocks.
In a new night of chants, residents of the eastern Tehran district of Ekbatan on Sunday shouted "death to Khamenei", "death to the Islamic republic" and "long live the shah", according to the Shahrak Ekbatan social media account which monitors the area.
Reza Pahlavi, the son of the shah ousted by the Islamic revolution, had urged people inside the country to stage such actions in parallel with protests abroad over the weekend.
Police in the southern German city of Munich said 250,000 people attended a rally there Saturday which in an unusual move was personally addressed by Pahlavi.
Other major pro-monarchy rallies were held in diaspora strongholds including Los Angeles and Toronto.
Pahlavi's office said on X that over a million people had attended such rallies worldwide but it was not immediately possible to confirm the figure.
Speaking in Munich, Pahlavi hailed the rally as the biggest such in years and said he was ready to lead a transition in Iran.
Monarchist supporters were also gladdened by an extremely rare public appearance at the rally by his sole surviving full sibling, his sister the former princess Farahnaz.
Persian-language TV channel Iran International, which is based outside Iran, reported similar actions taking place in other parts of Tehran Sunday, broadcasting images of people chanting "this is the final battle, Pahlavi is coming back" and "death to the Guards" in reference to the authorities' ideological army the Revolutionary Guards.
Slogans hostile to the authorities were also chanted in other cities including Shiraz in the south and Arak in the centre of the country, it added.
It was not immediately possible for AFP to verify the videos.
The new actions come two days ahead of talks on Tuesday between the US and Iran focused on the Iranian nuclear programme in Geneva which are seen as crucial to determining if Washington goes ahead with military action against Tehran.
According to the latest toll issued by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, over 7,000 people were killed during the protests, the vast majority protesters shot dead by security forces. Almost 54,000 people have been arrested in a crackdown that is ongoing, it added.

In Munich, the US urges ‘collective strength’ among allies to deter China
Washington and its Indo-Pacific and European allies emphasise need for cooperation to counter Beijing’s military build-up
Speaking at the conference on Saturday, Elbridge Colby, US undersecretary of defence for policy, said that while Washington wanted a “stable and respectful” relationship with China and to avoid conflict, this could only be done from a “position of strength” economically and militarily, with a focus on working with allies in “collective strength” for the first island chain.
The first island chain is a series of islands and archipelagos in East Asia, running from Japan to the Philippines. It includes Taiwan, which Beijing views as part of China to be reunited by force, if necessary.
Most countries, including the US and its allies, do not recognise self-governed Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to any forcible change to the status quo and is legally bound to supply Taipei with weapons for defence.
While stressing that Washington sought “stability” in the Taiwan Strait, Colby said the US was not trying to “strangle” Beijing.

Chinese tech companies are competing to make their mark during the Spring Festival Gala presented by state-run broadcaster CCTV, a variety show and annual spectacle that provides a rare nationwide marketing opportunity, like the Super Bowl in the US, and is also an unmistakable signal of political alignment with Beijing’s industrial priorities.
This year, ByteDance’s cloud computing arm, Volcano Engine, secured an “exclusive AI cloud partnership” with the gala, scheduled for Monday, taking the baton from last year’s sponsor Alibaba Cloud, the cloud computing and artificial intelligence unit of Alibaba Group Holding. This comes as demand for computing power surges, and China’s major cloud-service providers are locked in an increasingly fierce rivalry.
In a promotion for its consumer-facing Doubao app, the company plans to distribute more than 100,000 tech products, including drones, electric vehicles, robots and 3D printers, along with digital red envelopes worth up to 8,888 yuan (US$1,286) through lucky draws on Monday.
The gesture faces off against Tencent’s Yuanbao and Alibaba’s Qwen AI apps, which before the holiday rolled out giveaways worth 1 billion yuan and 3 billion yuan, respectively, in cash and vouchers, as the ancient tradition of lucky money found a new battleground in the AI era.
Excluded by the CCTV-ByteDance partnership, Alibaba sought other avenues for Qwen, sponsoring galas organised by local broadcasters in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Henan. Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.
Humanoid robots are expected, once again, to entertain audiences after a Yangge folk dance performed by Unitree robots on last year’s stage went viral.

Biodegradable Mardi Gras beads help make Carnival season more sustainable
It is Carnival season in New Orleans
- Bookmark
It is Carnival season in New Orleans. That means gazillions of green, gold and purple Mardi Gras beads.
Once made of glass and cherished by parade spectators who were lucky enough to catch them, today cheap plastic beaded necklaces from overseas are tossed from floats by the handful. Spectators sometimes pile dozens around their necks, but many are trashed or left on the ground. A few years ago after heavy flooding, the city found more than 46 tons of them clogging its storm drains.
The beads are increasingly viewed as a problem, but a Mardi Gras without beads also seems unfathomable. That is why it was a radical step when the Krewe of Freret made the decision last year to ban plastic beads from their parade.
“Our riders loved it because the spectators don’t value this anymore,” Freret co-founder Greg Rhoades said. “It’s become so prolific that they dodge out of the way when they see cheap plastic beads coming at them."
This year, beads are back, but not the cheap plastic ones. Freret is one of three krewes throwing biodegradable beads developed at Louisiana State University.
The “PlantMe Beads” are 3D-printed from a starch-based, commercially available material called polylactic acid, or PLA, graduate student Alexis Strain said. The individual beads are large hollow spheres containing okra seeds. That is because the necklaces can actually be planted, and the okra attracts bacteria that help them decompose.
2.5 million pounds of trash
Kristi Trail, executive director of the Pontchartrain Conservancy, said plastic beads are a twofold problem. First, they clog the storm drains, leading to flooding. Then those that aren’t caught in the drains are washed directly into Lake Pontchartrain, where they can harm marine life. The group is currently preparing to study microplastics in the lake.
The trend toward a more sustainable Mardi Gras has been growing for years and includes a small but growing variety of more thoughtful throws like food, soaps and sunglasses. Trail said there is no good data right now to say if those efforts are having an impact, but the group recently got a grant that should help them answer the question in the future.
“Beads are obviously a problem, but we generate about 2.5 million pounds of trash from Mardi Gras,” Trail said.
First algae beads, now PlantMe beads
Strain works in the lab of Professor Naohiro Kato, an associate professor of biology at LSU. He first got the idea to develop biodegradable beads in 2013 after talking to people concerned about the celebration's environmental impact. As a plant biologist, Kato knew that bioplastics could be made from plants and got curious about the possibilities.
The first iteration of the lab's biodegradable beads came in 2018, when they produced beads made from a bioplastic derived from microalgae. However, production costs were too high for the algae-based beads to offer a practical alternative to petroleum-based beads. Then Strain started experimenting with 3D printing, and the PlantMe Bead was born.
For the 2026 Carnival season, LSU students have produced 3,000 PlantMe Bead necklaces that they are giving to three krewes in exchange for feedback on the design and on how well they are received by spectators.
One funny thing, Kato said, is that people have told him they love how unique the PlantMe Beads are and want to keep them.
“So wait a minute, if you want to keep it, the petroleum-plastic Mardi Gras bead is the best, because this won’t last,” he said.
‘Let’s throw things that people value'
The lab is still working on ideas for a more sustainable Mardi Gras. Strain is experimenting with a different 3D printer material that biodegrades quickly without needing to be planted. Kato is talking with local schools about turning Mardi Gras bead-making into a community project. He envisions students 3D printing necklaces while learning about bioplastics and plant biology. And he is still exploring ways to make algae-based bioplastic commercially viable.
Ultimately, however, Kato said, the goal should not be to replace one plastic bead with a less harmful one. He hopes Mardi Gras embraces the idea of less waste.
Rhoades said Freret is moving in the same direction.
“In 2025, we were the first krewe — major parading organization — to say, ‘No more. No more cheap beads. Let’s throw things that people value, that people appreciate, that can be used year-round,’ " Rhoades said.
One of the most coveted items they throw is baseball hats with the Freret logo. He sees people wearing the hats around the city, and he says other krewes have noticed.
“I really believe that we, and other krewes, are able to inspire your larger krewes,” he said. “They want people to like their stuff. They want people take their stuff home, and use it, and talk about it, and post it on social media, and say, ‘Look what I just caught!’ ”

What to know about the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance
Law enforcement agents have been gathering more potential evidence as the search for “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week
- Bookmark
A glove containing DNA found a couple of miles from the Arizona home of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie ’s missing mother appears to match those worn by a masked person outside her house the night she disappeared, the FBI said Sunday.
The development comes as law enforcement gathers more potential evidence in the search for Nancy Guthrie, 84, which heads into its third week.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her Tucson home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Here's what to know about her disappearance and the search to find her:
Video of masked man and discovery of a glove
The FBI on Tuesday released surveillance videos of a person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of the person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. It described him as a man about 5 feet, 9 inches (1.75 meters) tall with a medium build. The agency said he was carrying a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.
On Sunday, the FBI said in a statement that a glove, found in a field near the side of a road about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the home, had been sent off for DNA testing. The agency said that it received preliminary results Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation.
Late Friday, law enforcement agents sealed off a road about two miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home as part of their investigation. A series of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock.
Investigators also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a nearby restaurant parking lot. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation.
Studying DNA
Investigators collected DNA from Guthrie’s property which doesn’t belong to Guthrie or those in close contact with her, the sheriff's department said. Investigators are working to identify who it belongs to.
Evidence requiring forensic analysis is being sent to the same out-of-state lab that has been used since the beginning of the case, the department said.
The FBI has said approximately 16 gloves were found in various spots near the house, most of which were searchers’ gloves that had been discarded.
Sorting through tips
The Pima County sheriff and the FBI announced phone numbers and a website to offer tips. Several hundred detectives and agents have been assigned to the case, the sheriff’s department said.
The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since Feb. 1. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
The sheriff’s department has not said whether any tips have advanced the investigation.
On Tuesday, sheriff deputies detained a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson. Authorities didn’t say what led them to stop the man but confirmed he was released.
The same day, deputies and FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search in Rio Rico, about an hour's drive south of the city.
Family pleas
Savannah Guthrie, her sister and her brother have gone on social media and shared multiple video messages to their mother’s purported captor.
The family’s Instagram videos have shifted in tone from impassioned pleas to whoever may have their mom, saying they want to talk and are even willing to pay a ransom, to bleaker and more desperate requests for the public’s help.
The latest video on Thursday was simply a home video of their mother and a promise to “never give up on her.”
A quiet neighborhood
Nancy Guthrie lived alone in the upscale Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where houses are spaced far apart and set back from the street by long driveways, gates and dense desert vegetation.
Savannah Guthrie grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and once worked at a television station in the city, where her parents settled in the 1970s. She joined “Today” in 2011.
In a video, she described her mother as a “loving woman of goodness and light.”

Instructor at scuba class where 12-year-old drowned had ‘been awake straight’ for 29 hours, report says
Dylan Harrison, 12, drowned during a scuba diving class in August 2025
- Bookmark
An instructor for a Texas scuba diving class where a 12-year-old girl drowned admitted to investigators he hadn’t slept in nearly 30 hours at the time of her death, according to a new report.
Dylan Harrison, 12, died in August 2025 after drowning during a class at The Scuba Ranch, a training lake in Terrell, Texas, according to Fox 4 News. Now, new allegations have come to light about her instructor, William Armstrong.
Armstrong was reportedly teaching a class of eight students, including Harrison, when the incident occurred. Harrison went missing during the class, and her body was found at a depth of 45 feet, Fox 4 News reports.
Armstrong was arrested on Friday, February 6, and charged with injury to a child, according to the outlet. He was released after posting a $150,000 bond and reportedly made no comments to reporters as he left the Kaufman County Jail.
An affidavit obtained by Fox 4 News said Armstrong admitted to investigators he had “been awake straight for approximately 29 hours, working three jobs” when Harrison drowned.
According to Fox 4 News, the document indicates no one was in the water searching for Harrison, and Armstrong was standing on the dock without diving gear on, when rescue officials arrived at the scene.
Investigators also collected Harrison’s dive watch, which appeared to indicate she wasn’t weighted properly, Fox 4 News reports. Weighting is a key safety measure that helps divers control their buoyancy, as well as the speed at which they dive and resurface, according to Scuba Diving International.
Armstrong has since been “permanently suspended” from teaching at The Scuba Ranch, according to the outlet. Armstrong also worked as an assistant chief deputy at the Collin County Sheriff’s Office, but has since resigned from his role, Fox 4 News reported.
In a statement shared with The Independent, a spokesperson for The Scuba Ranch confirmed the instructor was "permanently suspended" from teaching at their facility following the incident.
"The Scuba Ranch does not employ Dive Instructors, and does not provide, direct, or supervise instruction received. All Dive Instructors are independent of The Scuba Ranch and not affiliated with us other than as a customer," the spokesperson said.
The Scuba Ranch has been “fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation and remains committed to supporting all efforts to understand what happened," the spokesperson added.
“We pray this family receives the answers, justice, and closure they deserve, and that all of the dive community would be strengthened through what we learn from this tragedy,” they said.
The Independent has contacted an attorney representing Harrison’s family for comment. The Independent was unable to identify an attorney for Armstrong.

US forces board oil tanker in Indian Ocean that fled Caribbean blockade
The United States intercepted a new oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that had fled the blockade ordered by US President Donald Trump against sanctioned ships leaving or heading to Venezuela, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.
US forces boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that violated US President Donald Trump's blockade of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean and fled the region, the Pentagon said Sunday.
The Panamanian-flagged Veronica III "tried to defy President Trump's quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down," the Pentagon said on X.
The post included a video of US forces boarding a helicopter and then boarding the tanker ship.
The Pentagon intercepted the Aquila II in similar fashion about a week ago.

In December, Trump ordered a "blockade" of sanctioned oil vessels heading to and from Venezuela. At least nine ships have been seized thus far.
But those ships seized in recent months make up only a tiny fraction of the total number of sanctioned "shadow fleet" vessels operating worldwide to evade sanctions, which a senior US Coast Guard officer said number up to 800.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on January 3 – the same day that US special forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid – carrying around 1.9 million barrels of oil, TankersTrackers.com said.

The ship is listed under US sanctions relating to Iran, according to the website of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control.
"The Department of War will deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain," the Pentagon said on X.

Erdogan postpones UAE visit, saying leader has 'health problem'
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday announced he was postponing a visit to Abu Dhabi because Emirati leader Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan had a "health problem" - then deleted the message.
The message, posted by Erdogan's team on X, said he had talked with Al Nahyan by phone.
"During the course of the call, President Erdogan expressed his sadness over the health problem experienced by (President) Al Nahyan and wished him a prompt recovery", said the three-paragraph message.
Erdogan would travel to the United Arab Emirates at a later date, still to be determined, the message added.
Although the message - of which AFP has a screen grab - was quickly deleted from the account, it had already been picked up by official Turkish media.
Turkey's state broadcaster likewise took down its article on Erdogan that mentioned the Emirati leader's health problem.
The official Emirati news agency, WAM, reported on the telephone conversation between the two leaders, but did not mention that Erdogan's visit had been postponed.
Contacted by AFP, neither the Turkish presidency nor the Emirati authorities - who have themselves made no statement on their president's health - have yet answered.
The Emirati leader's team on Saturday evening released photos taken the same day showing Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, smiling and apparently in good health, with Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the emir of Qatar.

Opinion | Can Manila’s South China Sea strategy of defiance and diplomacy hold?
China and the Philippines are both signalling openness to diplomacy alongside continued military flexing, but this may not be sustainable
In the South China Sea, conference rooms and contested shoals operate on parallel tracks. Whether this compartmentalisation can hold or whether the next incident drags everyone into a crisis is fast becoming a regional question, not merely a bilateral one.
Yet events at sea that week told a different story. US-Philippine joint patrols operated near Scarborough Shoal, followed by Chinese patrols. As both capitals seek to shape the narrative, space for quiet de-escalation is shrinking.
In some ways, this two-track dynamic offers Beijing and Manila flexibility. Diplomats point to dialogue as evidence of responsible statecraft. Security establishments show resolve without triggering escalation. Domestic audiences see their government standing firm.

Teen daughter who campaigned for Chicago man detained by ICE dies from rare cancer
‘Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened deportation of her father’
- Bookmark
A Chicago teenager who had campaigned for her father's release from immigration detention has died after a battle with a rare form of cancer.
Ofelia Giselle Torres Hidalgo, 16, passed away on Friday from stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, her family confirmed in a statement. The teenager had been diagnosed with the aggressive soft tissue cancer in December and had been undergoing intensive chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
Her death comes just days after an immigration judge in Chicago ruled that her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was conditionally entitled to a "cancellation of removal". This significant decision, made only three days before Ofelia's passing, acknowledged the severe hardship his deportation would inflict upon his US-born, citizen children.
The ruling, according to a statement from his attorney, now offers Mr Torres Maldonado a clear pathway to becoming a lawful permanent resident and, eventually, a US citizen. Funeral arrangements for Ofelia remain private, the family added.
Ofelia was present via Zoom at last week's hearing.
“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened deportation of her father,” said Kalman Resnick, Torres Maldonado's attorney. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”
Torres Maldonado, a painter and home renovator, was detained Oct. 18 at a Home Depot store in suburban Chicago as the area was at the center of a major immigration crackdown dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz,” which began in early September.
Ofelia was undergoing treatment when she appeared in October in a video posted on a GoFundMe page set up for the family.
“My dad, like many other fathers, is a hard-working person who wakes up early in the morning and goes to work without complaining, thinking about his family,” she said in the video. “I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted just because they were not born here.”
In a wheelchair, she attended a hearing for her father in October. The family’s attorneys told a judge at that time that she was released from the hospital just a day before her father’s arrest so that she could see family and friends. They added that Ofelia had been unable to continue treatment “because of the stress and disruption.”
Torres Maldonado's attorneys petitioned for his release as his deportation case went through the system. A judge ordered a bond hearing after ruling in October that his detention was illegal and violated Torres Maldonado's due process rights.
A judge later cited Torres Maldonado’s lack of criminal history while allowing his release on a $2,000 bond.
Lawyers said Torres Maldonado entered the U.S. in 2003. He and his partner, Sandibell Hidalgo, also have a younger son.
The Department of Homeland Security had alleged he had been living illegally in the U.S. for years and has a history of driving offenses, including driving without a valid license, without insurance and speeding.

FBI seeking DNA match from glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s home

TUCSON, Arizona - Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from a discarded glove that was found near Ms Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in doorbell camera footage before she was abducted two weeks ago, the FBI said on Feb 15.
Results from the glove could potentially lead to what forensic experts call a “hit” as early as Feb 16 after they have conducted a national database search on the DNA specimen, the FBI indicated in a statement.
The preliminary findings from a private crime laboratory in Florida were received by the FBI on Feb 14 and were awaiting “quality control and official confirmation” on Feb 15 before the results are submitted for comparison against known DNA profiles in a national database, the FBI said.
The process of running a specimen through CoDIS, short for the Combined DNA Index System, typically takes 24 hours from when the Federal Bureau of Investigation receives a DNA sample.
The glove is one of roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days in a roadside field about 3km from the Tucson-area residence of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie
Most of the gloves recovered by investigators turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the vicinity, the FBI said.
But the one with a DNA profile recovered from it is “different and appears to match the gloves” worn by the man in a ski mask seen trying to disable Mrs Guthrie’s door camera in the early morning hours shortly before she was abducted, according to the FBI statement.
Hours after the DNA announcement, Ms Savannah Guthrie posted a video message on social media saying, “we still have hope” and urging whoever has her mother or knows her location “to do the right thing.”
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Feb 13 he was certain the person in the video, who was also wearing a gun in a holster and an over-stuffed backpack, was the primary suspect investigators were looking for to solve the high-profile case.
Mrs Nancy Guthrie was last seen on Jan 31 when family dropped her off at her home near Tucson after she had dined with them, and relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities have said.
Mr Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.
At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them delivered initially to news media outlets.
But there has been no known direct contact between Mrs Guthrie’s presumed captors and her family, or with authorities.
Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA tests to have come from Ms Guthrie, officials said last week.
Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also had a pacemaker.
The sheriff said on Feb 13 that DNA from people other than Ms Guthrie or those known to have been in close contact with her had also been collected from her property, but there has been no official word on any further findings from those samples.
Ms Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show Today, has posted several video messages with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie pleading for their mother’s return
In one video, they expressed a willingness to meet ransom demands.
In her latest Instagram video, two weeks to the day after her mother was reported missing and directed to “whoever has her or knows where she is,” the broadcast journalist said, “We believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it’s never too late.”
Mr Nanos told Reuters on Feb 13 no proof of life has surfaced since the abduction but he was quick to add: “There’s not been any proof of death either.”
Acting on a federal court-ordered warrant in connection with the Guthrie case on the night of Feb 13, sheriff’s deputies and FBI agents searched another house in an affluent neighbourhood less than 3km from her home, authorities confirmed over the weekend.
The sheriff’s office also said a person was questioned that night in a related traffic stop, but no arrests resulted from either incident.
The presumed kidnapping has drawn intense media attention as well as expressions of sympathy and support from President Donald Trump. REUTERS

Ms Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show Today, has posted several video messages with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie pleading for their mother’s return
In one video, they expressed a willingness to meet ransom demands.
In her latest Instagram video, two weeks to the day after her mother was reported missing and directed to “whoever has her or knows where she is,” the broadcast journalist said, “We believe in the essential goodness of every human being, and it’s never too late.”
Mr Nanos told Reuters on Feb 13 no proof of life has surfaced since the abduction but he was quick to add: “There’s not been any proof of death either.”
Acting on a federal court-ordered warrant in connection with the Guthrie case on the night of Feb 13, sheriff’s deputies and FBI agents searched another house in an affluent neighbourhood less than 3km from her home, authorities confirmed over the weekend.
The sheriff’s office also said a person was questioned that night in a related traffic stop, but no arrests resulted from either incident.
The presumed kidnapping has drawn intense media attention as well as expressions of sympathy and support from President Donald Trump. REUTERS

Why a crash in the final 'takes a bit of sting out' of Aussie snowboarder's Olympics

Why Australian Adam Lambert's medal-losing crash in the final made him feel better about his Winter Olympics
It seemed that only a disaster would cost Australia a second medal at the Winter Olympics in Livigno on Monday.
Unfortunately, that is exactly what happened — although that's not how Adam Lambert saw it.
Lambert and Josie Baff had cruised through the mixed team snowboard cross event, with Olympic champion Baff in particular looking in sublime form.
The pair produced two hugely impressive displays to advance to the final.
In mixed snowboard cross, the men race first, with the women following, handicapped by the amount of time their partner finished behind the leader.
With Baff arguably the form rider of the Games, all Lambert needed to do was get down to the bottom in contention with the leaders.
And, right up until the final corner, that's exactly what appeared to be happening, with Lambert hot on the heels of Italian Lorenzo Sommariva.
But then came that disaster.
"So I came around turn five, and I had speed on Lorenzo," Lambert said.
"I would have preferred to have been on his left.
"But unfortunately, I kind of just landed on his right, landed on his tail a little bit and then I had to go inside in turn six, and Lorenzo also was as far inside as he could be.
"My nose mounted his tail, and his tail slipped out. I lost all contact with my toe-side edge.
"So that's what set me down."
With Lambert down, Baff was assigned the maximum time deficit — 4.16 seconds — calculated according to the length of the course.
A penny for the thoughts of Baff, marooned up at the top of the course while her rivals sped away.
"I was thinking, wow, 4 seconds is a really long time," Baff said.
She's not wrong.
Baff had made up a deficit of half a second in the semifinal comfortably, which the 23-year-old said gave her confidence she could pull off a miracle.
"I knew that I was strong, my starts were way better today — I think I was less nervous and I was kind of going back to my normal starts.
"So I was like, 'You know what, anything's possible and I'm going to trust that these three might have some contact lower down and I want to be in that race if anything does happen.'
"I guess that was the mindset here, and also, I don't ever give up, not until I cross that line.
"So I just kind of went in with that [attitude], and I could see, I was like, 'Wow, I'm getting closer. I actually am getting closer. I thought this could still work.'
"But unfortunately, 4 seconds is a long time."
Lambert acknowledged that Baff was capable of extraordinary things, but even that was beyond her.
"I know Josie could have pulled back half a second — she probably could have pulled back a second and a half, she's been riding so well — but 4 seconds is just slightly too much."
It left the Australians in the worst possible place to finish at an Olympic Games — fourth in a four-team final.
As the three teams they had been racing with shoulder-to-shoulder just moments before went up and claimed their medals and accepted the plaudits from the massive crowd, Lambert and Baff trudged through the mix zone.
These Games have been tough on the snowboard cross riders, especially Lambert.
Cameron Bolton is his roommate and best friend. Seeing him be airlifted away from Livigno with a broken neck clearly affected the 28-year-old, at least in part, resulting in his mixed form and early exit in the men's competition.
The fact that he came within touching distance of an Olympic medal must sting, but despite the obvious disappointment, Lambert was philosophical.
"It's a tough place to be, fourth at the Olympics," he said.
"But we're also at the Olympics, and we're also in the finals.
"There's only so many people that get to be on the podium, and I'm proud to have been in the final to begin with."
Lambert — who only won his first FIS World Cup event earlier this year after eight seasons — said it was "too soon" to know whether this mistake would keep him up at night.
It may be the case that, after toiling for so many years without claiming a World Cup victory, Lambert has a different relationship with winning than others, taking a more holistic view of the sport.
Regardless, Lambert still said representing Australia in a final was "beautiful".
"I'm feeling a lot better about it [my Olympics] after today," Lambert said.
"I feel like, even with my crash in the final, I showed a little bit more of my style of riding and my ability.
"I'm really proud to have been able to do that, and it does take a bit of sting out of the last two days.
"It's a beautiful thing to be able to be out here and be representing the country and get so far into an event.
"Fourth place is — it's just short of the medals, but it's fourth place.
"It's still very good."

Zelensky announces expansion of joint defense projects with partners
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced this in his nightly video address, Ukrinform reports.
"Thanks again to Germany – we now have a new strike-drone production line, and we will continue expanding these efforts: joint development, joint production, pan-European programs, and financial instruments," Zelensky said.
He stressed that today, there is no leader in Europe who is not talking about the need for significantly greater European independence, much greater European self-reliance, and much greater autonomous strength for all of Europe.
"This is now one of the main trends. We are proposing concrete steps, concrete projects that make Europe stronger," Zelensky said.
As was reported earlier, the establishment of the Ukrainian-German defense enterprise Quantum Frontline Industries was announced as part of the new initiative "Build with Ukraine" in December.

FBI says DNA recovered from discarded glove near Guthrie home
The glove appears to match the pair worn by the masked suspect in surveillance video of Nancy Guthrie’s front door
A glove containing DNA found about 3km from the house of Today show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother appears to match those worn by a masked person outside her front door in Tucson the night she vanished, the FBI said on Sunday.
The glove, found in a field near the side of the road, was sent off for DNA testing. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement on Sunday that it received preliminary results on Saturday and is awaiting official confirmation.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on January 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities said her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
The discovery was revealed days after investigators had released surveillance videos of the masked person outside Guthrie’s front door.
A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long trousers, jacket and gloves.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. The agency said he was carrying a 25-litre “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.

How Iran plans to 'woo' Witkoff and Kushner in Geneva

It's the economy, stupid: Iran's new negotiating strategy facing the US combines nuclear talks with an offer to integrate American companies into the Iranian economy.
Iranian officials first raised the proposal during the initial round of talks in Oman. At the upcoming meeting in Geneva, they are expected to present an organized plan centered on allowing US firms to enter Iran's oil industry, rehabilitate its refineries and take part in additional projects, regional diplomatic sources told Israel Hayom.
Hamid Ghanbari, deputy head of economic diplomacy at Iran's Foreign Ministry, confirmed to local media that Tehran has offered Washington economic cooperation ranging from permitting US firms to operate in Iran's oil and gas fields to investing in mining projects and even purchasing passenger aircraft from American manufacturers.
Iran holds some of the world's largest natural gas reserves but has struggled for years to develop them due to corruption and sweeping international sanctions.
According to Ghanbari, the negotiations "include shared interests in areas such as energy, joint oil and gas fields, fast-yield mineral investments, urban development and aircraft purchases." He argued that for any long-term agreement to endure without being violated, it is essential that the US secure substantial and rapid economic returns.
Ghanbari added that the previous agreement, the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, failed in part because the US did not reap tangible economic benefits from it. Any new deal, he suggested, would require opportunities for quick and significant returns for Washington in order to make it resilient.
In exchange for these economic incentives, Iran is demanding swift measures to unfreeze tens of billions of dollars in Iranian assets held in Western banks and to ease sanctions in step with progress in the talks. Iran's frozen funds worldwide amount to tens of billions of dollars. Diplomatic sources noted, however, that after the previous deal led to the release of Iranian assets, much of the money was funneled into military buildup, missile development and the financing of regional terrorist organizations.
The Iranian approach appears designed to engage President Donald Trump and his envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, on business rather than on strictly military and security grounds.
The talks are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday. After the first round concludes, the sides will decide whether to continue discussions later in the week or return home for consultations.

India crushes Pakistan by 61 runs in marquee game in T20 World Cup. No handshakes again
Archrivals India and Pakistan declined to shake hands before and after the most-anticipated game of cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup
- Bookmark
Archrivals India and Pakistan declined to shake hands before and after the most-anticipated game of cricket's Twenty20 World Cup, with India easily winning by 61 runs on Sunday to secure its Super 8 spot.
India opener Ishan Kishan scored 77 off 40 deliveries in a match in Colombo which almost didn't take place after Pakistan had threatened a boycott earlier this month before reversing its decision.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and India captain Suryakumar Yadav didn't shake hands at the toss, which Pakistan won and chose to field. India and Pakistan players had refused to shake hands at last year’s acrimonious Asia Cup tournament in the United Arab Emirates that took place amid diplomatic and military tensions between the two neighbors.
India made a competitive 175-7 on Sunday on a sticky pitch at R. Premadasa Stadium. In reply Pakistan was bowled out for 114 in 18 overs. Despite the heavy defeat, Pakistan can still advance from Group A. It plays Namibia in its last group game.
Sunday’s game was the first time the teams have met since the Asia Cup, won by India.
Early setback for India
Agha’s decision to bowl first surprised many because the ground has a history of not favoring run chases.
“Our bowlers didn’t bowl well according to the situation and when it came to batting we didn’t apply ourselves, they didn’t give us a chance to go deep in the game,” Agha said.
Yadav was pleased with how losing the toss had turned out.
“Batting first was a better option on this wicket," he said.
But India's batting suffered an early setback when its most aggressive batter Abhishek Sharma was dismissed without scoring. Agha bowled the first over with four consecutive dot balls and had Sharma caught by Shaheen Shah Afridi.
Kishan pulled India back with a six and two fours in the following over and he dominated an 87-run stand for the second wicket off 46 deliveries with Tilak Varma.
Kishan's innings included three sixes and 10 boundaries before being bowled by off spinner Saim Ayub.
Ayub took two consecutive wickets in his last over to finish with his career-best T20 bowling of 3-25.
Yadav (32 off 29) and Shivam Dube (27 off 17) made useful contributions for India.
Poor start for Pakistan’s chase
Seam bowler Hardik Pandya gave India an ideal start with a wicket-maiden over, dismissing Sahibzada Farhan in the fourth delivery.
Jasprit Bumrah took two wickets in the next over — Ayub (lbw for 6) and Agha (caught by Pandya for 4).
Spinner Axar Patel bowled Babar Azam (5), leaving Pakistan 34-4.
Usman Khan resisted with a 34-ball 44 but was stumped when he stepped out to hit Patel.
Pandya, Bumrah, Patel and Varun Chakravarthy took two wickets each.
We'll meet again?
Agha said his team must now focus on securing its place in the last eight.
Second-place U.S. and third-place Pakistan have four points each in Group A but Pakistan still has a game to play.
“You have to see the bigger picture," Agha said, "we need to win that game and qualify … and then a new tournament starts.”
India and Pakistan could meet again in the semifinals or final. That game would also be played in Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament with India.
All eyes on Colombo
In the lead-up to the match in Colombo, Agha said he believed it was up to the Indian players to decide whether they would shake hands with his team before and after Sunday’s game.
Yadav, for his part, had been non-committal.
Pakistan’s government considered not playing Sunday’s match after the International Cricket Council kicked Bangladesh out of the World Cup for refusing to play matches in India, citing security concerns.
Pakistan only agreed to play after intense discussions with the ICC. The fixture is a major revenue earner for the ICC.
Political and military tensions have meant the two teams have not played a bilateral series for years.
India has not traveled to Pakistan since 2008 and Pakistan visited India for the 50-over World Cup in 2023 but has since played ICC tournaments at neutral venues.
India has defeated Pakistan 13 times in the 17 T20 games they have played. It now also has an impressive 8-1 record in the nine T20 World Cup matches since the first edition in 2007.
West Indies makes it 3 in 3, US keeps slim hopes alive
At Mumbai, West Indies notched its third successive win in Group C when it thumped Nepal by nine wickets and qualified for the Super 8 stage.
West Indies had already beat Scotland and England to take command of Group C.
Nepal showed plenty of promise in its first game when it lost narrowly to England, but then two heavy defeats against first-timer Italy and Sunday against West Indies saw it eliminated.
Fast bowler Jason Holder grabbed 4-27 and restricted Nepal to 133-8. Shai Hope then smashed an unbeaten 61 off 44 balls and Shimron Hetmyer scored 46 off 32 balls as West Indies cruised to 134-1 in 15.2 overs.
Sanjay Krishnamurthi kept American hopes of Super 8 qualification alive with a maiden T20 half-century – 68 not out off 33 balls – against Namibia in their Group A clash.
Skipper Monank Patel also scored 52 off 30 balls as the U.S. notched up its tournament highest score – 199-4 in 20 overs.
In reply, Namibia was restricted to 168-6, losing its third game and is now eliminated from the competition.
The U.S. won its final game by 31 runs.

Morocco's FAR complete CAF Champions League quarters line-up
Moroccan military club FAR Rabat forced a 0-0 draw at Egyptian giants Al Ahly on Sunday and secured the last CAF Champions League quarter-finals place.
Drawing in Cairo lifted FAR to nine points, one more than rivals Young Africans of Tanzania, whose 3-0 victory over Algerian visitors JS Kabylie in Zanzibar City was in vain.
Ahly supporters in a 45,000 Cairo crowd vented their frustrations by flinging bottles toward the pitch as the dominant home team failed to convert territorial superiority into goals.
Angolan Laurindo 'Depu' Aurelio scored in each half for Young Africans before Congolese Chadrack Boka notched a third goal.
Record 12-time African champions Ahly topped Group B with 10 points, and will be among the four seeded teams for the quarter-finals draw on Tuesday.
The others are defending champions and fellow Egyptian club Pyramids, surprising Stade Malien of Mali and Sudanese side Al Hilal.
Hilal reached the last eight of the premier African club competition despite playing home matches in Rwanda because of the civil war in Sudan.
The unseeded quartet are FAR and Renaissance Berkane from Morocco, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa and Esperance from Tunisia.
It ranks among the strongest last-eight fields in the 62-year competition with Ahly, Pyramids, FAR, Esperance and Sundowns have all lifted the trophy. Malien and Hilal have finished runners-up.
Berkane are Champions League debutants after winning the second-tier CAF Confederation Cup three times and finishing runners-up twice in the past seven seasons.

At least four people were killed on Sunday evening in an Israeli drone strike targeting a vehicle in the eastern Lebanese town of Majdal Anjar near the Lebanese-Syrian border despite a ceasefire, Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported.
The agency said an Israeli drone struck a car between the al-Masnaa border crossing and the village of Jdeidet Yabous, along the Lebanon-Syria border, resulting in fatalities and an unidentified number of injuries.
The sound of four strong explosions was reported heard in nearby villages, the agency added.
The attacks come amid repeated Israeli violations of a ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024.
Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war that began in October 2023, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
The offensives have killed more than 4,000 victims and wounded 17,000 in Lebanon.

Ukrainian drone attack targets multiple Russian oblasts, Bryansk reportedly left largely without electricity
Russian officials reported a large-scale drone attack targeting multiple regions on Feb. 15, including Moscow, Bryansk, and Belgorod Oblasts.
Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin claimed that Russian air defenses shot down 13 drones heading toward the capital, with emergency services responding to debris at impact sites.
Temporary flight restrictions were introduced at Domodedovo airport but were later lifted, according to state media.
Bryansk Oblast Governor Alexander Bogomaz said the region had been under sustained UAV attack since early morning, claiming that 120 drones were destroyed there. He later noted that strikes on energy infrastructure left five municipalities and parts of the city of Bryansk without heat and electricity.
Russia’s Defense Ministry earlier reported that 102 Ukrainian drones were intercepted between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. Moscow time across Bryansk, Kaluga, and Tula oblasts, as well as near Moscow.
Separately, Russian Telegram channels reported an apparent Ukrainian strike on the city of Belgorod, with regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov saying preliminary information indicated significant damage to energy infrastructure. Emergency services are assessing the extent of the damage.
No information was immediately available on the extent of the damage caused or on any possible casualties.
The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify these claims at the time of publication.
Ukraine regularly uses long-range drones to target military and industrial targets in Russia, including oil refineries, weapons factories, and ammunition depots.
The strikes are part of Ukraine's broader campaign of attacks inside Russia aimed at weakening Moscow's ability to sustain its war against Ukraine.

Marco Rubio Doesn’t Get It

Marco Rubio Doesn’t Get It
The Trump administration continues to lambast friends and empower foes.
Marco Rubio offered a more supportive message to Europe at the Munich Security Conference yesterday than J. D. Vance did a year ago. Wolfgang Ischinger, the chair of the conference, thanked him for the message of reassurance, adding, “I’m not sure you heard the sigh of relief in this hall.” This despite the fact that Rubio, like Vance, clearly misunderstands Europe and is in denial about the threats facing the United States and the transatlantic alliance.
In 2025, Vance said that the threat he worried the most about for Europe is not Russia, China, or any other external actor. It was the “threat from within,” particularly perceived restrictions on free speech. Vance’s attack landed like a bombshell in Europe. In the weeks that followed, Vance’s role in the Oval Office showdown with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the Signalgate leak (in which he wrote “I just hate bailing Europe out again”) reinforced his reputation as Europe’s strongest critic in the Trump administration.
Serving as the administration’s more diplomatic good cop, Rubio used his time at Munich to emphasize ties between Europe and the United States. He told the audience: “We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilization, and who, together with us, are willing and able to defend it.” Further emphasizing unity and shared purpose, he added, “We will always be a child of Europe.”
Rubio also tried to contextualize President Trump’s “direct” approach as part of the noble “task of renewal and restoration,” essential for both the alliance and for Europeans themselves. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline,” Rubio declared. Europe, he explained, had too much faith in open borders and international institutions when the only true defense of the world order is hard power—and the military investment that demands.
This story about Trump rescuing Europe from its short-sighted pacifism and general malaise is one you hear regularly, including from Europeans such as NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, but it’s not true. Consider the following.
On defense, Europe has been rearming rapidly over the past decade. Non-U.S. NATO members increased their defense spending by $70 billion a year during the first Trump administration, then by $190 billion in the Biden administration. The steep rise was largely in response to the growing threat from Russia, but it indicates that Europeans were seriously investing in their own defense well before Trump’s reelection.
It would be similarly wrong to claim that Europeans have outsourced Ukraine’s defense to the United States, given that Europe has been the biggest provider of aid to the country, allocating more than 132 billion euros from January 2022 to December 2024, compared with 114 billion euros from the U.S., according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. Europe’s contribution has grown since Trump took office again, and U.S. aid flatlined.
Even before Trump returned to power, the European Union’s asylum policy had shifted toward tighter border controls, faster processing, and a growing effort to assess asylum claims before allowing migrants in. The EU had also begun “de-risking” the economies of member nations by limiting Chinese investment, backing American export controls on advanced chip-making equipment to China, and reducing dependence on Chinese supply chains.
But the real problem was not what Rubio got wrong about Europe. It was what he chose not to say at all.
The big geopolitical story of this moment, other than Trump, is the increasing alignment and cooperation between Russia, China, and North Korea. Beijing and Pyongyang are now actively involved in a major war in Europe. China is helping Russia reconstitute its military and North Korea has sent weapons and troops. Russia has returned the favor by offering valuable military technology and know-how to both countries. Senior U.S. military and political officials have told me that they are particularly worried about North Korea’s cooperation with Russia and what it means for peace on the Korean peninsula.
This authoritarian alignment is the most profound threat that the United States and its allies, in Europe and the Indo-Pacific, face. Yet there was no mention of Russia or China in Rubio’s speech. He touched on both in the questions and answers but did not characterize them as strategic competitors or a threat to the alliance. This seems to be part of a pattern for the administration. In January, Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby gave a major speech in South Korea without ever mentioning North Korea. It’s like something out of Harry Potter—the threat cannot be named.
More perniciously, the Trump administration wants to readmit Russia to the G7 and has asked Russia and China to join Trump’s Board of Peace (Russian leader Vladimir Putin said yes, China said no). Meanwhile, Trump officials have seemed keen to alienate the EU and dismiss the “rules-based order” as nothing more than “cloud castle abstractions,” despite the fact that these are the very allies and ideals that the U.S. needs to compete with China and contain Russia.
Before arriving in Munich, Rubio told the press that “the old world is gone” and that “we live in a new era in geopolitics.” He is right, but he misunderstands why. The old order is fraying not because Europe is weak or complacent or guilelessly reliant on diplomatic institutions, but because authoritarian powers are increasingly willing to work together to forcefully reshape the world order. In this landscape, cohesive alliances, military deterrence, and economic resilience are essential.
By devoting his speech to the perceived shortcomings of America’s friends instead of the threats posed by the country’s adversaries, Rubio revealed not only the Trump administration’s flawed diagnosis of this geopolitical moment but its dangerously naive strategy for managing what is becoming—thanks largely to Trump—a treacherously multipolar world.

Femke Kok and Jutta Leerdam Power Speedskating-Mad Nation To Glory
Unknown

Before the Olympic 500-m women’s speedskating competition on early Sunday evening in Milan, the orange-clad Dutch enthusiasts at the venue—about 94.7% of long-track fans here have Holland connections—had no problem sharing their desired outcome of this race. They wanted a flip-flop.
Jutta Leerdam, who broke the Olympic record on Feb. 9 in the 1000 m—and, you likely have heard, is engaged to social media influencer-slash-boxer Jake Paul—already had her gold. Hopefully, she’d finish second in the 500, which is the strong suit of her teammate, Femke Kok, the 1000-m silver medalist. The Dutch were all-in on Kok for the shorter sprint. It was time for Kok to claim her prize.
Plus, many Dutch supporters don’t seem all that enamored with Leerdam’s famous fiancée. “He’s a little too extra for the Dutch,” says Yvette Reijtenbagh, who was wearing an orange beanie embroidered with the Netherlands flag. (When I asked her if she was from the Netherlands, she replied dryly, “No. Iceland.”)

“He’s showboaty,” says Else Baartman, 57, a secretary who lives in the northern part of the country. “He’s a little over the top,” notes Daniel Houben, a 37-year-old actuary from Holland who now lives in Switzerland. Perhaps Houben caught Paul’s entry into the Milan Speed Skating Stadium, surrounded by an entourage a half-dozen deep, including two humongous security guards and a guy filming his every move.
Unlike in the men’s 500 and 1000 races, which American Jordan Stolz won over Dutch rival Jenning de Boo in dramatic fashion, Team Netherlands left satisfied on Sunday. Kok, who has been dominating the 500 all season long, broke an Olympic record of her own; her time of 36.49 seconds is also the new fastest-ever time at sea level. Her margin of victory over silver medalist Leerdam, .66 seconds, is the largest in the 500-event since the 1972 Games in Sapporo, Japan.
“We are a really small country,” says Kok. “But we can do speedskating.”
No doubt. Stolz’s chase of four gold medals is gobbling up most of the sport’s Olympics headlines. But between long-track and short-track, the Netherlands tops the table in Milan: the Dutch have won 5 golds, and 11 total medals (Italy is second, with 3 golds and 5 total, respectively).
American Erin Jackson, the defending Olympic champion, finished fifth. She was paired with Kok in the final group. Jackson’s strong first 100-m—she called it the best start of her career—had her in medal contention. But Jackson stumbled out of a turn and couldn’t make up enough time to reach the podium. “For her to be able to basically do what I did last Olympic cycle, come in ranked number one, winning consistently, and then to do it at the Olympics, yeah, it's really awesome,” says Jackson.
The Dutch champions are cut from different cloths. Kok has a lower-key public presence than her teammate. Her Instagram posts mostly feature ice life: one thumbnail shows in a produce section. You can find Leerdam, however, on a private plane, lounging at a resort with Paul, or in a fashion shoot. That may explain, in part, why Leerdam has 6.2 million followers on the platform, while Kok has 285,000.
They do express admiration for one another. “We wanted to push each other to the highest level,” says Kok. With a pair of Olympic records in hand, mission accomplished. “She’s a different person than me, but we're still good, you know?” says Kok. “In the beginning, when we came up, the media was like making it, ‘oh, she's this, you're that. But we're not like this. We have respect.”
It helps that Leerdam, who will leave Milan with a pair of medals, has wholly earned her celebrity. “She’s a phenom,” says American Sarah Warren. “She had a ton of eyes on her, and she put it down, and she stood up to the pressure.”
Leerdham navigates a different set of challenges than her competitors, namely tabloid attention. “It's not always easy, especially with the media, because they want stories, and if they don't have stories, they make up stories,” she says. “That is sometimes hard to deal with as an athlete, if you just want to focus on skating fast or on your races.” Leerdam cites a rumor claiming that she and Stolz were training together. She actually thought this was a good idea, so she and Stolz did skate a few laps, she says, about a week or so ago.
Someone asked Leerdham, now that the competition is over, if she planned on enjoying Milan in the coming days. “I don't really know yet what the plan is,” says Leerdham. “We will see.”
Odds are, we’ll all find out soon enough.

Katie’s story: her abusive ex-partner said ‘kill yourself’. When she did, police dropped domestic violence inquiry

Hours before Katie Madden took her own life, she had a tense phone call with her former partner Jonathon Russell. Russell was on bail after allegedly assaulting Madden – he was banned from contacting her – but the conversation took place nevertheless.
There was a witness to the call who gave evidence to the inquest into Madden’s death. Mason Jones, a friend of Madden’s, said Russell was “vile” and “abusive”. Although Jones said he could not remember the exact words Russell used, he said: “I recall Jon saying at least once that he was in control of the town and would end her life if she didn’t do it herself.”
In evidence, Russell denied saying this, but he did admit he had encouraged Madden to kill herself before this.
In the days leading up to Madden’s death, her mother, Bernadette Sutton, had told police and social services that she was concerned about the threat Russell posed to her daughter. “By this point, I thought he would kill her or she would take her own life,” Sutton said, in a statement.
Nigel Parsley, the coroner, concluded that Madden died by suicide while the balance of her mind was disturbed, but he also cited her relationship with Russell, with whom she had two children, as a contributory factor.
“Kate’s toxic relationship, in conjunction with Kate’s known mental health conditions, affected her state of mind and therefore contributed to her death,” he said.
The circumstances surrounding Madden’s death are no doubt tragic, but they are also an example of an increasingly controversial area of UK justice, one which has been described as a blind spot in the law’s ability to see the growing numbers of suicides among domestic abuse victims as something more: evidence of potential crimes.
Analysis seen by the Guardian suggests that growing numbers of victims of domestic violence are taking their own lives. Campaigners are now calling for the circumstances that led to these deaths to be investigated.
The Guardian recently reported on the case of Georgia Barter, whose suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be unlawful killing – only the second time in English legal history that such a conclusion has been reached. Despite this, no police investigation into Bignell’s role in Barter’s death has ever been launched and the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence to bring charges.
Inquests have a different burden of proof to criminal courts, finding on the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. There is no criminal due process and nobody is convicted or acquitted.
In Katie Madden’s case, although the coroner acknowledged that a toxic relationship contributed to her death, he did not make any finding of unlawful killing. Almost two years on, Madden’s family say Russell has not been investigated in relation to any of the inquest findings or any alleged abuse. This is despite admitting at the inquest that he gave Madden a black eye weeks before she died.
Police closed the assault investigation just days after Madden was found hanged at her home in Lowestoft, Suffolk. “The idea that it would just be dropped because she died – it should never be the case,” her mother says.
‘Her happy ever after’
“You just couldn’t have wished for a better mum and person,” Sutton says of her daughter. “She was very generous. She would give anybody her last penny. She would give anybody a lift.”
Growing up, Sutton remembers her daughter as a “bundle of fun and a very lively girl” who often had her head in a book. It was when Madden was about 12 that Sutton noticed a “massive change” in her daughter. “She wouldn’t get out of bed,” Sutton says. “She wouldn’t tell me anything.” Much later, Sutton discovered Madden had been sexually abused.
As her teenage years passed, Madden began drinking heavily and going missing. Sutton felt powerless to protect her daughter and she spent a brief period in care. At 16, she dropped out of school after becoming pregnant with her first child, she began self-harming and using cannabis. She also tried to take an overdose – her first attempt at suicide.
She was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder. Sutton says Madden had spells of stability, was devoted to her children, and eventually got her own house in Lowestoft.
However, she also recalls that many people “took advantage” of her daughter, using her home to drink alcohol and take drugs. “Most of Katie’s friends, I wouldn’t even call friends, I would call them acquaintances,” Sutton says. “She never really understood how vulnerable she was. I said to her: ‘Can you not see that these people are taking advantage of you and your roof over their heads?’”
However, by late 2016, Sutton remembers Madden as being in a “good place”. It was then she met Russell. She told her mother she thought she had finally got her “happy ever after”.
Throughout the course of our three-hour interview, Sutton refuses to say Russell’s name, describing him only as the “alleged perpetrator”. She recalls being uneasy in his company from the outset. When she first met her daughter’s new partner over a meal, she says she “wasn’t 100%” but tried to convince herself she was being overprotective. “Mothers sit on the fence to begin with,” she says.
Madden soon fell pregnant with the couple’s first child, who was born in 2018. It was around this time she received a disclosure through Clare’s law, otherwise known as the domestic violence disclosure scheme, warning Madden of Russell’s past.
At Madden’s inquest, Russell agreed that he had “significant previous involvement” with the police, including one conviction for “physically assaulting a woman”.
A referral was made to a multi-agency safeguarding hub in light of the Clare’s law disclosure but the case was closed before any safety planning took place. In evidence, a senior social worker from Suffolk county council’s adult social services said this was because it looked like “a misdirected referral” as it did not indicate Madden “was subject to abuse or a crime”.
In a statement, the local authority said “lessons were learned by all agencies” after Madden’s death and added that it had “strengthened” its referral process “ensuring that safeguarding concerns about parents and children are shared promptly and appropriately” between departments. The council also said it had introduced “domestic abuse workers with dedicated training to better support adults in a child’s life who may be experiencing domestic violence”.
Madden had a second child with Russell in 2020. From this point, Sutton recalls, their relationship was “on and off”, something she remembers her daughter found hard to navigate. “Katie fell in love, this was her happy ever after,” Sutton says. “And suddenly it’s all [fallen] apart for a number of reasons.”
The next few years were punctuated by mental health crises. In November 2021, Madden spent four weeks in intensive care after crashing her car into a brick wall, scared her children would be removed from her. In June 2022, she asked for the children to be taken into care. “Katie’s children were her everything, but she felt that she was fighting so many battles,” Sutton says. A clinical psychologist suggested Madden would benefit from specialist cognitive behavioural therapy but she never received funding for it from any of the public services she was in touch with.
Sutton told the inquest that during this time, Madden was “fenced off” by Russell, and would sometimes spend days in bed without her phone as Russell “would smash it”. The inquest was also told that, in February 2023, Russell struck Madden on the face with her phone. Two months later, the court heard, Madden arrived at a contact meeting with her children with a cut to her eye and told Sutton she had been assaulted by Russell after a night out.
At the inquest, Russell accepted he had given Madden a black eye. He had been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and forbidden from contacting her.
In the weeks that followed, Madden’s mental health problems spiralled. On 3 June, Sutton contacted her daughter to make arrangements for a picnic in the park with her children. Madden simply replied with a love heart.
The following evening, Sutton’s doorbell rang. It was a police officer. She knew instinctively what had happened. “I told her that she didn’t need to tell me,” Sutton says. “I told her what she’d come for.”
‘I said, go kill yourself’
Mason Jones was one of the last people to see Madden alive. In a statement, he told the inquest that he had only been friendly with her for about a month before she died. On the morning of 3 June, he recalled waking up to a string of messages from Madden, who seemed upset by some social media posts suggesting that Russell was with another woman in a hotel. At 7am, Madden and Jones went on a drive. Jones said he wanted to buy drugs to manage pain related to a medical condition.
Jones recalled that Russell “seemed to instigate” contact with Madden, despite his bail conditions. In his evidence, Russell claimed Madden called him. In response to Jones’s allegation that Russell said he was “in control of the town and would end [Madden’s] life if she didn’t do it herself”, Russell became agitated. “I didn’t say that,” he replied. “Get me the evidence … I wouldn’t say that. I’m a father. Why would I say that?”
He was asked by the coroner what the “general contents” of the call were. He said: “It was very erratic at the start. She was crying … she was just very panicky … I tried to reassure her but then it escalated into an argument. I ended up saying bad stuff.”
The coroner asked if Russell had told Madden she should hang herself. “I didn’t say hang herself,” he said. “There was a couple of references where I said, go kill yourself. Instantly, I went back on myself, and said, don’t be silly, don’t do that.”
Jones said he and Madden went to another friend’s house, where Madden “continued to argue” with Russell by phone before returning home. At about 12.45pm, she sent a message to Jones which read: “Thanks for putting up with me.”
Later that afternoon, Joe Hart, a friend of Russell’s, visited Madden’s home as she was looking after his dog. He told the inquest that Russell had told him Madden had “a noose around her neck”, but said: “At the time, I didn’t think it was a serious statement.”
Hart did not get a reply at Madden’s house. He threw an empty milkshake bottle at her bedroom window to try to get her attention but there was no response.
Neither man alerted the police, or Madden’s family. Hart said this was “because of what Katie was like … she’d quite regularly go off the map after she’d been wrecked”.
Russell disputed knowing Madden had a noose around her neck. He told the inquest: “She said that she was going to kill herself, she didn’t say she had a noose around her neck.”
When Russell was asked if he had failed to raise the alarm because he wanted Madden dead, he said: “You shouldn’t be speaking like that. I’ve got two children with her. Come on, man, that’s wrong. I didn’t want her dead. I dream about her every single day.”
Hart returned to the property at about 5pm on 4 June, the inquest heard. He said he contacted Russell, who encouraged him to break in if there was no response. When he entered the house, Hart found Madden hanged and called the emergency services.
‘There is no better detective than a mother’
On the way to Madden’s home, PC Bradley Congleton was told there was a history of domestic violence between Madden and Russell, which had culminated in a live assault investigation. He recovered Madden’s phone from the property. When he charged it, he told the inquest, he found messages from Russell encouraging Madden to kill herself. “There is no doubt in my mind, that is what he said to her,” Congleton said.
Congleton’s focus appears to have been on preparing a timeline of what had happened at the actual scene. In his evidence, Congleton said he considered it a priority to trace Russell to check his movements. At first, Russell would only speak to Congleton through an open window, the officer said. He recalled Russell saying that Madden had told him in her last hours that she “didn’t want to be alive any more” and was “intoxicated through drink and drugs”. Russell told Congleton he had been concerned but not been able to attend the address due to his bail conditions.
“I just cannot even begin to think how Katie was feeling,” Sutton says. “I know she was feeling hopeless … she was made to believe that everything was her fault.”
About a fortnight after Madden’s death, when Sutton was clearing out her daughter’s house, a letter arrived from the police, addressed to Madden. It said the assault case against Russell was being dropped.
“They must have known that Katie passed away,” Sutton says. “And they sent her that letter for me to open. And I was so upset, angry and cross about it, I ripped it up and I was so gutted that I did.”
Sutton says she contacted police as she had “a gut feeling there was more harm” in her daughter’s case. She was given Madden’s phone. “I read and listened to her messages,” she told the inquest. She described Russell’s messages as “awful”. “He told her to kill herself,” she told the court. “This is something he had said on many occasions.”
“There is no better detective than a mother,” Sutton says. “What Katie was saying would haunt me for the rest of my life. I just remember Katie saying in one of those voice notes, ‘You are giving me more reason to do it. You are not welcome at my funeral.’”
Sutton said she wanted police to review Madden and Russell’s communications in case they were able to build a case against Russell for coercive control; she claims officers told her they only had the capacity to examine a month’s worth of data. She recalls an officer who tried to “reassure us as a family” that the information about Russell would be held on file. “That’s no good to me,” she says.
The Guardian sent Suffolk police a series of questions about Madden’s case. The force said it was unable to answer them as her death was the subject of a domestic homicide review that had yet to conclude. Domestic homicide reviews examine the deaths of adults suspected to have suffered violence, abuse or neglect at the hands of a partner or family member. They are intended to identify lessons for the multiple agencies involved, rather than decide on whether any criminal investigation is merited.
The Guardian was not able to reach Russell for comment.
Madden was cremated in an intimate family ceremony. “She was never the centre of attention,” Sutton says. “She would never have wanted to be on parade.”
‘How many more women have got to die?’
After Madden’s inquest Parsley, the coroner, issued a prevention of future deaths report addressed to the police, social services, the NHS, the home office and the Department for Health. He said there was “no formal system in place” to support Madden, even though she was “known to be vulnerable” after the Clare’s law disclosure and that multi-agency safeguarding referrals made in respect of her children were “viewed in isolation, with no system in place to assess any additional risks posed to Kate herself”.
He said that the public bodies Madden was in contact with each suggested another should pay for her cognitive behavioural therapy, which she ultimately never received.
Sutton, who works in the NHS, says she hopes lessons will be learned after the tragedy and criticised “the lack of communication, the lack of empathy, the lack of professional curiosity, the lack of risk assessment, the lack of the standard stuff that should be happening” when it comes to dealing with alleged victims of domestic abuse.
Despite the police finding messages on Madden’s phone from Russell in which he told her to kill herself, the Guardian understands no police investigation into their relationship or the circumstances surrounding her death has been launched since her inquest.
“How many more women have got to die?” Sutton says. “Whether they take their own lives, or whether someone takes their life for them, how many more women, before something is done? How bad does it have to get before someone is prosecuted?”

Revealed: The true toll of female suicides in UK with domestic abuse at their core
Unknown

The number of women who are driven to suicide by domestic abusers is being under-reported, and their cases overlooked by police, in what has been described by experts as a “national scandal”.
Domestic violence suicides are already growing at such a rate that a woman in an abusive relationship is now more likely to take her own life than be killed by a partner.
But research into the number of women who take their own life in such circumstances has suggested official statistics could track as few as 6.5% of the true number of cases.
According to the Domestic Homicide Project, a programme led by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), there were 98 suspected suicides following domestic abuse in 2024, compared with 80 intimate partner homicides.
But research by a suicide prevention programme in Kent found that about a third of all suspected suicides in the region between 2018 and 2024 were affected by domestic abuse.
If the numbers in Kent reflect the national picture, it could mean as many as 1,500 victims of domestic abuse are taking their own lives every year – up to 15 times as many as previously thought.
Tim Woodhouse, the programme manager and a University of Kent academic, who led the research, said: “We need some sort of national taskforce to get a grip on this.” He added that it was “bonkers that we are basing national estimates on one researcher’s evidence”.
He said his work was “just trying to open people’s eyes that this is happening way more often than people think – it is, in terms of numbers, a national scandal”.
The data collected by the NPCC, he said, was a “good start”, but “they’re not counting very many of the right suicides, they’ve got very tight exclusion criteria so they’re massively underplaying the number”.
Recording domestic suicides is just one part of campaigners’ struggle to have causes of death in these cases more thoroughly investigated. There has been only one criminal conviction for manslaughter in UK legal history where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse.
Lawyers believe this number shows coroners may have been too quick to dismiss deaths as suicides without properly considering whether they could be unlawful killings.
Campaigners have called for all suicides where domestic abuse is suspected to be investigated as potential homicides from the outset, in order to ensure the best evidence is collected and preserved, as well as more multi-agency work to protect victims from abusers in the first place.
To illustrate the scale of the crisis, the Guardian is publishing a series of articles about the people, most of them women, who have died by suicide following domestic abuse.
In the case of Georgia Barter, her suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be an unlawful killing.
An inquest in Walthamstow, north-east London, heard evidence that Bignell had kicked, stamped on and sexually assaulted Barter, but he was never charged with any offences in relation to his alleged abuse. Despite the coroner’s findings, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.
Today we also reveal the case of Katie Madden. At an inquest, her former partner Jonathon Russell admitted he had given Madden a black eye and, hours before her death, told her to kill herself. No criminal investigation into Russell’s role in Madden’s death has been launched.
In many cases, prosecutors do not see a basis for investigating wrongdoing and fail to bring any criminal charges at all after a domestic abuse suicide. It means alleged abusers are rarely investigated for offences such as violence or coercive control – despite a wealth of evidence often being presented to a coroner in an inquest. Families have also found police have dropped domestic abuse investigations after the victim has died.
Pragna Patel of Project Resist said: “Too many bereaved families who have lost loved ones to domestic abuse-related suicides are being failed by a criminal justice system that is not fit for purpose.” Her organisation has brought together bereaved families to launch a campaign to seek changes in the criminal justice system.
“At the heart of the injustice is not the failure of training, the absence of ‘professional curiosity’ or the lack of laws, but a systemic culture of discrimination, arrogance, indifference and apathy,” she added.
More recently, there have been concerted efforts from the NPCC and the Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges in such cases.
There are now two men being prosecuted for manslaughter following a suicide after domestic abuse, and both organisations have stressed they are keen to bring more cases to court.
However, lawyers, campaigners and families have said there are issues with individual police forces and officers failing to understand the impact of domestic abuse or to adequately investigate cases immediately after a death.
“Sadly, police forces too often miss opportunities to disrupt escalating domestic abuse and protect victims,” said Kate Ellis, the joint head of litigation at the Centre for Women’s Justice.
“Too often we see police forces failing to take any criminal action against perpetrators, or consider protective measures that could be put in place, even when domestic abuse cases are graded as high risk. These errors can have fatal consequences.
“We believe that some domestic abuse-related suicides are preventable, particularly in cases where the police are on notice of the abuse,” Ellis added. “Coercive and controlling relationships tend to follow similar patterns, so it is vital that police identify these patterns and act quickly.
“We are also concerned that many suicides in apparent domestic abuse contexts are not recognised or investigated by the police as potential homicides, even when there is significant evidence of prior domestic abuse.”
Southall Black Sisters has been campaigning for abuse-related suicide to be recognised as homicide for more than 40 years, and introduced an amendment in the crime and policing bill that was supported by more than 50 MPs.
The organisation has specifically raised concerns about the possible overrepresentation of suicide driven by domestic abuse and “honour”-based abuse within Black, minority and migrant communities.
“Women in these communities have additional barriers to overcome in order to escape abuse caused by intersecting racism and misogyny,” said Hannana Siddiqui, the director of policy, campaigns and research.
To date, there has only been one criminal conviction for manslaughter where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse. Nicholas Allen pleaded guilty to the charge in 2017 after his former partner Justene Reece took her own life. Allen had stalked her after she left him and moved to a women’s refuge.
In March, Ryan Wellings was cleared of the manslaughter of Kiena Dawes by a jury at Preston crown court. Dawes took her own life, leaving a note on her phone saying: “Slowly … Ryan Wellings killed me.” Wellings was convicted of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour, and jailed for six and a half years.
Georgia Barter’s mother, Kay, said: “It’s been almost six long heartbreaking years since I lost my beautiful daughter Georgia. Still the fight for justice goes on. I would like to ask this government ‘when did this country stop respecting or protecting women and girls?’ Now is the time to show them you care.”
She added: “The only successful conviction for manslaughter where a person’s partner died by suicide was in 2017 almost ten years ago. That is shocking. I’m sure I speak for myself and the countless grieving families out there – we demand change now.”
Frank Mullane of the campaign group Advocacy after Fatal Domestic Abuse said: “It might not be enough to rely on the police improving their investigations and the CPS optimising its prosecution, to ensure perpetrators face justice after domestic abuse related suicides.
“The defence team will exploit the merest mention of mental health difficulties and the jury may struggle to convict for manslaughter. A new law, specific to suicide caused by domestic abuse, will make it easier for the jury to identify causation. It will give confidence to the CPS to bring cases and it will educate the public.”

How the ABC Young Performers Awards helped launch the careers of these Australian musicians
The ABC Young Performers Awards have been running since 1944. The competition has launched the career of some of Australia's most successful musicians.
Many have achieved recognition on international stages, including composer and violist Brett Dean, pianist Simon Tedeschi, percussionist Claire Edwardes, violinist Emily Sun and more.
In 2026, the Young Performers Awards have returned to ABC Classic.
To find out what it's like to be in the competition, we spoke to past winners about their preparation, journey through the rounds and the opportunities the awards unlocked.
Percussionist Claire Edwardes on preparing to compete
Loading...Claire Edwardes is one of Australia's most recognisable percussionists.
She's particularly respected for her work championing contemporary classical music by women and other marginalised voices.
Edwardes is the Artistic Director of contemporary classical group Ensemble Offspring.
She entered the competition in 1999 while waiting to start her postgraduate degree in the Netherlands.
"The competition gave me something to focus on and work towards," Edwardes says.
In 1999, being a percussionist wasn't something many aspiring musicians considered as a career choice, so Edwardes competed in a category known as "other instruments".
But she went above and beyond to prepare her repertoire.
"I wrote out by hand a piano reduction of Joseph Schwantner's Concerto for Percussion and orchestra, because it really showed the breadth of all the different things I was capable of," Edwardes says.
She even sought some advice from Christopher Lamb, an American percussionist who premiered the music in 1995.
Edwardes won against serious contenders, including pianist Andrea Lam and violinist Alexandra Osborne, who are both also highly successful musicians today.
The percussionist spent the next 27 years playing as a soloist with all of the symphony orchestras around Australia, including while she was studying in the Netherlands.
"That never would have happened if I hadn't won the Young Performers Awards," she says.
Violinist Emily Sun on how the competition boosted her career
Loading...Emily Sun is an internationally sought-after violinist who regularly performs on some of the world's most beautiful stages including here in Australia.
She first became known to audiences through the 2011 documentary Mrs Carey's Concert, which followed a group of students preparing for a major performance at the Sydney Opera House.
Sun has a long history of involvement with the Young Performers Awards, being one of the finalists in 2011 and finally winning the competition in 2018.
"Winning the YPA [Young Performers Awards] marked a huge turning point for me in my performing career," Sun says.
"It gave me the confidence and opportunities to perform across Australia in concerto, recital and chamber settings."
As part of the prize, Sun became ABC Classic's Artist in Residence, which included recording an album and appearing in features on air and digital platforms.
"I definitely came out of it as a different artist," Sun says.
Her success has grown beyond the competition.
In 2023, Sun became a custodian of The Adelaide, a rare 250-year-old Italian violin crafted by famed luthier Giovanni Battista Guadagnini.
Clarinettist Lloyd Van't Hoff on the musicians he met
Loading...Clarinettist Lloyd Van't Hoff, who won the competition in 2015, says that his biggest takeaway was making connections with other musicians.
Van't Hoff grew up in Charters Towers in Far North Queensland. Meeting a dedicated and inspiring music teacher when he was 11 changed his life.
His family moved to Brisbane so Van't Hoff could pursue tertiary studies at the Queensland Conservatorium of Music and the Australian National Academy of Music (ANAM) in Melbourne.
When he decided to audition for the Young Performers Awards, Van't Hoff was "really at a loss" after finishing his studies.
"I felt this expectation from my peers, teachers and family who had all invested in my musical education," he shares.
Even though Van't Hoff initially felt intimidated by the prospect of the competition, he gave it a go.
"[Luckily], I had all of this repertoire that felt pretty cozy," he says.
In 2015, most of the rounds took place in Tasmania.
Professional musicians collaborated with competitors on the semifinal chamber music rounds, and the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra played with the grand finalists.
"A lot of the people I met during the competition were people who then opened doors for me."
He was invited to collaborate with more established ensembles such as the Flinders Quartet, and formed his own group, the Arcadia wind quintet.
Van't Hoff says there was "a tremendous sense of camaraderie" between the competitors of the Young Performers Awards.
"We're all friends for life," Van't Hoff says.
Flautist Eliza Shephard on the knock-on effects from winning
Loading...The most recent Young Performers Awards winner from 2022, flautist Eliza Shephard, is carving a path to be one of Australia's most exciting performers.
She's also an educator, improviser and recording artist.
"I'm loud and proud about my [love of] contemporary music," Shephard says.
Shephard's most influential teacher, Virginia Taylor, was herself a Young Performers Awards winner in 1988.
By the time Shephard entered the competition, she had already completed postgraduate studies at ANAM, as well as a four-month-long course in New York focusing on contemporary flute-playing technique, which influenced her repertoire choices.
While most musicians completed the competition within a year, Shephard's cohort had to navigate COVID-19 lockdowns and pandemic restrictions.
It turned the competition into "a long, drawn-out process", Shephard says.
To comply with the pandemic restrictions, the competitors had to be recorded and filmed performing to empty studios.
"I asked if I could have someone there just so it would feel like a performance," Shephard shares.
The ABC allowed each performer to bring a support person to their semifinal and grand final rounds, on the condition that they wouldn't interrupt the recording process.
Shephard's youngest sibling came to support her.
"They had to wear a mask, and they weren't allowed to clap," Shephard remembers.
"At the end of each piece, they used the Auslan sign for applause."
Shephard says the biggest lesson she learnt from the competition was how to showcase who she is as a musician through her repertoire choices, technique and curatorial ability.
Beyond the Young Performers Awards, Shephard has spearheaded the March of the Women, a recording project now entering its seventh year.
The project aims to increase the representation of female composers and championing female flute players.
Shephard recently commissioned six Australian female composers to write new music for her, enabled through the cash prize she received from the Young Performers Awards.
"A portion of my winnings went to help fund percentages of these commissions," Shephard says.
"The YPA [Young Performers Awards] had a big knock-on effect in my career, which is very amazing to sit and be with."
Entries are now open for the ABC Young Performers Awards for musicians 31 years and under.
EDITOR'S NOTE February 16, 2026: An earlier version of this article stated that percussionist Claire Edwardes spent the next seven years playing as a soloist with all of the symphony orchestras around Australia after winning the Young Performers Awards. This has been corrected to 27 years.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Two new mpox cases have been confirmed in Russian tourists who arrived from Thailand, St. Petersburg’s regional directorate of Russia’s consumer rights watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said.
"Rospotrebnadzor’s regional directorate for St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region informs that two mpox cases have been confirmed in citizens who returned from vacationing in Thailand," it said.
The two have been taken to an infectious diseases hospital, it said adding that they are in satisfactory condition.
According to Rospotrebnadzor, their contacts have been placed under medical supervision.
"The infection’s propagation has been prevented," it said but warned that risks of mpox imports still exist.
Earlier, three mpox cases were confirmed in the Moscow Region. One of the patients has already been discharged from hospital, the other two continue receiving treatment.
Mpox, formerly known as monkeypox, is a rare viral disease endemic to remote regions near tropical forests in Central and Western Africa. The first case of an animal transmitting the disease to humans was recorded in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970. According to the WHO, this virus is usually transmitted to humans by wild animals, such as rodents and primates, while its secondary spread among humans is limited. Usually the lethality coefficient during mpox outbreaks ranges from 1% to 10% with the majority of fatalities affecting younger age groups.
Mpox is most often accompanied by a skin rash or mucosal lesions, which can last from two to four weeks. Additional symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes.

4 killed in Israeli drone strike targeting vehicle along Lebanese-Syrian border
Israeli military says strike hit Islamic Jihad operatives in Majdal Anjar area
ISTANBUL
Four people were killed Sunday evening in an Israeli drone strike targeting a vehicle in the eastern Lebanese town of Majdal Anjar near the Lebanese-Syrian border despite a ceasefire, Lebanon’s official National News Agency reported.
The agency said an Israeli drone struck a car between the al-Masnaa border crossing and the village of Jdeidet Yabous, along the Lebanon-Syria border, resulting in fatalities and an unidentified number of injuries.
The sound of four strong explosions was reported heard in nearby villages, the agency added.
The Israeli military said in a statement that it carried out a strike against members of the Islamic Jihad Movement in the Majdal Anjar area of Lebanon.
There was no comment from the group on the incident.
The attacks come amid repeated Israeli violations of a ceasefire agreement reached in November 2024.

The chilling moment elderly man abducted from Sydney home as hostage video released

Elderly kidnapped man probably alive as ‘distressing’ hostage videos emerge
Updated ,first published
Police believe an elderly widower snatched from his home in a suspected case of mistaken identity is still alive and have pleaded with his kidnappers to release him as “distressing” images of the grandfather’s injuries circulate within Sydney’s underworld.
Chris Baghsarian, 85, was abducted from the bedroom of his North Ryde property about 5am on Friday, prompting police to issue a direct plea to the abductors, who they believe kidnapped the wrong person.
Police found signs of forced entry to the home, and are investigating whether the intended target was a figure linked to the Alameddine organised crime network living nearby.
CCTV footage shows two men, one in a high-vis shirt and the other in a dark hoodie, exiting a dark SUV and striding towards Baghsarian’s property, triggering the sensor light at the front of the property. They then appear to force the elderly man out of the home while the getaway driver moves closer to the rest of the crew. Police believe three men attended Baghsarian’s home, but suspect more could have been involved in his kidnapping.
Neighbours called police after hearing a commotion at Baghsarian’s property on Friday morning. One witness, Felix Cho, told Nine News that he heard “screaming that just kept going” as glass was smashed and dogs barked before the vehicle drove down the street.
Video has since emerged of an injured Baghsarian at an unknown location.
Baghsarian is pictured in the video in the grey tracksuit pants and flannelette shirt he was wearing when abducted.
Several images of Baghsarian’s severe injuries have been circulated within Sydney’s criminal underworld. Detectives are investigating the video and images and working to determine their legitimacy.
A vehicle matching the description of the getaway car was found burnt-out in South Turramurra shortly after the abduction. Police have not yet identified the location Baghsarian was being held, but believe he is still alive.
Detective Acting Superintendent Andrew Marks, the acting commander of the robbery and serious crime squad, said neither Baghsarian nor his family were involved in organised crime.
“Mr Baghsarian, Mr Baghsarian’s family, are not involved in any criminal world,” Marks said.
“The family are in distress. All they want is their father to be returned, their grandfather to be returned. And what I can say, is that I’m a million per cent confident that they have the wrong person.”
Concern for Baghsarian’s welfare has intensified following the release of the video as the 85-year-old enters his fourth day as a hostage.
“It’s not ideal that those images are out there,” Marks said.
Marks said it was “distressing to see an 85-year-old man in that position”.
Marks did not comment on whom the intended target may have been, or if they had known connections to organised crime.
“It’s not an instance where they randomly take people for the sake of it. They were intending to take somebody, but have taken the wrong person. They have kidnapped the wrong person,” Marks said.
Cases of mistaken identity have become increasingly common in Sydney’s underworld as contractors are hired to carry out crimes on behalf of larger organised crime networks.
Last May, Condell Park plumber John Versace was shot dead in the driveway of his family home in what police believe was a case of mistaken identity. The 23-year-old had no criminal record or links to organised crime.
Baghsarian requires daily medication and medical treatment. No ransom had been demanded by Baghsarian’s kidnappers, nor had his family received any communications from them, Marks said.
Baghsarian lived alone.
“The fact that these offenders – these kidnappers – have got it so wrong is concerning,” Marks said.
Premier Chris Minns pleaded for the kidnappers to return Baghsarian, suggesting they could drop the 85-year-old at a shopping centre, emergency department or nursing home if they didn’t wish to reveal their location.
“The family is obviously distraught, and the message from police and the government is very sincere and very direct, and that is the people who have done this have got the wrong person, police are incredibly confident in that – it’s not too late to end this situation,” Minns said.
“This is a distressing situation. We want to reunite Mr Baghsarian with his family, and we’re asking whoever is responsible for this to do it as an act of humanity today.”
Marks appealed for anyone who had seen people coming and going from a neighbouring unoccupied home or on the street Baghsarian lived on in the days before the kidnapping, to contact police.
“Every hour is very important,” Marks said.
“We need him returned now.”

Iranian Foreign Minister heads to Geneva for renewed talks with US
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi left for Geneva on Sunday, where talks between Iran and the United States are set to continue, his ministry said in a statement. According to the Foreign Ministry, these “indirect” talks will be held on Tuesday under the mediation of Oman, where a first session took place on February 6, and are expected to focus on Iran's nuclear program.
Iran's foreign minister has arrived in Geneva ahead of a second round of negotiations with the United States, Iranian state television said Monday, as Washington keeps up pressure on the Islamic republic.
According to Tehran, "indirect" Iran-US nuclear talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday, although Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed including Iran's ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies.
Tehran and Washington restarted negotiations this month after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June.
Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fate of Iran's stockpile of more than 400 kilogrammes of 60-percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors in June.

"The foreign minister has arrived in Geneva at the head of a diplomatic and expert delegation to take part in the second round of nuclear negotiation," Iran's state-run IRIB wrote on its Telegram channel.
During his visit to Geneva, Abbas Araghchi is expected to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials, Iran's foreign ministry said.
Read moreIran’s thorny IAEA relations hit new low after Israeli, US strikes
Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.
The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country's nuclear programme.
The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.
Read moreIran ready to dilute its enriched uranium if 'all sanctions are lifted'
Iran's deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the Islamic republic's economy.
"If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran's ability to enrich more.
"There should be no enrichment capability... dismantle the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said during a speech in Jerusalem.
Read moreTrump believes US is creating conditions for ‘good deal’ with Iran, Netanyahu says
'Viable' deal
On February 6, Araghchi led the Iranian delegation in indirect talks with Witkoff and Kushner in Muscat.
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
It has represented US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
Iranian deputy foreign minister for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said Tehran was seeking a deal with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, particularly in sectors such as aviation, mining and oil and gas, the Fars news agency reported.
"For the agreement to be viable, it is essential that the United States also be able to benefit from it in areas with strong and rapid economic return potential," he was quoted as saying.

Türkiye is getting ready to introduce new regulations to protect children on social media platforms, the country’s family and social services minister said on Sunday.
On the Turkish social media platform NSosyal, Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas said the government is close to putting the measures into effect, citing growing concerns about the impact of constant digital stimulation on children.
"Just like many countries around the world, we are very close to implementing social media regulations aimed at protecting our children," she said.
Goktas warned that people’s attention spans have dropped to about eight seconds, a trend she said harms children more than adults.
She added that children’s attention spans have declined by at least 30 percent over the past decade, impacting their concentration, friendships and academic performance.
These changes have also made teaching more difficult, she said, adding that similar social media rules for children are being debated or introduced in countries around the world.
She said Türkiye is working to create a safer internet environment for children, calling on parents and teachers to support the effort. "Together, we can make a safe internet possible for our children," she added.

Israel kills 11 in Gaza as Trump announces $5bn pledge from Board of Peace
US President Donald Trump says the first meeting of his newly created Board of Peace will take place on Thursday.
Israeli forces have killed at least 11 Palestinians in attacks across the Gaza Strip, medical sources said, as United States President Donald Trump announced that his newly formed Board of Peace has pledged $5bn to rebuild the war-devastated territory.
The Israeli killings on Sunday mark the latest violation of a US-brokered “ceasefire” that came into effect on October 10.

Hospital sources told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces targeted tents sheltering displaced Palestinians in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, killing at least five people.
They said Israeli attacks also killed five others in southern Khan Younis.
Separately, sources in Gaza told Al Jazeera that Israeli forces killed Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) commander Sami al-Dahdouh in an attack in the Tal al-Hawa neighbourhood, east of Gaza City, on Sunday.
Hazem Qassem, a spokesperson for Hamas, condemned the latest Israeli attacks as a “new massacre” and a “criminal escalation”.
He said they were a “clear attempt to impose a bloody reality on the ground and send a message that all efforts and bodies concerned with establishing calm in Gaza are meaningless, and that the occupation is continuing its aggression despite all parties speaking of the necessity of adhering to the ceasefire agreement”.
According to authorities in Gaza, Israel has killed at least 601 Palestinians and wounded 1,607 others since the “ceasefire” came into effect. The Government Media Office in Gaza also said Israel has carried out at least 1,620 violations of the agreement between October 10, 2025 and February 10, 2026.
Israel accuses Hamas of violating the agreement. It says four soldiers have been killed.
Board of Peace
The latest attacks come as Trump announced that the first meeting of his newly created Board of Peace will take place on Thursday in Washington, DC.
Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social platform that the members have pledged more than $5bn towards rebuilding war-shattered Gaza, and committed “thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans”.
The US has asked countries to pay $1bn to join the Board of Peace, suggesting that five countries may have already pledged to do so.
Al Jazeera’s Rosiland Jordan, reporting from Washington, DC, said that “there are reports that the United Arab Emirates has been the first to step forward with this billion-dollar pledge”.
She said that “there are also reports that Kuwait may be coming on board”, leaving three other countries that are not publicly known yet.
Trump did not specify how many of the board’s 20 members would be in attendance at the meeting.
Initially envisaged as a mechanism for ending Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, Trump’s board has taken shape with his ambition for a much broader mandate of resolving conflicts around the world, in what appears to be a US attempt to bypass the United Nations.
Several key US allies have declined to join the board.
Trump also said in his post that “Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization”.
Hamas’s Qassem, meanwhile, called on the Board of Peace to pressure Israel to stop violating the ceasefire and “compel it to implement what was agreed upon without delay or manipulation”.

Hungary: Magyar launches anti-Orban election campaign

Hungary: Magyar launches anti-Orban election campaign
February 15, 2026Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar launched his party's election campaign in Budapest on Sunday, vowing to end the 16-year rule of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, tackle corruption and reorientate Hungary back towards western Europe.
Magyar, a former influential member of Orban's nationalist Fidesz party, took over leadership of the center-right Tisza party in 2024 and quickly established himself as the biggest challenge to Orban in over a decade.
In June 2024, Tisza – which is an abbreviation of the Hungarian words for "respect" (tisztelet) and "freedom" (szabadsag) – won around 30% of the vote in European Parliament elections and most independent polls show it with a significant lead ahead of election day on April 12.
"We're standing on the threshold of victory with 56 days left to go," Magyar told supporters in Budapest on Sunday. "Tisza stands ready to govern."
Hungary: who is Peter Magyar?
A 44-year-old former lawyer, Magyar has accused Orban's right-wing populist government of mismanaging Hungary's economy and social services, and of allowing corruption to run riot, leaving Hungary one of the poorest countries in the European Union.
"Not only has the Hungarian economy not taken off; it has hit a dead end," he said.
He has also criticized Orban's antagonism towards the EU and continuing proximity to Russian President Vladimir Putin despite Russia's ongoing invasion of neighboring Ukraine.
After holding meetings with several European leaders at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) over the weekend, he said he would put an end to Hungary's "drift out of the European Union" under Orban.
"Hungary's place is in Europe," he said. "Not only because Hungary needs Europe, but also because Europe needs Hungary."
However, he also reiterated that a Tisza government would continue to oppose any accelerated Ukrainian accession to the EU and retain a border fence erected by Orban in 2015 as part of a continuation of anti-immigration policies.
Hungary: Magyar pledges to combat corruption
Nevertheless, despite some EU-scepticism, Magyar has vowed to combat corruption and strengthen Hungary's democratic institutions and independent judiciary in order to regain access to billions of euros' worth of suspended EU funding.
"It is time to call corruption what it is: theft," he said, promising "total transparency in contracts involving public funds" and the "recovery" of all the money Hungary "has been deprived of over 16 years."
During the campaign so far, Magyar has specifically targeted Orban's traditional strongholds: small, conservative-leaning towns and villages across the country but far away from major cities like Budapest, focusing on bread and butter issues such as low wages and rapidly rising living costs.
He has challenged Orban to a TV debate – thus far without response – saying the "outgoing prime minister" is only capable of "agitation" and "threats," accusing him of spying on opponents.
"If they can search through my private life, then they can rummage through everyone's," said Magyar.
Orban: work only 'half done'
Opposition and rights groups regularly accuse Orban of silencing critical voices in the judiciary, academia and media, as well as cutting the rights of minority groups.
Just this weekend, local authorities in Budapest once again permitted the staging of the annual neo-Nazi "Day of Honor" gathering while clamping down on small anti-fascist counter-demonstrations instead.
The ruling Fidesz party hasn't published an official election manifesto, arguing that, after governing for 16 years, voters know what policies to expect.
Orban on Saturday vowed to press on with a crackdown on what he called "pseudo-civil organizations, bought journalists, judges, politicians," saying his work was only "half done."

Feb 15 - A contract worker died following an incident at Rio Tinto's SimFer mine at the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, the world's largest producer of iron ore said late on Sunday, without providing further details.
The miner said work had been suspended at the SimFer mine site after the accident on Saturday. Chief Executive Simon Trott said he will travel to Guinea this week.
“Nothing is more important than the safety of everyone who works with us," Trott said. "We are determined to learn from this incident and to do everything we can to provide the safest possible workplace and prevent tragedies like this from happening.”
A Reuters review of internal documents, conducted last year, found six local workers had been killed between June 2023 and November 2024 in the construction of a port and a 670-kilometre railway leading to the mines in remote rural Guinea.
Since November 2024, at least two additional fatalities have been reported at the project.
A Rio Tinto spokesperson, asked about the Reuters findings last year, did not comment directly on the toll, but said in an emailed statement that the company was "working each and every day with our partners ... to share knowledge and expertise so safety is continuously improved across Simandou – which is a uniquely complex project."
Rio Tinto owns a 53% stake in the SimFer consortium, which holds the rights to half the vast Simandou concession - Blocks 3 and 4 - while Chinese state groups own the rest of the consortium.
A separate group led by Baowu Winning Consortium Simandou owns 85% of the operating company for the other half of the concession - Blocks 1 and 2. REUTERS

Extended war threat raises questions over IDF readiness

Nuclear negotiations between the United States and Iran are set to resume Tuesday in Switzerland, the same day the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins, as defense officials warn of heightened tensions that could escalate into a broader regional conflict.
Security officials are preparing for what they describe as a potentially volatile period, while again cautioning about the growing burden on regular and reserve forces amid ongoing disputes over military conscription.
According to data presented in recent months by Brig. Gen. Shay Tayeb, head of the Planning Division in the IDF’s Personnel Directorate, the military is currently short at least 12,000 troops across units and roles, including about 7,500 combat soldiers. Cabinet Secretary Yossi Fuchs recently said that each additional regular battalion would reduce the need to deploy between four and seven reserve battalions.
In a recent meeting with newly enlisted ultra-Orthodox recruits, the head of the Personnel Directorate said the military must fill its ranks while enabling them to maintain their religious way of life. “The operational need requires us to fill the ranks,” he said.
Underscoring manpower challenges, the IDF announced last week the creation of a new multi-arena maneuver division, to be established from existing training bases within the Ground Forces. About 1,200 personnel, most of them reservists, have already joined its headquarters. The division is expected to conduct exercises over the coming year, including a large-scale drill. Its headquarters will operate from Julis Base near Ashkelon.
Security forces have also completed preparations for Ramadan. Unlike previous years, officials say terrorist activity in the West Bank has been steadily declining, and Central Command maintains control over refugee camps in the northern West Bank area. Ahead of Ramadan, special forces have carried out arrests, and police and the military have intensified efforts against terrorists and incitement, including identifying individuals viewed as potential sources of escalation.
Thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank are expected to travel to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, prompting heightened security measures. The military is reinforcing the separation barrier and known breach points, while police are assisting in efforts to detain individuals residing in Israel without permits. Additional security is being deployed to agricultural outposts and roads in the West Bank amid concerns over possible terrorist attacks.
In recent weeks, the IDF spokesperson has issued regular statements emphasizing readiness along all borders, saying forces are prepared “in defense and offense” and are closely monitoring developments across the Middle East.
Meanwhile, CBS reported that President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in December that he would support strikes on Iran’s ballistic missile program if a diplomatic agreement is not reached. The report said senior U.S. military and intelligence officials have since discussed how Washington could assist, including through aerial refueling and securing overflight permissions.
Diplomatic sources said Trump is weighing options ranging from rapid political change in Tehran to a prolonged military confrontation, which he is believed to prefer avoiding. According to the sources, if Iran is seen as delaying negotiations without seriousness, Washington could shift toward military action. Close coordination is ongoing between Washington and Jerusalem regarding possible scenarios, including U.S. requests for joint action, requests for Israel to refrain from involvement, or authorization for Israeli strikes on ballistic missile infrastructure.
Iran has signaled it is unwilling to discuss its missile program as part of the negotiations, viewing it as a core strategic asset. Defense assessments indicate Tehran is unlikely to relinquish that capability under U.S. pressure.
The missile threat remains central to security planning. During previous rounds of fighting, Israel faced hundreds of launches, intercepting most but sustaining damage, reinforcing concerns about attrition tactics aimed at exhausting air defense interceptors. Air defense units, composed of seven battalions operating across five layers, are on alert alongside U.S. forces and potentially other partners.
Pro-Iranian militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthi movement in Yemen have continued issuing threats in recent weeks, warning of consequences if Iran is attacked.

Sudanese army says it destroyed RSF air defense system in West Kordofan
Military says ‘heavy losses’ inflicted on paramilitary forces in Abu Zabad area
KHARTOUM, Sudan
Sudan's army said Sunday that it had destroyed an air defense system belonging to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the West Kordofan state in the southern part of the country.
A military statement said that forces carried out a “qualitative operation” in the Abu Zabad area that resulted in the destruction of an RSF air defense system and inflicted “heavy losses in lives and equipment.”
The army did not provide further details about the operation or the scale of the reported losses.
It said its forces would continue operations “until the country is cleansed of the (RSF) militia.”
There was no comment from the rebel group as of yet.
In addition to the Darfur region, Sudan’s three Kordofan states -- North, West and South -- have seen heavy fighting between the Sudanese army and the RSF.
The conflict, which began in April 2023, has killed tens of thousands and displaced about 13 million people, creating one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises and famine conditions, according to UN reports.

Trump trade adviser Navarro says administration may force data center builders like Meta to 'internalize' costs

President Donald Trump's trade and manufacturing adviser, Peter Navarro, said on Sunday that the White House may force data center builders to absorb their costs as voters continue to sour on the economy and utility prices soar.
"All of these data center builders, Meta on down, need to pay for all, all of the costs," Navarro said on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures." "They need to pay, not only pay for the electricity that they're using on the grid, but they have to pay for the resiliency that they're affecting as well. They need to pay for the water. So there's activity, action here going forward, where we force them to internalize the cost."
Navarro did not detail what the White House's plan to force data center builders to internalize costs would look like. CNBC has reached out to the White House for clarification.
When asked about Navarro's remarks, a Meta spokesperson said the company already pays for all of its energy usage.
"Meta pays the full costs for energy used by our data centers so they aren't passed onto consumers — and we go beyond that by paying for new and upgraded local infrastructure as well as adding new power to the grid," the spokesperson said.
Data centers and their drag on utilities are part of the affordability problem. Electricity prices spiked 6.9% year over year in 2025 and show little sign of easing. Navarro sought to pin the blame for soaring costs on former President Joe Biden, who left office over a year ago.
"I just want to assure people that we're on it, we also feel your pain," Navarro said. "We understand the ravages that inflation took on you because of Joe Biden's irresponsibility, but we are addressing that with economic policy that ultimately will make wages rise faster than the inflation rate, and that's the key to affordability."
But Americans increasingly blame the Trump administration for rising costs. As the November 2026 midterms approach, polls consistently find Trump underwater on the economy. Democrats are pounding Trump and the Republicans on affordability, arguing that everyday goods and services have grown too expensive. Democrats have taken a 5.2 point lead in the generic ballot ahead of the November midterm elections that could loosen Trump's grip on Washington, according to polling averages from RealClearPolitics.
While Navarro sought to blame the former president's administration for Americans' struggle with affordability, Trump himself has said he's "very proud" of the state of the economy. In an interview with "NBC Nightly News" that aired during the Super Bowl on Sunday, the president was asked, "At what point are we in the Trump economy?"
"I'd say we're there now," he replied.
The Trump administration has recently taken steps to address the strain on data center electricity and rising utility costs.
Several states and the White House signed a pact in January urging the nation's largest grid operator, PJM Interconnection, to make big technology companies pay for new power plants on the system. PJM operates the grid in some of the most data center-heavy areas in the U.S., including northern Virginia and New Jersey.
Democratic Govs. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia and Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey both romped to victories in their states in 2025 after campaigning to lower electricity costs.
The pact called for $15 billion in new generation capacity within PJM, to be financed by tech companies, and urged the operator to hold an emergency auction to procure the power. The move comes as the administration simultaneously fights offshore wind projects in the Northeast, some of which are fully permitted or under construction.
"Perhaps no region in America is more at risk than in PJM," Energy Secretary Chris Wright said after the announcement. "That's why President Trump asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again."
POLITICO last week reported on a draft compact that the White House wants tech companies to sign to ensure data centers don't affect consumers' utility bills.
Trump said last month on Truth Social that he had struck a deal with Microsoft "to ensure that Americans don't 'pick up the tab' for their POWER consumption, in the form of paying higher Utility bills." The president added that his administration was negotiating with other tech giants and that there would be "More to come soon!"
Microsoft pledged last month not to raise utility costs near its data centers, and to replenish water used by the centers.

US ready to support Israel’s potential strikes on Iran — TV

WASHINGTON, February 15. /TASS/. The US administration has reassured Israel that it will support its strikes on Iran in case talks on the Iranian nuclear dossier fail, CBS news reported citing sources.
According to the sources, US President Donald Trump announced this position during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida in late December 2025. High-ranking Pentagon and intelligence officers are considering potential support for Israel’s new strikes on Iran, the television channel said adding that these discussions are focused on how the United States can help. Refueling of Israeli warplanes and obtaining permissions for their flights over third countries are looked as potential options.
Trump stated on January 26 that Washington had sent a "big armada" towards Iran and expressed hope that Tehran would engage in dialogue and make a deal, renouncing nuclear weapons. The US leader warned that "the next attack will be far worse" than the summer 2025 strikes on Iran. "Don't make that happen again," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

Senior Jewish American leader William Darroff urges conservatives to confront Tucker Carlson

William Daroff, the CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, urged leaders in the American conservative movement to publicly condemn Tucker Carlson, comparing him to Charles Coughlin, the influential 1930s radio priest known for antisemitic broadcasts.
Daroff spoke Sunday evening at a Jerusalem gathering attended by Benjamin Netanyahu, alongside American Jewish leaders visiting Israel as part of the Conference’s annual leadership mission.
In the remarks, Daroff described what he called a deepened bond between Israel and the United States since the October 7 attacks, telling Netanyahu that “American Jews and Israelis have felt their hearts beat as one.” He said the weeks after the Hamas attack produced a surge of unity, along with a harsher clarity about the threats facing Jewish communities.
Daroff then pivoted to Carlson, describing him as “the Father Coughlin of our age,” and argued that mainstream conservative leaders should respond the way Catholic authorities eventually did with Coughlin.
“What stopped Father Coughlin was when the Catholic Church, which had supported him, stood up and stopped him and called him out,” Daroff said, according to a transcript and contemporaneous reporting. “Today, the American conservative movement should do exactly the same,” he added.
Coughlin, once among the most prominent voices on American radio, promoted antisemitic and pro-fascist themes during the 1930s, reaching a mass audience before his public activity was curtailed during World War II through pressure from both US authorities and church leadership.
'We are one people'
The Conference’s 51st national leadership mission, led by chair Betsy Berns Korn, brought senior representatives of its member organizations to Israel for meetings with political, military, and civic leaders, as well as briefings on the war and Israel’s strategic challenges.
In his speech, Daroff also framed Israel-Diaspora relations in peoplehood terms, telling the audience: “We are one people bound by shared destiny and responsibility.” He called unity between Israeli and American Jewry “essential,” and said that when one part of the Jewish world comes under attack, “all of us feel it.”
At the close of the event, Daroff thanked Netanyahu for what he called his “leadership” and “friendship” with the American Jewish community, and presented a sculpture to the prime minister on behalf of the delegation, describing it as a work by noted Jerusalem artist Sharon Binder. He also referenced former Conference leader Malcolm Hoenlein during the presentation.
Carlson, a former Fox News prime-time host who now runs his own interview and commentary platforms, has remained a major voice in US conservative media.

The 11th commandment: Choose it or lose it - opinion
Unknown

05:29:21 KST

Last Shabbat, as I stood in the synagogue for the reading of the 10 Commandments, a sudden thought crossed my mind: Something is missing here!
The custom of reading aloud the 10 Commandments – the Decalogue – goes back to ancient times. In the Temple in Jerusalem, the 10 Commandments were part of the morning prayer service and were recited just before the saying of the “Shema.” Thus the two essential signposts of Jewish practice – the belief in one God and the essential moral and spiritual code of Judaism – were broadcast on a daily basis.
But at some point, the rabbis decided to eliminate the 10 Commandments from the liturgy. This was a reaction to the heretics, who pointed to the prominence of the Decalogue as proof that this is the only truly important part of the Torah that need be followed. While the 10 Commandments still can be found in many siddurim, and some people do still read them every morning, the architects of the prayer book concurred that we must indeed be wary of overemphasizing the 10 Commandments.
This was clearly the view of Maimonides. He strenuously objected to the widespread custom of congregants standing up for the readings of the 10 Commandments, in both the Exodus and Deuteronomy versions. His responsum on this subject is quite adamant:
“It is proper to abolish this minhag wherever it has taken hold, and to teach the people to sit, as they usually do, in order that there should not result a belief that one part of the Torah is superior to another; this is a belief that is wrong and evil and deplorable in the extreme.”
The rabbinic response to Maimonides notes that the flash and flourish of the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai, amid the fearful display of thunder and lighting, certainly play to the uniqueness of these powerful words written in stone. But the rabbis suggest that this is precisely because the Decalogue is much, much more than just 10 mitzvot, basic as they may be; they contain, in capsule form, all the 613 commandments that are to be found in the entire Torah.
So, for instance, “Thou shall not steal” also includes the prohibition of kidnapping, charging usurious interest, graft, influence peddling, and even gneivat da’at, “misleading others.”
“Thou shall not commit adultery” takes into account incest, immodesty, sexual abuse, and all forms of moral corruption. And the commandment to observe Shabbat? That includes all the many, many mitzvot that are connected to each of the Jewish holidays.
Spiritual portal that opens a connection with god
The 10 Commandments are, in effect, a spiritual portal that opens the door to a connection with God, but it is the greater body of the mitzvot that walks one through that pathway. In fact, the Hebrew word for Jewish law is Halacha, closely connected to halacha, “walking.” As a graphic illustration of this notion, there are exactly 620 Hebrew letters in the 10 Commandments; they represent the 613 mitzvot, plus the seven universal Noahide laws (sheva mitzvot bnei Noah).
But I want to suggest that there is an unwritten, 11th commandment that hovers above all the others: the mitzvah to live in the Land of Israel. This is a pervasive, all-encompassing Divine directive – a mitzvah “that is equal to all the Torah” – that permeates and activates the life of the Jewish people. Just living in Israel, at any level of observance, elevates the Jewish soul and automatically, even without our awareness, imbues within us a spirit of godliness and holiness. We walk the streets named for the prophets; we feel the festivals in the air. We not only study Jewish history; we live it. It is what I call “Moses by osmosis.”
Even in the most difficult of times, Israel inspires and nurtures us. When our son Ari fell in battle, the remarkable Rabbi Shlomo Riskin was the first rabbi to come to our shiva. He consoled us with the well-known prayer “Hamakom y’nahem et’hem b’toch she’ar aveley Tziyon v’Yerushalayim” (“May God comfort you among all those who mourn for Zion and Jerusalem.”) “Why is God referred to here as Hamakom – ‘the place’?” he asked. “It is because the place itself – Israel – will assuage your pain, knowing that Ari gave his life in order to defend and protect our holy land and all its citizens; there is no act of heroism greater than that.”
The very first time that God speaks to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob individually, He intimates to them that Israel is our natural habitat, given to the Jewish people for an eternal inheritance, and that the mitzvot cannot reach their fullest observance outside of Israel.
Each and every sidra (“portion”) in the Torah contains a reference to Israel, and the Talmud says explicitly that redemption can come only when we achieve three primary goals: sovereignty in the land; the obliteration of evil that endangers ourselves and all good people; and the rebuilding of the Temple. We’ve accomplished the first; we’re working hard on the second even as you read this; and the third, we pray, is just around the corner.
Why, then, does the Torah not explicitly spell out the obligation for every Jew to come to live here?
Some suggest it is because it is such an obvious, essential part of Jewish life that to enunciate it would be superfluous. But I have another idea.
I suggest that while the other commandments are obligatory – “forced” upon us from Sinai, whether we like them or not – this one imperative is there for us to voluntarily embrace. Like wise parents, who at times hold themselves back and allow their children to make decisions on their own, as an important part of their maturation, God is placing this long-awaited opportunity before us, carefully watching and waiting to see what we do: Will we choose it, or will we lose it?

NGOs waited decades to brand Israel with ‘genocide' label, watchdog head tells 'Post'

NGOs with an anti-Israel bias have been waiting for an opportunity to label Israel with terms such as ‘genocide’ for over 20 years, and the Gaza war finally gave them the opportunity, Dr. Gerald Steinberg, founder and president of NGO Monitor, told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday.
“We saw that with the coordinated 'genocide' campaign launched about a year after October 7. Discussions about using such terminology had circulated in NGO frameworks for over 20 years. They were prepared to use it as soon as they believed the opportunity arose,” he said.
Steinberg stated that by and large, the NGOs share a pattern of “political demonization of Israel, obsession with Israel, and reinforcement of each other’s messaging.”
The anti-Israel bias that exists within NGOs was brought back into the spotlight following the announcement that former Oxfam UK CEO Halima Begum is taking legal action against the organization for antisemitism. She has accused the group of pushing for the Israel-Hamas war to be labeled a genocide without sufficient evidence.
“It’s important to understand that there are hundreds of NGOs registered with the United Nations that claim to promote human rights or humanitarian aid while also maintaining active political advocacy roles,” Steinberg explained.
“Oxfam, for example, has an annual budget of about $1.3 billion. That’s enormous. It’s a powerful organization with a large public relations operation that significantly influences public and political opinion, including at the United Nations.”
However, he added, it is unprecedented for the leader of a major organization like Oxfam to acknowledge that these campaigns were planned in advance.
“That reflects a broader recognition of how far these NGOs have gone beyond reasonable criticism,” he said.
Steinberg further insisted that NGOs should be viewed by the international community as powerful actors shaping global narratives rather than small, altruistic volunteer groups.
“This entire industry requires careful, independent investigation. The lack of oversight has allowed a political agenda to override humanitarian claims,” Steinberg said.
Anti-Israel bias in NGOs happened gradually, Steinberg explained
The anti-Israel bias isn’t something that appeared overnight, Steinberg explained, adding that the takeover of the NGO industry was gradual, but today, organizations founded for different purposes have been transformed by activists whose fundamental objective is delegitimizing Israel.
When asked about possible ties to terror from NGOs operating within the Gaza Strip, Steinberg told the Post that NGO Monitor tracks over 300 organizations, and that some of the volunteers for these groups have become “virulent propagandists.”
“One example is Dr. Abu Sitta, who has been in and out of Gaza since at least 2018. On October 9, he accused Israel of “mass killing” and “indiscriminate killing” - language that escalated toward genocide accusations,” Steinberg said.
“Doctors Without Borders (MSF) provided him a platform. He became a primary source in global media for the claim that Israel bombed a hospital, killing 500 people. That allegation was later shown to involve a Hamas rocket misfire in a parking lot, with around 50 casualties. But once that narrative spreads, the damage is done.”
In Gaza, MSF recently left Nasser Hospital, and the IDF has stated that the hospital has been used as a base by Hamas.
MSF recently stated that they suspended non-critical operations due to armed individuals moving through the hospital and management concerns.
“This was widely known. Journalists and the IDF documented hospital use by Hamas years ago. It’s implausible that these NGOs were unaware,” Steinberg said.
“The question is why they’re acknowledging it now. I believe it’s related to Israeli requirements that NGOs submit staff names for vetting. Israel is demanding cooperation with security frameworks and screening of personnel to prevent terror infiltration. That pressure appears to be having some effect… If they knew hospitals were being used by Hamas and that aid was diverted to build hundreds of kilometers of tunnels - and remained silent - that makes them complicit.”

US would back Israeli attacks on Iran if talks fail, Trump told Netanyahu: Report

U.S. President Donald Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in December that Washington would back Israeli strikes targeting Iran’s ballistic missile program if diplomatic efforts with Tehran fail, according to U.S. media.
Discussions in Washington have shifted away from whether Israel could strike, moving instead toward how the U.S. might facilitate such a mission through technical and diplomatic means, said multiple people familiar with the matter, according to a CBS News report.
Key elements of this proposed cooperation include aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft to extend their operational range and the complex task of securing overflight permissions from neighboring sovereign nations.
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have said they would not permit their airspace for strikes on Iran.
The report emerged as Washington significantly steps up its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier as well.
A second round of negotiations between Iranian and American delegations is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, with Omani representatives serving as mediators.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Trump "prefers diplomacy" on Iran, adding that U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling for "important meetings."
"We'll see how that comes out," Rubio added.

The Palestine Action ruling leaves Britain’s Jewish community exposed - comment
Unknown

05:28:57 KST

For Britain’s Jewish community, the UK High Court’s ruling on Palestine Action is not an abstract constitutional debate. It raises a far more pressing question: who protects minorities when intimidation falls short of terrorism?
The High Court ruled on Friday that the government's decision to proscribe Palestine Action was "disproportionate" and unlawful and proposed that the order be overturned. Specifically, it found that the ban breaches Article 10 of the Human Rights Act, which protects freedom of expression.
The judges decided that, while the anti-Israel protest group engaged in "criminality," not enough of its actions amounted to terrorism. The Court did not deny that criminal offences had occurred; it ruled that the threshold for terrorism, and therefore proscription, was not met. For now, the group remains banned to give the government time to consider an appeal.
Palestine Action brought a legal challenge against its proscription after it was banned in July last year. The group maintains that its actions were not terrorism, and that it merely carried out "property damage against the weapons trade and against weapons that would have been used to massacre people in Palestine."
"Most people understand that is not terrorism. Acting to save lives is a necessity," Palestine Action founder Huda Ammori told Sky News. Over 2000 people have been arrested in the UK since the ban was enacted.
Home Secretary stood by the decision
Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood stood by her government's decision, saying it followed a "rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process" and that the ban does not prevent peaceful protest in support of the Palestinian cause. "Supporting the Palestinian cause is not the same as supporting Palestine Action," she said.
She also announced that she will fight the judgment in the Court of Appeal.
The ruling underscores that in the UK, even decisions framed as national security matters are subject to judicial review, and that the courts will scrutinize whether proscription is proportionate.
As the Board of Deputies of British Jews said, judicial oversight is "vitally important" in matters of national security. And yet this decision has a deep and pervasive impact on the Jewish community, whose way of life was affected by Palestine Action's campaigning. Jewish restaurants, businesses, and communities were targeted by Palestine Action for almost two years, causing fear, discomfort, and also incurring high costs (such as the need to repair vandalised buildings or remove graffiti).
Sans proscription, what measures will be in place to protect the Jewish community from repeated vandalism, graffiti, destruction, and harassment? Much of this activity was framed as a legitimate anti-Israel protest. But for those on the receiving end, such a distinction offers little comfort. At the end of the day, it is Jewish communities that suffer when their windows are smashed, or when kosher products are removed from shelves, or when cafes are forced to close because of constant targeting.
While there is some validity to the argument that arresting every person who supported Palestine Action was a waste of police resources, it at least sent a message that the government and law enforcement were taking steps to crack down on behaviour that intimidates Jewish and Israeli communities in the UK.
Coming so soon on the heels of the acquittal of six Palestine Action activists on aggravated burglary charges, a case in which a police officer suffered a serious spinal injury, the ruling may reinforce the perception among activists that the legal risks of disruptive protest are manageable.
Prosecutions for antisemitic crimes remain relatively rare. When high-profile cases end in acquittals, confidence in the system inevitably erodes, as the community questions whether it can rely on the criminal justice system to protect it.
It was never about peaceful protest
The debate now risks collapsing back into a narrow argument about freedom of speech, as if Palestine Action was simply about writing lengthy op-eds. But it was never about peaceful protest or holding up a banner; it's in the name - Action - and in many cases, this action was violent, destructive, and disruptive.
The High Court is right to guard civil liberties. But liberty without security is hollow for minorities who find themselves repeatedly targeted.
If a proscription is deemed disproportionate, the government must demonstrate what proportionate protection would look like. Otherwise, Britain’s Jewish community will be left asking whether the law protects not only their rights in theory, but their safety in practice.

A manicure, a memorial and the music of David  - opinion

On Tuesday night, 10 days after the return of Ran Gvili’s body, members of my Jerusalem synagogue Shira Hadasha gathered in an evening of song and to store away, in personalized fabric cases, the many accoutrements related to the return of the hostages. These, it was suggested, could be opened at appropriate times, such as on October 7, on Passover “to teach it to our children,” or on Memorial Day.
Everyone was encouraged to write their own messages. I have my share of yellow ribbon pins, yellow ribbons from my car, and a dog tag in gold attached to a necklace with birds flying free. But the symbol of identification that was most personally meaningful to me was on my fingernails – where the hostage yellow ribbon was created and recreated over the past two years in gel polish on my ring fingers.
So on Wednesday, I took a deep breath, and sat across from Hadassah Hospital-based manicurist Annael Toledano to remove the ribbons from my nails. It wasn’t a full manicure, so it was over in two minutes. It was emotional for her, too.
In January 2024, my friend, Jerusalemite Shari Greenwald Mendes – who volunteers for the IDF reserve unit tasked with preparing the bodies of fallen female soldiers for burial – spoke to a visiting mission of Hadassah leaders from the United States. She had just returned from testifying at the United Nations.
Greenwald Mendes described the appalling conditions of the bodies that she and her teammates treated with love and respect. An architect attuned to color, Greenwald Mendes spoke of the only bright colors amid the dark hues: pink, blue, and red polished nails. Many of the young women soldiers had polished their nails or gone for manicures for Simchat Torah, even though they would be spending the holiday at their army bases and not with their families, boyfriends, or synagogues.
The team paused to picture those women on October 6, and took a moment to honor them. Sitting to my right at the talk was Jerusalemite Madelaine Black, who volunteers at Hadassah Hospital. “Let’s polish our nails yellow in their memory and for the hostages,” she said. “Let’s spread the word.”
Tie a yellow ribbon, paint some yellow nails
And so it started – a campaign for yellow nails that began in Jerusalem, and then spread to the Diaspora. I think I was the first to polish my nails yellow, and Toledano, who provides uplifting manicures to harried staff and scared patients, suggested taking it one step further. She turned the pinkie fingers yellow, and then painted a three-dimensional-looking ribbon on both ring fingers.
She started offering it to clients, and even created a stand on International Women’s Day at the hospital. Then we were off to Hostages Square in Tel Aviv, offering yellow polish to visitors and families of hostages. I made a vow that I would continue until the last hostage was home, thinking then that it would be a matter of weeks or months. Hadassah women led the charge of nails in the US, and my Facebook feed filled with yellow.
Wherever I went in the Jewish world, women and men (who wanted to show their wives) took photos of the ribbon. When I met OPI nail polish co-founder Suzi Weiss-Fischmann in the summer of 2024, she was giving out yellow polish at the Hadassah Convention in Las Vegas, and I had the opportunity to tell her the moving origin story, which she hadn’t known.
What would I do when the hostages came home, I was frequently asked. I would turn those nails orange, I always answered, in honor of Shiri, Ariel, and Yarden Bibas. We wouldn’t find out they were murdered for another year, in January 2025.
From yellow to orange
So, it was on Thursday that I went with orange nails to see the newest woman-to-woman musical David the Servant King, my first time in a lovely theater in Jerusalem’s Talpiot Industrial Zone. Who knew? I was among 495 women there, nearly all in the modest dress and assorted head coverings of contemporary Orthodox Jews. There were enough young women for the tickets to include a request “not to bring babies.” There was also a list of biblical, Talmudic, and Midrashic sources in the playbill.
I felt exhilarated to be sitting among all these women from a sector that has played an out-sized role fighting in the war. They’re also probably the only audience in the world familiar with the aggadic interpretations dramatized in the play. One of Jerusalem’s great women Torah teachers was sitting in front of me, and I had the opportunity to ask her about her wounded nephew, whom I’d met in rehab.
Like the Bibas family, King David was reputedly a redhead, and the musical emphasizes his fraught childhood and unlikely kingship. All parts are played by women, a reverse of Shakespeare’s productions, and the actresses had training in adapting their movements to look more like men.
Playwright and lyricist Shlomit Koffler Weinreb first imagined the King David musical in 2017. She believes it was a heavenly inspiration shared with the creators of the House of David series for Amazon Prime, which had premiered in February 2025, and the enormously successful animated movie David, released that December. Esteemed journalist and author Melanie Phillips, also a Jerusalemite, has spoken of the “return of the heroic David warrior” – the valorous men and women who fought this war above and below ground and who maintained the thorny home front.
Readers of this column know that I am a longtime fan of the genre of women-to-women theater, music, and dance, in which Orthodox women who don’t perform before men express otherwise hidden and unexpressed talents. It’s hard for me to believe that it was 44 years ago that I went to my first women-to-women rock concert to raise funds for the family of Chaya Malka Abramson, recovering from a horrendous gas fire in the Old City of Jerusalem.
Koffler Weinreb was a composer, guitarist, and vocalist in her own women-to-women band called Ayelet Hashachar (“morning star”) in Baltimore. She plays a stirring prophet Samuel in David the Servant King. Tamar Rabinowitz, a co-creator and vocalist of that same women’s band, brings to life David’s resolute mother, Nitzvevet. Their band’s first performance on September 9, 2001, two days before 9/11, was a fundraiser for victims of terror in the Second Intifada.
David is played by the magnetic singer, actress, and scriptwriter Avital Macales. When, in the musical, Samuel anoints the future king, and the chorus sings the familiar words from Psalms and “Hallel” – in the midrash, from the mouth of David’s mother: “The stone the builders despised has become the cornerstone” – the tears in my eyes were not only for the ancient king of Israel but also for my unfairly reviled magnificent homeland and for our irrepressible people.

Jewish summer camps in Canada face pressure campaign over alleged 'Israeli military' ties

Anti-Israel groups in Canada are encouraging protest action against Jewish camps for their “explicit support for the Israeli military” and “genocide.”
“When children’s camps support a genocidal state, it’s time for gigantic change,” the groups (including Canada BDS) wrote in a joint statement on Friday.
The groups claim to have “identified” at least 17 summer camps throughout Canada that “support the State of Israel in some way.” Of the 17, 10 are in Ontario, three in Quebec, and 1one each in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia.
The pro-Palestine groups said that the camps actively fundraise for “war relief” efforts. For example, they reported that Camp Moshava Ennismore in Toronto has hosted an IDF soldier “who posted clips of himself in Gaza ‘joking’ about eating humanitarian aid,” and that Camp Timberlane (also in Toronto) posted at least one photo with a member of the Israeli military in Israel.
The protest groups then went on to accuse three accredited camps in Quebec and one in Nova Scotia of “explicit support for the Israeli military,” citing, for example, the fact that one of the camps commemorates Yom Hazikaron (Remembrance Day), or that some camp counselors are IDF veterans, or simply Israeli citizens.
Accusations of a 'Zionist who publicly supports Israel'
Additionally, the groups claim that Ontario Camps Association’s (OCA) Executive Director Joy Levy “is a Zionist who publicly supports Israel [and] its military, and promotes anti-Palestinian racism.”
Other examples of so-called “support” include the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, or the use of Hebrew in camp materials.
The protest groups even took fault with “food appropriation,” accusing Camp Solelim of appropriation of West Asian and Palestinian culture by advertising “The smell of zatar sprinkled on top of pita roasted over an open campfire…”
In a separate statement, the pro-Palestine groups said that the camps are not problematic “because they encourage connection to Jewish identity” but because “they encourage support for a genocidal, settler-colonial State.”
Given that the camps all have accreditation under their respective provincial camping association, the protest groups called for supporters to send letters to the leadership of the Quebec and Nova Scotia camp associations to tell them to revoke the accreditation of camps that hire, host, or support current or former Israeli military personnel.
They also urged followers to send a letter to the Board of Directors at the Ontario Camps Association to “hold Levy, their executive director, accountable for anti-Palestinian racism and support for a genocidal military, and demand an end to accreditation for camps that hire, host, or support current or former Israeli military personnel.”
Levy, on behalf of OCA, released a statement on Friday expressing deep concern about the campaign’s claims, which it called “discriminatory and antisemitic in nature.”
Libels and tropes related to Israel, Zionism, and Jewish people
“The accusations, aimed at our executive director, members of the OCA team, and several member camps, draw directly on stereotyped libels and tropes related to Israel, Zionism, and Jewish people – including ‘genocide’ and ‘colonizers,’ symbolic categories that are so often spread with specifically malicious intent.”
“The stated objective of that campaign is to pressure accreditation bodies to revoke or reconsider the standing of Jewish camps and to seek disciplinary action against staff,” Levy said, adding that such campaigning undermined the welfare and safety of Jewish children and the legitimacy of the leadership of the OCA (and elsewhere), Jewish camp administrators in Canada, and Canadian Jewish life in general.
“OCA is a provincial standards and accreditation body. We do not adjudicate international geopolitical conflicts, nor do we evaluate member camps based on their religious or cultural identity,” she added.
“We will not allow antisemitism, intimidation, discrimination, or harassment to take root within Ontario’s camp community.”
This is not the first time that Jewish summer schools have been the focus of anti-Israel campaigning. A few months ago, the database Find IDF soldiers, which documents Canadians who served in the Israeli military, released a new database named GTA to IDF, which details the institutions that the soldiers attended, implying that these institutions are breeding grounds for IDF conscription. Two specific camps – Moshava Ennismore and Ramah – were named.
“Publishing a directory of Jewish schools, community centers, and communal organizations framed as if their ties to Israel are incriminating is inciting and dangerous,” Austin Parcels, manager of research and advocacy at B’nai Brith Canada, told The Jerusalem Post at the time, adding that such lists become “a catalogue for hostile actors who are looking for targets.”
“These are Jewish organizations. Treating that basic fact as if it reveals something hidden or corrupt is an attempt to manufacture suspicion around Jewish identity itself. When you turn the most elementary fact of Jewish identity into suspicion, you are not revealing anything. You are giving people who want to harm Jewish institutions the ammunition they are looking for.”

Evidence with DNA near Nancy Guthrie’s home appears to match suspect
- The FBI has found a glove two miles from Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home, who was last seen on January 31.
- The glove could be linked to an “armed” individual seen in surveillance footage outside her home the morning she disappeared.
- The person in the footage, wearing a mask and gloves, appeared to tamper with Guthrie's doorbell camera.
- Investigators believe the found glove matches those worn by the individual in the surveillance footage and have sent it for DNA testing.
- The FBI reportedly said about 16 gloves have been found near Guthrie’s home, most of which were later identified as gloves used by searchers.

ICE releases detained Filipino after ‘unreasonable failures of care’
Greggy Sorio, a Filipino green card holder who lost a toe and part of his foot to a bone infection, wins release following medical neglect
A Filipino man awaiting the result of a deportation order has been released from Tacoma’s Northwest ICE Processing Centre following a federal court order that called the man’s detention unconstitutionally “punitive”.
While in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Sorio – also known as “Kuya G” – developed a bone infection that led to healthcare providers amputating one of his toes and a portion of his foot.
“I just want to say thank you to everyone. I’m speechless,” Sorio, 37, said during a celebration hosted by the Tanggol Migrante Movement, according to a statement from the organisation, which described Sorio’s release as “an unexpected announcement”.
Though the court order released Sorio from the Tacoma detention centre, he still faces a deportation order and the threat of removal from the US.
Sorio moved to the United States on a green card in 2007. He is originally from Lingayen, Pangasinan, in the Philippines.

Tom Homan says a small ‘security force’ will remain in Minnesota to respond to ‘agitators’
White House border czar won’t defend Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in interview, but declines to answer questions about her reported relationship with top-ranking official
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump’s border “czar” Tom Homan appeared across the Sunday news show circuit and presented a view for the future of immigration enforcement in Minneapolis as the Trump administration says it is withdrawing hundreds of officers from the state and ending an enforcement surge following the deaths of two Americans.
Homan recently took over as the top federal immigration enforcement authority on the ground in Minnesota following the removal of Gregory Bovino, ICE’s acting commander, from the role this month. His appointment followed calls from both Democrats and Republicans in Washington for federal officials to shift their tactics and outrage over the deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in confrontations with ICE and Border Patrol agents.
Though he announced this past week that the surge in Minneapolis was ending, Homan said on Sunday that a force would remain in the city to conduct operations in the future. Homan said that the agents remaining behind would include a “security force” whose purpose would be to stop protesters and others from interfering with ICE and Border Patrol enforcement operations.
"There will be a small force, a security force...that will respond when our agents are out and get surrounded by agitators,” said Homan. “They will remain for a short period of time to make sure the coordination, the agreements we have with local and state law enforcement stay in place."
Homan also said that agents tasked with investigating a fraud scheme in the state will remain, as will a team investigating an incident where activists conducted a protest at a church and were arrested alongside journalist Don Lemon, who was documenting the protest.
As his role grows in prominence, Homan is also facing questions about tumult reported within the ranks of Donald Trump’s DHS team, and in particular surrounding the ongoing work of Kristi Noem as DHS secretary. Noem is reportedly suspected by Trump and others to be in a relationship with Corey Lewandowski, her de facto chief of staff, which she denies but a factor that nonetheless adds a layer of frustration to a tenure as DHS secretary that has been loudly derided on the Hill, including by some Republicans.
Noem, already facing calls for her firing in Washington, was the subject of a Wall Street Journal exposé this week that detailed an agency in a constant state of chaos under her and Lewandowski’s management.
The piece cited many problems but also highlighted how the secretary apparently disliked Homan grabbing TV screens over her.
“Noem routinely berated staff if she saw Homan on TV and kept track of both their appearances to make sure she was on TV more than him,” the WSJ reported. “On at least one occasion, she asked aides to ensure she drew a bigger crowd at a conference than Homan, who was speaking on a different day.”
On Sunday, Homan declined to answer questions about Noem’s tenure as DHS secretary, while not defending her record from calls for her resignation from Congress.
“Look; it’s one team, one fight. I’m not playing into that media. They're trying to divide this administration,” Homan claimed, before he admitted that he did not agree with Noem on her decision-making 100% of the time. The border czar claimed that any disagreements he had with Noem were worked out in internal discussions.
He added that the record-low number of border crossings spoke for themselves.
Some aspects of Homan’s different approach to running the show in Minneapolis were on display on Sunday, regardless. Asked by CBS’s Face the Nation guest host Ed O’Keefe, Homan took a clearly different strategy to the give-no-ground approach that Noem and others have taken in response to allegations of wrongdoing by individual ICE or Border Patrol agents as he was asked by O’Keefe about agents placed on leave for giving misleading testimony.
Instead of defending the agents, Homan insisted that those cases had been sent to internal affairs for review and added that he had brought on more internal affairs staff to investigate claims of wrongdoing.
“Well look, you know, my first press conference in Minnesota I said I was bringing more internal affairs officers in, just to ensure officers were doing the right thing,” Homan said. “As the ICE director said on Friday, people will be held accountable.”
“Disciplinary action or prosecutions will occur” if accounts of ICE or Border Patrol agents committing violations of the law are found to be credible, Homan said.
Donald Trump himself has sought to balance his administration backing off Minneapolis in response to growing anger with a desire to deny any appearance of weakening or softening as it pertains to ICE and Border Patrol’s enforcement or operational standards.
“We’re going to de-escalate a little bit,” the president said in an interview in late January. In an interview with NBC Nightly News a few days later, he added: "I learned that maybe we could use a little bit of a softer touch. But you still have to be tough.”

At Munich, a U.S. Change in Tone Leaves Ukraine’s Allies Unconvinced
Unknown

MUNICH, Germany — The unofficial mascot for the 2026 Munich Security Conference was an elephant.
But if the elephant in the room was the question of whether the United States was trampling over the world order and its relationship with Europe nearly four years into Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, it was not ignored, but repeatedly confronted.
A year after U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance stunned European leaders at the same gathering by accusing them of abandoning democratic values and freeloading on the U.S.’ protection, Secretary of State Marco Rubio struck a more conciliatory tone.
The mood at this year’s conference was less apocalyptic than last year’s “shock therapy,” as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen put it.
But several attendees, many speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Moscow Times that they were not entirely reassured.
“We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve for us as history’s constant reminder that ultimately, our destiny is and will always be intertwined with yours, because we know that the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own,” Rubio told a crowd at the luxurious Bayerischer Hof Hotel.
But his was still seen as a continuation of the administration's MAGA rhetoric, decrying “mass immigration,” a “climate cult” and framing the U.S. not just as the most powerful country in the democratic world, but as part of a “shared civilization” with Europe, “forged by centuries of shared history, Christian faith, culture, heritage, language, ancestry” and “the sacrifices of previous generations.”
For some European leaders, who increasingly accept that the continent must reduce its reliance on Washington and assert itself as a more equal partner, that rhetoric landed uncomfortably.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz criticized Washington’s tariff policies and what he described as the projection of U.S. “culture war” issues into European politics.
“MAGA means anti-EU. It means anti-liberal world order. It means anti-climate change. That’s the ideological undercurrent” guiding U.S. foreign policy,” said Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who is thought to have one of the best relationships with U.S. President Donald Trump out of anyone in the alliance.
How much damage Rubio could undo was limited, as many European leaders have direct experience with the Trump administration.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen said she believes that Trump still wants to own Greenland, despite having toned down his threats to take it by force.
Eyes on east and west
The conference took place the day after a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, where they discussed progress toward capability targets set at last year’s summit in The Hague. NATO announced that a further $500 million would be pledged to purchase U.S.-made weapons for Ukraine through the Prioritized Ukrainian Requirements List (PURL), including air defense missiles to protect cities and infrastructure from Russia’s intensifying drone and missile attacks.
As Ukrainian civilians continued to freeze in apartments that have been without heating for weeks due to Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, Ukrainian officials sought to emphasize Moscow’s problems on the battlefield after Western figures suggested Russia lost 9,000 more men on the battlefield last month than they recruited.
At the Ukraine House exhibition, co-hosted by the presidential office near the main venue, visitors met Ukrainian drone developers and watched an AI-generated video depicting simulated Russian Geran drone attacks on major European cities.
On the main stage, President Volodymyr Zelensky called for security guarantees for Ukraine lasting at least 20 years. He said Washington had offered 15-year assurances but had not specified how it would provide them, including whether it would support a European reassurance force in Ukraine.
He called on the international community to “exert maximum pressure on Russia” by pushing down global oil prices to further hit a key source of revenue for Moscow’s war effort.
He also said Ukraine would hold elections — a condition pushed by Trump and the Kremlin — if a two-month ceasefire with security guarantees were agreed.
The next round of talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States is scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva.
After almost a year of talks in which Russia repeated its demand for Ukrainian territory and rejected external security support for Kyiv as a threat, the contours of any deal remain vague.
Rubio said it was unclear how “serious” Russia was about ending the war. “
“They say they are — and under what terms they are willing to do it and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine that Russia will always agree to. But we’re going to continue to test it,” he said.
Equally uncertain is how the international community would engage with Russia if a deal were reached. The Kremlin has signaled that peace would depend on ending Russia’s economic isolation, including lifting sanctions and pursuing new economic agreements with the U.S.
Attendees who spoke to The Moscow Times did not provide a clear picture of how the world should treat a post-war Russia. But none were looking for a return to the pre-war status quo.
“Let’s have a peace deal first and then see what happens after that,” Rutte said. “But for NATO, it’s clear as we see things now, Russia is a long term threat to the whole of NATO’s territory.”
“We leant over backwards to integrate Russia into the broadly understood West…” Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said. “I'm afraid under the current leadership of Russia, a return to normal relations with the West is unlikely. Colonial wars, if you look historically, are only ended by a different team than started them.”
Russian opposition activist Mikhail Khordokovsky also saw no prospects for a lasting peace as long as President Vladimir Putin holds power in the Kremlin.
“For him, war is necessary, because then we need to avoid talking about normal life,” he said.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.
Remind me later.

FBI: DNA recovered from glove found near Guthrie home that appears to match glove worn by suspect
FBI: DNA recovered from glove found near Guthrie home that appears to match glove worn by suspect
A glove containing DNA found about two miles from the house of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother appears to match those worn by a masked person outside her front door in Tucson the night she vanished, the FBI said Sunday.
The glove, discovered in a field beside a road, was sent for DNA testing. The FBI said in a statement that it received preliminary results Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation. The development comes as law enforcement gathers more potential evidence as the search for Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week. Authorities had previously said they had not identified a suspect.
On Sunday night, Savannah Guthrie posted an Instagram video in which she issued an appeal to whoever abducted her mother or anyone who knows where she is being kept. “It is never too late to do the right thing,” Guthrie said. “And we are here. And we believe in the essential goodness of every human being, that it’s never too late.”
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
The discovery was revealed days after investigators had released surveillance videos of the masked person outside Guthrie’s front door. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves.
AP correspondent Julie Walker reports on a break in the Nancy Guthrie disappearance case.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. It described him as a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build. The agency said he was carrying a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.
Late Friday night, law enforcement agents sealed off a road about two miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home as part of their investigation. A series of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock.
The investigators also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a nearby restaurant parking lot late Friday. The sheriff’s department later said the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but no arrests were made.
On Tuesday, sheriff deputies detained a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson. Authorities didn’t say what led them to stop the man but confirmed he was released. The same day, deputies and FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search in Rio Rico, about an hour’s drive south of the city.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Earlier in the investigation, authorities had said they had collected DNA from Nancy Guthrie’s property which doesn’t belong to Guthrie or those in close contact with her. Investigators were working to identify who it belongs to.
The FBI also has said approximately 16 gloves were found in various spots near the house, most of which were searchers’ gloves that had been discarded.

‘West exploits women’: Iran, Hezbollah use Epstein scandal to push anti-US narrative

Media outlets and officials across the Arab world are closely following developments in the Jeffrey Epstein case, with Iran and its regional allies using the scandal to advance longstanding accusations of Western moral corruption and to direct criticism at the United States and Israel.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei was asked about the case Sunday and described it as “a sign of a very deep moral crisis in the governing system of Western countries, especially given the involvement of many senior political figures.”
He added that from another perspective, the affair was also a criminal matter and a tragedy that had hurt public sentiment worldwide. Referring to Israel, Baghaei said suspicions were growing that the case had been “a long-term project to advance the political goals of certain actors, especially the Zionist regime.”
Iranian state-affiliated and pro-regime outlets have amplified such claims. During rallies marking the 47th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, video circulated showing demonstrators burning a statue in Tehran’s Revolution Square. Iran’s Tasnim news agency claimed it was a statue of Epstein.
Images from the scene, however, showed the statue depicted Baal, a deity historically associated with child sacrifice in ancient mythology. A Star of David had been placed on the statue’s head, and it was described in some reports as representing evil.
Press TV, a channel affiliated with the Iranian government, said in its Hebrew-language platform that Iranians had burned a statue of Baal “as a symbolic act due to anger over the Epstein scandal and child sacrifice.” It also claimed that Epstein had named a bank account “Baal,” referencing what it described as a figure worshipped in ancient times.
The Houthi movement in Yemen, aligned with Iran, has also prominently featured the case in its messaging. Its outlets have focused on allegations of Western corruption and abuse, while also highlighting a widely circulated image of Epstein with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman amid tensions between the Houthis and Saudi Arabia.
Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi said Feb. 5 that “Trump, the criminal unbeliever, and the leaders of America, Britain and the Zionist Jews” commit grave crimes. In a later speech, he described documents related to Epstein as evidence of what he called attempts by enemies to spread corruption.
Senior Houthi official Hazam al-Assad wrote on social media that Western countries had spent years criticizing Islam over issues such as child marriage and child recruitment while allegedly engaging in abuse themselves. In other posts, he questioned whether U.S. escalation against Iran was an effort to deflect from the scandal.
Another Houthi figure, Mohammed al-Farah, wrote on social media that one could be president of a country that calls itself a beacon of democracy while lacking moral values.
Pro-Houthi comedian Mustafa al-Momari also referenced the case in videos, criticizing Arab media for focusing on Houthi recruitment of minors while asking why they were not speaking about “children recruited to Epstein’s island.” Yemeni cartoonist Kamal Sharaf, who supports the Houthis, published cartoons and videos about the affair, including material widely viewed as antisemitic in connection with the Tehran statue-burning.
Lebanon’s Al-Manar television, affiliated with Hezbollah, aired a report titled “Epstein’s Scandals: The West as It Really Is,” quoting a political science and international law expert who said the scandal revealed the true face of Western systems that speak of values, freedom and democracy while allegedly violating them.
In Egypt, the controversy surfaced in a different context. The Interior Ministry announced Feb. 10 that it had canceled a party at a Cairo nightclub called “A Day on Epstein’s Island.” The event, which reportedly offered free entry for women, drew public criticism. Authorities said the gathering had not received required permits and that the organizer, a Cairo-based event producer, was arrested.

Trump tells Hamas to proceed with 'full and Immediate' disarmament

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza, and said members of his so-called "Board of Peace" had pledged $5 billion to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.
"Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization," Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a February 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
Disarmament is a key part in the second phase of the U.S.-brokered ceasefire plan sealed in October between Israel and the Palestinian militant group to end the war triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023.
The United Nations endorsed the plan in November.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Both sides accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Although originally intended to oversee Gaza's rebuilding, the charter for the "Board of Peace" does not seem to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
"The Board of Peace has unlimited potential," Trump said Sunday in his post.
After an initial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, the board is due to meet Thursday in the U.S. capital.
Countries have been asked to pay $1 billion for permanent membership of the board, and the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine in 2022, has drawn criticism.
Key U.S. allies including France and Britain have expressed doubts.
Trump said the $5 billion in pledges by member states would be formally announced then, and that members also "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans."
Trump has said the organization will work "in conjunction" with the United Nations.
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History," he said.
Under the ceasefire plan, a Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up with a goal of taking over governance in the battered Gaza Strip.

US would back Israeli strikes if Iran talks fail, Trump told Netanyahu in December: Report
Washington discussing how US might facilitate Israeli strikes on Iran through technical, diplomatic means, according to CBS
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump informed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a December meeting that Washington would back Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program if negotiations with Tehran collapse, US media reported Sunday.
Discussions in Washington have shifted away from whether Israel could strike, moving instead toward how the US might facilitate such a mission through technical and diplomatic means, said multiple people familiar with the matter, according to a CBS News report.
Key elements of this proposed cooperation include aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft to extend their operational range and the complex task of securing overflight permissions from neighboring sovereign nations.
Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have said they would not permit their airspace for strikes on Iran.
The report emerged as Washington significantly steps up its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier as well.
A second round of negotiations between Iranian and American delegations is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, with Omani representatives serving as mediators.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Trump "prefers diplomacy" on Iran, adding that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling for "important meetings."
"We'll see how that comes out," Rubio added.

Niger’s president arrives in Algeria amid signs of easing tensions
Visit follows restoration of diplomatic representation after more than 10 months of strain between Algiers and Niamey
ALGIERS, Algeria
Niger’s President Gen. Abdourahamane Tiani arrived in Algeria on Sunday for an official working visit, holding talks with Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, in a move seen as signaling an end to more than 10 months of diplomatic tension between the two countries.
Algeria’s presidency said in a brief statement on the US social media company Facebook that Tebboune received Tiani, who is leading a high-level delegation, without providing further details.
State television reported that Tebboune welcomed his Nigerien counterpart at Houari Boumediene International Airport in Algiers, describing the visit as reflecting the “depth of historical relations” between the two nations.
Footage on state TV showed an official welcoming ceremony, including the playing of both countries’ national anthems and an honor guard.
Senior Algerian officials attended the reception ceremony, including Senate Speaker Azzouz Nasri, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Said Chanegriha, Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, and Energy and Mines Minister Mohamed Arkab, according to state television.
Tebboune and Tiani later held bilateral talks in the airport’s VIP lounge with members of both delegations present. No immediate details were released on the substance of the discussions or the length of the visit.
Local media and analysts said the official welcoming and high-level talks indicate a definitive closing of the rift that strained relations for over 10 months.
On Thursday, Algeria announced the immediate return of Ahmed Saadi, its ambassador to Niger, after a reciprocal downgrade of diplomatic ties since last April. The move followed the resumption of duties by Niger’s ambassador to Algeria, Aminou Malam Manzo, also on Thursday.
Mending fences
The diplomatic rift began last April, when Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali, members of the Alliance of Sahel States, recalled their ambassadors from Algeria after Mali accused Algiers of shooting down one of its drones.
Algeria said at the time that the aircraft had violated its airspace on an offensive trajectory, marking the third such breach.
Algeria responded by recalling its ambassadors from the three countries under the principle of reciprocity. It later said Niger’s decision stemmed from solidarity within the Sahel alliance rather than a bilateral dispute.
Ties began to thaw late last year. In November, the Nigerian president sent Tebboune a message marking Algeria’s Revolution Day. In January, Algerian Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab visited Niger to review joint oil projects, the first senior-level Algerian visit since the diplomatic downgrade.
Algeria and Niger share nearly 950 kilometers (590 miles) of border and cooperate on major regional projects, including the Trans-Saharan Highway and a proposed gas pipeline that would transport Nigerian natural gas to Europe through Niger and Algeria. It is a huge project that could allow the transport of 30 billion cubic meters annually.

Gaza mother’s grim ordeal: A search for missing son among mutilated bodies
Gaza families seek closure as they search for loved ones among bodies returned by Israel under ‘ceasefire’ deal.
Gaza City, Gaza Strip – With exhausted steps and eyes filled with tears, Hanaa al-Mabhuh moves between the hall displaying photographs of bodies and the morgue at al-Shifa Hospital in a grim search for any trace of her missing son.
The 56-year-old mother wipes away tears with the back of her hand and stares at the decomposed faces on the screen, torn between the desire to find out what happened to her youngest child, while at the same time fearing he might be among the dead handed over by Israel under a US-brokered ceasefire deal.

“Every child is precious to his family, but my son is a part of me,” she adds, tears streaming down her cheeks as she walks toward the morgue.
The family contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and several human rights organisations to try to find out what happened to Omar and his cousin, but to no avail.
Hanaa says the wait has been heartbreaking.
“We do not know whether they are prisoners, or whether they [the Israelis] killed them and took their bodies or detained their bodies along with those bodies they release in batches.”
“We are running as if in a mirage and we do not know anything,” says Hanaa, falling silent as if trying to catch her breath.
Endless search
Since Israel began returning Palestinian bodies to Gaza through the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing, Hanaa has become one of hundreds of family members moving between hospitals and reception points seeking any clues to the fate of their loved ones.
The latest batch of bodies came on February 4. Gaza’s Health Ministry said 54 bodies and 66 boxes containing human remains, released by Israel via the ICRC, had been received.
The remains arrived at al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, where medical and technical teams began initial examinations and documentation before presenting them to families for possible identification.
Human rights organisations say handovers occur through the Red Cross in accordance with international rules, but these procedures do not always include detailed documentation or the circumstances of death, increasing the burden on Gaza authorities to classify bodies and attempt identification amid limited capacity to conduct DNA testing.
Since the latest handover, Hanaa has gone to the hospital several times to review lists and photographs of the bodies.
“I have not left any place without going to it. I even went to Khan Younis in the south of the Strip to check the photos,” she says.
The bodies were returned under the United States-brokered October 2025 truce agreement between Israel and Hamas, which stipulated that the remains of 15 Palestinians would be exchanged for the bodies of every Israeli held in Gaza.
As of last month, Israeli authorities continue to hold the bodies of more than 770 Palestinians in what is known as the “cemeteries of numbers and morgues“, according to the National Campaign for the Recovery of Martyrs’ Bodies and Disclosing the Fate of the Missing.
Hanaa’s suffering does not stop at reviewing Palestinian bodies. She also checks the lists of prisoners released by Israel from time to time, contacting the ICRC to try to confirm if her son’s name appears.
“By God, the Red Cross has memorised me and my voice from how much I call and ask. They tell me: ‘Sister, aren’t you the one who called last time?’ I tell him: ‘Yes, my brother. Forgive me, it is not in my hands.’ He sympathises with me,” she says.
Despite the gruelling effort, there is still no decisive answer about her son’s fate.
“My heart as a mother wishes that my son is alive. But I prepare myself for the worst possibilities, and even this psychological preparation has brought no result,” Hanaa says.
‘Why do they leave us lost?’
Hanaa says the hardest part is not only the loss, but the state of confusion and disorientation she lives through, along with hundreds of members of other families still searching for their relatives.
“Why do they leave us lost like this? We don’t know where they went or what their fate is,” she says.
Another grim aspect is witnessing the “pitiful condition” in which the bodies are returned by Israel’s military. “All the features are completely buried, and I cannot even distinguish my son’s features.”
Hanaa says she believes the mutilation is “deliberate” to increase the pain of Palestinian families. “It is as if they want to leave us in grief for a lifetime … to mourn our children without end,” she says, tears unceasing.
“My son was in the prime of his youth, like a flower, when he was lost. He was preparing to sit for his high school exams with his cousin. What did they do to disappear like this and for us not to know their fate until now?”
Since the war began in October 2023, the fate of bodies held by Israel has emerged as a central humanitarian and legal issue in the conflict. Israel does not publish a unified list of named bodies it holds.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, it has “facilitated the transfer of 360 Palestinian bodies to Gaza since October 2023”, supported the handover of 195 Israeli captives, including 35 deceased, and the return of 3,472 Palestinian prisoners alive.
Only 99 returned Palestinian bodies have been definitively identified, according to the Health Ministry. The rest remain unidentified or are still undergoing identification procedures.
The ministry said some corpses show gunshot wounds to the head and chest, shrapnel injuries, fractures to the skull and limbs, in addition to advanced decomposition – greatly complicating forensic identification.
Appeal for international help
Hanaa called on international organisations to intervene to assist grieving families such as hers to determine the fate of their children.
“We cannot calm down or stabilise psychologically or socially. We are under enormous psychological pressure,” she says.
“They plowed the earth completely and exhumed graves searching for Israeli bodies with equipment and tests. But our children, no one asks about them. By what logic does this happen?”
At Gaza’s forensic department, a small team handles this heavy burden under conditions that exclude tools of “definitive confirmation”, leaving staff and families in a wide space of doubt.
Ahmed Abu Taha, head of the bodies and missing persons files at the Health Ministry, tells Al Jazeera that 120 corpses recently arrived in Gaza via the ICRC. Some came complete, while others were simply bone fragments and other human remains.
Out of the 120, only two bodies were identified, and even those were not scientifically conclusive.
“Confirmatory” tests such as DNA analysis, forensic anthropology, and forensic odontology are unavailable in Gaza’s destroyed healthcare system, meaning only “presumptive” testing can be conducted, which is less precise, says Abu Taha.
“The steps begin with presumptive testing – looking at distinguishing marks, clothes, whether male or female, estimating age, identifying distinguishing features such as amputations or tattoos… Then you move to confirmatory testing. But unfortunately, in Gaza we only have presumptive testing.”
This type of testing “is prone to many errors” including misidentification, he adds.
When error becomes tragedy
The most painful aspect, Abu Taha says, is the impact an “error” has on families waiting desperately to find the body of a missing child. Repeated misidentifications have been recorded, causing shock and reopening wounds for many Palestinians.
Abu Taha recounts one story that deeply affected him and illustrates the psychological and emotional damage inflicted on families amid the absence of accurate DNA tests.
“On one occasion, members of a family came and identified a body as their son. They presented evidence that closely matched the body. The forensic team examined it and found similarities, and indeed the body was handed over to that family.”
Grieving relatives completed the formal procedures for receiving the body, obtained a death certificate, then proceeded with funeral rites and burial. They announced a wake to receive mourners.
But a shock came when, only two days after the burial, another family presented more conclusive evidence that showed the deceased person belonged to them.
Abu Taha says the harrowing incident has been repeated inside Gaza’s beleaguered hospitals.
He is calling for international intervention to pressure Israel to allow the entry of identification equipment and DNA testing tools as an ethical and humanitarian matter to end the suffering of families struggling to identify loved ones and give them a proper burial.
“The file of the bodies is not merely a numerical issue,” Abu Taha says.

Farrer challenger doesn't think Liberal's focus on migration will be welcomed
One of the contenders for Sussan Ley's soon to be vacated seat of Farrer, has warned the right side of politics that a crackdown on immigration will not be supported in the regional New South Wales seat.
Independent Michelle Milthorpe polled almost 20 per cent of first preferences in the seat at the 2025 election and has committed to running again in the by-election
"When I ran the first time it I didn't feel we were being represented here and nine months on I haven't seen much change," she told the ABC.
"We're still facing a cost-of-living crisis, we're still facing chronic childcare shortages, aged care services that are stretched . . . we're about to face a dry winter after a really long period of dry weather, we're in drought, people in regional areas are really concerned."
The new Oppposition Leader Angus Taylor will soon release a new immigration policy while One Nation continues to receive strong numbers in the polls as it pushes for a reduction in immigration numbers, however Milthorpe said that would anger people in her electorate.
"The reality for us in Farrer is that we have a large number of communities that depend on immigration to have healthcare services, to have farmers, to have all of these workers in our communities."
"I was speaking to some people from Denny (Deniliquin) just yesterday and they said the worst thing for their community, is to say no immigration because at the moment they're relying on migrants to help them with their business."
Liberal senator has 'serious concerns' about reported draft Liberal migration policy
Just a little more on that story about the Liberal Party's migration policy.
As we mentioned earlier, the Liberal Party is reportedly considering a policy of banning people from some parts of the world under the administration of a declared terrorist group.
Liberal senator Paul Scarr, who is also the shadow immigration minister, released a statement commenting on the media reports.
He says he never proposed any such policy, nor agreed to any such policy.
"I never signed or approved a shadow cabinet submission containing any such policy," Scarr says.
"I have a range of serious concerns with respect to any such policy," he says.
Lib MP says winning Farrer by-election will be more difficult with Nats in the contest
Liberal MP Garth Hamilton says it will be harder to win the electorate of Farrer with the Nationals contesting the seat.
Sussan Ley announced she'd be leaving parliament, and her seat of Farrer, after she was dumped by her party room from the Liberal leadership.
Speaking to Afternoon Briefing, Hamilton says it's longstanding tradition that both Liberals and Nationals run for a seat when there is a change of hands.
"That's the reality we face and that's being in a Coalition. It's part of an agreement we've had for a long, long time," Hamilton says.
"We want a Coalition member to take that seat and continue on. Hopefully, from my side, it's a Liberal," he says.
He says it would be "unfair" to attribute any blame of a Coalition loss in Farrer to Angus Taylor.
And that's where we'll leave Afternoon Briefing for today.
Liberal weighs into leaked immigration policy
Liberal MP Garth Hamilton and Assistant Minister Patrick Gorman have joined the Afternoon Briefing political panel, and have been asked about the Liberal Party's immigration policy.
News Corp reports the Liberals want to ban migration from some places with terrorist activity, including Gaza and Somalia.
Hamilton says while the vast majority of people who come to Australia love the country, some people come from places where extremist views are spread.
"There's some places where we can clearly see extremist views being spread quite liberally around the populous, particularly in countries that are controlled by those extreme terrorist organisations," Hamilton says.
Gorman says he's happy to engage with a policy when it is finalised. He says he's satisfied with the government's action to date on migration.
"If the Liberal Party's got all the detail then put it out there and let's have a discussion. They're not doing that so it's pretty hard to engage on right now," Gorman says.
Assistant Minister pushes back on Taylor's request for bipartisan taskforce on budget
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor has written to the PM, urging him to establish a bipartisan taskforce to find savings in the federal budget.
Treasurer Jim Chalmers has mocked the proposal and said it's a "predictable stunt" from the opposition leader.
Assistant Productivity Minister Andrew Leigh says Taylor went to the last election promising higher taxes and more debt.
"This is a man who at the last election was shadow treasurer, and wanted to raise taxes on all working Australians," Leigh says.
"From a political party that went to the last election saying they would subsidise lunches for bosses. This is a political party that is not serious about doing the work of budget repair," he says.
Andrew Leigh says ACCC case against Coles will have 'significant implications'
Assistant Competition Minister Andrew Leigh has joined Afternoon Briefing, where he's been asked about an Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) case against Coles.
The supermarket giant has been accused of a "planned" campaign to mislead customers over price discounts on the first day of a bombshell Federal Court case.
The assistant minister says it's a big case with "significant implications".
Asked if the government is considering looking at divestiture powers, Leigh says the government won't pursue it.
"We're focused really on things that will make a practical difference for Australian shoppers [and] help put downward pressure [on] supermarket prices," Leigh says.

Minister confirms CCTV trial underway in childcare centres
A trial of CCTV cameras in more than 300 childcare centres is underway, in response to a series of reviews into the sector.
The trial will look into where cameras should be placed in the centres, who holds the data, and how to ensure the footage isn't hacked.
Education Minister Jason Clare says the trial comes amid other looming changes to the industry that will require childcare educators to be on a national register, and to complete safety training by February 27.
During a press conference today, Clare has said he will release the Race Discrimination Commissioner's report into racism in universities this week
"We know that there are challenges with antisemitism and work is underway, led by David Gonski and the Antisemitism Education Taskforce," he said.
Nationals will run a candidate at Farrer by-election, McCormack says
Former deputy prime minister Michael McCormack has confirmed the Nationals will be running a candidate in the Farrer by-election.
Last week, Sussan Ley announced she would resign from the seat, which she had held for 25 years, after being dumped from the Liberal leadership.
Speaking to Sky News, McCormack says "high-profile figures" have approached the party, keen to contest the seat for the Nationals.
But he won't be drawn on who he thinks should be preselected to run for the seat.
He says he'd like to see a National Party MP represent the area, which he considers the party's "heartland".
"We want to give voters choice. We're certainly not going to put up a white flag … we'll be running a very good candidate; we will be running to win," McCormack says.
"To not run would be to thumb our nose at those people who've turned up at branch meetings, turned up at state conference, federal convention and kept the faith for 25 years while Sussan represented them," he says.
Henderson reveals frontbench intentions
Liberal senator Sarah Henderson says she hopes to return to the frontbench in a shadow ministry re-shuffle.
She was among those dumped from the shadow ministry when Sussan Ley took over as opposition leader last year.
Appearing on Sky News, Henderson has refused to be drawn on whether a frontbench position is locked in, but says she's made her intentions clear.
"I never talk about private discussions but I am not mincing my words — I do hope that I return to the frontbench," she says.
"We all have a responsibility to work together as a team to ensure that we can put our best foot forward to fight for the Australian people."
Kovacic says change of leadership won't guarantee better electoral fortunes
Liberal senator Maria Kovacic says a change of leadership alone ultimately won't change the problems facing her party.
Kovacic, who backed Sussan Ley in the leadership spill, says she supports new Opposition Leader Angus Taylor and Deputy Opposition Leader Jane Hume.
She's told Sky News that Australians expect the Coalition to focus on cost of living, among other policy areas, such as immigration and child care.
"They're the things that we have to talk to," Kovacic says.
"We have to talk clearly to the needs and aspirations of Australian households … we haven't been doing that, and that's reflected in the polls."
How much time do Taylor and Hume have to turn things around? Kovacic says it's a "matter for those" who will be "making those calculations".
The NSW senator says she hasn't spoken to Taylor and Hume about a new shadow ministry position.
Taylor's shadow ministry to be released within days
Angus Taylor has confirmed he'll unveil his shadow frontbench in the coming days.
The opposition leader will appoint his shadow ministry later this week, and is widely expected to reward his factional allies, with Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Senator Sarah Henderson and West Australian MP Andrew Hastie expected to return to the frontbench.
He says the "incredibly talented" group of people will have policies in place ahead of the next election.
Opposition leader won't say how much he'd like to cut immigration
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor has been asked whether he wants to cut immigration to pre-COVID levels or take it even lower.
The opposition leader says he won't put a number on migration today, other than to say he "certainly" wants it lower than it is at the moment.
Taylor says while immigration is important to Australia, it needs to be "done right" and that immigrants must adhere to the country's values.
"We shouldn't discriminate based on race or religion, but we should based on values," Taylor says.
"If people want to come to our country who do not believe in democracy, who do not believe in our laws, who do not believe in our basic freedoms, we should shut the door."
Taylor wants Liberal Party with 'freedom agenda' at core
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor is using his address at the Centre for Independent Studies to make his pitch as Liberal leader.
In the short address, the opposition leader has said he'll lead a Liberal Party with a "freedom agenda" at its core.
He says he wants a federal government that "gets the big things right but gets off your back".
Taylor says he wants businesses to be freer and "liberated from the reins of government" and that "eradicating the nanny state" is a priority.
"We can enable a revival of investment productivity and restore the conditions and confidence that will grow our economy, restore our living standards and a rising standard," Taylor says.
He's moving to a Q&A now. We'll bring you any interesting questions or comments.
Angus Taylor says 'all is not well' in Australia in first speech since becoming Liberal leader
New opposition Leader Angus Taylor is delivering his first address to the Centre for Independent Studies since becoming Liberal leader.
Taylor was scheduled to deliver a speech at the think tank, but his appearance has taken on a renewed importance since last week's leadership spill.
He's joined by Deputy Liberal Leader Jane Hume, Liberal senator James Paterson and former prime minister John Howard.
Taylor says "all is not well" in Australia.
He's touched on some of the areas in his sights, including the cost of living, homeownership, immigration and defence.
"Protecting our way of life is about many things. It's about re-establishing home ownership as the centrepiece of the Australian dream," Taylor says.
"It's about expanding child care instead of forcing every family into the same universal system.
"It's about strengthening education by focusing on core knowledge, education, not indoctrination.
"It's about celebrating our history and our values and nurturing a deep love of country, and it's about having an immigration policy that puts the interests of Australians first."
Taylor expected to reward factional allies following elevation to leadership
Speculation is mounting over who will be the Liberal winners and losers following Angus Taylor's elevation to the party's leadership.
Taylor will appoint his shadow ministry later this week, and is widely expected to reward his factional allies, with Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, Senator Sarah Henderson and West Australian MP Andrew Hastie expected to return to the frontbench.
Others in the right wing of the party, like Tony Pasin, Phil Thompson and Senator Jess Collins are due to be rewarded.
As newly elected deputy leader Senator Jane Hume also gets to choose her portfolio.
Those promotions will come at the expense of key backers of ousted leader Sussan Ley, with Alex Hawke, Andrew Wallace, Scott Buchholz and Anne Ruston among those expected to lose their shadow ministries.
Taylor is poised to retain some moderates on the frontbench, with Senator Andrew Bragg and Victorian MP Tim Wilson among them.
Wilson has been tipped as a potential shadow treasurer, while Hastie has been floated for an adjacent domestic economic portfolio like energy or industry.
New shadow cabinet set to be unveiled tomorrow, National deputy leader says
Deputy Nationals Leader Kevin Hogan says new Liberal leader Angus Taylor is set to reveal his overhauled shadow cabinet tomorrow.
Taylor is set to unveil his shadow cabinet and is expected promote formerly dumped shadow ministers Sarah Henderson and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price.
Asked if the Nationals will look to renegotiate the deal that brought the Coalition back together, Hogan says his party is "relaxed" about it.
Former opposition leader Sussan Ley agreed to reunite the Coalition on the condition that the Nationals frontbenchers who broke shadow cabinet solidarity remain in the sin-bin for six weeks.
"If we come back on March the first or we come back tomorrow, we are relaxed about that. I'm sure David [Littleproud] and Angus have had discussions about that, but I'll wait and see what the result of those discussions were," Hogan says.
Watt defends threatened species update
Environment Minister Murray Watt has defended the decisions made in the threatened species update last week.
In case you missed it (you’re forgiven, there was a bit happening), Watt announced that he would not be updating the Maugean skate's status from endangered to critically endangered.
A study by the Institute for Marine and Antarctic Studies found Maugean skate numbers had declined by 47 per cent between 2014 and 2021, with salmon farms considered a main contributor.
Watt said his decision was based on the advice of the threatened species scientific committee, but that the government would uphold its promise that no more species would go extinct under its watch.
Nineteen other species have been added to Australia’s critically endangered list.
"Our natural environment is under pressure from a range of factors — climate change, illegal clearing, other factors as well," he said.
"That's why we’ve taken such strong action to strengthen our emissions reduction targets, move towards renewable energy, but also to invest in the preservation of our species."
'Questions for Angus': Wallace on shadow cabinet
Liberal leader Angus Taylor will soon unveil his reshuffled shadow cabinet following the leadership spill.
Andrew Wallace is hoping to continue in his role of shadow attorney-general. Or at least, remain in shadow cabinet.
"Well I'd like to continue to serve as the shadow attorney-general or in some other way in the shadow cabinet, if Angus thinks that's appropriate ," he says.
"But ultimately those are questions for Angus. In the Liberal party, it's the leader and the leader only who determines who gets what."
Wallace was appointed shadow attorney-general by former opposition leader Sussan Ley in October last year, replacing Julian Leeser, who moved into the shadow education and early learning portfolio.
Unlike several of his shadow cabinet colleagues, Wallace — a vocal Ley ally — did not resign ahead of last week's leadership vote.

Top US sanctions official poised to leave Treasury amid tensions: Report
Hurley’s departure follows friction with Treasury secretary over sanctions strategy
ISTANBUL
John Hurley, the Trump administration’s top sanctions official, is expected to leave his post at the Treasury Department following tensions with Secretary Scott Bessent over sanctions policy approaches and objectives, Bloomberg reported Sunday.
Hurley, the undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, could depart after months of internal discord over the methods and focus of US sanctions strategy, people familiar with the matter told the outlet.
Officials are considering several ambassadorial positions for Hurley in an effort to retain a trusted ally within the administration, according to sources cited by Bloomberg.
A senior administration official told Bloomberg that Hurley maintains a strong working relationship with Bessent at Treasury.
The Financial Times reported Friday that President Donald Trump is considering Hurley for the German ambassadorship.
There has been no official confirmation from US officials regarding the matter.
Washington has widely used sanctions as a foreign policy tool under the Trump administration, targeting countries including Iran, Venezuela and China over issues ranging from nuclear programs to economic activities.

Somali airstrike kills 15 al-Shabaab terrorists in southern Somalia
Airstrike targets terrorists planting improvised explosive devices along key road in Middle Shabelle region, says Somali Defense Ministry
ISTANBUL
The Somali Army carried out a targeted airstrike in southern Somalia, killing 15 al-Shabaab terrorists, the country’s Defense Ministry said Sunday.
In coordination with international partners, the airstrike targeted militants planting improvised explosive devices along a key road in the Middle Shabelle region, destroying a vehicle and weapons used in a plot to attack civilians, according to a ministry statement.
The al-Qaeda-affiliated terror group has been engaged in an insurgency against the Somali government for more than 16 years, frequently targeting security forces, officials, and civilians.
Since last July, the Somali army, with the support of the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia and other international partners, has stepped up operations against al-Shabaab.
The African Union’s mission mandate was renewed by the UN Security Council in December for another year, with a UK-backed resolution extending its authorization until Dec. 31.

Zelensky announces new sanctions against Russians involved in war
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said this in his evening video address, Ukrinform reports.
"We are preparing a new sanctions package targeting Russian individuals who work for the war and put sport at the service of war. The documents are already prepared; this Ukrainian sanctions package should be a signal to others around the world – a signal that one cannot simply turn a blind eye to support for aggression. When Ukrainians at the Olympics are forbidden to even mention the victims of Russian aggression, that is clearly a global rollback of justice. We will restore justice. The sanctions decree will be issued soon," Zelensky said.
On January 17, Zelensky signed a decree enacting a decision of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine to impose sanctions on three individuals and two legal entities that use sports platforms to spread anti-Ukrainian narratives and Russian propaganda.

Türkiye condemns Israel's land registration move in West Bank

Türkiye on Sunday strongly condemned Israel's new decision on land registration in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of international law.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move aims to impose Israel’s “authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities."
"This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel's unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void," the ministry said.
"Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories," the ministry added, saying that the expansionist policies pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government undermine peace efforts and damage prospects for a two-state solution.
Türkiye called on the international community to take a firm stance against Israeli attempts to create facts on the ground.
The ministry said Türkiye will continue to support efforts to "establish an independent, sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” daily Israel Hayom said ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation – including killings, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion – as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Warner Bros weighs reopening sale negotiations with Paramount

Warner Bros weighs reopening sale negotiations with Paramount
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
NEW YORK - Warner Bros Discovery is considering reopening sale talks with rival Hollywood studio Paramount Skydance after receiving its hostile suitor’s most recent amended offer, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Members of the Warner Bros board are discussing whether Paramount could offer a path to a superior deal, people familiar with the board’s thinking said, a move that may ignite a second bidding war with Netflix
The board hasn’t decided how to respond and still has a binding agreement with Netflix, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information.
Paramount submitted amended terms last week that addressed several concerns.
The company will cover a US$2.8 billion (S$3.5 billion) fee owed to Netflix if Warner Bros terminates their agreement, and is offering to backstop a Warner Bros debt refinancing.
Paramount also said it will compensate Warner Bros shareholders if the deal doesn’t close by Dec 31, underscoring its confidence that the deal will get swift regulatory approval.
Warner Bros still has some concerns about Paramount’s offer, many of which it has outlined in past statements, but this is the first time the board has considered Paramount’s offer could lead to a better deal or prompt Netflix to up its bid. It has also faced pressure from shareholders to at least engage with Paramount.
Warner Bros has agreed to sell its namesake studio and HBO Max streaming business to Netflix in a US$27.75 a share deal.
Warner Bros has been racing to hold a shareholder vote on its Netflix agreement, while Paramount, the owner of CBS and MTV, has been appealing directly to Warner Bros shareholders through a US$30-a-share tender offer and is lobbying regulators to approve its deal.
Both Paramount and streaming leader Netflix have indicated they would be willing to raise their bids in order to secure a deal for Warner Bros, one of the largest US media companies.
Paramount Chief Executive Officer David Ellison has said the current offer isn’t his last and final bid, while Netflix’s leadership has told shareholders it could go higher as well.
Both companies are wary of spending too much. Shares of Netflix have declined more than 40 per cent
Mr Chris Marangi, co-chief investment officer at Gabelli Funds, said that while he was a bit disappointed Paramount didn’t raise its offering price this week, the latest changes to the terms suggest the company is finding “ways to be creative about structuring a deal.”
“Like the Warner Bros board, I want to see a sweetened offer,” said Mr Marangi, whose company owns Warner Bros shares.
If Warner Bros decides to re-engage with Paramount, it would need to notify Netflix first. Warner Bros would then try to get Paramount to increase its offer beyond US$30 a share. If Warner Bros decided Paramount’s new offer was superior, Netflix would have the right to match it.
Paramount triggered the auction of Warner Bros with an unsolicited offer in 2025.
The company increased the price several times before ultimately losing to Netflix. Paramount leadership has insisted its deal is better and has spent the last couple months wooing regulators and shareholders.
A number of Warner Bros shareholders, including Pentwater Capital Management and Ancora Holdings Group, have gone public with their belief that the board should engage with Paramount. But just 42.3 million shares were tendered to Paramount at last count, less than 2 per cent of those outstanding. BLOOMBERG

Türkiye set to introduce new social media rules to protect children, says family minister
'Just like many countries around the world, we are very close to implementing social media regulations aimed at protecting our children,' says Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas
ISTANBUL
Türkiye is getting ready to introduce new regulations to protect children on social media platforms, the country’s family and social services minister said Sunday.
On the Turkish social media platform NSosyal, Mahinur Ozdemir Goktas said the government is close to putting the measures into effect, citing growing concerns about the impact of constant digital stimulation on children.
"Just like many countries around the world, we are very close to implementing social media regulations aimed at protecting our children," she said.
Goktas warned that people’s attention spans have dropped to about eight seconds, a trend she said harms children more than adults.
She added that children’s attention spans have declined by at least 30% over the past decade, impacting their concentration, friendships, and academic performance.
These changes have also made teaching more difficult, she said, adding that similar social media rules for children are being debated or introduced in countries around the world.
She said Türkiye is working to create a safer internet environment for children, calling on parents and teachers to support the effort. "Together, we can make a safe internet possible for our children," she added.

DNA pulled from glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s home as FBI believe it may belong to suspect seen in doorbell cam
Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her Arizona home on January 31
- Bookmark
The FBI said a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home could match the gloves worn by an “armed” person seen in surveillance footage outside her front door the morning she disappeared, according to the Associated Press.
This comes after the FBI released new photos and videos from Guthrie’s doorbell camera of a suspect, who was wearing a ski mask and gloves, approaching her front door. Police said the man was armed and appeared to tamper with her camera.
The glove, which the agency said could match those worn by the suspect, has reportedly been sent off for DNA testing. While investigators have received the preliminary results, they’re still waiting on official confirmation, the AP reports.
The agency reportedly said about 16 gloves have been found near Guthrie’s home, most of which were later identified as gloves used by searchers that had been discarded.
Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie, was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills, a quiet community just outside of Tucson, Arizona, on January 31. She was reported missing the next day.
The masked individual seen at Nancy Guthrie’s front door has been described as a man with an average build who is between 5’9” and 5’10” tall. He was wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack, the FBI noted.
On Thursday, the FBI also announced a new reward of $100,000 for information “leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”
This comes after law enforcement officials carried out operations in the Tucson area Friday related to Guthrie’s disappearance.
Investigators searched a residence about two miles from Guthrie’s home Friday night, with a warrant that was “based on a lead,” a Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson said Saturday. No arrests were made.
Around the same time, officials conducted a separate traffic stop, also near Guthrie’s home. Investigators questioned an individual, but no arrests were made, the sheriff’s department spokesperson said.
The search for Guthrie is now entering its third week. Investigators “won’t quit” their efforts to find Guthrie, even if it takes years, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told The New York Times.
“Maybe it’s an hour from now,” Nanos said Friday. “Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy."
Her disappearance has sparked a massive search involving state and federal law enforcement agencies.
Guthrie relies on daily medication, and there could be “fatal” consequences if she doesn’t take it, Nanos has said. When she vanished, police also flagged that she has high blood pressure, a pacemaker and cardiac issues, according to a 911 dispatch audio.
Savannah Guthrie has said she believes her mother is still alive. The “Today” show anchor recently shared an old video of her mother on Instagram with the caption, “We will never give up on her.”
She also shared the footage of the masked man and asked for anyone with information to come forward. “Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home,” she wrote on Instagram.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said anyone with information should contact 1-800-CALL-FBI, 520-351-4900, 88-CRIME or visit tips.fbi.gov.

ACCC alleges Coles discounts 'utterly misleading' as court case begins, ASX gains 0.2 per cent despite mining sell off — as it happened
Supermarket giant Coles and the consumer watchdog were grilled in the Federal Court, with the ACCC accusing Coles of "utterly misleading" discounts on products like toothpaste, soft drinks and cheese.
The local share market closed modestly higher despite a sell-off of the big miners, while JB Hi-Fi and Aurizon delivered well-received results, while Treasury Wine Estates and Bluescope Steel failed to impress.

Goodbye
That's it for a very busy day on the blog.
On behalf of my colleagues who spent the day watching Coles vs the ACCC in the Federal Court, thanks for your company.
It will be fairly quiet overnight with Wall Street closed for the Presidents' Day Holiday. Hopefully that holiday will be extended to the President's overworked social media account.
But we will be back with a bang early in the morning with BHP heading a deluge of results tomorrow.
Until next time, missing you already ...
LoadingASX closes 0.2% higher despite mining sell-off
The ASX 200 closed modestly 0.2% higher, despite falling commodity prices hitting the big miners.
Most sectors made gains led by technology and industrial stocks, while the tiny education services sector rose 4.1%, the same as its heavyweight member, IDP.
After a strong performance last week, there was a bit of profit taking among the banks although CBA (+0.5%) was still in demand.
ANZ (-3.1%) was the weakest performer among its peers slipping from its record high after a 10% gain last week.
Bendigo Bank fell 2.2% after posting a slightly better than forecast half year profit.
The bigger, diversified miners were generally lower after key commodity prices fell on Friday. Rio Tinto shed 4.1%%.
Copper play Capstone was an exception, gaining 0.9%.
Among the rock kickers, gold miners were the standout, with most benefiting from the spot price jumping back above $US5,000/ounce level, before it slipped back later in the afternoon.
Retailers were in demand.
Although Coles and Woolworths ended up only marginal gains on the first day of the Federal Court case launched by the ACCC.
JB Hi-Fi closed 7.5% higher on well-received interim results this morning.
Having been battered in recent times, tech stocks returned to favour, with logistics software provider Wisetech gaining almost 13%.
Healthcare stocks did well with CSL (+1.4%) clawing back some recent heavy losses.
Clarity Pharmaceuticals gained almost 25% on releasing promising results with its prostate cancer therapy.
The top mover on the ASX 200 was shipbuilder Austral (+19.55%) recouping a part of last Friday's savage sell off.
The bottom movers include Treasury Wine Estate (-5.2%) after its half year results included a decision to suspend dividends to help improve the company's debt position.
ACCC v Coles has adjourned in Federal Court
The opening day of the hearing at the Federal Court in Melbourne has adjourned until Tuesday.
Once the ACCC's legal counsel Garry Rich concluded, John Sheahan from Coles' legal team addresssed Justice O'Bryan.
Among other arguments, Mr Sheahan said the case hinged on whether Coles was justified in lowering the prices of a basket of goods, raising them for a brief period, and then lowering them again.
He also put it to Justice O'Bryan that Coles customers were aware of price movements before making purchases.
This case hinges on whether Coles was justified in lowering the prices for a basket of goods, after raising them, and labelling the price drops discounts under the 'Down, Down' promotion.

Down Down creates 'substantially more revenue' for Coles
Almost anyone who's been to Coles in the last decade and a half would have noticed the supermarket giant's signature promotion.
"Down Down" is listed on item tickets that have been reduced in price.
At the opening day of the hearing at the Federal Court in Melbourne, the ACCC has argued that Coles is deceptive in its claim that these products are cheaper.
It says they're artificially increased in price for just a few days before being reduced to create the impression of a bargain.
And according to ACCC head counsel Garry Rich SC, it's an extremely lucrative practice by Coles.
"Substantially more revenue is generated on promotion than not," he said.
"Material sales revenue are higher when the product is on promotion [and] Coles's gross profit is projected to improve when the product is sold on the 'Down Down' price."
Earlier, Mr Rich said 245 products were involved in the "Down Down" campaign between February 2022 and March 2023
Affected products include deodorant, toothpaste, soft drink, cheese, shampoo and insect repellent.
Most were not true cut-price items, he said, but gave customers the impression they were with misleading messaging.
Will iron ore prices hold up as new supply collides with weaker demand?
With the Pilbara's miners in retreat today after Friday's near-3% drop in iron ore prices to well under $US100/tonne, is it a blip on the screen or a fundamental weakness in the market?
That fall has been somewhat halted today, with spot prices looking to be marginally higher this afternoon.
"The iron ore market" is largely a euphemism for the "Chinese market", given it represents just under 60% of global demand.
China's economic slowdown has been well documented elsewhere in previous blogs and posts.
The ailing Chinese property sector is the big worry. Too much supply, shrinking prices and a pessimistic outlook are at the heart of the problem.
But is the outlook for iron ore all that bad?
Maybe not, according to J.P. Morgan's resources team.
In its 2026 iron deep dive, the investment bank has forecast prices will hold at around $US99/tonne this year, with global steel output relatively flat as Chinese mills cut production by 2% and the rest of the world increases output by 2.8%.
On J.P. Morgan figures, Chinese iron ore imports set another record, around 90 million tonnes (Mt) above 2020 levels when peak steel was 1,065Mt vs 961Mt reported in 2025.
"Our bottom-up analysis of China's Fe (iron) unit consumption — including domestic ore production, imports, and scrap consumption — implies higher crude steel output than official data suggests," lead analyst Lyndon Fagen said.
This discrepancy echoes the late 2000s, when some induction furnace output was not captured in official statistics.
Mr Fagen says the ramp-up at the giant Shimandou mine in Guinea looks less damaging than first thought.
The note says net supply growth from the majors was "muted" in 2025, with combined shipments from BHP, Rio Tinto, Vale, and Fortescue up only 5Mt YoY.
It was up 20Mt YoY if Mineral Resources' Onslow project was included.
"In 2026, we expect 66Mt growth, with higher guidance from (Brazil's) Vale, incremental tonnes from Australia, and 20Mt from Simandou," Mr Fagen said.
However, the cost curve will more likely be tested in 2027/28, with 69Mt/49Mt added as Simandou ramps up.
Iron ore prices have averaged $US102/tonne last year and $US121/tonne over the past five years.
On a 10-year horizon, the price has been remarkably stable, averaging $101/tonne.
"We forecast $100/t for 2Q26, declining to $95/t by 4Q26, and maintain our $99/t forecast for 2026," Mr Fagen said.
"We are less concerned about Simandou's market impact, given the sizable cushion from non-traditional imports (~220Mtpa) and China's domestic ore production (~330Mt in 2025).
"With around 500Mtpa of marginal ore in the system, there is high potential for prices to remain above market expectations (consensus ~$80/t long term) as Simandou ramps up."
ACCC to finish evidence 'by this week'
The afternoon session of the opening day of the Coles hearing at the Federal Court of Australia in Melbourne has lacked the fireworks of earlier in the day.
ACCC's head counsel Garry Rich SC is presenting his case to Justice Michael O'Bryan.
We learned from internal emails that Coles was keen to stay ahead of the game in its close competition with fellow supermarket giant Woolworths.
Mr Rich has revealed that the ACCC case may last for the rest of the week, with several witnesses to be called.
After that, we will hear from Coles, who are bound to defend its "Down Down" promotions where prices are ticketed as major discounts.
The ACCC has been arguing that Coles often artificially increases its price for a short period before reducing it to a level higher than originally charged.
Justice O'Bryan said the proceedings would come down to whether Coles' processes were fair or not.
"I won't deny the commission at opportunity to interrogate around this material," Justice O'Bryan said.
"[We're investigating] what's right about what the [grocery] ticket conveyed."
If you're interested to watch the proceedings unfold in the Federal Court, you can here.
Internal Coles emails show company worried about competitiveness with Woolworths
Internal emails being read out by the ACCC show Coles staff fretting over competing with Woolworths on a price level.
The emails show that Coles managers described Woolworths's approach to discounting as "shocking", suggesting the prices had been dropped without any price establishment period.
They even raised potentially going to the ACCC themselves with their concerns about Woolworths not having a sufficient price establishment period.
The ACCC is arguing that this pressure to compete with Woolworths was the reason Coles took a more aggressive approach to the "Down, Down" promotion, which allegedly misled customers.
That's called shrinkflation
The other notable thing is the supermarket constantly put prices up, then ‘discount’ not back to the old price but above that AND reduce the size of the content. Example chocolate bars that were 200 grams are now 180 grams! This happens across the board with many products.
- Anne Kay
Well observed Anne — it's a pain I'm sure most of us have felt when going for our late-night chocolate fix … right?
The presumably unwelcome phenomenon of a product size shrinking but the price staying the same (or potentially increasing!) is known as shrinkflation.
The ACCC has had shrinkflation in its sights, pushing for supermarkets to have to publicise when there are size changes.
The federal government is consulting on new requirements for supermarkets, including pricing transparency measures.
Coles hearings slated for a fortnight
How long are we expecting the case to go on for?
- Lawson
Thanks for joining us Lawson — the Coles hearings are listed for a fortnight in the Federal Court.
And it's worth noting that the ACCC is pursuing both Coles and Woolworths, with Woolies defending its case separately in April.
ASX 200 rises, supported by tech and gold stocks as miners dumped
The ASX 200 has made a modest 0.2% gain heading into the afternoon session (2:00pm AEDT), despite falling commodity prices hitting the big miners.
Most sectors have made gains led by technology and retail stocks.
After a strong performance last week, there's been a bit of profit-taking among the banks, although CBA (+0.5%) is still in demand.
ANZ (-2.5%) is the weakest performer among its peers, while Bendigo Bank is down 1.4% after posting its half-year results.
The bigger, diversified miners are generally lower, after key commodity prices fell on Friday. Rio Tinto is down 4.6%.
Copper play Capstone is an exception, gaining 1%.
Among the rock kickers, gold miners are the standout, with most benefiting from the spot price jumping back above $US5,000/ounce.
Retailers are in demand.
Coles (+0.8%) and Woolworths (+0.4%) haven't been set back by the start of the Federal Court case launched by the ACCC this morning.
JB Hi-Fi is up almost 7% on well-received interim results this morning.
Having been battered in recent times, tech stocks have returned to favour this morning, with logistics software provider Wisetech up 8%.
Healthcare stocks are also doing well, with CSL (+1.2%) clawing back some recent heavy losses.
Clarity Pharmaceuticals is up almost 18%, after releasing promising results with its prostate cancer therapy.
The top mover on the ASX 200 is shipbuilder Austral (+15%), recouping a part of last Friday's savage sell off.
The bottom movers include Treasury Wine Estate (-5%), after its half-year results included a decision to suspend dividends to help improve the company's debt position.
Coles hearing recap from Federal Court in Melbourne
A quick recap if you're just joining us.
Coles is in the Federal Court in Melbourne after the ACCC accused the supermarket of ripping off customers with fake discounts on hundreds of products.
Consumer watchdog boss Allan Fels has told the ABC it's "the case of the century".
In opening arguments this morning, lawyer for the ACCC Garry Rich SC didn't mince words, accusing the supermarket giant's discounts of being "utterly misleading".
The ACCC's core argument focused around whether Coles disguised price increases as discounts, and if they could be considered a "fair dinkum statement".
Nature's Gift wet dog food was used as an example. The ACCC pointed out that the product previously cost $4, before the price rose to $6 for a week, and then fell to $4.50, with Coles claiming a discount from the higher price.
The iconic "Down, Down" campaign was also in focus, which the ACCC claimed used "illusory" discounts.
The case will set an important precedent for a similar case faced by Woolworths, which will likely be kicking off in April,

ACCC v Coles hearing is back in session
Court is back in session at the Federal Court in Melbourne after breaking for lunch.
The ACCC kicked off the trial this morning with opening arguments and is expected to finish with remarks before the end of the first day.
It has accused Coles of being deceptive in its "Down Down" promotions across their supermarkets Australia-wide.
Bendigo Bank beats profit forecasts but still sold off
Bendigo Bank released its first half results with its net and pre-provisioning profits marginally ahead of analysts' expectations, but clearly below those of investors.
At 1:30pm AEDT, Bendigo Bank was down 1.7% to $11.26 per share.
While the bank's cash net profit, the industry's preferred measure that excludes on-off impacts, was 3.6% higher than the consensus forecasts, worries emerged about narrowing margins and growing costs.
J.P Morgan's Andrew Triggs said the "NIM (net interest margin) was slightly better than expected, but this was offset by lower average interest earning assets, and margin pressure (that) is expected to return in H2."
"Operating expenses were flattered by significant investment spend taken below the line again.
"Bendigo Bank has guided to $70m-$90m of AML (anti-money laundering) investment expenses taken over 3 years, with a $15m headwind flagged for 2H26."
Mr Triggs said the main positive in result were strong credit trends in its loan book.
UBS analyst John Storey was concerned that the bank's underlying costs rose around 4% over the half, while investment spending fell around 25%.
He said the AML costs had not yet been factored into forward consensus estimates and the regulator AUSTRAC has not issued a decision on whether the planned action will be sufficient.
ACCC accuses Coles of 'planned' campaign to mislead customers
The ABC's national consumer affairs reporter Michael Atkin has also been listening in to today's proceedings and has filed his take on the case so far.
There has been intense debate about the pricing of more than 200 products at the opening of the landmark ACCC vs Coles court case.
Lawyers representing the consumer watchdog have labelled Coles's price discounts "utterly misleading" and accused the supermarket retailer of a "planned campaign".
The hearing is currently on a lunch break — catch up on what happened this morning:

The Coles hearing breaks for lunch
Well, that was quite an interesting morning at the Federal Court of Australia in Melbourne.
ACCC's head counsel Garry Rich SC didn't hold back in blasting the allegedly deceptive nature of Coles's "Down Down" promotions.
He did get some pushback from Justice Michael O'Bryan, who said customers weren't "naive" about price fluctuations in the commercial world during a cost-of-living crisis.
They've broken for lunch now on day one of the hearing and it will resume at 2:15pm ADST.
There are bound to be more fireworks this afternoon.
'Down Down' promotion added to Coles sales volumes
ACCC's head counsel Garry Rich SC has stepped up his attacks on Coles on the first day of proceedings at the Federal Court of Australia in Melbourne.
He has told Justice Michael O'Bryan that the supermarket giant's "Down Down" promotions have significantly added to its sales volumes, without providing genuine cost reductions for consumers.
"It’s a very appealing offer, prices are rising everywhere but Coles is telling customers that prices are down," Mr Rich said.
The head counsel said that between September 2019 and January 2022 observed more "guardrails" in the Down Down promotions.
During that period, products had to be at their new price for longer — a minimum of 12 weeks and a maximum of 18 months — before being cut and described as a "discount".
Earlier in the proceedings, Mr Rich gave the example of dog food that had been at a higher price for just a few days before being reduced and acclaimed as a "Down Down" discount.

Is Trumpism losing steam?
As Trumpism forces both major US parties to wonder what they stand for, experts weigh in on November election prospects.
The Republican Party currently controls the White House and both houses of Congress in the United States. But will that change in November?
Among Republican voters, US President Donald Trump is still wildly popular, despite criticism over uneven economic conditions and brutal anti-immigration tactics. And within the Democratic Party establishment, there is no sign of a desire to shift towards a more progressive, less centrist platform – even as left-leaning Democratic Socialists make gains.
Host Steve Clemons asks Republican strategist John Feehery and Amy Dacey, former chair of the Democratic National Committee, about Trumpism and the election prospects of both parties.

Trump’s bizarre Valentine’s Day fundraising letter asked ‘do you still love me?’ — and E Jean Carroll said she received it
Political action committees affiliated with the president has sent several Valentine’s Day-themed emails begging for donations
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
E. Jean Carroll, the writer who won an $83.3 million defamation lawsuit against President Donald Trump after he denied sexually abusing her, said she received a Valentine’s Day-themed fundraising email from a political action committee associated with the president that asks “do you still love me?”
The email, from “secret admirer Donald J. Trump,” begs people to read the “love letter” from the president and prove their devotion with a monetary donation.
“Roses are red, violets are blue. Do you still love Trump, as I love you?” the email from the PAC Never Surrender Inc. says.
“Before you read my letter – do you still love me and our great movement?” It adds, with a photo of Trump putting a Valentine's Day card in a mailbox. “I love you, and I was pretty sure you loved me back! Is everything ok?”
Carroll wrote on X: “Yes. This is a real email. No .I did not sign up on this mailing list. Yes. We are living in a crazy world.”
It is unclear why Carroll received the email if she never signed up for Trump’s campaign fundraising emails. Never Surrender Inc. is the president’s leadership PAC, which was converted from his 2024 presidential campaign after he won the election.
The Independent has asked Never Surrender Inc. for comment.
Carroll sued the president for defamation in 2019, during the first Trump administration, after the president denied her claim that he raped her in the 1990s. After a jury found Trump liable for sexual abuse, a separate jury awarded her millions for the repeated defamatory statements Trump made about her.
Carroll did not say whether or not she had received other Valentine’s Day-themed fundraising emails from Never Surrender Inc. The PAC has sent several over the month, similarly themed around a “love letter” which takes people to a donation website when opened.
In the past, Trump has relied on the money small donors give to PACs affiliated with him to pay his legal bills when he was embroiled in state and federal civil and criminal cases.
That includes fees for Alina Habba, who defended Trump in his federal civil defamation case with Carroll. Federal Election Commission records showed that the Make America Great Again Inc. super PAC and Save America PAC paid Habba’s firm roughly $4 million.
Never Surrender Inc. has sent hundreds of similar emails, purporting to be directly from Trump, asking supporters to show their love by taking a “poll” or leaving a personalized note that requires a monetary donation to be submitted.
Early on in February, Never Surrender Inc. sent an email saying, “I placed a special LOVE LETTER in the mailbox.”
“I love you, and I was pretty sure you loved me! But a few days ago, I sent a special LOVE LETTER for you and I haven’t heard back,” the email from February 4 reads.
Another one, from Valentine’s Day, reads “Do you need a hug?”
“Before Valentine’s Day is over, can you leave me a quick personal note? I’m dying to read it,” the email reads. It takes users to a similar donation website with a box available for people to leave a personalized note.

A critical point for Ukraine – and for Europe

Almost four years after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the situation on the ground and in the diplomatic arena has become critical. Our report from Kyiv graphically depicts the plight of so many residents in Ukraine’s capital city, who face nightly Russian air raids, targeting primarily civilian power supplies, in mid-winter. The intensity of the attacks, the damage sustained for want of sufficient air defence, and the winter temperatures have all been markedly worse than in previous years.
The human aspect, as ever, is the most poignant: nursery-age children who have learned to distinguish outgoing from incoming fire; a parliamentarian relieved that his family lacked the money to buy a flat in an adjacent high-rise that turned out to be more vulnerable than his ground-floor flat in an older building; no hot water, no heating or power, for all but two of 24 hours, all detrimental for wellbeing and morale. If this is what it is like living an MP’s relatively privileged life in Kyiv, the conditions for others, including those living further east, in the actual battle zone, must be many times worse.
Yet Ukrainians fight on, demonstrating admirable, almost superhuman, fortitude in their determination not to cede land to the Russian aggressor, and especially not the fortress belt that Russia has not been able to win on the battlefield and is seen as crucial to Ukraine’s security, now and in the future. Those who argue that it is time to stop praising Ukrainian resilience and time instead to focus on the actions that have made that resilience necessary are not wrong. But without Ukraine’s resilience, this could be a very different story.
Nor is it only on the ground that the situation has reached a critical point. The diplomacy that dates from the start of Donald Trump’s second term in office appears to stand at a potentially pivotal point, too. Both the dangers and, alas, the rather fewer hopes for peace, were on display this weekend at the Munich Security Conference.
This time last year, Europe was reeling from the speech at that same conference of the US vice-president, JD Vance, and what appeared his shocking litany of charges against Europe. This year, the most senior US speaker was the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, who sounded a more emollient and reassuring note, underlining a continuing US commitment to Europe, and paying tribute to European cultural achievements.
But he also left two raw realities in place. There would be no going back on the demand that Europe take responsibility for its own defence. And Ukraine – which he did not mention once by name in his speech, although that was more than made up for during questions and side-meetings – was primarily a European problem, and would be entirely a European problem if the current, US-led, diplomacy failed. He also noted that any agreement would require “hard concessions” on the part of Ukraine.
If that was intended to be a signal in advance of a new round of talks, involving both Ukrainians and Russians, due to take place in Geneva this week, it received a distinctly frosty response from Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky and his team of officials, who were also in Munich. Their view was that the US consistently made more demands of them than of the Russians, that further territorial concessions were out of the question, and that the prospect of elections in Ukraine – mooted last week – was barely on the drawing board.
Discussions, on and off the podium, at Munich, underlined not only the fitful and inconsistent nature of Mr Trump’s so far failed peace efforts on Ukraine, but also the extent of Europe’s exclusion, despite European leaders having made valiant attempts to be heard in the early months of Mr Trump’s second-term presidency. Now, once again, they find themselves on the outside, but with their solidarity weaker than it was, with divisions about how much support can be afforded for Ukraine and whether perhaps to open a channel to Moscow.
As so often, the European case was made most persuasively by Poland’s foreign minister, Radoslaw Sikorski. Now that Europe was effectively paying for Ukraine’s defence, he said, which includes funding weapons purchases from the United States, then the Europeans deserved a say in any talks and in what happens next. It is a position that is hard to argue with, but which could also come back to haunt the Europeans, who would be left with the sole responsibility, should Mr Trump decide to give up.
This makes the state of diplomacy at least as perilous for Ukraine as the increasingly difficult situation on the ground in Kyiv and elsewhere. Mr Zelensky sees the United States as essential to any peace, because he believes that it alone has the power to implement the security guarantees Ukraine needs. The growing detachment of the US administration from the whole process, however, was clear for all to see at the Munich conference, which is why the talks set to convene in Geneva are make-or-break as almost never before and not just for Ukraine, but for relations between the US and Europe.

FBI: DNA recovered from glove found near Guthrie home that appears to match glove worn by suspect

DNA pulled from glove found near Nancy Guthrie’s home as FBI believe it may belong to suspect seen in doorbell cam
Nancy Guthrie was last seen at her Arizona home on January 31
- Bookmark
The FBI said a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie’s Arizona home could match the gloves worn by an “armed” person seen in surveillance footage outside her front door the morning she disappeared, according to the Associated Press.
This comes after the FBI released new photos and videos from Guthrie’s doorbell camera of a suspect, who was wearing a ski mask and gloves, approaching her front door. Police said the man was armed and appeared to tamper with her camera.
The glove, which the agency said could match those worn by the suspect, has reportedly been sent off for DNA testing. While investigators have received the preliminary results, they’re still waiting on official confirmation, the AP reports.
The agency reportedly said about 16 gloves have been found near Guthrie’s home, most of which were later identified as gloves used by searchers that had been discarded.
Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie, was last seen at her home in the Catalina Foothills, a quiet community just outside of Tucson, Arizona, on January 31. She was reported missing the next day.
The masked individual seen at Nancy Guthrie’s front door has been described as a man with an average build who is between 5’9” and 5’10” tall. He was wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack, the FBI noted.
On Thursday, the FBI also announced a new reward of $100,000 for information “leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”
This comes after law enforcement officials carried out operations in the Tucson area Friday related to Guthrie’s disappearance.
Investigators searched a residence about two miles from Guthrie’s home Friday night, with a warrant that was “based on a lead,” a Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson said Saturday. No arrests were made.
Around the same time, officials conducted a separate traffic stop, also near Guthrie’s home. Investigators questioned an individual, but no arrests were made, the sheriff’s department spokesperson said.
The search for Guthrie is now entering its third week. Investigators “won’t quit” their efforts to find Guthrie, even if it takes years, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told The New York Times.
“Maybe it’s an hour from now,” Nanos said Friday. “Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy."
Her disappearance has sparked a massive search involving state and federal law enforcement agencies.
Guthrie relies on daily medication, and there could be “fatal” consequences if she doesn’t take it, Nanos has said. When she vanished, police also flagged that she has high blood pressure, a pacemaker and cardiac issues, according to a 911 dispatch audio.
Savannah Guthrie has said she believes her mother is still alive. The “Today” show anchor recently shared an old video of her mother on Instagram with the caption, “We will never give up on her.”
She also shared the footage of the masked man and asked for anyone with information to come forward. “Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home,” she wrote on Instagram.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said anyone with information should contact 1-800-CALL-FBI, 520-351-4900, 88-CRIME or visit tips.fbi.gov.

French justice minister blames ‘ultra-left’ for youth’s killing that shocked France
Quentin Deranque, aligned with far right, died from wounds after beaten Thursday while guarding protest of lawmaker from left-wing France Unbowed; party leader voices ‘shock,’ denies blame
The “ultra-left” in France was behind the fatal beating of a French youth aligned with the far right, Paris’s justice minister said on Sunday, after the killing inflamed political tension in the country ahead of elections.
Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin also accused hard-left politicians, including those from the France Unbowed party, the largest left-wing faction in parliament, of fueling violence with their language.
The victim, Quentin Deranque, aged 23, was hospitalized and placed into a coma on Thursday after being attacked in the southeastern city of Lyon. The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP that Deranque had died of his wounds.
Supporters said he had been providing security at a protest against an appearance by Rima Hassan, a member of the European Parliament for France Unbowed, when he was assaulted by a gang of rival activists.
Investigators are working on identifying the perpetrators, the prosecutors’ office said on Sunday. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter.
“It was clearly the ultra-left that killed him,” Darmanin told the Cologne-based RTL television.
“There are indeed speeches, particularly from France Unbowed and the ultra-left, which unfortunately lead to unbridled violence on social networks and then in the physical world,” he said.
“Words can kill,” Darmanin added, accusing Hassan and France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc Melenchon of “not having a word to say for the family of the young man.”
Later Sunday, Melenchon voiced his “shock” at the killing.
“We also send our empathy and compassion to his family and loved ones,” he said.
Melenchon, a three-time presidential candidate widely expected to run again in elections next year, added that his movement opposes violence, rejecting the blame placed on it as lacking “any connection with reality.”
Centrist President Emmanuel Macron has called for “calm” and “restraint.”
An alleged video of the attack broadcast by the French TF1 television shows a dozen people hitting three others lying on the ground, two of whom manage to escape.
“I heard shouts, people were hitting each other with iron bars and so forth. When I came to the scene, I saw individuals covered in blood,” a witness to the attack, who gave only the first name Adem, told AFP.
According to the Nemesis collective, which is associated with the far right, Quentin was providing security for its protesters and was assaulted by “anti-fascist” activists.
The family’s lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by “organized and trained individuals, vastly superior in number, and armed, some with their faces masked.”
The incident has further fueled tension between France’s far right and hard left ahead of municipal elections nationwide in March and the 2027 presidential race.
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027, despite a graft conviction, said on X that the “barbarians responsible for this lynching” should be brought to justice.
Demonstrations called by the far right in memory of Quentin took place in the southern city of Montpellier and Paris, where protesters unfurled a banner reading “Antifa murderers, justice for Quentin.”
The far right has pointed the finger at la Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth offshoot of France Unbowed.
But its founder, Raphael Arnault, a France Unbowed lawmaker, expressed his “horror” at the fatal beating, and the group denied involvement, saying it had “suspended all activities.”
France Unbowed lawmaker Eric Coquerel, speaking to Franceinfo, condemned “all political violence,” but said the activists responsible for Hassan’s security “were in no way involved in what happened.”
He pointed instead to a particular “context” in the southeastern city marked by violence from “far-right groups.”
At Saint George’s Church in Lyon, which the young man attended and where he volunteered for charities, priest Laurent Spriet called on Sunday for prayers “for the peace of Quentin’s soul.”
“Everything in its own time. Now is for compassion, for respect, for prayer, for letting the police and the justice system do their work,” he said.

MUNICH — European and American leaders spent three days pledging cooperation and offering to slap a new coat of paint on the façade of the transatlantic relationship. But the cracks are still showing.
The United States was less combative than a year ago in its showing at the Munich Security Conference, when Vice President JD Vance launched a scorching attack on Europe.
But the gathering showed that while the alliance continues to function, the old order that bound the two sides of the Atlantic for decades has broken down. There is no consensus on how the relationship can move forward given the regular seismic shocks the Trump administration revels in delivering to the system.

Immigration and taxes: Angus Taylor outlines agenda ahead of frontbench announcement

Opposition Leader Angus Taylor will soon unveil his overhauled frontbench as he signals a shift to the right with a focus on issues such as immigration.
The newly elected Liberal leader spent his first few days in the role sketching key priorities after ousting the party's first female leader, Sussan Ley, on Friday following weeks of infighting.
Policy announcements are expected to be accompanied by a refreshed frontbench, with exiled conservatives and leadership agitators Andrew Hastie and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price poised to return.
"They're magnificent members of our team," Taylor said on Sunday of the pair, whose previous frontbench stints ended due to migration-related issues.
While offering few details on his party's approach, Taylor promised to pursue a stricter immigration policy, repeatedly flagging plans to reduce the nation's migrant intake and tighten screening.
"The (migration) numbers under Labor have been just extraordinary — way beyond what this country can absorb," he said.
"Standards have been too low, numbers have been too high and we haven't explicitly shut the door on people who reject our way of life."
The Hume MP said he would unveil a full policy "in the coming days".
Taylor has insisted the Coalition is not trying to become "One Nation lite" as it bleeds voter support to the anti-immigration party.
The first poll since Taylor became Liberal leader, published by Nine newspapers on Monday, showed Labor with 32 per cent of the primary vote and One Nation and the Coalition tied on 23 per cent.
The Resolve poll of 1,800 people conducted between 8 February and 14 February found a Taylor-led Coalition three percentage points ahead of an Opposition led by Ley.
One Nation recorded primary support of 27 per cent in the latest Newspoll, conducted before Taylor toppled Ley as leader, with the Coalition on 18 per cent.
Former senior immigration official Abul Rizvi said Taylor's pointed tough-on-immigration stance could be directly influenced by One Nation's rise.
"He reads the polls as closely as anybody," Rizvi said.
However, he noted strong character requirements already existed for migrants looking to enter Australia and they had only been tightened by anti-hate crime laws introduced after the Bondi terror attack.
Taylor and deputy leader Jane Hume have also repeatedly vowed to offer lower taxes, a renewed focus on housing affordability and the end of an "ideological approach" to energy policies.
Hume said Australia needed to be "open-minded" on nuclear energy if the country was to reduce emissions and make power cheaper.

Heraskevych, Athletes for Peace plan to establish support fund for families of fallen Ukrainian athletes
The athlete told this to Ukrinform this on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Many people are probably asking: what comes next? Together, we are launching a fundraising campaign with a German organization for the families of athletes. Athletes for athletes. This is a wonderful initiative that will also help honor the memory of these remarkable individuals," Heraskevych said.
He clarified that he is not calling on Ukrainians to contribute, but rather appealing to international friends. Therefore, he is not sharing bank details for donations in Ukraine.
The goal is to establish a permanent fund to support the relatives of fallen athletes.
The athlete displayed a helmet featuring 24 portraits, but emphasized that the number of athletes who have been killed is far higher. This must be remembered, he said.
The helmet will remain in his possession for now, Heraskevych added, noting that he took part in events on the margins of the conference.
Athletes for Peace has publicly protested against Russia's war in Ukraine.
As Ukrinform previously reported, Heraskevych was disqualified ahead of his first run at the 2026 Winter Olympics. He had planned to compete wearing the "helmet of remembrance," but the race began without his participation. On the eve of the event, the International Olympic Committee barred him from competing with the commemorative helmet, citing non-compliance with the rules.
The disqualification of the Ukrainian athlete at the 2026 Olympics was widely condemned internationally.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the IOC's decision to disqualify the Ukrainian skeleton racer does not reflect adherence to the principles of Olympism, which are founded on fairness and the promotion of peace.
Zelensky later awarded Heraskevych the Order of Freedom.

IDF strikes Islamic Jihad terrorists near Lebanon-Syria border

The IDF said Sunday it carried out an airstrike against Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in the area of Majdal Anjar in Lebanon’s Bekaa Valley, near the Syrian border.
The military did not immediately identify the specific targets, but the strike was considered relatively unusual, as operations in Lebanon have largely focused on Hezbollah rather than Palestinian Islamic Jihad or Hamas.
Majdal Anjar is a predominantly Sunni town located about 33 kilometers from Metula, near the Syrian border. The area sits at a junction linking the Baalbek-Marjayoun road with the international highway connecting Beirut and Damascus. Due to its location, the town serves as a transit point for goods moving between Syria and Lebanon and onward to other Arab countries, and hosts numerous import-export businesses.
The strike came a day after the IDF targeted Hezbollah weapons depots and infrastructure in southern Lebanon. The Hezbollah-affiliated Al-Manar television channel reported at the time that fighter jets carried out a series of strikes in the village of Bouslaya, between Houmine al-Fawqa and Deir al-Zahrani, and in the Jabal al-Rihan area.
The IDF continued strikes against Hezbollah targets overnight, as part of ongoing efforts to thwart attempts by the terrorist organization to rebuild its capabilities. Operations have included fighter jet strikes, drone attacks on vehicles carrying terrorists, as well as artillery and machine gun fire.
Despite the continued military activity, there has been no significant diplomatic progress, and the situation along the northern front remains largely at a standstill pending broader regional developments, particularly involving Iran.
Even amid the stalemate, several upcoming meetings are expected to influence developments. The Lebanese government is scheduled to convene Monday, when Army Commander Rodolphe Haykal is expected to present an update on the army’s plan to consolidate weapons under state control.
According to recent reports, Haykal is set to outline the second phase of the plan, covering areas north of the Litani River. Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to areas south of the Litani. The terrorist organization maintains that the Lebanese government should instead focus on securing the withdrawal of remaining Israeli forces from southern Lebanon.

From Central Europe, Rubio Rejects NATO Exit Talk, Calls For Stronger European Role

BRATISLAVA -- Just one day after addressing the Munich Security Conference, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio used a brief stop in the Slovak capital to dispel fears of a US retreat from NATO, telling reporters that Washington remains firmly committed to the alliance.
Standing alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico on February 15, Rubio dismissed concerns triggered by recent US troop adjustments in Europe.
“We're not leaving NATO. We're not leaving.... We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case,” Rubio said, playing down speculation that redeployments signal a broader shift.
The number of US troops in Europe typically fluctuates between 80,000 and 100,000, depending on operations, training exercises, and rotational deployments. In fall 2025, the US announced that soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division, the majority of whom were deployed in Romania, would redeploy without being replaced.
Rubio also criticized what he described as alarmist interpretations of Washington’s call for higher European defense spending. “Every time we say this, people go crazy. They think that means you're going to abandon NATO, you're going to abandon your allies,” Rubio said, adding: “The point we're making is that the stronger our allies are, the stronger we are collectively.”
Instead of abandonment, Rubio framed his urging of European allies to spend more on defense as a recognition that NATO is more durable when its European members are more militarily capable.
“We are not threatened or feel that it's hostile to see NATO grow in its own capabilities, not independent of the United States, [but] in conjunction with the United States,” he said.
'We Want To Be Your Partner'
Rubio was explicit that Washington does not want Europe to remain dependent. “We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner,” he said.
This message echoed themes the secretary of state advanced a day earlier in Munich, where he combined pointed criticism of Europe’s internal trajectory with an affirmation that the United States and Europe share a common destiny. In that speech, he warned that Europe must reverse what he described as cultural and economic decline and regain control over mass migration, while reaffirming transatlantic unity.
In Bratislava, Rubio’s tone was more transactional than doctrinal. He portrayed Central Europe as a focal point for deeper US engagement, underscoring shared interests in defense and energy cooperation.
He also played down disagreements -- including Slovak criticism of a recent US operation in Venezuela -- as inevitable among sovereign nations.
“A lot of countries didn't like what we did in Venezuela. That's OK. That was in our national interest. I'm sure there's something he'll do one day that we don't like, and we'll say, hey, we didn't like what you did. So what? That doesn't mean we're not going to be friends,” Rubio said.
Rubio’s visit to Slovakia lasted only a few hours before he departed for Budapest, where on February 16 he is scheduled to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The sequence of appearances -- from Munich to Bratislava to Budapest -- underscores the dual thrust of Rubio’s diplomacy: reaffirming US commitment to NATO even as Washington presses Europe to become stronger and less dependent and deepening ties with key Central European governments seen as aligned with the administration’s approach to transatlantic relations.

Hollywood groups condemn ByteDance's AI video generator, claiming copyright infringement
A new artificial intelligence video generator from Beijing-based ByteDance, the creator of TikTok, is drawing the ire of Hollywood organizations
- Bookmark
A new artificial intelligence video generator from Beijing-based ByteDance, the creator of TikTok, is drawing the ire of Hollywood organizations that say Seedance 2.0 “blatantly” violates copyright and uses the likeness of actors and others without permission.
Seedance 2.0, which is only available in China for now, lets users generate high-quality AI videos using simple text prompts. The tool quickly gained condemnation from the movie and TV industry.
The Motion Picture Association said Seedance 2.0 “has engaged in unauthorized use of U.S. copyrighted works on a massive scale.”
“By launching a service that operates without meaningful safeguards against infringement, ByteDance is disregarding well-established copyright law that protects the rights of creators and underpins millions of American jobs. ByteDance should immediately cease its infringing activity,” Charles Rivkin, chairman and CEO of the MPA, said in a statement Tuesday.
Screenwriter Rhett Rheese, who wrote the “Deadpool” movies, said on X last week that “I hate to say it. It’s likely over for us.” His post was in response to Irish director Ruairí Robinson's post of a Seedance 2.0 video that shows AI versions Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt fighting in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
Actors union SAG-AFTRA said Friday it “stands with the studios in condemning the blatant infringement” enabled by Seedance 2.0.
“The infringement includes the unauthorized use of our members’ voices and likenesses. This is unacceptable and undercuts the ability of human talent to earn a livelihood,” SAG-AFTRA said in a statement. “Seedance 2.0 disregards law, ethics, industry standards and basic principles of consent. Responsible AI development demands responsibility, and that is nonexistent here."
ByteDance did not immediately respond to a message for comment Sunday.

Fast-spreading measles outbreak takes hold among under-10s in north London

A big measles outbreak in north-east London is affecting unvaccinated children under the age of 10, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has confirmed.
UKHSA previously reported 34 laboratory-confirmed measles cases among children who attend schools and nurseries in Enfield from 1 January to 9 February, with some requiring hospital treatment.
Measles is a highly infectious viral illness that can spread very easily among people who are not fully vaccinated. While many people recover, the illness can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation and, in rare cases, long-term disability or death.
Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: “Our latest data shows we are now seeing a big measles outbreak in north-east London, mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 in schools and nurseries, with some being hospitalised.
“Measles is a nasty illness for any child but for some it can lead to long-term complications and, tragically, death, but [it] is so easily preventable with two doses of the MMRV vaccine.” The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) was replaced by the MMRV with the addition of chickenpox (varicella) to the vaccination.
Saliba urged families to ensure their children have not missed any doses. She said: “With Easter holidays fast approaching, it is a timely reminder to families travelling overseas to ensure all family members, especially children, are vaccinated, as measles is widespread in some countries with close links to the UK and there are ongoing outbreaks in parts of Europe.”
Global health officials announced earlier this year that the UK was no longer considered to have eliminated measles after reporting almost 4,000 infections since 2024.
The outbreak comes amid declining uptake of the MMRV vaccine across the UK, with only about 84% of children receiving both doses by the age of five, well below the 95% level needed to prevent outbreaks.
Enfield has one of the lowest MMRV vaccine uptake rates in the country, according to UKHSA figures from last August, which showed just 64.3% of five-year-olds in the borough received both doses in 2024-25.
The Sunday Times reported that more than 60 suspected cases of measles had been reported by seven schools and a nursery in Enfield.
A message posted on the borough’s Ordnance Unity Centre for Health GP surgery website described a “fast-spreading measles outbreak”. It said: “During this recent outbreak, one in five children have been hospitalised due to measles and all of them had not been fully immunised.”
Alev Cazimoglu, Enfield council’s cabinet member for health and social care, said: “The current outbreak has mainly affected children and some have required additional care with a short stay in hospital. Measles is one of the most infectious known diseases. It is approximately six times more infectious than Covid-19.
“Catching the measles is entirely preventable, but it spreads extremely quickly where vaccination levels are low. By checking your family’s vaccination status and taking up the free NHS vaccine, you are protecting not only yourselves but also vulnerable members of our community.”
Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health, is writing to every parent in the area to try to contain the spread of the disease. Temporary vaccination centres have been established in schools across the borough in an effort to boost immunisation levels.
Sher-Arami told the Sunday Times the outbreak had the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” as people travel across the city for work and school.
She said average vaccination figures – which are low across the city – masked significant pockets of very low uptake, which created prime areas for measles to spread.
Modelling of a large measles outbreak in London by the UKHSA suggests between 40,000 and 160,000 people could become infected. Last July a child died from measles in Liverpool after a small outbreak there.
Since the start of the year there have been 96 confirmed cases of measles in England, three-quarters affecting children under 10. Enfield has had the highest numbers, followed by Birmingham.
There is no specific treatment for measles, only the vaccination to prevent catching it.
Although the vaccination has been proven to be safe and effective, now-debunked claims that the injection was linked to autism have persisted on social media and among some minority ethnic communities, contributing to vaccine hesitancy.
Measles spreads through coughs and sneezes and by touching contaminated surfaces, making it extremely easy to pass on in schools. Early symptoms include a high fever, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and red, watery eyes. A blotchy red-brown rash usually appears a few days later, starting on the face before spreading across the body.

Trump says Board of Peace will unveil $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting
US President Donald Trump said Sunday that members of his newly created Board of Peace have pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilization and police forces for the territory.
The pledges will be formally announced when board members gather in Washington on Thursday for their first meeting, he said.
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honor to serve as its Chairman", Trump said in a social media posting announcing the pledges.
He did not detail which member nations were making the pledges for reconstruction or would contribute personnel to the stabilization force.
But Indonesia’s military said Sunday that up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission.
It's the first firm commitment that the Republican president has received.
Rebuilding the Palestinian territory will be a daunting endeavor. The United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimate that reconstruction of the territory will cost $70 billion.
Few places in the Gaza Strip were left unscathed by more than two years of Israeli bombardment.
The ceasefire deal calls for an armed international stabilization force to keep security and ensure the disarming of the Palestinian group Hamas, a key demand of Israel. Thus far, few countries have expressed interest in taking part in the proposed force.
The 10 October US-brokered ceasefire deal attempted to halt a more than 2-year war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones.
It is not clear how many of the more than 20 members of the Board of Peace will attend the first meeting.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who held White House talks with Trump last week, is not expected to be there.
Trump’s new board was first seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.
But it has taken shape with his ambition for a far broader mandate of resolving global crises and appears to be the latest US effort to sidestep the United Nations as Trump aims to reset the post-World War II international order.
Many of America’s top allies in Europe and elsewhere have declined to join what they suspect may be an attempt to rival the Security Council.
Trump also confirmed that Thursday's meeting will take place at the US Institute of Peace, which the State Department announced in December it was remaining the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace.
The building is the subject of litigation brought by former employees and executives of the nonprofit think tank after the Republican administration seized the facility last year and fired almost all the institute’s staff.

Epstein survivor thought she was ‘going to die’ while being assaulted on pedophile’s private jet
Juliette Bryant said she had ‘no way of getting away’ once she arrived on Epstein’s island
- Bookmark
A woman who was trafficked to Jeffrey Esptein’s private island said she thought she was going to die when he sexually abused her on a flight to the Caribbean.
Juliette Bryant, 43, said she was raped repeatedly by the pedophile financier after being recruited in Cape Town, South Africa, in 2002, when she was at university and an aspiring model.
She told Sky News that she believed her “dreams were all coming true” when she was recruited by a group of women at the age of 22, believing she would be able to “make a difference” for her family and improve their financial situation by modelling.
Juliette said she had initially been flown to New York before being told she would be travelling to the Caribbean with Epstein.
She told how the women who recruited her were waiting at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey, where she boarded the private jet and was seated next to Epstein.
She said: “As the plane took off, he started forcibly touching me in between my legs, and I just freaked out and I suddenly realised - oh my God, my family aren't going to see me again, these people might kill me’.
“I got such a fright, it was such a huge changing thing for me.
“I suddenly realised I had to be nice and be friendly, because I realised I was in great danger.”
Juliette said the women who recruited her for Epstein laughed when she was sexually assaulted on the flight.
“They saw and they just laughed,” she said. “I was really, really petrified. It really changed me, the whole thing, going through this.
“I just didn’t know what to do and I really thought that I was going to die.”
Juliette said she had “no way of getting away” once she arrived on Epstein’s private island - Little St James in the US Virgin Islands.
“They had my passport and by then we had landed on one of the Caribbean islands and then were taken on a helicopter to his island,” she said.
“There was just no way of getting away. I'm not strong enough to swim away. I wouldn't be able to swim off there."
She told Sky News she took more flights to Epstein's homes in New York, Palm Beach, Paris and New Mexico.
She said she is still reckoning with the impact of his abuse.
"I look on Facebook, I see Epstein's face. I look on X, I see Epstein's face,” she said.
“I look at the news, there it is again. You know, there are times when it's made me feel physically ill, to be honest, it is just constantly there and there is no way of escaping it."
The US Justice Department has released millions of files related to the case of Epstein, shedding further light on his expansive network of high profile figures.
The latest release – expected to be the last – contains some three million pages, including 180,000 images and some 2,000 videos attached to the case. It brings the total to 3.5m documents released.
Epstein, who pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18 in 2008, died in New York in 2019 ahead of a pending trial.

Ukrainian ex-minister caught at border in $100M corruption case

ALBAWABA - As part of a large investigation into corruption in Ukraine's energy sector, the country's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) has arrested former Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko.
Halushchenko was arrested while trying to cross the border, according to an official statement released on Sunday. Officials said that the investigation is going on quickly and in accordance with the law.
The case is about a supposed $100 million bribery scheme inside Ukraine's state nuclear energy agency. Investigators say that the operation involved high-ranking officials and businesspeople, including a former close friend of President Volodymyr Zelensky.
A Bigger Political Problem
The arrest happens during the ongoing "Midas" scandal, a political crisis that started in November and has already caused some high-level officials to quit. In the past few months, Ukraine's ministers of justice and energy have quit because they were thought to be involved in corrupt activities.
Andriy Yermak, the head of the Presidential Office and a key player in Ukraine's negotiations over the war with Russia, also quit in late November after investigators searched his home.
Recently, the investigation has grown to include members of parliament, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, and a former presidential adviser on a number of charges.
Secret Investigation
NABU said that the current case is the result of a 15-month undercover operation. Tymur Mindych is at the center of the accusations. He is said to be a longtime friend and former business partner of President Zelensky.
According to investigators, Mindych ran a network that moved about $100 million through a so-called "back office" in Kyiv. They say he took advantage of the situation created by Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine.
In the last part of the investigation, anti-corruption officers worked together to raid places in Kyiv and other areas, taking cash and documents.
Pressure for Change
Fighting corruption is still one of Ukraine's most important reform goals, especially since the country wants to join the European Union. To join the EU, a country must show that it is making progress in the areas of accountability, transparency, and the rule of law.

Western, Arab nations slam ‘de facto annexation’ of West Bank as Israel presses ahead

The government on Sunday approved the launch of a land registration process in the West Bank for the first time since 1967, advancing measures that have drawn international criticism, including accusations of “de facto annexation.”
The proposal was submitted by Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Yariv Levin, Finance Minister and minister within the Defense Ministry Bezalel Smotrich, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
Under the decision, large areas in the West Bank defined as state land will be formally registered in the name of the state. The Justice Ministry’s Land Registration and Settlement of Rights Authority will be authorized to carry out the process and will receive dedicated funding and staffing.
A government statement said the move would allow for “transparent and thorough clarification of property rights,” help resolve legal disputes and enable regulated infrastructure development and land marketing. It described the decision as a response to what it called unlawful land registration efforts by the Palestinian Authority in Area C, which under interim agreements remains under full Israeli control.
The measure was among several approved by the security cabinet last week ahead of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. The decisions have prompted sharp reactions in Western capitals and across the Arab world.
The United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan criticized the move. Britain condemned it, and Germany said it amounted to “de facto annexation.”
Despite the backlash, the government has continued advancing the process.
Katz described the renewal of land registration as a necessary security and governance measure. “Regulating land prevents unilateral actions, reduces illegal takeover attempts and undermines terrorist infrastructure that destabilizes security,” he said, adding that the step would provide legal and operational certainty for the military and security establishment.
Smotrich said the decision marked a continuation of efforts to strengthen settlement and control throughout the territory. “For the first time since the Six-Day War, we are restoring order and governance in land management in Judea and Samaria,” he said, using the biblical term for the West Bank. He added that regulated land settlement would reduce disputes, create legal clarity and prevent unilateral steps.
Levin called the move “a real revolution in Judea and Samaria” and said the government is committed to deepening its hold on all parts of the land.
The 1997 Hebron Protocol, signed as part of interim agreements with the Palestinians, outlined arrangements for authority and control in parts of the West Bank. Critics argue the new measures contradict the spirit of those understandings.

Ukraine’s ex-energy minister arrested while trying to cross border
German Galushchenko was detained by Ukraine’s anti-corruption bureau while trying to leave the country.
Ukraine’s National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) says it has arrested the country’s former energy minister, German Galushchenko, who resigned in November amid a massive corruption scandal, as he tried to cross Ukraine’s border.
“Today, while crossing the state border, NABU detectives have detained the former Minister of Energy as part of the ‘Midas’ case,” the NABU said in a statement.

It did not name Galushchenko in its statement, but he served as the country’s energy minister last year and resigned in November.
“Initial investigative proceedings are ongoing, carried out in accordance with the requirements of the law and court sanctions. Details to follow,” the NABU added.
Galushchenko was one of several ministers who resigned in 2025 as the NABU unveiled an alleged money-laundering conspiracy in the country’s energy sector that investigators believe was orchestrated by an ally of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
According to Ukraine’s Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO), the alleged $100m scheme was orchestrated by businessman Timur Mindich.
SAPO’s investigators say Galushchenko helped Mindich manage illicit financial flows in the energy sector, while contractors working with Energoatom were forced to pay bribes of 10 to 15 percent to avoid losing contracts or facing payment delays.
Ukraine’s previous two energy ministers had resigned amid the fallout from the scandal, which also claimed the job of Zelenskyy’s chief of staff.
The two ministers and the chief of staff have all denied wrongdoing.
Battling corruption is a key priority in Ukraine’s reform effort as it eyes membership in the European Union, which requires the country to shake off a decades-old scourge of graft.
Authorities in recent weeks have targeted lawmakers, former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko and a former presidential adviser over various charges.

FT: Uber Eats to launch in Finland after Foodora exit

Uber Eats will enter the Finnish market this year, according to the Financial Times. The US platform will roll out its food delivery service in Finland as part of a wider European expansion that also covers Austria, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Greece, Romania and Norway.
The Financial Times reported that Finnish consumers will gain access to the service during 2026.
The move comes only days after rival Foodora said it will withdraw from Finland.
Foodora will continue deliveries until 27 February. After that date the service will cease operations in the country. Foodora said earlier that it had struggled to compete with market leader Wolt.
In comments to the Financial Times, Susan Anderson, Uber’s head of delivery for Europe, said the company looks forward to expanding into territories with established operators.
“We think it is time to raise the bar, shake things up and offer better value across the sector,” she told the newspaper.
The Financial Times reported that the expansion forms part of Uber’s plan to generate an additional one billion dollars in gross bookings over the next three years.
The newspaper said Uber Eats has increased its market share in large European economies including Germany, France and the United Kingdom.
Anderson attributed recent gains to Uber’s ability to market its delivery service to users of its ride-hailing platform and to promote its membership scheme.
Uber has operated its ride-hailing service in parts of Finland for several years.
Uber also plans to expand automated delivery using drones and robots, Anderson told the Financial Times.

India rout bitter rivals Pakistan at T20 World Cup
India’s win against Pakistan takes the defending champions through to the next round of the T20 World Cup.
Defending champions India have thumped Pakistan by 61 runs in a grudge Group A match at the Twenty20 World Cup in Colombo, Sri Lanka, to secure their place in the Super Eight stage of the cricket tournament.
Suryakumar Yadav’s side made 175-7 after a flying start from Ishan Kishan’s superb 77, before bowling Pakistan out for 114 in 18 overs.
The defeat on Sunday extended Pakistan’s dismal record against India in World Cups.
India have now won eight of the sides’ nine meetings at T20 World Cups, as well as all eight of their encounters at ODI World Cups.
The cricket teams of the nuclear-armed, contentious neighbours only face each other in multi-nation tournaments at neutral venues under a longstanding compromise arrangement.
It has been more than 18 years since India and Pakistan last met in a Test match, and 13 years since either side crossed the border to play a bilateral series.

Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey’: The Epstein ties that ended the run of Goldman Sachs’ top lawyer

Gifts and soup from ‘Uncle Jeffrey’: The Epstein ties that ended the run of Goldman Sachs’ top lawyer
Goldman Sachs general counsel Kathy Ruemmler has had a storied legal career. As a federal prosecutor, she helped successfully prosecute Enron executives including Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling. She was part of President Barack Obama’s administration, working in various roles for much of his two terms in office, including as White House Counsel.
She was even briefly considered by President Obama as a candidate for attorney general.
Ruemmler, 54, announced that she plans to resign from the top legal post at Goldman after a trove of emails and correspondence between her and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein showed the two individuals were especially close, years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction on sex crimes charges, when he became a registered sex offender.
Ruemmler previously played down her relationship with Epstein. She called him a “monster” and said she regretted ever knowing him. Ruemmler has repeatedly described their relationship as professional, citing her job as a private defence attorney before she ever joined Goldman Sachs.
But documents made public in recent weeks and reviewed by The Associated Press depict a deeper relationship than had previously been characterised by Ruemmler and Goldman Sachs. These included intimate email exchanges, social plans and gifts that went beyond formal legal work.
About 8400 documents involved Ruemmler or referenced her. Some correspondence shows Ruemmler was aware of the extent of the allegations that Epstein had faced involving underage girls in Florida. In some instances, she advised Epstein on how he might go about trying to repair his image and defend himself publicly against new claims of misconduct.
The gifts Epstein gave to Ruemmler have been documented in news reports: the spa treatments, the handbags from Hermes, an Apple Watch, a Fendi coat, among many others. But some of the interactions between Epstein and Ruemmler described throughout their correspondence indicate that Epstein and Ruemmler did not simply have a lawyer-client transactional relationship, as Ruemmler previously attested to.
“It makes him happy to see you happy,” Epstein’s assistant wrote to Ruemmler in 2016, after Epstein prepaid for a spa treatment for her.
In October 2018, Epstein directed one of his assistants to send flowers and chicken soup to Ruemmler because she has “not been feeling well”. It would not be the first time that Epstein would send her a small token of appreciation when she was sick. They talked about dating issues, made jokes about both the wealthy and everyday people, and shared laments about their careers and dating lives.
They would message each other about mundane things such as their mutual distaste for seeing babies in business class on flights and would repeatedly plan to have dinner or drinks in various places. Epstein even had Ruemmler as a backup executor of his will at one point.
Setting aside the immense wealth and privilege and Epstein’s legal troubles, many of the emails between the two would look no different from the banter that many Americans would share in their own text messages, emails or group chats.
“Well, I adore him. It’s like having another older brother!” she wrote in an email in 2015.
During her time in private practice after she left the White House in 2014, Ruemmler received several expensive gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat. The gifts were given after Epstein had already been convicted of sex crimes in 2008 and was registered as a sex offender. Ruemmler was also involved in Epstein’s legal defence efforts after he was arrested a second time for sex crimes in 2019 and later killed himself in a Manhattan jail.
“So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.
She later joined Goldman Sachs in 2020 and became the investment bank’s top lawyer in 2021.
The firm’s leadership backed her publicly amid the revelations. But the embarrassing emails raised questions about Ruemmler’s judgment. Historically, Wall Street frowns on gift-giving between clients and bankers or Wall Street lawyers, particularly high-end gifts that could pose a conflict of interest. Goldman Sachs requires its employees to get pre-approval before receiving gifts from or giving them to clients, according to the company’s code of conduct, partly in order not to run afoul of anti-bribery laws.
Bloomberg News, The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Goldman’s partners, who are the firm’s most senior and well-regarded members going back to when the investment bank was privately held, had begun to question why the firm was holding Ruemmler in such high regard when other lawyers were just as qualified to hold the top legal job.
In her statement, Ruemmler said: “Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm’s legal, reputational and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do. My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’ interests first.”
Goldman chief executive David Solomon said he respected Ruemmler’s decision to resign. The firm isn’t rushing Ruemmler out the door, and said in a statement that she would wind down her work at the bank “to ensure a smooth transition”, before her last day on June 30.

Cabinet OKs new West Bank land registration process, critics decry ‘de-facto annexation’
An initial NIS 244 million is allocated for land registration for years 2026-2030, process could take 30 years. Levin, Smotrich laud ‘deepening grip’ on West Bank
Jeremy Sharon is The Times of Israel’s legal affairs and settlements reporter
The cabinet authorized on Sunday the opening of a land registration process in the West Bank for the first time since 1967, with the ministers who initiated the measure saying it would enable the registration of broad swaths of land as state land available for Israeli development.
The resolution authorized an initial budget of NIS 244 million ($79 million) for the land registration process in the years 2026 to 2030 in Area C of the West Bank, where Israel has full military and civilian control, and the establishment of 35 positions in various ministries and state agencies to conduct the registration work.
The explanatory text of the resolution noted, however, that the registration process will be lengthy and take at least a year and a half for every plot of land, if not more, and that registering all non-registered land in Area C could take up to 30 years.
The process of establishing the registration mechanisms could itself take a year and a half, the resolution stated, but nevertheless set a goal of registering 15 percent of the unregistered land within five years.
The Palestinian presidency condemned the step, saying it constitutes “a de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity.”
Jordan’s Foreign Ministry, in a statement, called on the international community to “assume its legal and moral responsibilities, and to compel Israel, the occupying power, to stop its dangerous escalation.”
Defense Minister Israel Katz, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, and Justice Minister Yariv Levin lauded the decision, saying it will create legal certainty in the territory and protect the national interest.
The cabinet decision follows a controversial decision by the security cabinet last week that expanded Israeli oversight and enforcement activities into areas A and B of the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority has military or civilian control, and enabled private Israeli citizens to buy land in the territory, something not previously possible.
Up until 1967, only about one-third of all land in the West Bank was formally registered in land registration processes conducted during the period of the British Mandate and then under Jordanian control from 1949 to 1967.
Israel halted that process in 1968, a year after it captured the West Bank, and it has never resumed until now.
The new registration process will only take place in Area C, which constitutes some 60% of the entire territory and where, like the rest of the West Bank, some two-thirds of the land is not formally registered.
The Oslo Accords Israel and the PA signed in the 1990s placed Area C under Israeli security and administrative control, but they stated that the territory should be gradually transferred to Palestinian jurisdiction.
While stopping short of formally annexing the entire territory amid opposition from US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government has passed a slew of measures aimed at cementing Israel’s control over Area C — along with other parts of the West Bank.
The terms of the cabinet resolution initiated by the defense, finance, and justice ministers instructed the commander of the IDF’s Central Command — the de facto military governor of the West Bank — to authorize the Land Registry department in the Justice Ministry to carry out the land registration process. The Land Registry will establish a land settlement directorate to conduct the work.
Along with the initial budget of NIS 244 million for the next four years, 35 new positions will be created in the Justice Ministry, the Survey of Israel mapping agency, the Defense Ministry, and its Civil Administration department to carry out the work.
“This matter is consistent with the needs of the area, particularly in light of the passage of time and the uncertainty that has arisen with respect to some locations, while respecting local law to the extent possible,” the resolution stated.
It also said that the process came to counter a similar land registration process being conducted by the Palestinian Authority, including in Area C, which it said the PA was barred from carrying out under the terms of agreements signed with Israel.
The Peace Now and Yesh Din organizations, which campaign against the settlement movement, denounced the decision, saying it was another step in Israel’s de facto annexation of the West Bank, with the former appealing directly to US President Donald Trump to halt the move.
A source in Peace Now said that although in theory there could be a fair and objective land registration process for all parties in the West Bank, it would be very hard under current conditions and regulations for Palestinians to prove and assert their ownership claims.
The source said this shift would likely lead to the declaration of hundreds of thousands of dunams of land in the territory as state land, meaning it will be available to Israel for the development of settlements, infrastructure, and transportation.
While state land is supposed to be managed for the benefit of all civilians, Israel makes it available almost exclusively for settlers.
“The government has approved a massive land grab in the West Bank on the way to de facto annexation, in complete contradiction to the will of the people and the Israeli interest,” Peace Now said, in response to the decision.
“We are warning President Trump — Netanyahu is deceiving you. You said you would not allow annexation, but he is annexing right under your nose.”
Trump has said on several occasions, including last week, that he opposes the annexation of the West Bank by Israel, but organizations opposed to Israeli control of the territory have said that his position ignores measures taken by the current government that are de facto tightening Israeli control over the West Bank.
The cabinet ministers who initiated the new land registry process extolled the cabinet decision.
“The resolution constitutes a real revolution in Judea and Samaria,” said Justice Minister Levin, using the biblical term for the West Bank. “The Land of Israel belongs to the people of Israel. The Israeli government is committed to deepening its grip on all parts [of the land], and this decision is an expression of that commitment.”
Smotrich, the finance minister, said the measure was “continuing the revolution of settlement and the grip on all parts of our country,” and claimed the new land registration process would “prevent conflict, create legal certainty… and enable legal and responsible development” in the West Bank.

Poland should develop its own nuclear defences amid growing threat from Russia, says president
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WARSAW - Poland should look at developing its own nuclear weapons in light of the growing threat from Russia
“I am a big supporter of Poland joining a nuclear project,” Mr Nawrocki said in the interview, adding that he cannot say if or when Poland will start work aimed towards having its own nuclear weapons.
“We are a country right on the border of an armed conflict, and we know what the attitude of the aggressive, imperial Russian Federation toward Poland is,” Mr Nawrocki added.
Mr Nawrocki’s comments come after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said at the Munich Security Conference that he’s in talks with France over potential European nuclear defence. Mr Merz made a call to reorder the transatlantic relationship amid the turmoil of US President Donald Trump’s second term.
Mr Nawrocki said in the Polsat News interview that Poland should follow the path toward developing its own nuclear potential, with respect for all international regulations.
When asked if the US would allow Poland to take this direction, as Warsaw is a signatory of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, Mr Nawrocki said “I don’t know this, but we need to act in a direction so that we can start the work.”
Warsaw signed a treaty with France in 2025, which Prime Minister Donald Tusk said will open the way toward Poland potentially sharing protection from French nuclear missiles.
In September, more than 20 drones crossed Poland’s territory during a Russian airstrike on neighbouring Ukraine
Mr Nawrocki said it is too early for him to say if he would sign into law a draft that would streamline the SAFE funds in Poland. BLOOMBERG

Nate Bargatze considered squeezing a big, dumb joke into his command for drivers to start their engines at the Daytona 500.
“At first, I thought about doing like, how many feet are in 500 miles,” Bargatze said. “Nobody knows.”
Bargatze laughed when he said the proposed joke, which is a riff on his popular “Washington’s Dream” sketches on “Saturday Night Live," fell flat when he tested it Saturday night during a gig in Indianapolis.
“I was going to do another one with Jimmie Johnson being older to let the younger drivers know that his left blinker will be on the whole race,” Bargatze said. “Then when I got here and talked about it, it’s like, I think you just need to do, normal? You have all these hopes and dreams to do something funny.”
Bargatze kept it straight in his role as grand marshal for Sunday’s Daytona 500.
“It's going to be insanity,” Bargatze said. “It's been a dream to be asked to do this.”
Bargatze's day at Daytona — where he mingled with drivers such as Denny Hamlin — is just the latest dream job for one of the most popular stand-ups currently working. He hosted the Emmy Awards, released three Netflix specials and just won a Best Comedy Album Grammy Award for “Your Friend, Nate Bargatze."
His “Big Dumb Eyes World Tour” set a record for biggest one-year gross by a comedy performer in history and has set more than 40 arena attendance records.
They served as warm-up acts for his first starring role in a movie, “The Breadwinner.” Bargatze co-wrote the script for the film he said was influenced by his stand-up and old-school funny, family movies such as “Mr. Mom” and “Home Alone.”
“You want it to be broad, the whole family can come,” Bargatze said. “It's like what I do with stand-up, you kind of just want everybody to come.”
Mandy Moore plays Bargatze's wife in the comedy, which also includes Colin Jost and Will Forte and opens May 29.
“Obviously overwhelming,” Bargatze said. “I don’t know how to act. Learning that on the fly was a good time.”
The 46-year-old Bargatze resumes his stand-up tour this week in Rockford, Illinois, and he's set to host the ABC game show, “The Greatest Average American.”
The title seemed fitting when Bargatze was gifted one of only 500 specialty Daytona 500 hats. The hat was numbered 302. Average.
“It's not bragging,” Bargatze said. “I'm right in the middle. That's where the average American would be. It's humility. It's how you go.”

UK’s top prosecutor says ‘nobody above law’ as detectives investigate Andrew’s Epstein links

The UK’s top prosecutor has said “nobody is above the law” amid growing pressure on police to fully investigate Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor’s links with Jeffrey Epstein.
Thames Valley police said earlier this week they were in discussion with the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations of misconduct in public office against the former prince.
Stephen Parkinson, the director of public prosecutions, told the Sunday Times: “It’s my job to enforce the law and I do so without fear or favour, and that is unaffected by the status of the individual concerned.”
Parkinson said he had “total confidence” that detectives would examine any relevant evidence that might point to criminality. “From my perspective, I don’t find it a difficult offence to prosecute because the core of it is a gross breach of trust by someone performing the function of a public officer,” he said.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct while UK trade envoy between 2001 and 2011 has come under scrutiny after emails released in the Epstein files suggested he shared confidential information with the convicted sex offender.
Emails have shown how David Stern, a business associate and friend of Mountbatten-Windsor, was in regular contact with Epstein and accompanied the former prince on his publicly funded visits to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shenzhen in the autumn of 2010.
It has been revealed that Stern would organise meetings for Mountbatten-Windsor based on Epstein’s suggestions.
This taxpayer-funded trip occurred just a few months before Mountbatten-Windsor met Epstein in New York in December 2010, which the disgraced royal previously claimed marked the end of their relationship.
Now evidence compiled by the Mail on Sunday has revealed how Mountbatten-Windsor used his government role to further Epstein’s business interests.
He reportedly leaked sensitive information about the Royal Bank of Scotland after it was bailed out by the government, and a senior palace aide is said to have leaked an official diplomatic cable about UK-China trade relations to a banker who was the former prince’s friend and business associate.
Another email shows how Epstein arranged for Mountbatten-Windsor to have dinner at a five-star hotel in Beijing with Jes Staley, a senior banker who was later exposed as the disgraced financier’s personal banker.
The newspaper also reported that Stern plotted with Epstein to do “discreet” deals with the Chinese government after Mountbatten-Windsor’s 2010 trade mission.
Epstein boasted about getting intelligence from Mountbatten-Windsor and Peter Mandelson, saying in an email: “I’ve got the UK sewn up.”
New photos show the former prince socialising with a Chinese model at a dinner in Beijing during the official trip where he was supposed to be representing the UK as trade envoy.
According to the Epstein files, Stern advised Epstein to illegally hide his child sexual abuse conviction to obtain a visa to China after the disgraced financier’s initial application was rejected.
The former prime minister Gordon Brown has called for a full police investigation. “In the past week, I have delved deep into the Epstein files to discover the extent of Mandelson and Epstein’s betrayal of Britain during the global financial crisis,” he wrote in the New Statesman.
“What I discovered about the abuse of women by male predators and their enablers – and Britain’s as yet unacknowledged role – has shocked me to the core. It demands an in-depth police investigation, and is by far the biggest scandal of all.”
Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader, has also said the police should check whether criminal corruption took place while Mountbatten-Windsor was trade envoy. Cable, who was business secretary for some of that period, said the former prince’s alleged behaviour was “totally unacceptable”.
“We need a police or DPP [director of public prosecutions] check on whether criminal corruption took place and a government investigation into how this was allowed to happen,” he said.
Thames Valley police previously said they were reviewing allegations that Epstein provided Mountbatten-Windsor with a woman to have sex with at Royal Lodge in 2010, as well as the allegations of misconduct in public office.
Mountbatten-Windsor, who served as the UK’s special representative for trade and investment between 2001 and 2011, has always denied any wrongdoing.

Starmer facing calls for inquiry over Labour think tank’s investigation into journalists
Labour Together, which helped the prime minister’s election to become party leader, reportedly paid £36,000 for the probe
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Sir Keir Starmer is facing calls to order an inquiry into a Labour think tank’s investigation into journalists as he struggles to move on from the woes facing his premiership.
Foreign Office minister Stephen Doughty said it would be “only right” to have a probe into Labour Together, which helped Sir Keir win the Labour leadership.
The calls heap pressure on government minister Josh Simons, who commissioned the 2023 report on reporters investigating the group’s funding.
The Sunday Times reported that the contents of an investigation by PR consultancy Apco were informally shared with Labour figures in 2024, including current cabinet ministers and special advisers. Apco was paid £36,000 to carry out the investigation in 2023.
The paper said it contained pages of “deeply personal and false claims” about one of the journalists, Gabriel Pogrund. It also discussed his Jewish background and included false claims about personal and professional relationships. It was also reported to have made “baseless claims” that the emails underpinning the journalists’ story were likely to have come from a hack of the Electoral Commission, suspected to have been carried out by the Kremlin .
The Conservative Party has written to Labour Party chair Anna Turley, urging her to investigate Mr Simons’s role in the decision to hire Apco.
It also urged Labour to investigate the role of other Labour Together directors, who include “serving cabinet ministers”, and to set out whether the party still considers it appropriate for Labour MPs to receive cash from the think tank.
The Labour Party should suspend all engagement with Labour Together “until all allegations have been independently investigated”, the Tories said.
The letter, from Tory chair Kevin Hollinrake, concluded: “Once again, the government is distracted from the serious challenges facing our country.
“The public deserve the full, unredacted facts about this latest scandal to engulf the top of the Labour Party. Nothing less will suffice.”
In a statement, Mr Hollinrake said: “Labour Together’s behaviour shows a worrying contempt for the free press, a fundamental foundation of our democracy.
“With its close and widely known links to the heart of government, serious questions must be answered about who was aware of these actions, including whether senior figures around the prime minister knew.
“After Starmer’s attempts to deflect from the Mandelson-Epstein affair, the public will accept nothing less than full transparency.”
Mr Simons was an ally of Morgan McSweeney, who previously ran Labour Together and who resigned from No 10 last week as the Mandelson scandal engulfed Downing Street. Mr Simons told the paper he said he had asked for information to be removed before passing the report to the intelligence agency GCHQ. No other British journalists were investigated as part of any document he or Labour Together ever received, he also said.
John McDonnell, Labour’s former chancellor, has called for an independent inquiry into the affair.
He said it was clear to him as ”secretary of the NUJ’s parliamentary group if true this is unacceptable”.
Another Labour MP, Karl Turner, called on the prime minister himself to look at the issue and said he should meet Mr McDonnell “to discuss” it.
Nadhim Zahawi, the former Conservative chancellor who has since defected to Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, led demands for Sir Keir to reveal what he knew of the investigation.
He said: “This is a huge story. If this was any other party, the calls for an investigation would be deafening..”
Mr Doughty told Times Radio: “It's only right that if there is an investigation, that's able to run its course, and that we understand what happened. I want to see a country where journalists are able to do their job without fear or favour.”

No clear path to ending the partial government shutdown as lawmakers dig in over DHS oversight
No clear path to ending the partial government shutdown as lawmakers dig in over DHS oversight
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Lawmakers and the White House offered no signs of compromise Sunday in their battle over oversight of federal immigration officers that has led to a pause in funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
A partial government shutdown began Saturday after congressional Democrats and President Donald Trump’s team failed to reach a deal on legislation to fund the department through September. Democrats are demanding changes to how immigration operations are conducted after the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis last month.
Congress is on recess until Feb. 23, and both sides appear dug into their positions. The impasse affects agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, the Secret Service, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
The work at ICE and CBP goes on unabated because Trump’s tax and spending cut law from 2025 provided billions more to those agencies that can be tapped for deportation operations. About 90% of DHS employees were to continue working during the shutdown, but do so without pay — and missed paychecks could mean financial hardships. Last year there was a record 43-day government shutdown.
White House border czar Tom Homan said the administration was unwilling to agree to Democrats’ demands that federal officers clearly identify themselves, remove masks during operations and display unique ID numbers.
“I don’t like the masks, either,” Homan said, But, he said, “These men and women have to protect themselves.”
Democrats also want to require immigration agents to wear body cameras and mandate judicial warrants for arrests on private property.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats are only asking for federal agents to abide by rules followed by law enforcement agencies around the country.
“And the question that Americans are asking is, ‘Why aren’t Republicans going along with these commonsense proposals?’” Schumer said. “They’re not crazy. They’re not way out. They’re what every police department in America does.”
Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said he could back Democrats calls to equip immigration officers with body cameras and would support efforts to bolster training. But he balked at their demands that federal officers remove masks and clearly identify themselves, noting some officers taking part in immigration enforcement operations have faced doxing and other harassment.
“What are you going to do, expose their faces so you can intimidate their families?” Mullins said. “What we want is ICE to be able to do their job. And we would love for local law enforcement and for states to cooperate with us.”
Republican Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama, a Trump ally who had pushed for a two-week extension of DHS funding while negotiations continued, said it was “shortsighted of Democrats to walk away” from talks.
Trump made enforcement of the nation’s immigration laws a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign for the White House and he promised to be aggressive in detaining and deporting people living in the United States without legal permission.
DHS reports it has deported more than 675,000 migrants since Trump’s return to office last year and claims some 2.2 million others have “self-deported” as the Republican president has made his immigration crackdown a priority.
“President Trump is not going to back away from the mission, the mission that American people said they wanted him to complete, and that is securing our border and making sure that we actually do interior enforcement,” Britt said.
Homan was on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Schumer and Mullin appeared on CNN’s “State of the Union” and Britt was interviewed on “Fox News Sunday.”

'The Jewish Journey Through Loss': Combining halacha and psychology in order to heal - review
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

04:21:18 KST

There are books that explain the halachot of mourning. There are books that explain the psychology of grief. Until now, these have been two separate shelves.
Dr. Batya Ludman and Gina Junger noticed that gap years ago and set out to bridge it. Their new book, The Jewish Journey Through Loss, published by Maggid Books under Koren Publishers Jerusalem, brings together what has too long been kept apart: the wisdom of Torah and the insights of psychology, working side by side to help mourners heal.
Ludman is a clinical psychologist who has practiced in Israel for decades. She grew up watching her parents serve on the chevra kadisha, and later joined it herself. Junger is a Jewish educator whose students, young and old, continue to shape her teaching. The two became chavrutot on the subject of death and grief, and their husbands marveled at how they could talk about it for hours. “With my psychological background and her perfect blend of Jewish understanding,” Ludman writes in the acknowledgments, “we seemed to complete each other’s ideas as well as sentences and make the sum of one and one so much greater than two.”
That partnership shows on every page. The book walks through the stages of mourning from illness through death, shiva, shloshim, the first year, and beyond. But it does not read like a Halacha guide or a psychology textbook. It reads like a long conversation between two people who have thought deeply about loss and want to share what they have learned.
Judaism's therapeutic approach to mourning
The central insight of the book is that the structure of Jewish mourning is itself therapeutic. “One of the most beautiful aspects of Judaism’s approach to death is its focus on ritual,” the authors write. “This prescribed structure, filled with incredible wisdom, lovingly embraces the mourner, moving you forward, step by step, through your pain.” Shiva keeps the mourner home and surrounded by community during the first shock of loss. Shloshim begins to ease them back into the world. The year of aveilus allows grief to settle gradually. This is not news to anyone who has sat shiva, but the authors make the connection explicit: The Halacha moves at the pace a person can absorb. It is not arbitrary. It is wise.
What sets this book apart is its attention to what mourners actually feel. The authors describe the guilt that surfaces unexpectedly, the exhaustion of telling the same story to every visitor, the moment months later when a smell or a song brings grief rushing back. They write about the disorientation of the first days, when everything you know has been turned upside down, and the Halacha gives you something to hold onto. They write about the strange relief some mourners feel, and the guilt that follows the relief. They write about anger at Hashem, and about the silence that sometimes says more than words.
The book is filled with vignettes drawn from the authors’ own lives and from the families they have worked with. A teenager who walks out of the room rather than hear the news about his mother. A young woman who never knows how to answer when someone asks how many siblings she has, because she lost a brother. A mourner who describes grief as a closet you learn to open and close, and over time, it becomes a little easier. These are not case studies. They are moments of recognition. Reading them, you think: ”Yes, that is what it is like.”
There are chapters on different kinds of loss. Losing a parent. Losing a spouse. Losing a child. Losing a sibling. Each one carries its own weight. The authors quote a teaching that with the death of a spouse, you lose your present; with the death of a parent; you lose your past; and with the death of a child, you lose your future. They do not rush past these distinctions. They sit with them.
There are also chapters on harder topics. Suicide. What to tell children. The isolation of mourning during COVID, when shiva happened on Zoom and the community could not walk through the door. And there is a chapter on grief after terrorism, written before Oct. 7 and then revised after the war began. One of the dedication pages memorializes David Schwartz, killed in battle on 27 Tevet 5784 defending Am Yisrael. The authors live in Israel and have watched their community absorb loss after loss. “Then along came COVID-19,” Ludman writes, “followed by the multiple losses experienced during and after a horrific war, and we suddenly had infinitely more we needed to say.”
That sentence captures something important about the book. It was not written from a distance. It was written from inside the experience, by two women who have accompanied mourners through the hardest days of their lives and who have faced loss themselves. Ludman thanks her patients “who allowed me to accompany them on their journey in both life and death, through loss and through healing.” Junger prays that the book will be “a tool for people to find comfort in their grief.” You can feel that intention throughout.
The tone of the book is warm and honest. The authors do not pretend to have all the answers. “We ask for your forgiveness,” they write, “if we don’t always anticipate correctly just how you may be feeling.” They know that grief is not predictable, that what helps one person may not help another, that feelings change quickly and without warning. They are not trying to fix anyone. They are trying to walk alongside.
For those who make shiva calls, the book offers practical wisdom. It explains why the Halacha tells us to wait for the mourner to speak first, and why presence often matters more than words. It describes what mourners wish visitors understood, and what well-meaning people sometimes get wrong. Reading those sections, I thought of visits I have made and wondered if I had helped or just added to the exhaustion.
For those who are grieving, the book offers something harder to name. Companionship, maybe. The sense that someone understands what you are going through, even the parts you have not said out loud. “While we are unable to take away your pain,” the authors write, “we sincerely hope that through this book we will ‘walk’ alongside you as you take your journey forward into the land of healing.”
The book also speaks to those who have not yet experienced major loss but want to be prepared. Ludman and Junger compare it to expecting a baby. You read books, you talk to friends, you think you know what to expect, but when it happens you discover how much you did not anticipate. Grief is similar. No one is fully ready. But some preparation helps.
One line near the end of the book stayed with me. “We don’t have a choice over the package that we each are given in life,” the authors write, “but we do have a choice as to what we do with that package.” That is the question the book keeps circling back to. Loss is not optional. But how we carry it, how we make meaning from it, how we let it shape us or not, those are choices. The Halacha provides a framework. The rest is up to us.
I finished the book thinking about the two women who wrote it. A psychologist and an educator. A chavruta that became a partnership. Two voices woven together so closely that you cannot always tell where one ends and the other begins. They set out to bridge the gap between the psychological and the halachic, and they succeeded. The result is a book that feels both deeply Jewish and deeply human.
It is not a book you want to need. But when you need it, you will be grateful it exists.

Trump told Netanyahu he would support Israeli strikes on Iran's missile program, CBS reports

United States President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during their meeting in Florida in December that he would support Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program if the US and Iran could not reach a deal, CBS News reported on Sunday, citing two sources familiar with the matter.
According to the report, renewed internal discussions among US military and intelligence officials are focused on how the US would help Israeli forces in the case Israel conducted a new round of strikes against the Iranian regime.
Examples of US assistance could include providing the IDF with aerial refueling or securing airspace permissions from countries along the potential route aircraft would take to strike, CBS cited two additional US officials as saying.
Thus far, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have explicitly stated that they would not permit the use of their airspace for strikes.
US moving military assets close to Iran
The internal talks come as the US is actively moving military assets to the region.
The USS Gerald R. Ford, a US aircraft carrier, and its accompanying fleet of warships are being redeployed from the Caribbean to the Middle East, four US officials confirmed to CBS, in a move that “would place formidable firepower within range of Iran.”
Further US-Iran negotiations on a possible deal are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday.

Gov't approves new international airport in Israel's South, amid Ben-Gurion congestion concerns

The government approved the establishment of a new international airport in southern Israel on Sunday, designating the Ziklag area in the Negev as its location.
This new airport in the South will be developed alongside an additional international airport in northern Ramat David. The government cited the main factor behind the development of the two new airports as growing congestion at Ben-Gurion Airport. It also said that the new airports would encourage economic growth in the country’s peripheral areas.
The government’s decision calls for accelerating planning of the airport in the South to match the pace of the progressing airport in the North, so the two can be developed simultaneously.
According to the proposal, the existing Ben-Gurion Airport in central Israel is approaching its maximum capacity of approximately 40 million passengers per year.
Without additional international civilian airports, the government said, Israel faces a serious risk of an aviation crisis. This would lead to a shortage of available flights relative to demand and potential pressure to increase ticket prices.
The government underscored the importance of advancing both the northern and southern airports in parallel. It added that the development of both air hubs would enable balanced economic growth across the North and South, creating numerous jobs in those areas.
Strategic importance
Further, the government noted the airports’ strategic importance in emergency scenarios, citing lessons learned during the war and Operation Rising Lion against Iran in June.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the move was part of a broader national vision.
“This is part of our vision, a real vision for developing and settling the Negev and eliminating the periphery,” Netanyahu remarked at the government meeting.
“I have always said, ‘Government infrastructure combined with private initiative.’ This is the classic connection in the case of this enormous anchor project.”
“Only in this way will we be able to provide a real response to the growing demand from tourists and the air traffic of many millions who arrive in Israel each year, and many more who will arrive, as well as Israeli citizens who travel abroad,” he added.
Transportation Minister Miri Regev (Likud) said Israel must already prepare for the heavy congestion expected at Ben-Gurion Airport until the additional airports are operational.
“Establishing two complementary international airports is an urgent national, economic, and security necessity,” she said.
Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (Religious Zionist Party) echoed Regev’s remarks, adding that the state would allocate the necessary resources to execute both projects in the South and the North.
Ahead of Sunday’s decision, protesters demonstrated in northern Israel against the advancement of the airport in Ramat David. Demonstrators expressed concern that the plan could ultimately result in the construction of an international airport in the northern Jezreel Valley.
They argued such a move would severely harm vital agricultural land, Israel’s food security, the environment, agriculture, and public health. Protest leaders instead called on the government to develop the airport only in southern Israel.
The government’s decision on Sunday finalized the southern airport’s location in the Ziklag area rather than Nevatim, which had initially been considered.
Although the Ziklag site had previously been considered, it was originally rejected due to its proximity to Gaza-area flight paths frequently used by the Israel Air Force. Officials had raised concerns about its closeness to the Gaza border and potential security risks.
However, the defense establishment ultimately concluded that the risk was not substantial enough to halt the project.
Aviation industry sources have reported that the site could still pose logistical challenges, including potential strain on Israel’s air traffic control networks.

4 key insights from Munich Security Conference

04:21:00 KST

The United States strikes a reassuring tone; Europeans pledge stronger defenses while the Ukraine war grinds on and China makes bold promises.
At the Munich Security Conference, which wound up pm Sunday, AFP spoke to Rachel Ellehuus, director general of British defence think-tank the Royal United Services Institute, about her key takeaways.
A year after U.S. Vice President JD Vance stunned the MSC by attacking Europeans on democracy and civil rights, Donald Trump sent more moderate members, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby.
"There was a deliberate attempt this year to send so-called grown-ups," Ellehuus said.
Both "signalled that they see Europe as a partner, that the U.S. believes that NATO is good for the U.S. and they want to make this partnership work", she said.
She said Colby delivered a "very direct" message: "The United States has many responsibilities, the Europeans are quite wealthy, and it is time for Europe to take the lead in conventional defence operations within NATO."
Nevertheless, trust has been lost and Nordic leaders worry about Trump's designs on Denmark's autonomous territory of Greenland and fear "there could be other surprises".
She also expressed worry about Colby's use of the term "flexible realism" and whether this means Washington will differentiate between "good NATO members" who have stepped up defence spending, like Germany and Norway, and those who have done less.
"I do worry that they're going to distinguish between allies and decide that some are more worth defending than others. And of course that undermines the entire principle of NATO."
"Another cause for concern," she said, was that Rubio "talked a lot about Christian values and the civilisational ties". She said this points to the "alignment among the far right" on both sides of the Atlantic.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, in his opening speech, delivered "a very strong push for a more European NATO".
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer meanwhile expressed "a desire for a closer relationship with continental Europe and the European Union", she said, adding this "was quite bold because politically that's a bit risky for him in the in the UK".
And French President Emmanuel Macron talked about a European defence beyond the EU which would be "much more inclusive of countries like Norway, Turkey and the United Kingdom".
"I thought all of those were good steps for the big European countries, becoming more aligned in terms of how they would step up in creating a more robust European defence."
Ellehuus nonetheless stressed that Europe faces many obstacles, from fiscal problems in France and the UK to delays and hurdles in European defence cooperation.
Most European leaders at the MSC do not believe a ceasefire will come any time soon in the Ukraine war started by Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion.
"The overarching sense was that Russia is not serious about ending the war, and the current negotiations are just an attempt by Russia to buy time to keep fighting," Ellehuus said about US-led talks.
At the MSC, "there were a lot of people in there who tried to undermine this narrative that the Russians are winning," she said.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky "called on the world to exert maximum pressure on Russia, for example more targeted sanctions to decrease the price of oil".
She pointed to large Russian losses for minimal territorial gains and said: "When you look at the economic indicators, some of the pressures on their society, they're not exactly winning."
China seeks seat 'being vacated by US'
As Trump vows to place "America first", China is "more than happy to move into the seat that is being vacated by the United States," she said.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke of strengthening ties with Germany and rebooting relations with Canada. Despite being a close ally of Moscow, he said Beijing was willing to send "new humanitarian aid" to war-torn Ukraine.
Ellehuus said China "did a very nice job of presenting themselves as the guardians of multilateralism, as the protector of small and medium sized countries, as the guardians of the rules-based order".
She added that "nobody believes that, but they presented a very kind and gentle face, that could be tempting to some countries if they're upset with the United States".
Ellehuus said Europeans "are aware of the risk, but they are tempted by the economic benefits that could come from a closer economic and trade relationship with China, and they probably think that they can manage the downside".

There are increasing signs from both Israeli and foreign officials that there will be no major progress toward US President Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire Phase II before late February at the earliest.
Recently, top IDF sources predicted it would take months, even in a best-case scenario, before the Palestinian technocratic committee announced by the Trump administration as a key part of Phase II in January would actually start to have a concrete impact on Gazans’ lives.
Then on Friday, Board of Peace Executive Committee leader Nickolay Mladenov said in Munich that there was no basis for his oversight committee or the Palestinian technocratic committee to take any actions in Gaza until the nearly daily disruptions of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas stop.
Mladenov added that if they tried to start improving the situation in Gaza while fighting was still occurring, it would only embarrass them and render their efforts ineffective.
Hamas insists on associates holding power
Since January, there have been no announcements or reports of the committees taking over, even any civilian functions in Gaza, which Hamas has at least sometimes said publicly it is willing to pass on to them.
Rather, the only reports have been about disputes between the committee and Hamas about who will manage rebuilding efforts in Gaza on behalf of the committee, with Hamas insisting on their associates holding such power, even if the Hamas high command moves into the background on political issues.
In addition, Mladenov said the various civilian committees need the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and a new Palestinian police force – one not associated with Hamas – in place.
The earliest that the first piece of the ISF, some 5,000 Indonesian peacekeepers, is expected to arrive in Gaza is still weeks away.
Other than Mladenov, no Israeli or American officials have even been actively discussing the Palestinian police force, such that it is very unclear when and if it will deploy.
Mladenov also said that significantly more funding must come forward for rebuilding Gaza, something that it seems will only start as of the meeting in the US on Thursday.
Collectively, Mladenov’s statements seemed to confirm what IDF sources previously told The Jerusalem Post and others regarding the expected slow pace of any major impacts from Phase II in Gaza.
To date, the only concrete progress on the ground from Phase II has been the opening of the Rafah crossing.
However, even that opening has been much more limited than expected in terms of how many Palestinians are allowed in and out of Gaza, and no vehicles have been allowed through the crossing to date.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it no secret that he prefers to return to a major operation in Gaza instead of empowering the Palestinian technocratic committee, a Palestinian police force, and ultimately the PA.
Yet, US envoys Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff heavily prefer to proceed with Phase II and to avoid a return to major hostilities.

'The Iranians are lying': Netanyahu says he's 'skeptical' about future US deal with Tehran

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was "very skeptical" about any future deal with Iran and that he raised concerns with US President Donald Trump that "the Iranians are lying."
Speaking at the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations’ 51st Annual National Leadership Mission in Jerusalem on Sunday, Netanyahu said he just returned from the US, where he held "a very important meeting" with Trump focused on Iran.
The conference, which began on Sunday, is set to run through Thursday.
According to Netanyahu, Trump believes as though "Tehran feels like it missed a chance to reach a deal last time and wants to reach one this time." He stressed, however, that he had his doubts.
"Iran is reliable on one thing, that they lie and they cheat."
'For the security of Israel and the world'
Netanyahu went on to lay out what he considered essential components in any future deal with Tehran.
"If a deal is reached, it should have several components that we believe are important not only for the security of Israel but for the security of the US, the region, and the world," the prime minister said.
First, according to Netanyahu, a potential deal must ensure the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran’s territory, not merely stopping enrichment.
Second, all uranium enrichment equipment and infrastructure will have to be dismantled and removed from Iran, to ensure the country has no enrichment capability.
Third, the deal will have to limit Iran’s ballistic missiles to a range of 300 kilometers to ensure they cannot reach Israel or valuable assets in the region.
Finally, the deal will have to include disbanding the axis of terror, Iran’s proxy network in the Middle East, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, and Hamas in Gaza.
Netanyahu: We're giving Trump's plan a chance
Speaking on Gaza, Netanyahu said Israel will try to implement Trump's peace plan in Gaza, despite voicing concerns.
"We're giving Trump's plan a chance," Netanyahu told the American Jewish leaders.
On the issue of disarming Hamas, which has faced numerous delays and difficulties, Netanyahu stressed it was non-negotiable.
"We have to complete the job," he said, adding that Israel has so far dismantled approximately 150 kilometers of the 500-kilometer network of Hamas tunnels in Gaza.
"Gaza will not pose a threat ever again," Netanyahu stated.
Trump’s peace plan states that “all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen.”
Addressing US aid, the prime minister said Israel is looking to shift the relationship "from aid to partnership."

Indonesia to begin deploying Gaza peacekeeping force in April - report

Indonesia’s contribution to the International Stabilization Force (ISF), which will handle aspects of peacekeeping in Gaza during the Trump administration’s Phase II of the ceasefire, will start deploying in April, and likely primarily deploy in June, AP reported on Sunday.
The same report set the number of soldiers in April at 1,000 and the full June force at around 8,000, which is higher than some prior numbers that the media has speculated about.
According to the report, aspects of the process for selecting and clearing soldiers to join the force are underway.
However, Indonesia also said that if conditions in Gaza were not ripe for deployment regarding any conflict with Hamas, the force might not ultimately travel to Gaza even if it was ready.
Already on February 9, Channel 11 had confirmed that Indonesia would be the first segment of the ISF in Gaza, though at the time the report had suggested the soldiers might arrive within weeks.
In prior months, Indonesia had been mentioned as a possible contributing country to the ISF along with the UAE, Egypt, Italy, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Qatar, Turkey, and others, but until now, not a single country had moved from general promises to a concrete readiness to send troops.
Indonesian President Subianto to visit Washington
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be visiting Washington for Trump’s Board of Peace summit on February 19.
Neither the ISF in general, nor Indonesia in particular, is expected to seek direct confrontation with Hamas or to proactively disarm them.
Rather, they are expected to supervise current ceasefire lines and possibly handle other border-related issues.
For example, Indonesian soldiers are expected to supervise some of the defense lines in the Khan Yunis and Rafah areas of southern Gaza.
The coming months will still require resolving complex issues, such as the rules of engagement, should Hamas make contact with the Indonesian chapter of the ISF.
Moreover, there are questions about which countries will follow Indonesia’s example, and when.
Finally, if Hamas has not started a serious disarmament process by early May – around the Trump administration’s 100-day deadline – it is unclear whether the ISF would continue or whether Israel might return to major ground operations in Gaza.

American, as well as Israeli officials, see little chance of deal between US and Iran

Just days before Tuesday’s meeting in Geneva between United States President Donald Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and Iran’s foreign minister, officials in both the US and Israel assess that the chances of a deal between Iran and the US are slim.
The Iranian foreign minister, leading a delegation of representatives from political, legal, technical, and economic fields, is expected to meet with International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi on Monday, who would oversee any nuclear agreement to ensure compliance.
Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi said in an interview with the BBC that Iran is willing to consider concessions to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington shows readiness to discuss lifting sanctions.
“The ball is in the American court to prove they want an agreement, and if they are sincere, I’m sure we’ll be on the path to one.” Takht-Ravanchi clarified that reducing uranium enrichment to zero is not on the table for Iran. “It is not part of the negotiations,” he said.
Netanyahu addresses Trump meeting
Speaking at the Conference of Presidents (COP) on Sunday, Netanyahu discussed his recent trip to Washington to meet Trump and said their discussions focused mainly on Iran. “The president is determined to exhaust diplomatic options and believes Iran understands it missed an opportunity last time, and there is a high chance they won’t miss it this time,” the prime minister said, adding that he expressed skepticism about any deal with Iran.
“Even if a deal can be reached, it must include components that safeguard the security of Israel, the United States, and the world,” he said.
Netanyahu outlined what he believes the US should demand of Iran: “First, all nuclear enrichment must be prevented; all equipment and materials for developing nuclear weapons must be destroyed, along with all ballistic missiles. Iran must cease all support for terrorist activities. There must be effective and genuine oversight to ensure compliance.”
After returning from his meeting with Trump, Netanyahu held a series of discussions with security chiefs and a small group of ministers on regional issues.
Iran’s army chief of staff, General Abdolrahim Mousavi, said on Sunday that Trump must understand that any battle against Iran would teach him a historic lesson. “Any conflict with Iran will prevent Trump from imposing global hegemony once and for all. If Trump wants war, I wonder why he is talking about negotiations?”

Stephen A Smith reveals reason for Molly Qerim’s First Take departure
Qerim announced her departure in September

ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith has revealed the reasons behind his former co-host Molly Qerim’s exit from the network.
Qerim, 41, announced her departure from the ESPN show in September after serving as host for 10 years. She officially stepped away at the end of 2025 and has since been replaced by Shae Cornette.
Her co-host Smith has now opened up about the circumstances surrounding her departure. In a recent episode of The White House With Michael Irvin podcast, Smith, 58, called her exit “incredibly unfortunate.”
“Molly decided that she wanted to leave, and she had some issues that I’m not going to discuss,” Smith said. “It wasn’t with me, but she had some issues that was foremost on her mind and she made the decision to abruptly resign.
“I can tell you that Molly and I worked together for 10 years — I loved Molly. I didn’t want her to leave. Listen, I think Shae Cornette is doing an outstanding job for us. She knows her sports backwards and forwards. She is the real deal. But on a personal level, I definitely miss Molly, as do a lot of us, because we’re friends, and she was great.”
In announcing her departure, Qerim wrote: “After much reflection, I’ve decided it’s time to close this incredible chapter and step away from First Take. Hosting this show has been one of the greatest honors of my career. Every morning, I had the privilege of sharing the desk with some of the most brilliant, passionate, and entertaining voices in sports — and with all of you, the best fans in the world.”
She expressed her gratitude for her colleagues and the monumental experiences she’s had as a result of the show.
“I’m so grateful for what this journey has given me: lifelong friendships, unforgettable memories, and the chance to be part of something truly special,” she added. “From the bottom of my heart, thank you for welcoming me into your homes.”
Before joining First Take, she contributed to ESPN’s digital and mobile platforms from 2006 to 2010, hosting College Football Live and Fantasy Football Now. She left the network in 2010, before returning five years later to host First Take.
ESPN responded to Qerim’s departure with a statement from the network’s President of Content, Burke Magnus.
“Molly has been an integral part of ESPN since 2006 and a key driver of First Take’s success since joining as a host a decade ago,” his statement read. “She elevated the show with her poise, skill, and professionalism while supporting others as a kind and encouraging teammate. We respect Molly’s decision, wish her the best in the future, and thank her for her extraordinary daily commitment to sports fans and ESPN.”

Ukraine war latest: Ukraine destroys half of Russia's 'key' Pantsir air defense systems, security service says
Key developments on Feb. 14-15:
- Ukraine destroys half of Russia's 'key' Pantsir air defense systems, security service says
- Ukraine hits Russia's BK-16 landing craft in Crimea and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, military says
- Zelensky, Rubio discuss air defense for Ukraine, possibility of leader-level peace talks
- Territorial concessions by Ukraine won't bring peace, Zelensky says in Munich
- Ukraine сonfirms strike on oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, hits air defense system in Crimea
- Over 177,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine identified by media investigation
The Alpha unit of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) destroyed half of Russia's stockpile of the coveted Pantsir air defense system, the SBU announced Feb. 14.
"The 'Pantsir' is one of Russia's modern and key air defense systems. The cost of a single system ranges from $15 to $20 million. These anti-aircraft missile systems are the most effective in countering Ukrainian long-range drones," the announcement read.
The "systemic destruction" of the air defense system has the "strategic goal" of making Russia vulnerable to long-range strikes as Moscow continues to wage its war, the SBU said.
A diminished arsenal allows the Armed Forces to effectively strike Russian "military bases, warehouses, airfields, and other occupied facilities."
Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia and its own occupied territories in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power.
The SBU claimed on Jan. 19 that its long-range strikes during the year of 2025 either "destroyed or disabled" Russian air defense systems worth a total of approximately $4 billion.
On Feb. 12, Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to be worth approximately $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces later reported on Feb. 13.
Meanwhile, the 1st Separate Center of the Unmanned Systems Forces (USF) on Feb. 12 struck an airfield in the village of Hvardiiske in Crimea, the Kirova electrical substation in Luhansk, and a data center in Prymorsk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Ukrainian long-range cruise "Flamingo" missiles struck a major Russian arsenal storing missiles, ammunition, and explosives in Kotluban, Volgograd Oblast, overnight, Ukraine's General Staff reported on Feb. 12.
The facility belongs to Russia's Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU) and is described as one of the largest ammunition storage sites used by the Russian army. Powerful explosions and secondary detonations were recorded at the site.
In addition to the strike on the arsenal, Ukrainian forces on Feb. 12 hit the Progress Plant in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast. The enterprise produces high-tech equipment for aviation and missile systems and is involved in supporting Russia’s military.

Ukraine hits Russia's BK-16 landing craft in Crimea and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, military says
Ukrainian forces successfully attacked a Russian BK-16 landing craft and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Feb. 14.
The General Staff reported that Russia's BK-16 landing vessel, a high-speed landing craft for coastal operations and troop transport, was "successfully hit" on Feb. 12 in the Novoozerne area, Russian-occupied Crimea.
Some other military targets were also hit on Feb. 12, such as the RSP-10 radar station in Crimea and Russia's communications node in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff said.
Additionally, on Feb. 13, Ukraine hit a Russian ammunition depot near the village of Novoeokonomichne in occupied Donetsk Oblast.
"The Ukrainian defense forces will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor," the General Staff said.
Crimea has been under Russian occupation since its illegal annexation in 2014.
Ukraine has stepped up strikes on military infrastructure on the peninsula and other newly occupied territories since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.

Zelensky, Rubio discuss air defense for Ukraine, possibility of leader-level peace talks
Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Presidential Office Spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov told the media.
The discussion focused on the situation on the battlefield, Russian attacks, and the damage caused to Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Part of the discussion included ways to support Ukraine with additional air defense missiles during the winter, according to the Presidential Office.
Rubio and Zelensky also discussed the next round of trilateral peace talks among the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, set to take place in Geneva on Feb. 17–18.
"It's important that the planned negotiations in Geneva be productive, and I thank the United States for its constructive approach," Zelensky said after the meeting. "We also touched on the sequence of steps. It's important to make progress on issues of security guarantees and economic recovery."
The peace negotiations will eventually require a top-level meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the Presidential Office said in a statement published after the talks.
"Ukraine believes that a meeting at the leadership level should ultimately be held to resolve the most problematic issues," the statement said.
Zelensky met with Rubio following his conference speech earlier in the day. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov joined him in the talks.
Following the meeting, Zelensky also held a phone call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys representing Washington in the ongoing negotiations. They discussed the upcoming talks, the recent rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi, and the meeting with Rubio.
"Not everything can be disclosed over the phone, and our negotiating team will present Ukraine's position next week," Zelensky said after the call on Feb. 14. He thanked the U.S. team for their "constructive attitude."
Both Zelensky and Rubio addressed the conference in separate speeches on Feb. 14. Zelensky stressed Ukraine's commitment to the ongoing peace negotiations among Kyiv, Moscow, and Washington, but said territorial concessions to Russia would not lead to peace.
Rubio also acknowledged that the question of control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has not been resolved in the current negotiations.
In a briefing after his speech, Zelensky told journalists that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee, but that Kyiv was looking for a longer-term pledge.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing. We want to have 20 years plus. Thirty, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
The day before Zelensky's meeting with Rubio, Trump said that Zelensky needs to "get moving" to secure a peace deal with Russia.
"Russia wants to make a deal and Zelensky is going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity," Trump claimed. "He has to move."
When asked about Trump's comments, Zelensky acknowledged on Feb. 14 that the U.S. president may be "preparing (the) atmosphere" ahead of the upcoming peace talks in Switzerland.
"Not losing our dignity, we can move," Zelensky said.

Territorial concessions by Ukraine won't bring peace, Zelensky says in Munich
President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that territorial concessions by Ukraine would not bring peace, just as the 1938 Munich Agreement did not prevent World War II.
"It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine — just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a greater war," Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference.
The Munich Agreement was a compromise reached by Nazi Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy in 1938, allowing German dictator Adolf Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region. The agreement was touted as an effort to prevent a war but did not achieve its goal, with Germany invading Poland the following year.
It has since become the primary historical example of the failures of appeasement — the policy of granting concessions to an aggressor in hopes of achieving peace.
In his speech, Zelensky compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to the "previous Putin, who began dividing Europe" — a reference to Hitler.
As part of the ongoing peace talks between Moscow, Kyiv and Washington, Russia is demanding Ukraine's withdrawal from the parts of Donetsk Oblast that it still controls.
Zelensky has repeatedly stated that territorial concessions are unacceptable to Ukraine. He reiterated on Feb. 14 that concessions are often discussed during peace talks only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia.
Regarding elections, Zelensky said that Ukraine can make changes to its constitution and hold elections if there is a ceasefire. He added that Ukraine could also agree to a truce if Russia holds an election.
He also stressed that Ukraine will do "truly everything" to make these negotiations successful.
"Ukraine wants the result of all these efforts to be real security and real peace. Real peace. Not what came out of Geneva in 2021. Not what the Russians hope for, from this so-called spirit of Anchorage."
Zelensky's comments are a reference to Russian-U.S. talks held in Geneva in 2021 and in Anchorage, Alaska, in 2025.
Zelensky also argued that the absence of Europe at the negotiation table is a "big mistake."
"And it is we — Ukrainians — who are trying to bring Europe fully into the process, so that Europe's interests and voice are taken into account," he added.
In later remarks to journalists, Zelensky said that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee as part of a peace deal, but that Kyiv is looking for guarantees that last at least 20 years.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing.
We want to have 20 years plus. 30, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
Following the briefing, Zelensky held private talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky's message was "very clear".
"The first thing is that the Ukrainian people are fighting and not giving in. This is most important. And second, that Putin is not changing the goal," Tsahkna said.
Tsahkna added that the Ukrainian people are willing to stop the war, but not under any conditions, as "Putin is actually not willing to change the goals."
"Putin will continue the aggressive behavior, and Ukraine is protecting Europe," he said. "And the other way around, Ukraine is an opportunity for Europe."
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said at the conference that Russia does not seek a peace agreement, as indicated by the appointment of Vladimir Madinsky, a controversial Putin aide and historian, to the Russian negotiating team.
The return of Medinsky signals a potential hardening of Moscow's stance during the negotiations, given his history of uncompromising rhetoric in previous rounds of talks.
During the conference, Zelensky also met Rutte to discuss the funding of the PURL initiative and its further development.
Signed by the U.S. and NATO in July 2025, the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) agreement lays out a mechanism for NATO member states and partners to purchase high-priority equipment for Ukraine.
"We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," Zelenky wrote on X.
Zelensky also thanked for a "highly productive meeting" in the Ramstein format. After the meeting, the allocation of €38 billion in military aid for Ukraine was confirmed, Zelensky said.

Ukraine confirms strike on oil terminal in Russia's Krasnodar Krai, hits air defense system in Crimea
Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Ukraine carried out strikes on an oil terminal in southern Russia and a Russian air defense system in occupied Crimea overnight on Feb. 14–15, according to Ukraine's military intelligence (HUR).
In southern Russia, Ukrainian forces struck the Tamanneftegaz oil terminal near the village of Volna in Krasnodar Krai. A fire was recorded at the facility, HUR said, adding that the extent of the damage is still being assessed. The terminal is located near the Kerch Strait, east of Russian-occupied Crimea.
The confirmation follows earlier claims by Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratyev, who said Ukrainian drones had targeted several sites in the region, including an oil depot in Volna. He said two people were injured and that emergency crews responded to multiple fires in the region.
Volna is located just east of Crimea's Kerch Peninsula and about 325 kilometers (200 miles) from Ukrainian-controlled territory near Nikopol.
HUR also said Ukrainian forces successfully struck a Pantsir-S1 air defense missile system near the village of Kacha in occupied Crimea.
The Pantsir is one of Russia's key modern air defense systems. The cost of a single system ranges from $15 to $20 million. It is considered the most effective against Ukrainian long-range drones.
In addition, a repair unit belonging to a Russian artillery brigade was reportedly hit near Vilne in occupied Donetsk Oblast, and a concentration area of Russian personnel was struck near Liubymivka in occupied Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Kyiv considers energy infrastructure to be a military target as they directly fund Russia's war. Ukraine regularly strikes military infrastructure deep within Russia in an effort to diminish Moscow's fighting power as the Kremlin continues to wage its war against Ukraine.
An oil terminal near the village of Volna was also struck on Jan. 21, sparking a blaze, killing three people and injuring eight others, Kondratyev and independent media previously reported.
On Feb. 12, Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to be worth approximately $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces later reported on Feb. 13.
The Alpha unit of Ukraine's Security Service (SBU) has destroyed half of Russia's stockpile of the coveted Pantsir air defense system with the "systemic destruction" of the system, the SBU announced Feb. 14.

Over 177,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine identified by media investigation
Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 177,433 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine as of Feb. 13.
Since the media outlets' last update in early February, the names of 9,291 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties.
The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities.
The confirmed death toll now includes over 57,200 volunteers, 21,400 recruited prisoners, and 17,000 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. A total of 6,414 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed.
While Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures at all, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV in an interview on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia's full-scale war. Kyiv largely avoided commenting on its losses for the first two years of the full-scale invasion, until Zelensky announced in February 2024 that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.
Zelensky also told France TV that Russia would continue to incur staggering losses if it attempted to conquer all of eastern Ukraine by force of arms. His comments come amid the latest round of trilateral peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S., where the status of Ukraine's eastern Donbas territory remains a major point of contention in negotiations.
Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make marginal advances in Ukraine's front line region as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState reported that Russian forces occupied 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of the country
The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces estimates that as of Feb. 13, Russia has lost around 1,250,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 22, 2022. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured.
Mediazona published the complete list of identified casualties for the first time in February, marking three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database.

Suvi Minkkinen makes history with Olympic bronze in Milano-Cortina

Suvi Minkkinen secured a historic bronze medal in the women’s biathlon pursuit at the Milano-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics on Sunday. The 31-year-old became the first Finnish woman to win an Olympic medal in biathlon.
She hit all 20 targets and climbed from sixth place at the start to the podium in Anterselva. Italy’s Lisa Vittozzi won gold on home snow, and Norway’s Maren Kirkeeide took silver.
Minkkinen started the 10km pursuit 50 seconds behind the leader after finishing sixth in the sprint. She shot clean in both prone stages and remained in contention at halfway.
In the first standing stage, she cleared all five targets and moved into fourth place.
On the final visit to the range, several leading athletes missed. Minkkinen stayed composed and delivered a fourth flawless series. She left the range in second place.
Kirkeeide, despite two misses earlier in the race, caught and passed Minkkinen on the final lap.
Minkkinen held off France’s Lou Jeanmonnot, who finished 15.1 seconds behind the Finn in fourth.
“Such good feelings. I was able to make a perfect race just as I had planned,” Suvi Minkkinen said after the finish.
“For four laps I focused on my own work. Today the level of focus I had was a dream state that is hard to reach. Today I reached it, and the reward is Olympic bronze.”
She said the result linked back to work done years earlier. “A couple of years ago I made a high-altitude training plan with these Games in mind, so that my body would work here in Anterselva. Now I can perform here at the highest level in the world.”
The bronze delivered Finland’s third medal of the Milano-Cortina Games and marks the second major championship podium of her career. She won sprint bronze at the World Championships in Lenzerheide last winter.
This is her third Olympic appearance. Before Milano-Cortina, her best individual Olympic result was sixth place, achieved in the sprint earlier in the week.
Finland has now won seven Olympic medals in biathlon. All previous medals came from men.
The last Finnish Olympic biathlon medal came 28 years ago in Nagano in 1998. On that occasion, Ville Räikkönen claimed bronze in the sprint.

President Donald Trump held a campaign-style rally on Friday at Fort Bragg, an active Army base in North Carolina, urging troops to vote for Republicans and criticizing Democrats.
Trump entered the base to Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the USA” and ended the event with the Village People’s “Y.M.C.A.” He shared the stage with Michael Whatley, a former Republican National Committee chairman and Senate candidate, while touting his military spending plans and celebrating his restoration of the Fort Bragg name.
The rally took place before an audience of uniformed service members.

“You have to vote for us,” Trump told the troops Friday, highlighting his move to restore the Fort Bragg name after Congress directed the Pentagon to rename bases named after Confederate officers. Trump’s administration renamed the installation after Pfc. Ronald L. Bragg instead of Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg.
“If we don’t win the midterms, they’ll take it off again,” Trump said. “They’ll take it off again. You can’t let that happen.”
A majority of the uniformed service members reportedly listened without visible reaction, aside from lifting their phones to record photos and videos.
Friday’s event was not the first time the President has delivered such overtly political remarks at military venues, testing the tradition of separating the armed forces from partisan politics. In his second term, Trump has increasingly ignored that separation, often using military bases as stops for campaign-style political speeches.
Defense Department policy bars active-duty service members from engaging in partisan political activity. Army guidance stresses that the institution must remain above politics in both practice and perception.
“The Army as an institution must be nonpartisan and appear so too,” the Army field manual states. “Nonpartisanship assures the public that our Army will always serve the Constitution and our people with loyalty and responsibility.”
The President is under no such restriction, but most have adhered to the military’s apolitical standards.
TIME has reached out to the White House for comment.
Here is a brief history of Trump’s speeches at military events and bases during his second term:
Oct. 5, 2025 — Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia
Trump marked the Navy’s 250th anniversary in Norfolk while the federal government was shut down, using the event to criticize Democrats over budget negotiations.
“Despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” Trump said. “But we have to take care of this little gnat that sits on our shoulder called the Democrats.”
“Despite the current Democrat-induced shutdown, we will get our service members every last penny,” he added.
The President attended the ceremony alongside the first lady and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, honoring a 100-year-old World War II veteran and observing military exercises. His remarks, however, focused heavily on the budget impasse and immigration.
September 30, 2025 — Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia
Defense Secretary Hegseth convened a gathering of senior military leaders in September, which Trump joined at the last minute. Speaking before a room of generals and admirals, Trump delivered a speech that observers described as partisan.
“The ones that are run by the radical left Democrats... what they've done to San Francisco, Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, they're very unsafe places. And we're going to straighten them out one by one. This is going to be a major part for some of the people in this room,” he said in a speech to military leaders. “That's a war too. It's a war from within.”
He warned that the county was “under invasion from within” and criticized political opponents, blending his role as commander in chief with political messaging in a setting traditionally reserved for nonpartisan military discourse.
The event drew attention because it broke with the longstanding norm of keeping senior military forums free from campaign-style rhetoric, raising questions about civil-military boundaries.
June 10, 2025 — Fort Bragg, North Carolina
During a visit to Fort Bragg, earlier last year, marking the Army’s 250th anniversary, Trump announced he was restoring the names of seven military bases that had been changed after a Pentagon review of installations honoring Confederate officers.
“We won a lot of battles out of those forts. It’s no time to change,” Trump said. “I’m superstitious. I like to keep it going.”
The announcement reversed changes made under the Biden administration following recommendations from a congressional naming commission. Trump said he chose to reveal the decision at Fort Bragg rather than wait for a military parade in Washington days later.
“I can’t wait. I got to talk to my friends here today,” he said.
At the same Army anniversary celebration, Trump used his remarks to defend deploying National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles amid protests over immigration enforcement.
Calling protesters “animals” and “a foreign enemy,” Trump said. “We will not allow an American city to be invaded and conquered by a foreign enemy.”
He also warned that demonstrators opposing an upcoming military parade “will be met with very heavy force.”
The event, which included military demonstrations and equipment displays, blended ceremonial observances with political messaging about immigration, public safety, and Democratic leaders.
His visit also drew attention after campaign-style merchandise was sold on base, including “Make America Great Again” hats and Trump-themed T-shirts.
May 24, 2025 — West Point, New York
Trump delivered a commencement address at the U.S. Military Academy that at times resembled a campaign rally, appearing before graduates in a red “Make America Great Again” hat and tying the institution to his broader political agenda.
“In a few months, you’ll become graduates of the most elite and storied military academy in human history,” Trump told the cadets.”And I know, because I rebuilt that army.”
The President used the speech to tout his first-term record, criticize diversity initiatives, and repeat familiar campaign lines, including his claim that he faced more investigations than Al Capone.
“We’ve liberated our troops from divisive and demeaning political trainings,” he said. He also veered into cultural issues, refereing transgeder policies and gender in sports while addressing the graduating class.

Netanyahu says US deal with Iran must dismantle nuclear infrastructure
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he told US President Donald Trump last week that any US deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process.
Speaking at the annual Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, Netanyahu also said Israel still needs to "complete the job" of destroying all tunnels in Gaza.
Israel, he said, has already dismantled 150 km (93 miles) of an estimated 500 km.
A second round of talks between the US and Iran are slated for this week.
Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the US that delivers economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying on Sunday.
Netanyahu said he is sceptical of a deal but it must include enriched material leaving Iran.
"There shall be no enrichment capability - not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place", he said.
Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Netanyahu also said that he aimed to end US military aid to Israel within the next 10 years, after the current 10-year deal of receiving $3.8 billion a year - which is largely spent in the United States on equipment - ends in 2028.
Due to a thriving economy, "we can afford to phase out the financial component of the military aid that we're receiving, and I propose a 10-year draw down to zero. Now, in the three years that remain in the present memorandum of understanding and another seven years draw it down to zero", Netanyahu said.
"We want to move with the United States from aid to partnership", he said.

West not to be able to compete with global South — Russian businessman

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. The real challenge for Europe is its inability to compete with the global South rather than a mythical existential threat coming from Russia, Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska said.
"The world has changed dramatically and will continue changing rapidly. The aging West will not be able to compete with the global South, either economically or militarily. This is the major threat to the comfortable live in the Old World. Definitely, not Russia," he wrote on his Telegram channel.
According to Deripaska, it would be useful for Russia to diversify its economic relations and opt for more pragmatic economic cooperation with China, Africa, India, and Latin America rather than continuing interaction with the dominating "wealthy" West.
Given well-balanced strategy, Russia will be able to regain economic growth of 7-8% and win a foothold among the world’s top four economies within ten years after the conflict in Ukraine is ended.

Rubio says US pleased with overall ‘trajectory’ in Syria after YPG deal

The United States is satisfied with the “trajectory” in Syria, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday, following an agreement between the government and the U.S.-backed YPG terror group last month.
"There's been some days that have been very concerning, but we like the trajectory," Rubio said on a brief visit to Bratislava. "We have to keep it on that trajectory. We've got good agreements in place."
Rubio added, however, that a deal between Syrian authorities and the YPG must now be implemented.
"That's not going to be easy and there other such agreements that they need to reach with the Druze, with the Bedouins, with the Alawites, with all the elements of a very diverse society in Syria," Rubio said.
The YPG is the Syrian wing of the PKK. The PKK's attacks under the pretext of a struggle to establish a self-styled Kurdish state, cost thousands of lives since the 1980s. The YPG pursues a similar agenda in Syria and declared parts of northeastern Syria as an autonomous region. The group aims "decentralization" of Syria to carve out a Kurdish entity.
Syrian leaders in Damascus and YPG officials announced in January, after months of deadlock and armed clashes, that they had reached an agreement to integrate YPG and YPG-held areas of Syria into the Syrian state.
The PKK/YPG created a self-styled so-called Kurdish state in northeast of the country during Syria's civil war (2011-2024).
The United States had supported the PKK/YPG under the pretext of fighting Daesh terrorists.
But after the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad at the end of 2024, the President Donald Trump's administration backed Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, whose anti-regime forces drove Assad from power, in his bid to impose authority over the entire country.
Rubio on Sunday defended the administration's embrace of al-Sharaa, even against the former YPG allies, by arguing that Washington faced a difficult decision in Syria.
The process, "as difficult as it's been, is far better than a Syria that would've been broken up into eight pieces with all kinds of fighting going on, all kinds of mass migration," Rubio said. "So we were very positive about that."

'Extremely lenient': Box Hill North players sanctioned over inappropriate photos

Box Hill North players' sanctions over inappropriate photos criticised as 'extremely lenient'
The Box Hill North Football Club players involved in inappropriate photos posted online after their "Silly Saturday" post-season celebrations have been sanctioned by the league's governing body.
The reprimands have been called "extremely lenient" by the former women's captain who first brought the behaviour to the club's attention in August last year.
In the photos posted to social media, the captain of the men's senior team was dressed as a schoolgirl having her breast touched by a St Kilda AFL player.
The outfit referred to the "St Kilda schoolgirl" scandal in 2010, when two St Kilda players were accused of having sex with a 17-year-old schoolgirl.
In another photo, the deputy vice-captain was dressed in full-body blackface with a large penis attached to the costume. This photo was left on Instagram for more than three months.
The four players involved were found by the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) to have breached the league's national community football policy general code of conduct and the VAFA's social media policy.
The two players who posted the photos to social media received a three-week suspension, while the other two players in the photos received a two-week ban.
They have all been stood down from any leadership roles until they complete appropriate education sessions, after which their positions will be reviewed.
The league said all players pleaded guilty and cooperated fully with the investigation.
Genna Krienke, the former captain of the women's team who brought the photos to the club's attention, said the club took no action for four months and only raised the issue to VAFA after the media got involved.
The 25-year-old, who has now left the club, took part in the league's investigation into the matter, yet said she had not been contacted by VAFA, AFL Victoria or the club following the handing down of the punishments.
"I'm disappointed but not surprised that it's [the sanctions] just a slap on the wrist," Krienke told the ABC.
"The players are not going to learn from this at all, other clubs are not going to learn from this either, because they've seen that the punishment is just one to three weeks of sitting out."
When the photos were first reported by ABC Sport, the club provided a statement in which it "sincerely apologises for any offence caused following the players' end-of-season gathering".
"Certain costumes and associated social media posts were inappropriate and do not reflect our values or the inclusive environment we strive to provide," the statement read.
"To be clear, the club strongly condemns this behaviour and is taking the matter extremely seriously."
The club did not respond to multiple requests for comment by the ABC following the sanctions, including asking what the education sessions involved and an expected timeframe.
VAFA also declined to comment on what the education sessions involved.
Krienke said she did not think the club could say in good faith that it had taken the matter seriously at any stage throughout the process.
"They were slow in approaching it. They were hesitant to investigate it. They've been extremely lenient with the coach and the players in the punishment," she said.
"They cannot look me in the eyes, or look any woman, person of colour or marginalised person in the community in the eyes, and say, 'We've taken this seriously.'"
She added it was "beyond disgusting" that in the eyes of VAFA and the club, careless conduct on a football field could have resulted in a harsher punishment than the players' planning and choosing to wear the offensive costumes.
One source told ABC Sport the players testified they had been subjected to social media abuse following the story becoming public, which was a factor in the decision-making around the suspensions.
VAFA said in a statement following the sanctions it "remains committed to upholding its values of respect, inclusion, community and integrity, and to educating all members in support of these principles".
The club will also conduct two respectful relationships workshops (as recommended by AFL Victoria) for the men's playing and coaching group and undertake a whole-of-club "Healthy Club" workshop facilitated by Relationships Australia.
VAFA, AFL Victoria and Box Hill North were contacted for further comment by ABC Sport.

When Palestinian peasants brought an empire to its knees
Unknown

There was a time in Palestine when the greatest empire in the world lost control of entire areas, when highly educated lawyers followed the orders of simple illiterate peasants, and when wearing the Palestinian scarf, or koufiyyeh, became a political statement. Just like Palestine’s name, it has almost been forgotten from the world’s memory.
Palestinian director Annemarie Jacir’s recent film, “Palestine 36,” tells part of that story, shedding light on one of the most dramatic and crucial episodes of Palestinian history: the 1936-1939 revolution.
The film takes place between Jerusalem and the nearby fictionalized village of al-Basma, spanning the years in which Palestinians launched an uprising against the British Mandate and Zionist settler colonialism. The story follows the lives of several characters descended from the rural Palestinian peasant class, the urban middle class, and the traditional elites. A fair bit of the movie is devoted to unearthing the divisions between them, especially differences over how to respond to the increasingly aggressive Zionist settler movement, which operated under the discriminatory protection of the British. Some continued to opt for diplomacy with the British out of concern for their social and financial privileges. Others, directly impacted by British colonial policies and Zionist land grabs, joined the uprising in earnest, facing brutal repression.
“Palestine 36” is the first rendition of the 1936 revolution for the big screen. The international audience for which it was largely intended knows little of this history, and in that respect, the film aptly delivers, and with aesthetic finesse. But for Palestinians, recent years have seen a renewed interest in the 1936 revolution, especially for the younger generation of Palestinians who grew up under the Oslo Accords and the era of Palestinian defeat. That’s why the planned screenings of the movie in Ramallah had to be repeated several times to accommodate the intense local interest in seeing it.
The renewed interest in the 1936 revolution could be traced back to the period of revived political consciousness among young Palestinians during the past decade, becoming increasingly present in cultural circles and activist groups. Youth organized local visits to West Bank villages following in the footsteps of the revolution’s protagonists and their local stories. Folk artists featured stories about how the Palestinian peasant “fallahi” culture came to represent national liberation in those years. Young historians and researchers produced dozens of articles on specific aspects of that period, including the short-lived “state” proclaimed by revolutionaries in the hills of Hebron, the historical figure behind an iconic 1936 poem, and the real story of the Palestinians who collaborated with the British against the revolution.
“Palestine 36” can be seen as a continuation of this Palestinian effort to reclaim the narrative of a key period of Palestine’s modern history.
Palestinian writer and founder of Palestine’s “Popular University” project, Khaled Odetallah, has been an important figure in this recent revival. He says that the 1936 revolution was “a foundational event of Palestinian nationalism.”
“Because contrary to previous attempts by Palestinian urban elites to formulate a national movement after the end of WWI, the 1936 movement erupted from the popular base of Palestinian society,” Odetallah told Mondoweiss.
“‘Palestine 36’ captures this historical event successfully and in a highly aesthetic manner, and it does deliver the essentials about it to an international audience that might not be familiar with it,” Odetallah continued.
But as a well-made artistic work, Odetallah believes the movie still couldn’t capture all the dimensions of the poor peasant uprising that had posed a serious challenge to the British empire, “which controlled half of the world at the time,” he said.
Odetallah points out that the fictional film al-Basma is clearly inspired by the real-life village of al-Bassa in the Galilee, even though the film depicts the village as near Jerusalem.
Al-Bassa was a predominantly Christian village that would come to be ethnically cleansed in 1948. Before that, its residents were swept up in the revolution, as British soldiers, in an effort to put down the revolt, entered al-Bassa on September 6, 1938, and sprayed the villagers with machine gun fire for 20 minutes before burning it to the ground, according to the testimony of a British soldier.
“Many of the events portrayed in the film actually took place in al-Bassa, especially some of the cruelties committed by the British forces,” Odetallah explained.
Jacir’s historical epic also takes pains to shed light on some of the British figures behind the brutal repression of the revolt. This is perhaps best encapsulated in the character of Captain Wingate, clearly inspired by the real-life mastermind behind the British repression of Palestinian villages during the revolution, Orde Charles Wingate.
His cruelty and violence towards Palestinians, and his ideological Christian Zionism, are one of the film’s high points as far as historical portrayals go. But it “failed to show the more strategically important role of Wingate,” Odetallah said. “Wingate was the engineer of the Zionist military doctrine during the Nakba, and he was the person who trained the Zionist militias in how to repress and depopulate Palestinian villages, to the point that he introduced Zionist militia men into his troop during his counterinsurgency campaigns in the Palestinian countryside.”
One of those Zionist militia men was none other than Moshe Dayan, who would go on to become Israel’s Defense Minister and called Orde Wingate his “first teacher” in his diaries. Many of the methods used by the Israeli army today, like punitive home demolitions and mass arrest campaigns, were introduced by Wingate and other British officers in the 1930s. The film does show these British practices, but it doesn’t highlight the direct connection between the British military and Zionist paramilitary forces.
A class-based revolution
The film also sheds light on the social contradictions in Palestine during the 1930s, even highlighting aspects largely ignored by mainstream Palestinian narratives — namely, the collaboration of some Palestinian elites with the British against the revolution. The film shows, for example, a prominent Palestinian journalist and editor whose wife discovers that he had been on the payroll of the Zionist organization to publish articles unfavorable to the revolution, under the promise of helping him become mayor.
“The film does a courageous thing in breaking some taboos,” Odetallah noted. “This did happen, and it is difficult to write about these treasons in academia today, but what the film failed to capture, in my opinion, is the more structural, class-based type of collaboration with the colonizers,” he said.
“There is the petty collaboration of some individuals which needs to be hidden, but there were in the 1930s entire elite families and groups whose behavior was nothing more than the logical protection of their interests, and who openly acted against the revolution,” he explained. “Including that could have more deeply captured the class dynamics of the times.”
Understanding the class character of the revolution and the social and political forces that opposed it ultimately helps explain how it was crushed by 1939. The first Palestinian who took up the task of mapping these class dynamics was Palestine’s literary juggernaut, Ghassan Kanafani. The result was his pioneering in 1971 study of the revolt, which opened with the statement that the anti-colonial revolution in Palestine was defeated “by the alliance of British and Zionist colonial forces, the surrounding Arab regimes, and the local traditional elites.”
The importance of Kanafani’s study — the only historical piece he has written that isn’t literature or political journalism — lies in the fact that it isn’t really about the past.
Palestinian historian and educator Hazem Jamjoum, author of the latest English translation of Kanafani’s work, has pointed out that Kanafani wrote the study in the aftermath of Black September, the devastating war launched by the King of Jordan against the Palestine Liberation Organization, which ended with the Palestinian resistance leaving the country. Kanafani sensed that it was the beginning of a process that would pave the way for a politics of compromise and political capitulation instead of liberation. He identified this tendency as encapsulated in the Arab regimes and Palestinian elites’ class-based interests. According to Jamjoum, Kanafani’s study was essentially issuing a warning to his time.
As a self-proclaimed Marxist, Kanafani chose the 1936 revolution precisely for its obvious class character and its foundational nature in Palestine’s national struggle. He was laying the groundwork for a counter-narrative of the Palestinian struggle, told from below rather than from the top down.
“Palestine 36” doesn’t exactly adopt this particular reading of history, although it certainly isn’t hostile to it. It places the film’s characters at the center of the events, emphasizing their individual stories and trajectories, while avoiding foregrounding a single character as the hero. In this, the film hints at the spirit of collectivity in the revolt, keeping the story a collective one, just not of a specific class or group.
Some characters in the film remain somewhat flat in the background, but the main ones undergo an evolution in self-awareness. This happens to Yousef, the young man who wants to escape his rural village life and ends up fighting the British in its hills. But it also happens to Khuloud, the educated journalist in the city with close connections to British government employees, who starts out hoping that the uprising doesn’t spiral out of control and that the national leaders will unite. She ends up leaving her husband and joining protesters in the street.
Yet even though the film sets the revolution in the countryside, most of the political dialogue takes place in the city between Palestinian elites and the British. It is as if the events are centered in one world, and the reflection about them in another.
This is most starkly highlighted when the characters learn about the results of the British Peel Commission on Palestine, which recommended the partition of the country to give half of it to the Zionist movement. The dialogue concerning the commission and the ensuing argument over it all happens in a Jerusalem city house around a social dinner table, in the presence of a British government employee. This contrasts with the reaction in the village, where people pour out into the fields in anger and chase British patrols with stones.
This also applies to the movie’s portrayal of Palestinian social dynamics. We can clearly see how urban society is structured and how the relations among the political leaders, the journalists, the businessmen, and the British evolve. But we don’t learn much about the village — its family and clan structure, social hierarchies, or how the revolution sprang from Palestinian village society and impacted them. This tended to render the Palestinian village as something of an archetype, to the point that its culture was largely absent. Despite actors’ efforts to use the rural Palestinian pronunciation of certain letters, it didn’t capture the accent, mannerisms, or speech style of Palestinian villages. For an international audience, this isn’t an issue, but for a Palestinian audience, it sticks out like a sore thumb.
Yet in its most important task, “Palestine 36” does what few other films have done for an international audience: it places the 1936 revolution at the center of the Palestinian narrative. First-time viewers will come away from the movie knowing that they just learned of a key and foundational episode in the decades-long Palestinian struggle for freedom. More importantly, it makes up the core of what it means to adopt Palestinian identity: fighting for freedom demands a price, and even then, the results are never guaranteed.
This is most poignantly captured in one of the film’s final scenes. After the destruction of the village by the British, one of the characters tells a child, “It is not the first time, and it won’t be the last. There is still a long way to go.” With that, history comes full circle.

‘Right about everything’: Liz Truss tweets photo of meeting with Trump

After spending time and resources crisscrossing the Atlantic to cultivate the support of the Maga faithful, Liz Truss has finally got the prize she apparently craved: a photo with Donald Trump.
Britain’s shortest-serving prime minister tweeted a photo on Sunday showing her in the company of the US president at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
“Right about everything,” Truss posted, tagging the president on X.
Trump had yet to record the meeting on his own social media feeds, focusing instead on promoting the new documentary made by his wife, Melania. It is unclear how long the meeting between Truss and Trump lasted and how it was initiated.
Truss, who has increasingly adopted extreme positions to the right of the Conservative party she once led since she left office, and has attempted to relaunch herself as a podcaster, has made addresses in each of the last two years at the flagship annual conference of the US right.
She told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Maryland last year that her own country was “failing”, as she appeared alongside rightwing populists from around the world planning deeper ties and cooperation.
An increasingly marginal figure in British politics, who was prime minister for only 49 days and lost her seat in 2024’s general election, Truss has sought to secure a safe harbour at CPAC, a once mainstream conservative gathering that has embraced Trump’s brand of nativist-populism.
At home in the UK, meanwhile, Truss has been trying to get her own club off the ground and has been accused of wandering the premises of London’s exclusive club 5 Hertford Street in search of members to poach for her rival operation.
The latter, called The Leconfield, asks “founding members” for £500,000 and was conceived by Truss and the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, who is transforming his Curzon Street offices for the venture.

Bangladesh has invited top diplomats of South Asian nations for a new government ceremony in the capital Dhaka after new lawmakers were elected in last week's general elections, officials announced on Sunday.
The newly elected lawmakers and Cabinet members will be sworn in on Tuesday, ushering in the first new parliament following the 2024 uprising that ended Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.
Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin will swear in new lawmakers, and the president will do the same for the new Cabinet.
In line with tradition, guests, among them the foreign ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) members, including Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and others, have been invited to the swearing-in to be held in front of the parliament building.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which secured a two-thirds majority in Thursday's election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, will form the government with party leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister.
In Thursday's election, the BNP got 49.97 percent of the vote while the Jamaat-e-Islami party-led alliance Jamaat got 31.76 percent, according to the country's election commission.
Jamaat ally the National Citizen Party (NCP), the youth group that led the 2024 uprising, got 3.5 percent of the vote.
Jamaat seeks recount for 32 seats, announces protests
After securing 77 seats, the Jamaat alliance accepted the results overall but claimed some irregularities in the process.
Jamaat said on Sunday that they are seeking a recount in 32 constituencies over alleged irregularities and counting manipulation.
Assistant Secretary General Hamidur Rahman Azad told reporters that they saw irregularities during the voting, adding: “There is a demand for revaluation in 32 seats. We will follow the legal process.”
He also announced protests for Monday, saying: “We will take the oaths of office, go to parliament, and play a constructive role. At the same time, the streets will also be open for us.”
More than 127.6 million people in Bangladesh were eligible to cast ballots, and the country saw a voter turnout of 59.44 percent, up from 41.8 percent in the January 2024 elections.
Results in three seats were held up or suspended, two due to court orders and one due to the death of a candidate.
The commission also published the results of the Thursday referendum on constitutional reforms, with votes in its favor exceeding 60 percent.
In a rare political gesture, Rahman visited Jamaat Ameer chief Shafiqur Rahman at his residence in Dhaka on Sunday. Some top leaders from the both parties were present and discussed issues, including post-election developments.
Rahman is scheduled to hold another such visit to NCP chief Nahid Islam, a key figure of the 2024 upspring, at his Dhaka residence.

African leaders wrapped up a two-day summit on Sunday with urgent calls to end conflicts across the continent and renewed demands for reform of the UN Security Council, as mounting security crises overshadowed the gathering’s stated agenda of water issues.
Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye, the newly elected African Union (AU) chair, said restoring stability remains the bloc’s foremost priority.
“We need to silence the guns. We need peace on this continent. We need stability on this continent, and we have a program for that,” he told a closing press briefing.
AU Commission Chair Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said the leaders also stressed the link between development and stability, warning that access to basic services remains critical for long-term peace.
“Without equitable access to water and sanitation, we cannot talk of public health or inclusive development or sustainable prosperity for our people,” he said.
Worst humanitarian crisis
In a separate press briefing, AU Peace and Security Commissioner Bankole Adeoye described the situation in Sudan as “the worst humanitarian crisis globally” and said the conflict, which began in April 2023, remains “virtually unreported” despite its scale and impact on regional stability.
Taking questions on Sudan, he told reporters: “Our number one goal is a permanent, unconditional, inclusive, immediate ceasefire.”
He also reiterated Africa’s long-standing position on global governance reform, saying the UN Security Council must better reflect contemporary realities.
“The UN Security Council must reflect the world of today,” Adeoye said.
Adeoye added that AU leaders reaffirmed their policy of “zero tolerance” for unconstitutional changes of government.
Although the summit was officially convened under a theme focused on water security and sanitation, the issue received less attention in its final hours as leaders concentrated on urgent peace and security challenges across the continent.

Lawmakers urge DOJ to ‘stop protecting predators’ over vague Epstein files disclosure
- The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent a six-page letter to Congress, disclosing a list of high-profile individuals mentioned in the Jeffrey Epstein files.
- Lawmakers have expressed dissatisfaction with the disclosure, accusing the DOJ of being purposefully vague and protecting individuals with close ties to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
- The list includes names of celebrities like Marilyn Monroe and Janis Joplin, who died decades ago, alongside figures such as Donald Trump, without clarifying their connection to Epstein.
- Members of Congress, including Rep. Ro Khanna and Rep. Nancy Mace, are demanding greater transparency and the release of fully unredacted files, despite the DOJ indicating this is the final release.
- The DOJ stated it has released “all” records as required by the Epstein Files Transparency Act, but lawmakers argue that many pages remain blacked out and that the list is incomplete.

Over 1,000 agents leave Minnesota as immigration surge winds down
US border tsar says a ‘small’ security force will remain to protect remaining personnel following weeks of volatile protests
White House border tsar Tom Homan said on Sunday that more than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota’s Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge.
He also said agents will keep investigating fraud allegations as well as the anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church.
“We already removed well over 1,000 people, and as of Monday, Tuesday, we’ll remove several hundred more,” Homan said. “We’ll get back to the original footprint.”
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St Paul area for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) “Operation Metro Surge”.
The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and proved successful. But the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile and two US citizens were killed.

My suburb has a reputation for sleaze. But now Sydney and Melbourne want to emulate it

Opinion
My suburb has a reputation for sleaze. But now Sydney and Melbourne want to emulate it
People talk about living in the Valley like they might talk about doing time.
You sign up for a two-year stretch. At first, you immerse yourself in the vice and degeneracy, but then it wears you down, you get clean and, if you’re lucky, your rental agent grants you parole at the 18-month mark.
Then you’re out of there, minus a good portion of your bond, but with a good dose of PTSD.
I’ve lived in the Valley for much of the past eight years, and I get it.
The first four years were at FV by Peppers, on the corner of Brunswick Street and St Pauls Terrace, and I definitely saw things I wouldn’t tell my mother about (although dear old mum, bless her, once picked me up and was delighted to spot a former colleague walking along Brunswick Street … before he stepped into The Den sex shop). A good number of my neighbours were sex workers and cashed-up drug dealers.
There were parties and lock-ins at local restaurants, and noise complaints and visits from security.
On a typical Friday walk home along Brunswick Street, you’d step over passed-out punters and fist-bump the occasional security guard before escaping into the elevator to your apartment.
It was fun, and sometimes funny, but frequently exhausting, and when I moved out in 2021, like many others, I thought I was making good my escape.
I did, but not really. These days, I live on Wandoo Street, still in the Valley but a vastly different part. And it underlines how this is very much a suburb of two halves.
There’s the club-driven grunge and grit of Brunswick Street and its surrounds, and then there’s the perfectly manicured glamour of James Street, the area in which I live. And yet, the two, within easy walking distance, co-exist happily enough.
That’s in part because despite its careful curation, James Street is, in many ways, just as real as the suburb’s less-salubrious elements. The restaurants here – Essa, Hellenika, Bianca – are excellent, and its collection of boutiques one of the best in the country.
Someone once said to me: “Imagine being in London in the middle of winter and seeing a picture of The Calile? You’d be on the plane in no time.” James Street represents the city’s international future as we head towards the Olympics, and it’s one of the few places in Brisbane where drivers simply accept that pedestrians rule.
Planners and designers in Sydney and Melbourne study places like James Street – this planned precinct in a city that got good at executing them after it knocked down so much heritage.
But that’s the other thing I love about this end of the Valley – it does have heritage and history. You just need to know where to look. There are the converted war-era Nissen huts on Arthur Street that now house Italian diner Mosconi and, until recently, King Arthur Cafe, and the old air-raid shelters near the corner of Wickham and East streets.
The suburb played a significant role in World War II, particularly after General Douglas MacArthur – allied commander of the south-west Pacific theatre – moved his headquarters to Brisbane in 1942. It was the home of the US 5th Air Force service command, an ordnance and enlistment depot, and an air freight depot.
The history goes back further, of course – thousands of years in the case of the Indigenous Turrbal and Jagera people. The suburb was named by Scottish migrants who arrived in Moreton Bay on the 608-tonne SS Fortitude in 1849.
Initially farmland, Fortitude Valley’s growth was turbocharged by the arrival of the train line in 1890, and the subsequent retail rivalry between Thomas Beirne and his former manager, James McWhirter.
Its resistance to floods helped the Valley remain Brisbane’s primary retail district right up until the rise of suburban shopping centres in the 1970s. Then came a decline.
Related Article
If the blocks around James Street are known for their wartime history, the areas up the hill towards Brunswick Street and the guts of Wickham Terrace still have echoes of the “Moonlight State” of the Bjelke-Petersen years, when police corruption was rampant.
Les Bubbles, a steakhouse, was once Bubbles Bath-House, the illegal casino and massage parlour at the centre of the Fitzgerald Inquiry; the infamous Hot Lips strip club sat on the corner of Brunswick Street and St Pauls Terrace; and in 2017, then-Queensland attorney-general Yvette D’Ath announced the government would reopen the coronial inquest into the 1973 firebombing of the Whiskey Au Go Go nightclub, which killed 15 people.
There’s a sense the Valley has never quite reckoned with those dark days, even as gentrification of the streets surrounding Brunswick, Alfred and Constance threaten to flatten much of the past entirely.
As a journalist, you like to be somewhere that’s in a state of flux or transformation – that’s where the stories are, and that’s Brisbane right now.
Fortitude Valley continues to play a key part in that transformation. And as you sit and watch the apartment blocks rising around you – this city slowly being rewired to go up instead of out – you can’t see that changing any time soon.

Unmanned systems forces, in coordination with Special Operations Forces and Defense Intelligence, conducted an attack on the Russian Tamanneftegaz oil and petroleum products export terminal in Krasnodar Krai.
The 1st Separate Center of the USF reported this news.
According to the report, a series of explosions were recorded during the strike on the night of February 15. The extent of the damage is still being assessed. Local authorities confirmed the strike on the morning of the same day.
Official sources said one of the tanks containing oil products caught fire. Russian authorities claimed the fire was caused by falling debris rather than a direct hit.
Krasnodar Krai Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said that, in addition to the tanks, storage facilities, and elements of the terminal infrastructure were damaged.
Tamanneftegaz is one of Russia’s key export terminals, located near the port of Taman. The facility handles the transshipment of oil, petroleum products, and liquefied hydrocarbon gases from tank farms for onward shipment by sea.
The terminal is a critical component of Russia’s oil export infrastructure and also supports the logistical capabilities of the Russian Black Sea Fleet.
Its proximity to the Crimean Bridge and temporarily occupied Crimea further underscores its importance for the logistical support of Russian forces in the Black Sea.
Available data indicate the terminal’s design capacity is around 19.9 million tons of oil and petroleum products per year.
The facility’s tank farm, used to store oil products and liquefied gas, has a total capacity exceeding 1 million cubic meters.
This is not the first attack on the facility. On January 21, four oil storage tanks caught fire following a prior strike.
Two months earlier, on the night of December 21-22, 2025, the port of Taman was also hit by drones.

Russia's losses increase its reliance on foreign fighters – Bloomberg

Russia's losses increase its reliance on foreign fighters – Bloomberg
According to Ukrinform, Bloomberg stated this in an article.
UK Defence Secretary John Healey said that Russia is increasingly relying on foreign fighters in the war against Ukraine because its troops are sustaining heavier losses than they can replace.
Ukraine's Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov told European colleagues this week that Ukraine had managed to inflict more losses on Russian forces over the past two months than the Kremlin had been able to recruit, Healey told Bloomberg News on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
This is forcing the Russian armed forces to rely more heavily on thousands of foreign fighters, he said, including mercenaries from India, Pakistan, Nepal, Cuba, Nigeria, and Senegal.
They are "often recruited under false pretenses and press-ganged under pressure without necessarily realizing that they're destined for the Russian meat machine on the front line of Ukraine," Healey noted. He estimated the number of North Korean troops fighting for Russia at around 17,000.
Last week, Bloomberg wrote that in January Russia suffered approximately 9,000 more frontline losses than it was able to replenish.
According to Healey, in some sectors of the front the casualty ratio has also increased from about six to 25 Russian losses for every Ukrainian casualty.
Western officials believe this trend, supported by the increased supply of drones to Ukraine, is a key factor in mounting pressure on Russia.
As reported by Ukrinform, total combat losses of Russian forces from February 24, 2022, to February 15, 2026, in the war against Ukraine amount to approximately 1,253,270 personnel, including 1,250 over the past day.

As high-speed rail plans gather pace, Britain's HS2 offers hard lessons

As high-speed rail plans gather pace, Britain's HS2 offers hard lessons
Take a flight out of London heading west, and you may just catch a glimpse of a massive construction site snaking its way through the otherwise green English countryside.
That is what one day will become the UK's first fully domestic high-speed rail line, known in Britain as HS2.
But with federal and state governments in Australia reviving long-talked about plans for fast rail networks of their own, the British project comes with some lessons.
Construction of HS2 officially began in 2019, but years later the project is mired in delays, cost overruns and planning failures on multiple fronts.
Experts say many of those challenges present important takeaways for Australian governments — issues they must address if they want to prevent their mega-projects going off the rails.
Where will HS2 go?
HS2's route has been one of the knottiest aspects.
The high-speed line was initially approved to run from London's Euston station, via the UK's second-largest city, Birmingham, before branching into the northern English cities of Manchester and Leeds.
The project was developed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, with politicians hopeful that it would aid an economic recovery.
However, austerity measures implemented in subsequent years made HS2 increasingly difficult to justify, particularly after construction began in 2019, and the COVID-19 pandemic ushered in elevated inflation.
What was initially proposed as a cut-and-dried £37.5 billion ($72 billion) scheme in 2009 was, by some estimates in 2020, expected to cost £100 billion.
Opposition gathered a head of steam.
First, the Leeds leg was axed in 2021. Then the route to Manchester was binned last year.
Experts say that's already reduced, if not eliminated, the actual benefits of the line, when set against the standard rail lines already operating.
"[The economic benefits] won't nearly be as great as if the line had gone all the way," Chris Nash, a British transport expert, says.
"It never looked to stack up, being built just London to Birmingham."
Sally Gimson, who has written a book about the project's failings, is equally critical of the line's shortening, stating that the original plans were supposed to "free up capacity on the west coast line for freight" between Birmingham and Manchester, two of the UK's largest industrial centres outside of London.
"It's crazy to end it in the West Midlands."
Now, the UK government is talking about building a separate high-speed line between Birmingham and Manchester, which may only become a reality in 20 years' time.
Left at the station
Even more frustrating for planners is that scaling back the project means the new Birmingham station is something of a white elephant. It is overly complex, with too many platforms that will ultimately serve only trains to London.
It doesn't end there.
While Birmingham's station is too big, London's terminus does not yet exist.
"There hasn't been any work done in Euston since 2023," Ms Gimson says.
UK PM Sir Keir Starmer's government, which inherited the project when it came to office in 2024, still has not announced how the Euston station will be funded, what it will look like, and when it will open.
All the while, HS2's overall cost is rising, souring the public's appetite for large infrastructure projects.
Why the cost?
Ms Gimson says the project's hefty price tag is rooted in a lack of flexibility from the outset.
"So the trains had to go faster than any other train in the world, the signalling had to be more sophisticated than any other signalling in the world," she says.
"We put lots of bells and whistles on it, so that also then made it more expensive."
That's an argument rejected by one of the project's chief architects, Lord Andrew Adonis, who, in 2023 as the project was being cut back, argued that the cost difference between conventional and high-speed rail was only 10 per cent.
Among other issues, Lord Adonis blames "excessive planning requirements", a lack of expertise in the UK government, and NIMBYism, referring to "not in my back yard" locals along the route who demanded expensive changes to the project.
Costs were further exacerbated by supply chain problems after the country officially left the EU, and HS2 also cites the inflation surge since COVID as a factor.
In response to questions from the ABC, a spokesperson for HS2 says even the project's chief executive acknowledges "the overall delivery of HS2 has been unacceptable" and needed resetting.
"Target costs were optimistic and the design was immature when we started construction," the spokesperson says.
"HS2 Ltd was not properly set up for delivery success and has suffered from high turnover in leadership positions, lacked capability in key areas and has been passive in the face of challenges, failing to learn lessons."
What are Australia's plans?
High-speed rail in Australia has long been discussed but has been slow to proceed.
Among the ideas discussed are linking Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane to compete with one of the world's busiest aviation corridors.
In November last year, a business case for building a high-speed rail link between Sydney and Newcastle was supported by Infrastructure Australia, the federal body responsible for assessing the viability of major projects.
But ultimate approval sits with the federal government.
A spokesperson for the High Speed Rail Authority told the ABC the delivery of other projects was "taken on board and learned from" when designing the business case for the Sydney-Newcastle link.
"Recognising that high-speed rail will be new to Australia, as part of our business case process, we have taken a 'tried and tested approach' to mitigate risk," the spokesperson said.
"This includes getting feedback on the approach taken and lessons learnt from established high-speed rail networks internationally and those under delivery, including HS2."
What lessons does HS2 hold for Australia?
Lord Adonis believes that, despite the cost, High Speed 2 will "be greeted … as a transport miracle" and, at least he hopes, will eventually be upgraded again so that it may one day reach Leeds and Manchester.
For Sally Gimson, the UK's experience has a clear lesson: meddling and tinkering with rail projects once shovels are in the ground ends in disaster.
"It should be a national project," she says.
"It has to be agreed with government, with governments into the future."
"[With HS2] there was real disagreement about whether to do it or not … it was never national project."
Professor Nash agrees, saying Australian governments should decide on a plan, "stick to it and not keep changing it".
Further, he warns that rushing to complete an entire project in one go could end up disastrously, preferring a staged approach instead.
"Maintaining flexibility by building a part but building it in such a way that is useful, and then carrying on if everything looks favourable, does make sense," he says.
But he concedes that is more difficult when Australia's vast distances are factored in.
"Because [Australian] cities are so far apart with not all that much between them, it's difficult to find a way of phasing it so you're building something useful even if the line never gets right to the other end."

Why experts say this preventable child disease hit a 35-year record high

Whooping cough cases hit record high after 'potentially catastrophic' vaccine rate drop
In short:
The number of whooping cough cases rose in 2024–25 to the highest level recorded in Australia in 35 years, a Productivity Commission report has revealed.
More than 57,000 cases were identified in 2024, including 37,663 that affected infants and children aged up to 14.
What's next?
Infectious disease experts say a continuing decline in childhood immunisation rates could risk an increased circulation of preventable diseases.
A "potentially catastrophic" decline in Australia's childhood vaccination rates has contributed to the sharpest increase in cases of whooping cough in 35 years, infectious disease experts say.
Rates of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease also known as pertussis, rose to almost 800 cases per 100,000 Australian children in 2024–25, according to a recent Productivity Commission report.
The average rate was 183.5 per 100,000 children for the pre-pandemic years, from 2015–16 to 2018–19.
The Australian Centre for Disease Control's surveillance system showed 57,257 whooping cough cases were confirmed in 2024, with 37,663 of those cases involving infants and children aged up to 14.
That spike marked the highest yearly number of cases since 1991, when cases of whooping cough were first recorded.
Almost 26,000 of the cases were detected in NSW and more than 15,000 in Queensland.
Another 25,272 notifications of whooping cough were then confirmed by authorities in 2025.
Whooping cough is a potentially fatal infection caused by the bacterium bordetella pertussis and can lead to severe coughing fits that can linger for months, according to Australia's Centre for Disease Control.
Common symptoms often include a runny nose, sneezing and a mild dry cough within the first week of illness. After two weeks, the infection can worsen and lead to long episodes of heavy coughing.
Archana Koirala, a paediatrician and infectious diseases specialist from the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and social distancing rules were a factor in the 2024–25 spike.
"The bacteria is spread similarly to how viruses are spread, and so if you restrict people from coming into contact with each other, the bacteria is restricted in its spread as well," she said.
"Immunised children didn't get exposed to that usual kind of circulation … and so they didn't get that immune boost.
"We saw a decline in coverage across Australia, and so what happens is that [among] those who are vaccinated, their immunity waned … and a proportion didn't get their vaccines in time.
"That's like a perfect storm for an outbreak."
In Australia, routine childhood immunisations are administered from birth until the age of four to protect against diseases such as hepatitis B, diphtheria, pertussis, polio, rotavirus, measles, meningococcal and influenza.
Paul Griffin, the director of infectious diseases at Mater Health Services, agreed.
"The unfortunate reality is that when vaccination rates decline, population susceptibility and therefore risk goes up, and these things will increase," he said.
"If we don't do something about it, we're going to start seeing a whole host of these things that really should be much better controlled than they are at the moment, and that includes basically all vaccine-preventable diseases.
"It is potentially catastrophic."
In September last year, 91.54 per cent of children aged one, 89.57 per cent of two-year-olds and 93.17 per cent of five-year-olds were vaccinated for preventable diseases, according to quarterly data released by the federal health department.
All three age groups fell short of the national target of 95 per cent.
The data showed it was the lowest national coverage rate for one-year-olds since 2014, the lowest for two-year-olds since 2015 and the lowest for five-year-olds since 2016.
"Even a slight decline in vaccination can have a big impact on population immunity and case numbers and burden of disease," Dr Griffin said.
"We know [whooping cough] is a devastating infection, particularly in those most vulnerable, and we need to make sure we don't continue to see this trend into the future."
Dr Koirala said the childhood vaccination rate decline also coincided with an increase in the number of measles cases.
The Australian Centre for Disease Control reported 181 cases were confirmed in 2025 — up from 57 in the previous year.
About 30 cases have been detected this year.
If the vaccination rates did not rebound, Australia could face a potentially disastrous re-emergence "of diseases that we have almost eliminated", such as endemic measles, she said.
Australia was among the first four nations globally to eliminate the constant local transmission of measles in 2014, according to the World Health Organization.
"We're really worried because measles is a very infectious virus and we know that when the coverage gets below 95 per cent in the population, that's when large outbreaks have occurred," she said.
"We'll see a measles death, we'll see a whooping cough death … and if vaccine hesitancy increases, we'll have more circulation of the bacteria."
Vaccine advocate flags dangers of social media
Catherine Hughes, the co-founder of the Immunisation Foundation of Australia, lost her son Riley in 2015.
He died from whooping cough at just 32 days of age.
She said watching Australia's childhood vaccination rates continue to decline "makes your heart sink".
"You think back to that time when you watched your baby in hospital get worse and worse and sicker and sicker and ultimately not survive. It's such a simple, easy way to prevent it," she told the ABC's Radio National Breakfast.
"To know that these rates are the worst that they've been in 10 years for childhood immunisation, it's not great news.
"I worry that this trend will continue."
Loading...Ms Hughes became a vocal immunisation advocate after Riley's death, saying she was concerned about the rise in misinformation and "anti-vaccine propaganda" that continued to proliferate on social media.
"A couple of years ago, a lot of the social media companies would use fact checkers and it did help mitigate to a certain degree some of the anti-vaccine propaganda that we see, but that has been dropped in the last 12 to 18 months," she said.
"At the end of the day, all it really does is serve as a reminder to me of why it's important that we continue to speak out … about the importance of vaccination."
Dr Griffin believes it is now "far easier to be misinformed than to be informed" about vaccination safety in Australia.
"We need to be more proactive in getting good information out there," he said.
"Make sure people know where the good sources of information are; empower our frontline workers in this regard — our pharmacists and our GPs — with good information and the time and resources to be able to spend time with patients … to be able to make sure that everyone gets the right information."

Right now, 400 kilometres above us, above the earth's surface, orbiting at 17 and a half thousand miles per hour, or 5 miles per second, the new crew of the International Space Station are just settling in.
The team of four that make up Expedition 74 set off on Friday morning at 5.15 am, from Cape Canaveral. They are Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway from the US, Andrey Fedyaev, a Russian Cosmonaut, and Sophie Adenot, becoming the second female astronaut from France, after Claudie Haignerer 3 decades ago.
The ISS is considered the most expensive human made engineering project in history, a total cost over it's lifetime around 150 to 160 billion, and since the year for 25 years it has been continuously occupied by humans, living, working in a set of capsules in a football field sized space, pushing the boundaries of science in space.
And Sophie Adenot from Burgundy, a former helicopter pilot said she's dreamed of this moment since she was tiny, despite the slim odds of doing it, she said her family encouraged her from the off.

Trump tells Hamas to proceed with 'Full and Immediate' disarmament
US President Donald Trump on Sunday urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza, and said members of his so-called "Board of Peace" had pledged $5 billion to the Palestinian territory's reconstruction.
"Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization", Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a 19 February meeting of the board in Washington.
Disarmament is a key part in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire plan sealed in October between Israel and the Palestinian group to end the war triggered by the Hamas-led attack in October 2023.
The United Nations endorsed the plan in November.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Both sides accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Although originally intended to oversee Gaza's rebuilding, the charter for the "Board of Peace" does not seem to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
"The Board of Peace has unlimited potential", Trump said Sunday in his post.
After an initial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, the board is due to meet Thursday in the US capital.
Countries have been asked to pay $1 billion for permanent membership of the board, and the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine in 2022, has drawn criticism.
Key US allies including France and Britain have expressed doubts.
Trump said the $5 billion in pledges by member states would be formally announced then, and that members also "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans".
Trump has said the organization will work "in conjunction" with the United Nations.
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History", he said.
Under the ceasefire plan, a Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up with a goal of taking over governance in the battered Gaza Strip.

Iran says pursuing nuclear deal with US for mutual economic benefits

Iran is seeking a nuclear agreement with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, an Iranian diplomat said Sunday, ahead of a new round of negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
Iran and the U.S. renewed negotiations earlier this month to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The U.S. has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, U.S. officials have told Reuters.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made it clear that he would prefer diplomacy and a negotiated settlement, while making clear that may not happen.
"No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran but we're going to try," Rubio said.
Iran has threatened to strike U.S. bases in the Middle East if it is attacked by U.S. forces but on Sunday took a conciliatory line.
"For the sake of an agreement's durability, it is essential that the U.S. also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns," foreign ministry deputy director for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
"Common interests in the oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments, and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations," Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers had not secured U.S. economic interests.
In 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact that had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme, and re-applied tough economic sanctions on Tehran.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that a U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday, a meeting later confirmed to Reuters by a senior Iranian official on Sunday.
"Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be traveling, I think they are traveling right now, to have important meetings and we'll see how that turns out," Rubio said, without providing further details.
While talks leading to the 2015 nuclear pact were multilateral, the current negotiations are confined to Iran and the United States, with Oman acting as mediator.
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi left Tehran for Geneva to take part in the indirect nuclear talks with the U.S. and meet the head of the UçNç nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, and others, his ministry said.
Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled Iran's readiness to compromise on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was "in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal."
The senior official referred to the Iranian atomic chief's statement on Monday that the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions as an example of Iran's flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Tehran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in past negotiations, with Washington viewing enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons. Iran denies seeking such weapons.
In June, the U.S. joined Israel in a series of air strikes that targeted Iranian nuclear sites.
The U.S. is also stepping up economic pressure on Iran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the U.S. would work to reduce Iran's oil exports to China, Axios reported on Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80% of Iran's oil exports so any reduction in that trade would significantly lower Iran's oil revenue.

AI got personal last week, and it's more complicated than we think

analysis
Artificial intelligence got personal for me last week. It also became clear how quickly it's developing now and that it is more complicated than we thought.
A week ago, someone sent me a link to an online article describing a flaming confrontation between me and the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, Matt Comyn, on the set of 7.30.
The story was 2,000 words long, very detailed, and had pictures of Comyn and me arguing in front of 7.30 host Sarah Ferguson, before Matt throws away his microphone and storms off.
Not a word nor a photo of it was true. It was an AI fake. I won't link to it because it would draw more attention to it. The article was convincing, and many people have since written to me asking whether it is true.
Then that night, a bloke named Matt Shumer, who co-founded an AI company in New York City, published a 4,800-word essay headed Something Big is Happening, which has since gone viral.
In it, Shumer talks about two AI releases the previous week that came within minutes of each other.
He wrote: "… on February 5th, two major AI labs released new models on the same day: GPT-5.3 Codex from OpenAI, and Opus 4.6 from Anthropic (the makers of Claude, one of the main competitors to ChatGPT). And something clicked. Not like a light switch … more like the moment you realise the water has been rising around you and is now at your chest".
He went on to say: "I am no longer needed for the actual technical work of my job. I describe what I want built, in plain English, and it just … appears."
Mind you, cars have been doing this for a while. I got a call last week from someone at Tesla offering to show me his autonomous car. He says he tells it to drive to the airport and it does — he doesn't touch the steering wheel, the brake, or the accelerator for the entire trip. In Australia, it's against the law to sit in the back seat reading a book, but that is allowed in a few American cities, and driverless taxis are now doing 450,000 trips per week.
AI wake-up call
It's been a big week for wake-up calls.
On Tuesday, Mrinank Sharma, the head of safeguard research at Anthropic (the company that developed Claude AI), resigned, posting a letter on X: "The world is in peril. Not just from AI, or bioweapons, but from a whole series of interconnected crises unfolding in this very moment.
"We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our ability to affect the world, lest we face the consequences. Moreover, throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to let our values govern our actions."
He says he's going off to study poetry and devote himself to the practice of "courageous speech".
On Wednesday, I had coffee with a young man, 27, who decided a couple of years ago to start a business training people in how to use AI. It didn't work because he quickly realised there was no point teaching people to use something that was simply going to replace them. Instead, he's building an AI agent that will replace receptionists by answering the phone and dealing with customers' queries so they don't know it's not human. At this stage, he says, it will tell customers they're talking to an AI.
The AI will have all the company's data and be able to tell customers whatever they want to know.
On Wednesday night, our time, Jimmy Ba, one of the co-founders of Elon Musk's xAI, which developed Grok AI, also resigned. He posted this: "We are heading to an age of 100x productivity with the right tools. Recursive self-improvement loops likely go live in the next 12mo. It's time to recalibrate my gradient on the big picture. 2026 is gonna be insane and likely the busiest (and most consequential) year for the future of our species."
On Thursday, the head of AI at Microsoft, and one of the founders of Google's DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, told The Financial Times: "White-collar work, where you're sitting down at a computer, either being a lawyer or an accountant or a project manager or a marketing person — most of those tasks will be fully automated by an AI within the next 12 to 18 months."
How will investors respond?
It's now dawning on the world, including investors for the first time, that artificial intelligence is moving well ahead of any plans to deal with its consequences.
The near-simultaneous release of GPT-5.3 Codex by OpenAI, and Opus 4.6 by Anthropic was one of two events in early February that brought "AI fear" (as analysts call it) to the share market.
The first, on February 3, was Anthropic's release of plug-ins for Claude Cowork that will allow it to automate professional work, starting but not ending with the back-office work done in law firms.
Software and data firms like Salesforce, Thompson Reuters and Adobe saw their shares drop sharply, and in Australia, software companies like Technology One, Xero and Wisetech did likewise.
Last weekend, a Chinese lab called OpenBMB released an AI agent called MiniCPM-o 4.5, which is open-source and has 9 billion parameters.
It runs on local devices, like laptops and smartphones, and doesn't need data centres, so suddenly there are question marks around the massive investment in them.
I asked Google's Gemini AI how that compares with its own parameters. It replied that it "likely" had more than a trillion parameters and remarked: "Comparing a model like MiniCPM-o 4.5 to a flagship like Gemini 3 Flash is a bit like comparing an agile, high-performance sports car to a massive, hyper-efficient logistics network. They both get the job done, but their 'engines' are built very differently."
Oh. Right.
LoadingThe fourth industrial revolution is here
As I lay awake at the end of the week staring at the ceiling in the dark, I realised that my earlier frames of reference for AI and what's being called the fourth industrial revolution were suddenly inadequate.
I had been thinking about AI as both a return to labour that is owned — a part of capital — rather than employed, about two centuries after the abolition of human slavery, and simultaneously as a collapse in the price of intelligence.
The price of intelligence is falling towards zero in the same way that the price of communication fell with the invention of packet switching and TCP/IP. That is, the internet.
Those two aspects of AI explain why every company in the world is rushing to use it: costs will fall, and productivity will surge. As a result, so will profits — and every corporate executive is required to increase profits.
Moreover, company owners and their boards are motivated to shift production from labour to capital wherever possible because capital is where wealth is created, while employed labour drains it.
But what's happening is far more profound even than the issues of cost and ownership, as profound as they are.
We are building — or perhaps have already built — an alien intelligence that thinks at least one thousand times faster than any human, knows every bit of knowledge that every human has ever known, is evolving a million times faster than human evolution and will end up vastly outnumbering humans.
Calling it another industrial revolution seems insufficient.

Conflicts, UN reform dominate close of water-themed AU summit
Leaders call for ceasefires across the continent, particularly in Sudan, and renew demands for UN Security Council reform as mounting crises overshadow development priorities
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
African leaders wrapped up a two-day summit on Sunday with urgent calls to end conflicts across the continent and renewed demands for reform of the UN Security Council, as mounting security crises overshadowed the gathering’s stated agenda of water issues.
Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye, the newly elected African Union (AU) chair, said restoring stability remains the bloc’s foremost priority.
“We need to silence the guns. We need peace on this continent. We need stability on this continent, and we have a program for that,” he told a closing press briefing.
AU Commission Chair Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said the leaders also stressed the link between development and stability, warning that access to basic services remains critical for long-term peace.
“Without equitable access to water and sanitation, we cannot talk of public health or inclusive development or sustainable prosperity for our people,” he said.
In a separate press briefing, AU Peace and Security Commissioner Bankole Adeoye described the situation in Sudan as “the worst humanitarian crisis globally” and said the conflict, which began in April 2023, remains “virtually unreported” despite its scale and impact on regional stability.
Taking questions on Sudan, he told reporters: “Our number one goal is a permanent, unconditional, inclusive, immediate ceasefire.”
He also reiterated Africa’s long-standing position on global governance reform, saying the UN Security Council must better reflect contemporary realities.
“The UN Security Council must reflect the world of today,” Adeoye said.
Adeoye added that AU leaders reaffirmed their policy of “zero tolerance” for unconstitutional changes of government.
Although the summit was officially convened under a theme focused on water security and sanitation, the issue received less attention in its final hours as leaders concentrated on urgent peace and security challenges across the continent.

Why a packet of Arnott's Shapes could help determine the 'case of the century'

ACCC takes Coles to court over 'illusory' discounts in 'case of the century'
Thousands of customers throw a box of Arnott's Shapes into their shopping trolleys each week — one of a dozen purchases that could help decide a bombshell case playing out in the federal court from today.
The ACCC has accused Coles of ripping off customers with fake discounts. And if the supermarket giant loses, it could face a huge fine and massive reputational damage.
Customers could also receive cash back from a class action lawsuit that might follow, and corporations could be forced to change how they price their products — especially discounts.
But if Coles successfully defends itself, the blowback for the ACCC will be significant, with implications for an upcoming, almost identical, lawsuit against Woolworths.
"The stakes are enormous," former consumer watchdog boss Allan Fels said.
"The ACCC will certainly be feeling nervous, as would Coles.
"It's the case of the century because it affects not only Coles and Woolies, but millions of businesses who discount [and their customers]."
Coles accused of 'illusory' Down Down discounts
The court will look at the prices Coles charged for 245 common household products, ranging from paper towels to dog food and yoghurt, under its prominent "Down Down" promotions.
The ACCC alleges Coles misled shoppers in stores and online because the products were sold at one regular price for at least six months before being jacked up for a short period and then slashed as part of a "Down Down" promotion.
ACCC chair Gina Cass-Gottlieb said the discounts — which ran between February 2022 and May 2023 — were fake or "illusory".
Shoppers thought they were getting a bargain, but they were paying either the same amount as or more than the product's regular price, the ACCC claims.
Twelve representative products have been chosen to save the court time and avoid examining hundreds of items.
For example, the regular price for a box of Strepsils was $5.50. This price remained on the product for more than 640 days before being increased to $7 for 28 days, then reduced during a "Down Down" promotion.
The sales ticket customers saw for Strepsils showed a "Down Down" price of $6.00 and a "was" price of $7; however, that was 9 per cent higher than the regular price of $5.50.
Professor Fels said the period of time Coles increased prices before discounting them would be crucial.
"If those price drops had been preceded by big price rises, then the court may well conclude it was misleading and deceptive," he said.
The ACCC said the case was partly prompted by social media users alerting it to the pricing practices.
One of those social accounts belonged to Paniora Nukunuku, who posts tongue-in-cheek videos on TikTok questioning supermarket prices.
One post showed Mr Nukunuku comparing the cost of tinned corned beef at Coles to Aldi.
"Corned beef is not a luxury food," he says.
"No-one should be having to feel like they have to choose between the basics."
Coles told the ABC Mr Nukunuku was "not comparing like-for-like items" and was "comparing a house brand product with a proprietary product".
Meanwhile, consumer group Choice said members had expressed growing concern about the way supermarkets advertised discounts.
"We've all experienced feeling bombarded by just the sheer number of colourful tags," director of campaigns, Andy Kelly, said.
"There's some important contextual information being left off."
In 2023, Choice called out Coles for increasing the price on a product it had promised to have "locked" for a fixed period.
In response, Coles refunded customers for price increases on 20 items.
How Coles plans to strike back
Coles is fighting back, rejecting the central allegation that the "Down Down" discounts were "illusory".
It claims the price rises were justified due to inflation hammering suppliers and a surge in global commodity prices, as well as in packaging, freight, utilities, and international shipping.
Australia experienced a 30-year high in inflation when the alleged misconduct occurred, peaking at 8.4 per cent in December 2022.
In 243 of 255 instances, Coles says suppliers requested a higher shelf price or changes to promotional funding.
Coles also defended raising prices for up to six weeks before cutting them to the "Down Down" price.
It was "a genuine discount from that shelf price", the company said.
The supermarket chain said the original price was no longer relevant to the discount because it had been "superseded" due to increasing costs.
Another former ACCC boss, Graeme Samuel, said the court may probe what Coles intended when it briefly raised prices before discounting them, and whether that was justified by suppliers requesting increases and later seeking the price dropped to entice customers back to their product.
The court has granted Coles the right to keep certain information confidential, including an expert report and key witness affidavits.
Coles said the material was mainly related to "commercially sensitive information" that it did not want competitors to see.
Senior executives and board members will not be giving evidence.
What's at stake?
If it loses, Coles faces a substantial fine.
By comparison, Volkswagen copped a $125 million fine for misleading consumers over diesel emissions while Qantas coughed up $100 million for selling tickets to flights it already cancelled.
Professor Fels said he would not be surprised if Coles was forced to pay even more if the allegations were proven.
"If Coles loses, the penalties will be in the hundreds of millions of dollars," he predicted.
Mr Samuel agreed that any loss would result in a substantial penalty.
"Frankly, they deserve to have the book thrown at them."
Mr Nukunuku said he would be watching closely.
"A lot of people would feel validated on the cost-of-living experience," he said.
The outcome of the case will also have immediate implications for what is known as "Was, Now" retail pricing.
"Such a shake-up would bring a benefit to consumers because they'll be better informed about what they are buying and will lead to sharper competition," Professor Fels said.
However, if the ACCC loses, there will be "serious consequences" for the watchdog, including difficult questions about whether it was overly influenced by the political firestorm around price gouging.
"There will be suggestions, accusations that they instituted these proceedings because of the political pressure that was around at the time to blame Coles and Woolworths," Mr Samuel said.
What about supermarket 'price gouging'?
No matter what the court decides, it will not offer a verdict on so-called price gouging.
Coles reported a net profit of $1.08 billion last financial year and is the second biggest supermarket chain with more than 840 stores.
Together with Woolworths, it has almost two-thirds of the market cornered.
An ACCC inquiry dodged the question about whether the supermarkets charged excessive prices or had unreasonable margins, only saying the big two players had little incentive to compete on price.
Coles rejected this, saying "competition is very much alive in the grocery sector".
But in a major change, the federal government has banned "excessive pricing of groceries" from July 1.
The ban prohibits large retailers from charging prices that exceed the cost of supply plus a reasonable margin.
The consumer watchdog has flagged that the ban would likely result in it taking further court action against the supermarkets.

Bangladesh invites top diplomats of S.Asian nations for government swearing-in ceremony
297 newly elected lawmakers, Cabinet members set to be sworn in Tuesday in front of parliament building
DHAKA, Bangladesh
Bangladesh has invited top diplomats of South Asian nations for a new government ceremony in the capital Dhaka after new lawmakers were elected in last week's general elections, officials announced Sunday.
The newly elected lawmakers and Cabinet members will be sworn in on Tuesday, ushering in the first new parliament following the 2024 uprising that ended Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.
Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin will swear in new lawmakers, and the president will do the same for the new Cabinet.
In line with tradition, guests, among them the foreign ministers of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) members -- including Afghanistan, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and others -- have been invited to the swearing-in to be held in front of the parliament building.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which secured a two-thirds majority in Thursday's election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, will form the government with party leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister.
In Thursday's election, the BNP got 49.97% of the vote while the Jamaat-e-Islami party-led alliance Jamaat got 31.76%, according to the country's election commission.
Jamaat ally the National Citizen Party (NCP), the youth group that led the 2024 uprising, got 3.5% of the vote.
Jamaat seeks recount for 32 seats, announces protests
After securing 77 seats, the Jamaat alliance accepted the results overall but claimed some irregularities in the process.
Jamaat said Sunday that they are seeking a recount in 32 constituencies over alleged irregularities and counting manipulation.
Assistant Secretary General Hamidur Rahman Azad told reporters that they saw irregularities during the voting, adding: “There is a demand for revaluation in 32 seats. We will follow the legal process.”
He also announced protests for Monday, saying: “We will take the oaths of office, go to parliament, and play a constructive role. At the same time, the streets will also be open for us.”
More than 127.6 million people in Bangladesh were eligible to cast ballots, and the country saw a voter turnout of 59.44%, up from 41.8% in the January 2024 elections.
Results in three seats were held up or suspended, two due to court orders and one due to the death of a candidate.
The commission also published the results of the Thursday referendum on constitutional reforms, with votes in its favor exceeding 60%.
In a rare political gesture, Rahman visited Jamaat Ameer chief Shafiqur Rahman at his residence in Dhaka on Sunday. Some top leaders from the both parties were present and discussed issues, including post-election developments.
Rahman is scheduled to hold another such visit to NCP chief Nahid Islam, a key figure of the 2024 upspring, at his Dhaka residence.

Zelensky announces new support packages for Ukraine
According to Ukrinform, he stated this in his evening address following his participation in the Munich Security Conference.
"There were many meetings, and most importantly – there will be new support packages for Ukraine. The key priority is missiles for air defense, for protection against ballistic missiles. This has been issue number one throughout this entire winter, as you know. That is why we discussed it in Munich with virtually every leader who can truly help us. Also with Marco Rubio, the U.S. Secretary of State," he said.
He expressed hope that the agreements would work as intended. Air defense, Zelensky emphasized, is a daily necessity.
As Ukrinform reported, during his speech at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky showed European politicians a visualization of the massive strike carried out by Russian forces against Ukraine on the night of February 12.

Kansas woman jailed for falsely accusing estranged astronaut spouse of committing a crime while on the ISS
Summer Heather Worden, the estranged spouse of NASA astronaut Anne McClain, was sentenced to three months in prison
- Bookmark
A Kansas woman has been sentenced to jail time after prosecutors said she falsely accused her estranged spouse, NASA astronaut Anne McClain, of committing a crime while on the International Space Station.
Summer Heather Worden, a former Air Force intelligence officer, was sentenced Thursday to three months in federal prison and two years of supervised release, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Texas. The 51-year-old was also ordered to pay $210,000 in restitution.
This comes after Worden pleaded guilty to lying to law enforcement in November.
The case stems from allegations Worden made against McClain in July 2019. The court heard evidence that Worden “falsely accused her former spouse of illegally accessing her bank account from the International Space Station while the couple was going through a divorce,” according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
Investigators learned Worden “opened her bank account in April 2018, and both parties accessed it until January 2019, when Worden changed the account credentials,” the agency said. They also said Worden gave her wife access to her bank records and login credentials as early as 2015.
“Even after an internal investigation exonerated the former spouse, Worden continued promoting the false claim to news outlets and hired a media consultant to amplify the claim. The evidence further showed Worden publicly released her former spouse’s personal information,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.
Worden was allowed to remain out on bond until her sentencing hearing. She’s now expected to “voluntarily surrender to a Federal Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future,” prosecutors said.
McClain, 46, has maintained that she had permission to access Worden’s accounts, The New York Times reports.
In November, the NASA astronaut said Worden “presented a story to federal investigators and to the media with the intention of harm,” according to the Times.
“From the outset, there was no evidence supporting her claims, and overwhelming evidence disproving them. As I continue my public service, I remain committed to the values that have defined my career and which held up under the closest scrutiny,” she added.
McClain joined NASA in 2013. During her first spaceflight, she spent more than 200 days as a flight engineer and completed two spacewalks.
Most recently, she commanded NASA’s SpaceX Crew-10 mission, which launched in March 2025. McClain served as a flight engineer for 146 days and completed a nearly six-hour spacewalk during that mission.
The Independent has contacted Worden’s attorney and McClain for comment.

Malian forces 'neutralize' about dozen terrorists in central region, army says
Operation carried out between Bambara-Maoude and Inadjatafane in Douentza
ISTANBUL
Malian forces "neutralized" around a dozen terrorists Sunday during an operation between Bambara-Maoude and Inadjatafane in the Douentza region, the army said in a statement.
The statement did not identify the groups targeted.
“No effort will be spared by the FAMa to ensure the protection and free movement of people and their property,” the army said, referring to the Malian Armed Forces by its French acronym.
Mali has faced persistent insecurity for more than a decade, particularly in its central and northern regions, where armed groups linked to militant organizations and local conflicts have carried out attacks against security forces and civilians.
The army regularly announces counterterrorism operations as it seeks to reassert control over territory and curb the activities of armed groups, especially in areas near key population centers and along the Niger River corridor.

Liberal Party divided over policy direction as Angus Taylor plots right-wing political shift
In short:
Senior sources have told Four Corners that the Liberal Party is discussing an immigration approach inspired by a controversial UK Labour policy.
It is part of a broader realignment taking place in right-wing politics in Australia amid the rise of populism overseas.
Liberal MPs are divided over whether to overhaul the party's direction or maintain tradition to win back voters who have abandoned them.
Internal machinations in the right wing of the Liberal Party are threatening to divide the party further after a tumultuous start to the political year that culminated in a change of leadership.
New leader Angus Taylor is seeking to unify the party that has already divorced its Coalition partner this year, and his elevation to the top job all but confirms the Liberals will shift further to the right in a bid to counter One Nation's surging popularity.
A tougher immigration policy is central to his vision as opposition leader, with him declaring on Friday "the door must be shut" to people who do not align with "Australian values".
The party is yet to announce any policies, but senior sources have told Four Corners that the Liberal Party is actively discussing a controversial approach to immigration inspired by a recent UK Labour policy.
Late last year, following a new hardline immigration approach, UK Labour announced it would deny visas to three African nations unless their governments cooperated with the UK's efforts to return their citizens whose visas had been cancelled.
By February, all three had capitulated and assisted the UK in returning their citizens.
Under the policy being considered by the Liberals, if a country refused to take back its citizens who had been rejected by Australia, then Australia would blacklist that country — or potentially a zone within it — and ban its citizens from getting a visa.
This could include areas like parts of the Philippines, which have in the past been hotbeds of terrorism.
The proposed policy, which Mr Taylor is understood to be considering, is part of a broader radical realignment taking place in right-wing politics in Australia.
But the shift is controversial within the already divided Liberal Party and goes beyond a battle between moderates and conservatives, who are at odds about how to win back voters who have abandoned the party.
There is a deeper rift in the conservative wing between those who believe the party should emulate the populist strategy of Donald Trump and the UK's Nigel Farage, or stick to the economic tradition of John Howard and Peter Costello.
With its right wing now in control, behind the scenes, the Liberal Party is embroiled in a contest between those who want to overhaul their party's direction and those who believe doing so would mean political death.
United right?
After claiming victory in Friday's leadership spill, Mr Taylor declared the party "must look ahead and put the disagreements of the recent past behind us".
But his elevation to leader suggests the party will shift further to the right on cultural issues and immigration, which threatens to further divide the party.
Mr Taylor represents a group of Liberal MPs who believe that the traditional approach to economics is the way to win back voters in the centre.
On the other side is an Andrew Hastie-led group, which is pushing for a more populist, "Australia First" approach that focuses on reducing immigration and investing in local manufacturing.
Last year, Mr Hastie's group succeeded in dumping net zero climate emissions from the party's policy platforms. His next campaign was immigration, which he linked to higher house prices, and it quickly became one of the party's top priorities.
Despite Mr Hastie's withdrawal from the leadership race in January, the broader rupture over the party's future direction has not been silenced. He and his fellow populists were instrumental in installing Mr Taylor as leader and are likely to be rewarded with frontbench roles.
Victorian Liberal senator James Paterson, a key powerbroker in the conservative wing who swung his support behind Mr Taylor, said the change in leadership was about securing the party's traditional supporters.
"The nine months since the election have taken us to new lows, and that's due to a variety of factors, but it's very clear that a big chunk of people who used to have faith and trust in the Liberal Party have walked away from us," he told Four Corners.
"The first and most important task in politics is to lock down your base … our first task is to earn back the trust and support of the people who used to vote for us, who are now exploring other options."
Senator Paterson, however, conceded that tensions existed within the party's conservative wing over the way forward.
"Of course. There should be, right? We've just suffered our worst-ever election defeat and then plunged even further in our public support since," he said.
"Our traditional supporters are telling us they don't recognise what we stand for and they think we're divided, so of course, you would expect that there would be a debate. There has to be a debate."
But the conservative forces pulling the party are not just internal.
Searching for the 'centre right'
The rise of One Nation has rattled the Coalition and motivated members of the Liberal and National parties to take a harder line on immigration and the economy, in an effort to avoid losing votes to the right-wing party.
That tougher stance was on display in Mr Taylor's first public appearance as opposition leader on Friday, with his vision for immigration and economic issues shared by his populist Liberal colleagues.
Senator Paterson denied that the party was shifting to the right to appeal to voters moving to One Nation.
"It's not really about left or right per se, but it is about demonstrating to our more conservative supporters that on issues like Australia's culture and national identity, on our symbols, on questions of values, that we are the traditional centre-right political party that they recognise," he said.
"They want to see us stand up for things like the flag and the anthem and the constitution and Australia Day and our Anzac tradition because they see in us, or they hope to see in us, a patriotic Australian party."
That approach, however, is not without issue amongst more moderate members of the Liberal Party.
South Australian Liberal senator Andrew McLachlan is concerned about the dangers of a hardline approach to immigration, particularly in the wake of the Bondi terror attack, when language used by some politicians to describe Muslims has sharpened.
"I think it's extremely unhelpful. For those of us that have longstanding relationships with the Muslim community, we need to give them reassurance they're not being singled out," he told Four Corners.
"I'm a veteran of Afghanistan. I have very strong ties to the Afghan community. They're devastated post-Bondi. They're Australians. They've come here to escape radicalisation."
Charlotte Mortlock has long been dedicated to the Liberal Party. In addition to being a member, she founded Hilma's Network, a group dedicated to getting more Liberal women elected.
On Sunday, Ms Mortlock announced she had quit the Liberal Party and would step down from her role as executive director at Hilma's "due to recent events".
She believes the populists are trying to appeal to the fringe to attract votes and it won't work.
"One of the biggest things that I think is a problem is that we have politicians who have been completely algorithmed," she told Four Corners.
"We've always had the pub test, but people are replacing that with their social media feed, and they are thinking that the world is a place that it is not, and they are living in an alternative reality.
"The huge concern there is that they're creating public policy for that virtual reality.
"There are people in Australian politics on both the far left and the far right. They speak with such a conviction that they are so certain that they have the finger on the pulse. They have their finger on their social media algorithm."
Campaign problems
Supercharging the algorithm is conservative lobby group Advance, which is flooding social media with a fierce anti-immigration campaign and promoting a nostalgic vision of a whiter Australia.
Advance launched in 2018, but it's only in the last few years that its donations have skyrocketed — from $5 million in 2022–23 to more than $13 million last year.
That's more than double the donations to left-wing activist group GetUp! and on par with the Business Council of Australia.
The latest donations to political parties also showed that $895,000 was donated to Advance last year by Hancock Prospecting, the company of billionaire mining figure Gina Rinehart, who is a supporter of Pauline Hanson and One Nation.
Advance has made clear that Mr Hastie is one of their preferred Liberals by promoting him in its social media videos, and Liberal MPs have told Four Corners about the impact the group is having on the Liberal party room by pushing right-wing agendas and campaigning against moderate Liberals.
Four Corners has confirmed that senior Liberal strategists are concerned that Advance is cannibalising the donations that would come their way, while it is being promoted by Liberals like Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who has been advertised as a prominent speaker at Advance's blockbuster conference later this month.
There is also internal anger that Advance has attacked Liberals it sees as having moderate views, including Sussan Ley, Andrew Bragg and Tim Wilson, particularly given it has received a $500,000 donation from a Liberal Party-linked fund, the Cormack Foundation.
Moderate Liberal frontbencher Mr Wilson said the donation was wrong.
"I don't think any people should give any money to any organisation that campaigns against Liberal MPs unless their objective is to see Labor, teal or Greens MPs elected,"he said.
"So I would dissuade anybody from doing that. I don't see that it serves any purpose."
Advance declined to be interviewed by Four Corners, but in a statement said: "In our experience, people who run down Advance in the media always have an agenda of their own.
"Advance does not support any political party, but will always encourage politicians whose values and ideas align with our supporters and criticise those who don't."
Divided direction
Former Liberal Party strategist Tony Barry helped shape the party's direction, and is now watching from the sidelines as a pollster.
"At the moment, the Liberal Party is a man drowning, and so their future is entirely dependent on shaping an economic narrative that appeals to those Liberal-coded voters out there to grow their primary vote," he told Four Corners.
"The danger for the Liberal Party is if it moves to the fringes, it'll start getting fringe political results.
"There's simply no pathway back to government without winning some of those teal seats."
Trying to reclaim inner-city seats at future elections will be more difficult if the Coalition considers working with One Nation to form government — a suggestion firmly rejected by James Paterson.
"We're not looking for any more dance partners," he said.
"As you might have seen over the last nine months, we've had enough challenges managing our existing dance partner. I don't think we need a third one."
Results from recent polls suggest One Nation's messaging is working, but how many votes it will attract on issues such as a harsh line on immigration is the existential question now facing the Liberal Party.
"I think the real debate is between those who think that we're just a little bit off, and those who think we're a long way off," Queensland Liberal MP Garth Hamilton said.
"I think we've been a long way off for a little while now, and I think that's the real source of tension here.
"Do we just keep on kind of refining where we've been and making small changes, or are there some significant departures to how we've been working that we need to do?"
While One Nation's rise in polling is still untested at an election, Tony Barry is confident the Liberal Party can turn its fortunes around.
"The Liberal Party needs an enema, but I think its future can be secured, but only if it pivots that economic narrative and differentiates from Labor with some bold policies," he said.
"The pathway back for the Liberal Party is not to keep shadowing One Nation with those policy agenda settings, but to offer some economic hope.
"That might be in the form of income tax cuts, addressing some of the structural problems in the economy to show that there is hope for the future.
"At the moment, they're just creating and chasing noise."

Australia wants to make international hunting harder for shooters like Darren. He says it won't work

Watch The Feed's Short Documentary on Australia's Trophy Hunters
This article contains images of animals that may upset readers.
In a trophy room just outside Goulburn in regional NSW, glassy eyes watch from every direction. Antlers stretch toward the ceiling and the air smells of chemicals used to preserve dead things and the dust that inevitably settles over years of collecting.
Floor to ceiling, the walls are covered in taxidermy: some heads, some full bodies. Couches have skins thrown over them and coffee tables are decked with tusks.
Darren Plumb gestures toward mounted animals and says that almost everything in the room, he’s hunted.
Mountain zebras from South Africa, black bear from Canada, brown hyena from Namibia, Himalayan tahr, jackal, steenbok, oryx, kudu,and caracal.
"In excess of ninety," he says. Plumb, who is now a board member in NSW for the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party, has been hunting since he was five. Soon he’ll be 60.
"Some people run a marathon to get a medal," he says.
These are what he refers to as his medals — markers of achievement for someone who grew up in a small town of about 2,700 people, and went on to see rural corners of the world many travellers never reach.
"It can be said that it's hours of nothing and then 30 seconds of a total adrenaline rush," Plumb says.
"It's the camaraderie. It's not actually the killing of an animal, it's the getting out there, just trying to see if you could outwit an animal on their terms."
When asked how much he’s spent, he laughs. "I tried to add that up one night and stopped. It was just phenomenal."
At least $100,000, he offers.
He points out some of the more recognisable animals in the room.
"Warthog," he says, gesturing. "They’re cute because they’re ugly."
He says Disney has stacked the deck of public sympathy, turning some animals into familiar, likeable characters and leaving others without that glow.
For hunters, he says, that means the public respond with emotion, not context.
The fight over Australia’s hunting trophies
For years, Australians have boarded flights bound for Africa, North America and beyond to hunt giraffes, zebras, black bears, polar bears and more, and bring their remains home.
They call them trophies, but even among hunters, that word can feel uncomfortable.
At the federal election last May, the animal welfare organisation Humane World for Animals (HWFA), helped secure political support for a wider ban on trophy-hunting imports. Several independents, including David Pocock, as well as the Greens and the Labor Party, signalled they were in favour.
In a statement to The Feed, the federal government said: "The Albanese Government supports this initiative, with work being undertaken by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water to progress it."
The proposed ban, if accepted as is, would be Australia’s toughest crackdown yet, blocking the 20 most popular hunting trophies from entering the country in a bid to deter people from travelling to hunt them.
Over the past decade, Australians have imported — or applied to import — more than 1,000 hunting trophies from 46 different mammal species protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), including 299 American black bears, 147 Hartmann’s mountain zebras, 47 hippos, 17 polar bears and 16 giraffes.
On the list are many of the animals that line Darren Plumb’s walls.
Some, like the red lechwe, a species of antelope, are recognised as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Others, like the American black bear — Australia’s number one imported hunting trophy — are classified as least concern, with growing populations.
Nicola Beynon, head of campaigns for HWFA, has been one of the leading voices behind the push for change.
"Trophy hunting has no social licence in this century. It's a practice that I think most people wish was left behind in the last century," she says.
While US hunters import the majority of global trophies, Australia is among the top 10 trophy-importing nations in the world, according to HWFA estimates.
In 2024, Botswana’s then President Mokgweetsi Masisi hit back at Germany after officials proposed tighter restrictions on elephant trophy imports, offering to send 20,000 elephants to Germany and asking how Germany could have an opinion when Botswana had rebounded elephant numbers to the largest population in the world.
Namibia’s former environment and tourism minister, Pohamba Shifeta, has similarly warned that blanket import bans could harm conservation and rural livelihoods, arguing that without alternatives to replace hunting revenue, "both our people and wildlife will suffer".
But despite pushback, Beynon says Australia has a right to back a prohibition.
"We've already prohibited the trophies of elephants, lions and rhinos, and there's all sorts of contrabands that we say we don't want in this country."
Putting a price on a head
Hunters such as Plumb see it differently. They argue that if people understood how the system actually works, the reaction might be less visceral.
"The keyboard warriors," he says, "have most likely never set foot in the countries where those animals are taken".
"If you take Africa, for example, the local communities look after their animals because they know there’s going to be someone like me that’s going to come over and shoot a zebra," he said. "I’m going to pay $1,000 to shoot that zebra."
To Plumb, the logic is simple: giving wildlife an economic value creates an incentive to protect it. He describes it as a cycle that feeds both community and funds conservation — and it's the common argument made by hunters.
He says trophy hunters only target old, solitary animals.
"So you're really looking for an older animal," Plumb says. "They either die of old age or, in my case, hopefully I shoot them, I do the taxidermy and put them on the wall and then I can look at them for the rest of my life."
He says meat rarely goes to waste, and hunts are regulated with government-issued permits.
"Meat and protein goes back to the communities," he says. "In Africa it’s all used. In North America and Canada, the meat by law has to be taken and used, it can’t be left on the mountain."
'Interfering with natural selection'
Nicola Beynon says that in practice, the idea that only specific animals are targeted is a fallacy.
"Hunters are going for the animals that have some of the most impressive physical traits," she says.
"You’re removing the strongest, healthiest animals, weakening the gene pool and the resilience of their populations … you’re interfering with survival of the fittest."
She also questions how hunts are carried out.
"These are tourists, they're not always skilled hunters," Beynon says.
"They can use hunting weapons that are cruel, like bows and arrows, which aren’t very good at getting a quick kill."
The exception, not the rule
In a reserve near Cape Town, South African freelance journalist Adam Cruise watches giraffes wander past, unbothered by the sound of a nearby vehicle.
Cruise broke the story of Cecil the lion — the research-tagged animal killed in 2015 after being lured out of Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe.
The well-known male lion was killed by an American trophy hunter. Zimbabwean authorities said the lion had been shot with a bow and arrow and then tracked for hours before being killed with a rifle.
The global backlash helped trigger Australia’s move to restrict lion trophy imports.
"It was really nice to see those giraffe just ambling slowly past and not being skittish. On a trophy hunting ranch you would see they would run away straight away at the sound of a vehicle," he says.
Cruise has spent years examining the claims made by hunters and industry bodies and says the argument that trophy hunting benefits local communities frustrates him.
He calls it patronising and a convenient excuse to hunt.
He points to the practice of distributing meat, particularly elephant meat, to communities already dealing with human–wildlife conflict and describes it as an insult.
"I mean, it's like it's, you're in a zoo and the zookeeper comes along and tosses a piece of meat into your cage. That doesn't help people at all. It doesn't stave off hunger because it's once in a while."
"In 50 years of trophy hunting, these communities remain as poor as ever."

Follow the money
Independent research, including peer-reviewed studies in major conservation journals, shows that in many African countries, only a small share of trophy-hunting revenue reaches the communities living alongside wildlife.
Studies by Economists at Large and research published in journals including Biological Conservation tell a similar story: in many places, much of the money leaks out to foreign-owned operators, quotas are weakly managed, and the benefits end up concentrated among a small local elite — meaning many communities see little direct gain.
"Most of that money is going back to the trophy hunting company, which is also often foreign-owned. When they are employing locals, they're employing very few of them and on very low wages," Beynon says.
But there are exceptions hunters often point to — and researchers agree they’re real, just not the norm.
Namibia: A rare success story
Namibia’s community conservancy model is widely cited as the most successful version of trophy hunting in Africa.
There, communities co-manage land and receive guaranteed revenue-sharing from hunts. A study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America shows this model has supported anti-poaching patrols, habitat protection, and local salaries.
Researchers emphasise, however, that the model succeeds because locals have real decision-making power and strict governance structures, not because trophy hunting inherently produces conservation outcomes.
In Pakistan, animal numbers surged
In Pakistan’s northern regions, trophy hunting of markhor, or screw-horned goat, and Himalayan ibex operates under a CITES — approved community management program.
In these regions, 80 per cent of trophy fees go directly to local communities, with the remaining 20 per cent returning to government conservation programs, according to Pakistan’s Wildlife Department and United Nations Development Programme reporting.
Multiple studies published in conservation journals and CITES case reviews show that markhor populations rebounded significantly in areas where communities controlled revenue and protected habitat.
In 2024, it was widely reported that a permit to hunt a flare-horned markhor sold for roughly US$180,000 ($270,000), the highest amount ever paid for the species.
‘It’s neocolonial’
Robbie Kroger, a South African Australian American hunter and content creator, runs an organisation with a mission to rebrand hunting’s image. He’s furious about Australia’s proposed ban.
"Australia through this ban is acting like a colonialist, actually a neocolonist".
"I cannot defend a rich, fat white person sitting behind an animal," he says. "I can defend this picture of us with all the schoolchildren that we just fed", showing a picture on his phone of himself and three other men standing with a group of schoolchildren.
Kroger doesn’t pretend the model is perfect. But he says hunting keeps land from being cleared for agriculture and in his view, that makes it a trade-off worth taking.
"Forget everything else. If we’re protecting habitat in Africa alone, for example, hunting protects 1.5 million square kilometres of habitat," he told The Feed from Memphis.
"Wouldn’t you want to use every tool we have?"
And he says in some remote areas, it’s the best viable option for generating income.
Kroger pulls out a photo of a local man he calls Peter, who lives in rural Zimbabwe. He says there isn’t a tourism lodge within 100km of Peter. Where tourists won’t go, hunters will.
"He will tell you that hunting elephants has changed his life from a protein perspective," Kroger says.
For Kroger, cruelty happens in nature anyway, so why not get paid for it?
"Mother nature, she’s a cruel, violent bitch. She’ll bring disease, she’ll bring starvation … Are you either going to get someone to pay you to do it or are you going to pay to do it?"
"It simply comes down that they hate the idea of hunting."
'Agriculture in disguise'
Cruise argues that while some species numbers have increased, the context matters.
"A lot of hunting people say our numbers of species are actually going up," he says.
"And that is true, but you’ve just got to look at the nature of what these species are. They’re not wild, they’re ranched."
He describes many hunting ranches as "agriculture in disguise".
"It falls under the agricultural ministry. It is not under the environmental ministry and the profits are agricultural. So admit it as such."
On many trophy properties, Cruise says target species are effectively farmed — artificially fed and selectively bred for larger horns or whiter pelts.
"It’s kind of like cattle ranching where the target species that hunters like to shoot are overstocked on small patches of fenced land," he says. "It’s not really the protection of nature or biodiversity."
A line in the sand
Plumb says that from his own trips, he’s seen the benefits firsthand — and that even if the system has flaws, he believes he’s contributed to something positive.
But he also acknowledges past mistakes, including "taking an immature animal" or "a long time ago, probably climbed over a fence I shouldn’t have".
On one point, Plumb and Beynon agree: a ban like this won’t stop people from travelling overseas to hunt if they really want to. Some within the hunting community told The Feed that Australians had hunted a lion just months ago and plan to bring back a sculpture instead.
"There won’t be any real-world effect," he says. "If a person wants to go to Africa and has the money to shoot a lion, they’ll shoot a lion."
But for Beynon, Cruise, and others pushing for change, that’s beside the point. For them, the ban is about where Australia chooses to draw the line.

Former Georgian Ejder 6×6 APCs Found in Syria

Former Georgian Ejder 6×6 armored personnel carriers (APCs), purchased from Turkey in 2009, have been spotted in service with Syria’s new army.
B-AREV published the photo on his page on the social media platform X.
The vehicles have been repainted in a sand-colored camouflage, replacing the distinctive Georgian tricolor scheme.
In the summer of 2025, APCs were recorded being transported in their original Georgian colors, though at the time, there was no clear confirmation that they were destined for Syria.
Confirmation came in December 2025, when the vehicles were publicly displayed during a parade in Damascus. The number of APCs transferred to Syria has not been disclosed.
Unlike other members of the Ejder family, the Ejder 6×6 did not achieve broad export success. Georgia was the only foreign customer, purchasing a total of 72 vehicles.
It is possible that Turkey repurchased some of the APCs as a relatively quick and low-cost way to equip Syria’s new army. It is also possible that Tbilisi received preferential terms or priority access to modern Turkish weapons in return.
During service in Georgia, the APCs were reported to suffer from limited engine power.
For the Georgian military, this was a significant drawback, as the vehicles’ performance declined in mountainous terrain and their cross-country mobility was limited under difficult conditions.
The relatively high ground clearance also resulted in a higher center of gravity, which affected stability. In some cases, vehicles overturned while cornering at speed or operating on rough terrain.
The Ejder 6×6 TTZA (Taktik Tekerlekli Zırhlı Araç — tactical wheeled armored vehicle) has a combat weight of about 18 tonnes, a maximum road speed of up to 110 km/h, and a range of approximately 800 km. Only the first and second axles are steerable.
The hull is made of hardened steel, providing all-round protection against small-arms fire and artillery fragments. Additional armor can be fitted to increase ballistic protection, although this option was not implemented on the Georgian vehicles.
A V-shaped hull bottom is designed to improve crew survivability, accommodating a crew of two and up to 10 troops, with protection against mines and improvised explosive devices.
The vehicle is also equipped with two rear-mounted water jets, allowing it to cross water obstacles at speeds of up to 9 km/h.
The Ejder 6×6 can be fitted with a remotely operated weapon station armed with either a 7.62 mm or 12.7 mm machine gun, as well as a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher. The Georgian Armed Forces operated the version equipped with the grenade launcher.
The platform can also accommodate other remotely operated turret systems with weapons of up to 90 mm caliber, expanding its potential combat roles.

Trump sanctions chief John Hurley poised to leave after friction with Bessent
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – Mr John Hurley, the Trump administration’s top sanctions official, is set to leave his post after friction with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr Hurley’s expected departure as Treasury’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence follows months of internal tension over the tactics and targets of US sanctions policy, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
His future remains unclear, with officials floating Mr Hurley for several ambassadorial roles, in an effort to keep a loyal and valued ally within the fold, the people said.
A senior administration official said that Mr Hurley is in talks with the White House for an ambassadorship and that Mr Hurley and Mr Bessent continue to have a great working relationship at Treasury.
His exit would mark the latest shakeup in senior ranks at the Treasury Department.
Mr Bessent’s first chief of staff, Dan Katz, left in the fall and his successor, Michael Friedman, left as well, according to some of the people. Mr Bessent’s top deputy stepped down in August, while the key post of undersecretary of international affairs remains unfilled.
Overall, the level of turnover has raised questions among current and former officials about stability inside one of the government’s most market-sensitive agencies.
The changes come as US sanctions toward resource-rich nations including Venezuela, Iran and Russia play an increasingly pivotal role for international investors, global energy flows and geopolitical risk.
In recent weeks, Treasury has been at the centre of the Trump administration’s push to roll back many restrictions on the Venezuelan oil industry
Mr Hurley has overseen Treasury’s TFI unit, a sprawling apparatus of roughly 1,000 employees that has become one of Washington’s key foreign policy tools. Over the past decade, the job has evolved into a front-line position shaping everything from oil exports to access to the dollar-based financial system.
A former hedge fund executive with ties to the late investing legend Julian Robertson, Mr Hurley was confirmed by the US Senate in July 2025 and emerged as a forceful advocate of assertive economic pressure.
Colleagues have described him as disciplined and analytical, with a strong belief in the role that sanctions can play in projecting American power abroad.
But tensions within Treasury have grown in recent months over how sanctions authorities get deployed, particularly as some of President Donald Trump’s top advisers pursued designations against political opponents, including foreign judicial officials and international institutions, several of the people said.
Some career staff raised concerns privately about reputational and diplomatic fallout, while others argued the measures were consistent with the administration’s broader strategic posture.
Unease within the agency has also grown as the US braces for its mutual evaluation report from the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force, where international assessors are expected to flag concerns over the recent scaling back of key anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing measures, some of the people said.

Tunisian police detain opposition figure Olfa Hamdi at airport
Tunisian police detained opposition figure Olfa Hamdi as she arrived at the country’s main airport on Sunday, local media reported, in the latest move against a critic of President Kais Saied.
Hamdi, leader of the Third Republic party, was detained shortly after disembarking from a flight, the reports said. She resides abroad and previously served as CEO of Tunisia's national carrier Tunisair.
Hamdi has repeatedly criticized Saied’s rule and called for the formation of a transitional government and early presidential elections.
Opposition figures described the arrest as part of a wider crackdown on dissent, as Tunisia grapples with deepening polarization since Saied assumed sweeping powers in 2021, a move critics have denounced as a coup.
Authorities made no immediate comment on the arrest. Reuters has been unable to contact Hamdi's lawyer or any of her relatives.
In early February, police arrested a member of parliament known for mocking the president, in what opposition called an effort to stifle critic voices.
Many opposition leaders, along with activists and journalists, are behind bars, with critics accusing Saied of having turned Tunisia into a prison since 2021.
Saied rejects the accusations, insisting that he is not a dictator and that the law applies to everyone, regardless of their position.

The billion-dollar move crime boss made for Australia’s top illicit cigarette brand

The billion-dollar move crime boss made for Australia’s top illicit cigarette brand
Just before his 40th birthday, Kaz Hamad traded the shadows for a global corporation. Now, he exerts a white-knuckle grip over the illicit tobacco market from the production floor to shops that dare not sell anything else. This is the story of how he did it.
Kazem Hamad’s crime empire has taken a major stake in the Manchester tobacco company in Dubai, cementing his grip on the illicit cigarette market from production to sale in hundreds of suburban shops across Australia.
Manchester United Kingdom, despite being illegal to import or sell in Australia, has become the most popular tobacco brand in the country as organised crime syndicates flood the market with cut-price, untaxed cigarettes, fuelling Melbourne’s so-called ‘tobacco war’.
Hamad, who was deported to Iraq in mid-2023, has emerged as the most powerful gangland boss in Melbourne’s underworld after creating a ‘cartel’ that controls the illicit tobacco market after a two-year campaign of firebombings and shootings.
The Australian Federal Police believes Hamad’s reach extends well beyond Victoria, with the cartel operating across five states and one territory in Australia.
The 41-year-old was arrested by Iraqi authorities in mid-January following intelligence provided by the Australian government. His current status in Iraq is unknown beyond a mugshot provided to Australian authorities by their counterparts overseas.
Four sources in law enforcement, intelligence and the tobacco industry, speaking on the condition of anonymity to disclose confidential information, say Hamad has taken a significant financial stake in the foreign tobacco company, which is headquartered in London but operates out of a free port zone in the United Arab Emirates.
Hamad’s involvement in Manchester has allowed his transnational criminal syndicate to reap massive profits by exerting control over every part of the illicit market, from production to import smuggling to wholesale distribution to street-level retail.
Hamad’s dominance over the market in Australia is rigidly enforced through violence, including running an extortion racket over hundreds, if not thousands, of shops around the country that are forced to sell the Manchester brand.
The profits are estimated to be in the billions of dollars.
Hamad’s involvement in Manchester came after he forced the surrender of major rivals, the Haddara crime family, in early 2024, taking control of their distribution networks, retail shops and profit share in the brand.
Under Manchester’s business model, the company produces billions of cigarettes in the emirate of Dubai, which are legally sold to exporters who ship them around the world. That is despite the brand failing to meet most countries’ packaging standards and its widespread use to evade tax.
The cigarettes are smuggled into Australia by criminal syndicates and then distributed to wholesalers and retail shops.
Commonly in drug trafficking networks – such as those handling cocaine – each link in the chain is controlled by a different criminal gang, often in different countries. This is because no single syndicate is strong enough to control the entire network.
Dr John Coyne, head of strategic policing and law enforcement at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, described Hamad’s arrangement as a “fully vertically integrated criminal enterprise”.
“Organised crime groups are looking for vertical integration because it gives you a surety of supply. It allows you to make maximum profits,” he said.
“It means being able to control parts of the supply chain that aren’t illegal. It’s illegal to bring the tobacco into Australia, but they can maximise their profits and coordination by taking control of the part of the supply chain where it’s legal to manufacture and export it.”
Federal and state law enforcement authorities have declined to comment on the record about Hamad’s involvement in the Manchester brand.
But sources say the connection between Manchester and organised crime syndicates in Australia is long-standing and has fuelled the explosion in the illicit tobacco market, years before Hamad seized control of the black market from the Middle East.
Quintessentially British?
Manchester United Kingdom is a British tobacco brand – on paper at least.
Its logo is a heraldic shield standing between two unicorns, the national animal of Scotland also featured in the UK’s royal coat of arms.
“Inspired by Manchester city, Britain’s metropolis and the ever-beating urban spot in London, Manchester cigarette brand took on, since its naissance, the city’s vibe, glam and charm,” the company’s promotional materials say.
The headquarters of “Manchester United Kingdom” is in the very heart of London’s West End, occupying a prime spot on historic Regent Street.
Manchester regularly shows up at tobacco trade fairs in the Middle East and the US, where its marquees look more like display cases for high-end jewellery than cigarettes.
But there are easily identifiable cracks in its cultivated image.
The flash address near The Langham hotel and high-end clothing shops are all for show.
Manchester United Kingdom, owned by J.S.S. Tobacco Ltd, is just one of hundreds of companies that “occupy” a suite in the building, a virtual office that has been described as a “scammers’ paradise” by the British media.
The suite has appeared as a registered “place of business” in multiple legal proceedings and document leaks related to tax-avoidance schemes.
Incorporation records show J.S.S. Tobacco Ltd has just one employee in Britain and its operation is so small it is not required to file financial paperwork, except a declaration that “the company confirms that its intended future activities are lawful”.
Manchester’s real home is the Jebel Ali Free Zone, on the outskirts of the city of Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates.
Jebel Ali is one of the busiest shipping ports in the world, serviced by a vast plain of factories and warehouses that enjoy special tax advantages, employment conditions and secrecy provisions governing their operations.
The UAE exports upwards of 100 billion cigarettes a year, making tobacco one of the country’s biggest non-oil exports.
The Jebel Ali Free Zone alone is home to more than 20 tobacco factories and has become a major transit point for illicit cigarettes smuggled into Australia, Europe and beyond, according to intelligence assessments and court records. The area accounts for 36 per cent of Dubai’s GDP.
The Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Centre at George Mason University in the US estimates the UAE is responsible for a quarter of the illicit cigarettes sold globally, making the country one of the biggest contributors to the black market.
This masthead does not suggest the Manchester brand or its agents are committing any crime. The cigarettes are manufactured legally and are a legal product when they are exported from Dubai.
Manchester brand cigarettes are made by at least three factories in Jebel Ali under licence from the ultimate corporate owner, Adam International FZCO.
Almost nothing is known about the operation of the company or its value, as the UAE does not mandate disclosure of anything but basic information about the more than 11,000 businesses operating inside the Jebel Ali Free Zone.
A corporate investigation report commissioned by this masthead only stated its primary business is the “trade of tobacco” and “financial information was not available”.
“The shareholder structure of Jebel Ali free zone companies in the United Arab Emirates is generally not recorded at the commercial register and is not publicly available,” the report said.
“The subject’s financial statements were not available in the course of our investigation and respondents contacted at the company were not prepared to release such documents.”
Behind this cloak of institutional secrecy, Manchester became a dominant brand in the illicit tobacco trade and forged deep connections to Australian organised crime.
Representatives for Manchester’s parent company in Dubai, Adam International FZCO, did not respond to requests for comment.
Long-time player
There have long been suspicions in law enforcement that Manchester had links to organised crime, going back almost to the brand’s founding.
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime researcher Ted Leggett said that for a long time, the position of tobacco companies had been to export their product to wholesalers and wash their hands of whatever happened next.
“If the wholesaler diverts that traffic into illicit channels, that’s not their problem,” he said.
But in Manchester’s case, there is little recourse for the brand to separate itself from the illegal markets their products get funnelled into.
Despite being manufactured legally in Dubai, Manchester cigarettes without health warnings can’t be legally sold in any major market in the world because they do not comply with packaging and graphic warning requirements in almost every jurisdiction.
That includes the countries with transit ports for shipments bound for Australia, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Thailand, which debunks any possible claim that the cigarettes are being manufactured to be sold in those areas.
“When a producer produces cigarettes, the packaging that they’re in is unique to the country of destination,” Leggett said.
“Those packages without health warnings can’t be sold in any country which covers, I think I calculated, 97 per cent of the adult population of the world.”
But there has also been more direct intelligence.
As part of a sting operation in 2018, a well-known smuggler was caught boasting to undercover police operatives that he personally knew the owner of Manchester because he was the first person to ever import the brand illegally into Australia in 2009.
The smuggler, Ahmed Masri, and a covert police officer travelled to Jebel Ali to arrange for a container to be packed with 9.5 million Manchester cigarettes.
“[Masri] told [the officer] that his tobacco supplier in Dubai was ready and waiting for his order and could be trusted and relied upon 100 per cent,” according to court records.
This is just one of hundreds of containers packed with Manchester cigarettes that have flooded the Australian market over the past 15 years.
It is not known what market share Manchester now commands because Australia’s law enforcement and intelligence community was caught unprepared by the explosion in the market.
A freedom of information request has revealed the Australian Border Force has been unable to track the rise of Manchester.
“[ABF operations] have advised that brand names of illicit tobacco seizures are not recorded. Therefore, the department is unable to provide data on brand names of illicit tobacco seizures,” the agency reported.
What the Department of Home Affairs does track is the total number of cigarettes it has seized across all brands, including Manchester, Double Happiness, Mac, Esse and others.
In 2025, more than 2.5 billion cigarettes were intercepted at the border, up almost 500 per cent from 423 million ‘sticks’ five years ago.
Industry market intelligence says Manchester is now the top-selling cigarette – legal or illegal – in Australia.
Tobacco is now also the second most valuable illegal commodity after drugs, according to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission.
“The billions of dollars of profit available continues to drive serious and organised crime involvement in illicit tobacco – now estimated to represent the majority share of Australia’s tobacco market,” a commission spokesperson said.
Before the rise of Hamad in mid-2023, the illicit market had been dominated in Victoria by the Haddara crime family, which built an empire of legitimate businesses in the hospitality, auto repair and entertainment industries off the back of illicit tobacco imports.
They also have extensive land and business holdings in Lebanon, sources say.
The Haddaras held a tight grip over the trade for more than a decade, arranging some of the largest importations of illegal cigarettes in Victoria at the time. For law enforcement trying to crack down on the market, the syndicate was the number one player.
Manchester shipping records, obtained by this masthead, show an influential member of the Haddara crime family organising shipments of nearly a quarter of a billion Manchester cigarettes from suppliers in the UAE in the first half of 2023.
In the hands of illicit retailers on the streets of Australia, that six-month supply alone would be worth more than $100 million.
Law enforcement sources say the Haddaras, who also have deep connections to organised crime in Lebanon and Dubai, parlayed this influence into a stake in the Manchester brand itself.
The Haddaras’ ability to influence the supply chain made it a major power in the attempted formation of an organised crime “commission” in early 2023 that would attempt to regulate control of the illicit market among a number of organised crime gangs and outlaw bikie clubs.
That ended in February 2024, following a relentless firebombing and shooting campaign allegedly waged by Hamad from his base in Iraq, where he ordered dozens of targeted attacks on Haddara-owned or linked tobacco shops and family businesses.
The speed of Hamad’s rise caught the Haddaras off guard. The crime family was soon backed into a corner and their network of close allies began to splinter.
The turning point was when patriarch Fadi Haddara, the subject of a $1 million murder contract, found GPS trackers attached to the undercarriage of his car.
Underworld sources at the time said the Haddaras paid $1 million to Hamad to be left in peace, and handed control of a vast network of business interests to their rivals.
That marked an end to the dominance of the Haddaras. However, some segments of the syndicates were co-opted into the new cartel created by Hamad, who continues to use their deep connections in international smuggling networks.
In July 2025, the member of the Haddara family who was orchestrating those mass exports in 2023 came together with members of the Hamad cartel in “meetings” in Lebanon that were also attended by the operator of a major Dubai-based cargo clearing company.
Images of the encounter show members of the Haddara family posing with Hamad’s associates outside a hillside property overlooking a valley. In other photographs, the group can then be seen sitting on a large wrap-around couch inside a room decorated with golden jugs and cups and old rifles, sharing plates of fruit and a hookah.
The same member of the Haddara clan had four months earlier met with the cargo clearing company operator in Dubai for dinner at a fancy restaurant overlooking the city’s skyline.
The blow to the original Melbourne-based Haddara syndicate is perhaps best encapsulated in a social media post by Fadi Haddara the month after the Dubai meeting, showing an image of actor Leonardo DiCaprio along with a quote.
“A year ago I would have died for certain people. A year later half of them are dead to me.”
Fadi Haddara did not respond to requests for comment when approached via his lawyer.

Push for Melbourne’s top science school to introduce gender quotas

Push for Melbourne’s top science school to introduce gender quotas
Two of Melbourne’s most sought-after state high schools will reach gender parity next year, marking the end of more than a decade of male-dominated enrolments.
The milestone has prompted calls for the state’s top specialist science school, where female representation has yet to return to its pre-pandemic high, to work harder to get more girls into its classrooms.
Selective entry Suzanne Cory High School and Nossal High School have been dominated by boys each year since 2014, a stubborn trend which prompted the state government to introduce a special measure in 2024 requiring both schools to enrol an equal number of girls and boys in year 9.
However, John Monash Science School, which has recorded a decade-old gender imbalance, is exempt from the measure.
About 600 aspiring John Monash Science School students complete an assessment and interview each year in the hope of securing one of 200 prized year 10 places.
But the odds of securing a place is greater for boys with the proportion of girls enrolled at the Clayton school falling from 49 per cent in 2020 to 47 per cent last year, analysis by The Age shows.
Gender Equity Victoria chief executive Micaela Drieberg said for gender parity to be achieved and then maintained across academically selective schools, quotas should be part of the selection process.
“All students should have equal opportunities,” Drieberg said.
“A consistent policy that focuses on gender representation across all select entry schools would ensure the students of today have equal opportunities, as well as the students of tomorrow.”
Places at Suzanne Cory High School and Nossal High School, Melbourne’s only two co-educational selective entry schools, have persistently favoured boys but will achieve full gender balance next year when the 2024 year 9 intake reaches year 12.
John Monash Science School principal Andrew Chisholm said the 17-year-old school aimed for parity however the gender balance depended on applications.
He said John Monash Science School differed from Suzanne Cory High and Nossal High as it was a specialist selective entry school rather than a cross-discipline selective entry school.
“We’re really inclusive, and we want gender balance,” he said.
“But sometimes having more guidelines actually makes it worse because you’re taking away the freedom of the school and to choose the people who are most appropriate to be at a science school.”
Chisholm pointed out that of the 34 year 11 students joining the school this year, 21 were girls.
Drieberg acknowledged the specialist science school was close to parity but said a consistent policy was required to lift and then maintain an equal proportion of girls and boys in the classrooms.
“If we don’t have these things in place, and if we take our foot off the pedal, we can easily go backwards,” she said.
Mark Morris, the co-chair of research and gender advocacy group The 100% Project, said having gender equality policies in place signalled parity was taken seriously.
“Failure to work toward gender equality is an intentional act against gender equality,” he said.
“When it comes to gender equity, there shouldn’t be different acceptable standards for different schools.”
Suzanne Cory High School and Nossal High School have both recorded an increase in the proportion of girls enrolled since the policy took effect.
Of the 922 students at Suzanne Cory High School last year, 47 per cent were girls.
In 2023, the year the special measure was announced, 42 per cent of the student population were girls. That figure rose to 46 per cent when the policy took effect in 2024.
It’s a similar story at Nossal High School, where 46 per cent of the 825 students last year were girls, up from 43 per cent between 2022 and 2024.
“We know historically that quotas work,” Drieberg said.
However, Melbourne University professor of history and philosophy of science Cordelia Fine said benefits of gender parity policies didn’t automatically justify them.
“In the case of selective schools, there is a cost both to boys who would otherwise have been offered a place, and to girls who may be stigmatised as needing a lower bar to gain entry,” Fine said.
Melbourne molecular biologist Suzanne Cory, whose name adorns the Werribee school, is an advocate of having an equal number of boys and girls in the classrooms.
Cory, the first female president of the Australian Academy of Science, told The Age in November that all students would benefit from an academically selective system made up of an equal proportion of girls and boys.
Victorian Education Minister Ben Carroll said the state’s selective entry schools provided high-achieving students with an academically challenging and enriching secondary school experience.
“Balancing gender enrolment numbers in our select entry high schools provides every Victorian student an equal opportunity to study at one of these education providers,” he said.
More than 5700 students sat the selective entry school entrance exam last year.
Just 1000 places for this year’s year 9 intake across Nossal High School, Suzanne Cory High School, MacRobertson Girls’ High School and Melbourne High were up for grabs.

Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control

Israel launches new West Bank land policy seen as a ‘mega land grab’
West Bank land registration will force anyone who has a claim to land to prove ownership, a move decried by Palestinians
Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in Israel gaining control over wide swathes of the area for future development, according to a government decision on Sunday.
It paves the way for the resumption of “settlement of land title” processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Mideast War in 1967. It means that when Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership.
The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the process likely amounts to a “mega land grab” from Palestinians.
“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Peace Now’s Settlement Watch programme. Area C refers to the 60 per cent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ office in a statement called the decision “a grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law”, which amounts to “de facto annexation”. It called on the international community, especially the UN Security Council and the United States, to intervene immediately.

Ukraine preparing to sanction Russians who "put sport at service of war" – Zelenskyy
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reported that Kyiv is preparing a new sanctions package targeting Russians who "work for the war and put sport at the service of war".
Source: Zelenskyy in his evening address
Quote: "We are preparing a new sanctions package targeting Russian individuals who work for the war and put sport at the service of war.
The documents are already prepared; this Ukrainian sanctions package should be a signal to others around the world – a signal that one cannot simply turn a blind eye to support for aggression. When Ukrainians at the Olympics are forbidden to even mention the victims of Russian aggression, that is clearly a global rollback of justice.
We will restore justice. The sanctions decree will be issued soon."
Background:
- Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games over his "helmet of remembrance" featuring 20 Ukrainian athletes who were killed due to Russia's aggression.
- Zelenskyy awarded the Order of Freedom to Heraskevych.

US teen who pushed for her father’s release from ICE custody dies of cancer
Unknown

03:24:54 KST

A Chicago teenager, whose father was detained by immigration authorities while she navigated cancer, died on Friday, a family spokesperson said.
Ofelia Torres, a 16-year-old in Chicago, had been undergoing treatment for an aggressive and rare form of cancer since late 2024. As she and her family struggled with the medical procedures, her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained by immigration authorities while at a Home Depot in October, leading to a contentious and public case that highlighted the human effects of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
The family challenged Torres Maldonado’s detention, saying he was instrumental to helping their family and caring for Ofelia’s four-year-old brother, Nathan. A judge later ruled in late October that Torres Maldonado’s arrest and detention was illegal. He was released from custody on 30 October.
Last year, the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz, a surge in immigration enforcement arrests in Chicago, with officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), border patrol and other federal agencies descending on the city to drive up arrests.
Torres Maldonado was arrested by authorities and detained in an immigration jail amid the operation. Ofelia had been enjoying a temporary break from treatment for stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer that develops in skeletal muscles, when her father was detained.
Delia Ramirez, a US representative opposing the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, said on social media that Ofelia, one of her constituents, was an inspiration.
“Even as Ofelia fought cancer, she also fought to bring her father home and ensured that he would no longer have to live in fear in the shadows,” Ramirez said. “She taught us what love, hope, and resolve look like. My condolences to her family and loved ones.”
Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, also expressed his condolences on social media, while criticizing the Trump administration’s operations in Chicago.
“Ofelia led a steadfast, dedicated and truly inspiring life,” Johnson said, adding that the Trump administration’s “indiscriminate, bigoted” mass deportation campaign, “which has upended the lives of hard-working families who came to Chicago, and other cities across the country, in search for a better life, must come to end”.
A public GoFundMe page highlighting the Torres family’s story in October included a video by Ofelia talking about her dad and the effect of his arrest.
“I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targeted
because they were not born here,” Ofelia said in the video. The Torres family were able to secure resources to help with their situation. “Sadly, that’s not the case for all families.”
“That’s why I’m making this video: to spread awareness and remind the public that immigrants are humans with families and deserve to be treated with love and respect, just like anyone else,” Ofelia added.
The Torres family’s story led to widespread condemnation and backlash against the Trump administration for their crackdown targeting families. Ofelia’s family received legal assistance, filing and pushing for his release.
In response to the Chicago Tribune when the family’s story came to light, homeland security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin accused Ofelia’s father of “habitual driving offenses”. She called his legal case “nothing more than a desperate hail Mary attempt” to keep him in the US with his family.
Days before Ofelia died, a judge ruled that Torres Maldonado’s deportation would be blocked, due to the hardship it would bring his family, opening the door to a potential pathway to permanent residence and eventual citizenship.
“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threatened
deportation of her father,” the family’s attorney said in a statement. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”
According to the Chicago Tribune, Ofelia completed a school project on the high cost of healthcare in the US. As a result, her teacher introduced her to an Illinois state representative.
“She is smart, funny, inquisitive, engaging. We just talked about state healthcare policy,” Illinois state representative Laura Faver Dias said at the time. “We talked about her fears, our shared fears about what happens to Medicaid for her and her family as she is navigating cancer.”

Winter Olympics recap: Brignone’s double gold after broken leg, Klaebo sets a medal record
MILAN (AP) — Federica Brignone and Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo glided into history at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Sunday in very different ways.
Host nation Italy was delighted as Brignone’s sensational comeback continued with a second gold medal of these Games. She’s still in pain after a badly broken leg last year.
Klaebo has the most gold medals of any Winter Olympian in history with nine after taking gold with Norway’s cross-country men’s relay team.
Brignone does it again
Winning one gold medal in super-G made Brignone feel like she was living in a movie.
What do great movies get? A sequel.
The Italian skier known as “the Tiger” was unbeatable in the giant slalom for her second gold of the Olympics and fifth career medal, breaking her own record as the oldest women’s Alpine skiing Olympic champion.
There were two silver medalists as Sara Hector and Thea Louise Stjernesund finished in exactly the same time and bowed to Brignone to mark her victory.
After breaking multiple bones in March, Brignone needed two surgeries and 42 stitches to put her leg back together. She only returned to skiing in January.
Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States was 11th and has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic races since Pyeongchang in 2018.
Record ninth gold medal for Norwegian skier
Klaebo stands alone as the most successful Winter Olympian in history after winning his ninth career gold medal in cross-country skiing.
Norway’s prime minister was watching as Klaebo anchored his team’s relay gold Sunday. That broke a tie at eight gold medals with three other Norwegians: cross-country skiers Marit Bjoergen and Bjoern Daehlie and biathlete Ole Einar Bjoerndalen.
Klaebo could get into double figures by the end of the Milan Cortina Games. His next chances for a 10th gold are in the team sprint on Wednesday or the 50-kilometer race on Saturday. Also, he’s only 29 years old.
Norway ended Sunday with a Games-leading 26 medals, 12 gold. Host nation Italy reached 22 on Sunday, its best-ever Winter Olympic medal haul. The U.S. and Japan have 17 apiece.
More controversy rocks curling
The typically calm world of curling has been rocked by a controversy over double-touching, and it broadened Sunday as the British men’s team had a stone removed for the violation.
Until Sunday, the Canadian men’s and women’s teams had been in the focus of scrutiny. An expletive-laden outburst by Canada’s Marc Kennedy after an accusation of a double touch against Sweden on Friday highlighted the problem. A double touch is when a player touches a stone again after releasing it.
U.S. and Canada win again in men’s hockey
In men’s hockey, the U.S. and Canada both made sure of quarterfinal spots with convincing wins in the final game of group play. Canada routed France 10-2 and took the top seed on goal differential. Canada will play either Czechia or Denmark in the quarterfinals.
The U.S. beat Germany 5-1 and is set to face the winner of the qualification round game Tuesday between Sweden and Latvia.
Another win for the moguls king
Mikael Kingsbury of Canada has won almost everything there is to win in moguls skiing. When a new Olympic event was added, he won that, too.
Kingsbury took gold, his fifth career Olympic medal, in the inaugural dual moguls event Sunday, three days after settling for silver in the traditional moguls event, won by Australian Cooper Woods.
Dutch speedskater Jutta Leerdam won another medal but it was silver, not gold, as her teammate Femke Kok won the women’s 1,000 meters. Miho Takagi of Japan was third and defending champion Erin Jackson of the U.S. fifth.
Britain won its first snow-sport Olympic gold in history, a victory for Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale in team snowboardcross. There was another British gold in team skeleton hours later.
Biathlon saw a first Olympic gold for Italy as Lisa Vittozzi won the women’s pursuit, hours after Sweden’s Martin Ponsiluoma took a surprise gold in the men’s event.
Norwegian ski jumper Anna Odine Stroem won the first-ever Olympic women’s large hill event to finish the Games with two gold medals and a silver.
German figure skaters Minerva Fabienne Hase and Nikita Volodin lead the pairs event after the short program after other gold-medal contenders made mistakes. The free skate is Monday.

When Israel fought the Soviets: the secret air war of 1970

The most direct military clash between the IDF and the Soviet Union unfolded gradually and largely out of public view, emerging during the final year of the War of Attrition as a dangerous escalation that brought a Cold War superpower into open combat with Israeli forces. What began as an Egyptian effort to recover from defeat in the 1967 Six-Day War evolved into a covert superpower deployment, direct aerial combat between IDF and Soviet pilots, and deadly missile engagements that reshaped the regional balance and hastened the war’s end.
After the 1967 Six-Day War, Egypt sought to challenge control of Sinai not through a decisive ground offensive but through prolonged pressure. Artillery duels along the Suez Canal intensified. Commando raids became routine. Air power assumed a central role. IDF aircraft struck Egyptian positions along the canal and increasingly deep inside Egypt, targeting air bases, radar installations, bridges, power stations and logistical hubs.
By 1969, the imbalance in the air was stark. Mirage III fighters and newly introduced F-4 Phantom jets gave the IDF the ability to operate hundreds of kilometers west of the canal. A series of deep-penetration raids, later known collectively as Operation Priha, exposed Egypt’s inability to defend its own heartland. Bombs fell near Cairo, Alexandria and the Aswan Dam. Egyptian fighter losses mounted, while air defenses struggled to intercept or survive.
President Gamal Abdel Nasser concluded that Egypt could not sustain the war alone. In the autumn of 1969 and again during a visit to Moscow on Jan. 24–25, 1970, he pressed Soviet leaders for expanded assistance. This time, the request went beyond weapons. Nasser asked the Soviet Union to defend Egyptian airspace directly.
The Soviet response was unprecedented. Moscow approved a covert deployment code-named Operation Caucasus, involving a full expeditionary force, divisional in size. At its core was the 18th Special Anti-Aircraft Rocket Division of the Soviet Air Defence Forces, reinforced by fighter aviation regiments equipped with MiG-21MF aircraft, radar units, electronic warfare teams and thousands of personnel.
Beginning in March 1970, Soviet ships unloaded men and equipment at Egyptian ports. SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missile batteries were deployed around Cairo, Alexandria and Aswan. Soviet pilots flew combat air patrols. Radar operators, missile crews, technicians and controllers took over entire sectors of the air defense network. Vehicles were painted in Egyptian colors. Soviet personnel wore desert uniforms resembling Egyptian dress. Officially, both Cairo and Moscow denied the deployment.
IDF intelligence detected the presence almost immediately. Unit 848 intercepted Russian-language communications. Radar signatures and operational behavior matched Soviet doctrine. The conclusion was unavoidable: Soviet forces were now actively engaged.
Despite this, political leaders sought to avoid escalation. The IDF was directed to avoid contact with Soviet-manned systems. Deep-penetration missions were curtailed and by April 1970 halted entirely, ending a year of successful strikes deep inside Egypt.
The restraint backfired. Soviet commanders used the pause to reshape the battlefield. Missile batteries advanced eastward toward the canal in carefully protected stages. Egyptian air defense units were freed to reinforce the front. The operating space for IDF aircraft narrowed steadily.
By early summer, the consequences were severe. Several Phantoms were shot down by surface-to-air missiles. Aircrew were killed, wounded or captured. Soviet confidence increased. MiG-21 patrols expanded their range, probing closer to the canal and beyond.
On July 25, Soviet-flown MiGs intercepted IDF A-4 Skyhawks during a ground-attack mission and pursued them into Sinai. An AA-2 Atoll missile struck one aircraft, forcing an emergency landing at Rephidim. For the first time, Soviet pilots had fired air-to-air missiles east of the canal.
Maj. Gen. Mordechai Hod, commander of the IDF Air Arm, and Lt. Gen. Haim Bar-Lev, chief of staff, concluded that restraint had failed. Air superiority, regarded as a strategic pillar since 1967, was under direct threat. Hod proposed a controlled confrontation in air-to-air combat, where IDF experience and training were believed to offer an advantage over Soviet pilots, rather than continued exposure to missile ambushes.
The plan was presented to the cabinet on July 25 and approved by Prime Minister Golda Meir. The objective was deterrence, not escalation. The operation was code-named Rimon 20.
Planning relied on deception, timing and intelligence dominance. Unit 848 and other intelligence elements provided continuous monitoring of Egyptian and Soviet communications. IDF electronic warfare units prepared to disrupt radar coverage at key moments.
On the morning of July 30, routine-looking strike missions were flown along the canal to preserve normal patterns. Shortly after 14:00, four F-4 Phantoms from Squadron 69, led by Avihu Bin-Nun with navigator Shaul Levi, attacked an Egyptian radar station near Sokhna, flying profiles typical of Skyhawks to avoid drawing special attention.
At the same time, four Mirage IIIC fighters from Squadron 119 — flown by Amos Amir, Asher Snir, Avraham Salmon and Avi Gilad — crossed into Egyptian airspace near Hurghada. Flying in tight formation, they appeared on radar as a single reconnaissance aircraft and climbed to altitude on a steady northward track.
Soviet controllers responded as expected. The first quartet of MiG-21s lifted off from Kawm Ushim under Capt. Yevgeny Kamenev. Two additional formations followed from Beni Suef, led by Capt. Nikolai Yurchenko and Capt. Vitaliy Saranin. Further MiGs joined from al-Qatamiyah. In total, 24 Soviet fighters were committed.
Unseen, additional Mirages from Squadrons 117 and 101 loitered at low altitude over Sinai, beyond radar coverage, while another quartet waited on alert at Rephidim.
As the MiGs closed to within 20 kilometers, Hod gave the order to attack. Fuel tanks were jettisoned. Formations broke apart. The engagement collapsed into a chaotic, close-range dogfight as Phantoms and Mirages converged from multiple directions.
Salmon scored the first kill, firing an AIM-9D Sidewinder at a MiG threatening a pair of Phantoms. The missile struck, killing Yurchenko. Moments later, Snir downed another MiG flown by Capt. Yevgeny Yakovlev, who ejected but later died. Snir was then hit by a missile fired by Capt. Vladimir Ivlev. His Mirage was badly damaged, its tail shredded, but he disengaged and landed safely at Rephidim.
Phantom pilot Aviem Sella, flying with navigator Reuven Reshef, engaged a MiG flown by Capt. Georgy Syrkin. After an initial missile appeared ineffective, a second hit destroyed the aircraft. Syrkin ejected and survived.
Another MiG, flown by Kamenev, attempted to escape at low altitude. Bin-Nun and Levi launched an AIM-7 Sparrow at extremely low height, destroying the aircraft.
The final loss was confirmed only years later. A MiG flown by Capt. Vladimir Zhuravlev, pursued by Salmon and Iftach Spector, managed to flee the immediate fight but later crashed. Salmon and Spector were credited with a shared kill.
The entire engagement lasted less than three minutes. Five Soviet MiGs were destroyed. Three pilots were killed. Two ejected. No IDF aircraft were lost.
Publicly, details were muted. Initial statements spoke only of enemy aircraft downed. Egypt denied losses. Moscow remained silent. Within days, foreign reports identified the pilots as Soviet. In October, Meir confirmed it openly.
Moscow responded quickly. Marshal Pavel Kutakhov, commander of the Soviet Air Force, flew to Egypt. Reinforcements followed. Additional MiG units arrived, along with Su-15 interceptors. Plans were drawn up for retaliation through surface-to-air missile ambushes rather than air combat.
That response came on Aug. 3.
IDF strike aircraft were dispatched to attack missile batteries deployed between Abu Suweir and Ismailia in an operation later known as Shayar 265. The mission aimed to blunt the expanding Soviet-built air defense network. Instead, the aircraft flew into a carefully prepared trap. Decoy missile sites had been erected. Operational SA-3 batteries were concealed and linked to coordinated fire plans.
A dense barrage of missiles followed. One Phantom was hit and went down. Pilot Yigal Shohat was severely wounded and later lost a leg. Navigator Moshe Goldwasser was captured by Egyptian forces, tortured and later died in captivity.
Another Phantom was badly damaged. Pilot Raanan Naaman was wounded by missile fragments that tore through the cockpit. Navigator Yoram Romem took control of the aircraft and flew it back to Rephidim despite extensive damage. Both men were later decorated by the IDF.
Shayar 265 underscored a grim conclusion for IDF planners: there was no tactical solution to the Soviet missile network then deployed in Egypt. Losses mounted. Strategic calculations shifted.
Within days, U.S.-brokered diplomacy produced a ceasefire. It took effect on Aug. 7, 1970, ending the War of Attrition. Although Egypt later violated the agreement by advancing missile batteries eastward, large-scale fighting ceased.
Soviet forces remained in Egypt after the ceasefire, continuing to operate air defenses. Only in 1972 did President Anwar Sadat expel most Soviet troops, retaining advisers.
Years later, memoirs, declassified documents and archival discoveries revealed the full scope of Operation Caucasus, Rimon 20 and Shayar 265. Together, they exposed a rare Cold War confrontation in which the IDF and Soviet forces met directly, tested one another’s limits and then stepped back from a conflict that threatened to draw in the world’s superpowers.

ASX edges up despite falls for iron ore miners; JB Hi-Fi surges
Updated ,first published
The Australian sharemarket edged higher on Monday as the technology sector bounced back sharply from a sell-off last week, even as weakness in the iron ore price dragged down shares in the country’s mining giants.
The S&P/ASX 200 rose 19.5 points or 0.2 per cent to 8937.10 at the close, with eight industry sectors moving higher, led by a strong rebound in technology shares.
Software businesses including WiseTech (up 12.9 per cent), Xero (up 7.6 per cent) and Technology One (up 5.6 per cent) rallied, after the sector tumbled on Friday amid investor fears over the threat from artificial intelligence.
The rebound in technology shares, alongside smaller rises in other sectors, helped to cushion the market from a slide in the big mining stocks, amid recent weakness in the iron ore price.
The three iron ore heavyweights all fell, with Rio Tinto losing 4.1 per cent, Fortescue shedding 4.7 per cent and BHP moving 1.5 per cent lower. Iron ore has fallen in recent days and was trading under US$100 a tonne on Monday on the back of increasing Chinese stockpiles and concerns about oversupply.
Rio Tinto also announced on Monday that a worker had died following an accident at the company’s SimFer mine at the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. Work has been suspended at the mine.
Gold stocks were mixed, with Northern Star rising 0.3 per cent while Evolution Mining fell 1.6 per cent.
It was a mixed day for banks, as Bendigo and Adelaide Bank reported its profits fell 3.3 per cent in the first half, to $256.4 million, as the bank’s income rose but its operating expenses also increased. It held the dividend flat at 30c a share, while flagging extra spending to improve its compliance with anti-money laundering laws. Bendigo shares fell 2.2 per cent.
The two biggest retail banks, Commonwealth Bank (up 1.2 per cent) and Westpac (up 0.2 per cent), both moved higher, while the more business-focused National Australia Bank (down 1 per cent) and ANZ Bank (down 3.1 per cent) both lost ground.
BlueScope shares fell 2.7 per cent after the steelmaker reported an 81 per cent jump in December-half earnings to $558 million, as President Donald Trump’s hike in US steel tariffs led to “stronger US steel spreads” for its products manufactured in the US. This offset a softer performance in Australia and Asia for its locally manufactured steel which competes against China’s steel glut.
The company, which is the target of a takeover bid by Kerry Stokes SGH and US-based Steel Dynamics, also announced it will deliver $3 a share to investors this calendar year via a $1 per share special dividend, $1.30 per share in ongoing dividends, and a $310 million market buyback worth around 70c per share.
The owner of Penfolds, Treasury Wine Estates, slumped 5.2 per cent after announcing declines across almost all of its metrics for the first half of the 2026 financial year and suspending its interim dividend. Earnings of $236 million was a 66 per cent fall on last year; net sales revenue of nearly $1.3 billion represented a decline of 16 per cent, while sales revenue per case fell 5.1 per cent. The winemaker recorded a loss after tax of nearly $650 million for the half-year as demand for wine in China and the US weakened.
Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi added 7.5 per cent after announcing a sales uplift of 7.3 per cent to $6.1 billion, a similar 7.1 per cent lift in net profits to $305.8 million, and an interim dividend of 210 cents per share, which is 23.5 per cent higher than this time last year.
The tech retailer attributed the strong numbers to ongoing high demand for consumer electronics, as well as a well-executed promotions program.
Energy stocks were mixed, with Woodside Energy and Yancoal both up 0.2 per cent, while Santos was flat and Whitehaven Coal fell 0.1 per cent.
Coles rose 0.1 per cent as a landmark legal case brought by the consumer watchdog got under way in the Federal Court. The ACCC is alleging some of the supermarket giant’s discounts were illusory. Woolworths also rose 0.1 per cent higher.
Housing estate developer Stockland’s chief executive officer Tarun Gupta said higher settlement volumes of land lot sales, a boost from its development fee income and resilience in its warehouse and shopping centre portfolios contributed to a strong first half result. Funds from operations for the six months to December were $325 million, up $74 million on the prior corresponding period. Stockland’s statutory profit was up, at $292 million, after a boost in property valuations of $81 million on a “look-through basis” across its investment platform. Stockland shares gained 2.3 per cent.
The Australian dollar was trading at US70.87¢ at 5.08pm AEDT.
US stocks steadied on Friday after an encouraging update on inflation helped calm a Wall Street that’s been racked by worries about how artificial-intelligence technology may upend the business world.
The S&P 500 barely budged, a day after it had tumbled to one of its worst losses since Thanksgiving. The Dow Jones rose 48 points, or 0.1 per cent, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2 per cent.
Wall Street stocks got some help from easing Treasury yields, which fell after a report showed inflation slowed last month by more than economists expected. US consumers paid prices for groceries, clothes and other costs of living that were 2.4 per cent higher overall than a year earlier.
On Wall Street, stock prices steadied for several companies that investors had earlier targeted as potential losers from AI disruption.
The heaviest weight on the market was Nvidia, which fell 2.2 per cent. Because it’s the largest stock on Wall Street, its moves carry more weight on the S&P 500 than any other company’s.

British Museum removes the term Palestine from certain Middle East exhibits

The British Museum has removed the term “Palestine” from some of its Middle East gallery panels and labels following complaints that the use of the term was historically inaccurate and anachronistic.
“For the Middle East galleries for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium [BCE],” the British Museum told The Jerusalem Post on Sunday, adding that “some of the graphic panels date from the earlier period of the understanding of the term are being reviewed as part of plans for refurbishing these spaces.”
This comes after UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLFI) expressed concerns about historically inaccurate references to “Palestine” in displays covering the ancient Levant and Egypt. In a letter to the British Museum, UKLFI explained that several maps and descriptions retroactively apply the term “Palestine” to periods in which “no such entity existed” and that this “risks obscuring the history of Israel and the Jewish people.”
UKLFI argued that applying a single name across thousands of years “erases historical changes and creates a false impression of continuity.”
As such, UKLFI asked the museum to review its collections and revise terminology so regions are referred to by historically accurate names such as Canaan, the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, or Judea, depending on the period being described.
Museum decided Palestine no longer 'neutral' terminology
The museum told the Post that while the term “Palestine” was well established in Western and Middle Eastern scholarship as a geographical and “neutral” designation for the southern area of the Levant since the late 19th century, it recognized that “the term no longer holds a neutral designation and may be understood in reference to political territory.”
For this reason, the museum has, until now, opted to use UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, “for example, Gaza, West Bank, Israel, Jordan, and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate.”
According to UKLFI, the information panels in the Levant gallery, covering the period 2000-300 BCE, have all already been updated to describe in some detail the history of Canaan and the Canaanites and the rise of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel using those names. A panel in the Egypt galleries was recently amended to replace “Palestinian descent” with “Canaanite descent.”
A UKLFI spokesperson said the organization “welcomes the British Museum’s willingness to review and amend terminology which is inaccurate or liable to convey an incorrect meaning today.
“Museums play a vital role in public education, and it is essential that descriptions reflect the historical record with precision and neutrality. These changes are an important step toward ensuring visitors receive an accurate understanding of the ancient Near East.”

NCAG Chief Commissioner admits he threw stones at Israeli soldiers when he was 'still young'

Ali Shaath, the chief commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, threw stones at Israeli soldiers alongside Palestinian youth he worked with, he admitted during an interview with Ahmad Biqawi in April 2025.
Around seven minutes into the nearly two-hour interview, Shaath said, “I worked with the youth at school in demonstrations against the Israeli occupation. We would stand in areas where there were occupation checkpoints and their posts, and we would throw stones at them so they would leave our town.”
“I actually was the organizer of this activity or this national act in the city of Khan Yunis [in the Gaza Strip]. I succeeded in awakening all the opinions and feelings of the people, and they set out to the occupation’s positions,” he said.
Without confirming his age at the time of the incident, only saying he was “still young,” Shaath told his interviewer he was sentenced for the stone-throwing attacks. He said he was later imprisoned again, resulting in him needing to resit his degree, but he did not give a reason for the detainment.
The IDF recognizes stone throwing as a form of “popular terror.”
Video threatens NCAG's future
Israeli expert and director of the Palestinian Media Watch, Itamar Marcus, told The Jerusalem Post that the newly discovered video could undermine NCAG’s legitimacy if Shaath is allowed to remain its head.
“If the United States wants this experiment for Gaza’s future to have any chance of success, it must immediately remove Shaath from his position and appoint a replacement who is honest enough to condemn violence and recognize Israel’s history and its right to exist,” he said.
And this would need to be someone “brave enough to say it publicly,” the researcher told the Post.
Marcus noted that Shaath’s ideology, as exhibited during the interview, made his appointment to the NCAG inappropriate.
“First and most important, Shaath declared the existence of Israel to be an American and European colonial implant. Shaath, the so-called apolitical leader to build Gaza, sees Israelis as foreigners and denies Israel’s right to exist,” he said.
“During the interview, he uses the PA term for Israel – ‘the occupation’ – instead of calling Israel by name. In the PA lexicon, all of Israel is an ‘occupation,’ and all Israeli cities are ‘settlements,’” Marcus continued.
MK Ohad Tal, the chair of the Religious Zionist faction in the Knesset, told the Post, “For those who seek stability and genuine peace, there is no alternative to Israeli control over Gaza.”
“Our soldiers did not fight courageously for many months only to transfer Gaza from one Palestinian terror regime to another, merely replacing one failed and dangerous government with another,” he said.
“I call on Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu to commit to the notion that in the long term in Gaza, there will be no Hamas and no Abbas. It should be a place free of anyone who seeks to follow in their path.”
Shaath enjoys his reputation as a moderate. Despite his family connections to senior members of Fatah, Shaath had previously spoken in support of a two-state solution.
In 2011, while blaming West Bank violence exclusively on Israeli settlers, Shaath told Army Radio, “I think our people are quite satisfied not to go back to violence and are going, in this fight, to continue their peaceful struggle for independence and for real peace and a two-state solution.”

The Milano Cortina Games organizers on Sunday said they had taken measures to preserve "a neutral, respectful and welcoming environment" at the Olympics after an altercation between a pro-Palestinian employee at an Olympic venue shop and an Israeli supporter.
"We are aware of an incident that took place at the Cortina Sliding Centre involving a retail employee and a visitor," the Games organizers said.
"It is not appropriate for Games staff or contractors to express personal political views while carrying out their duties or to direct such remarks at visitors," they added.
The employee repeatedly called out "Free Palestine" when a group of Israeli sports fans entered the shop, videos of the incident circulating on social media and on Italian newspaper websites showed.
The footage showed a person with an Israeli flag on their bag exiting the store after the exchange, while another person from the group engaged with the employee, daring him to repeat "Free Palestine," which he did.
"This is the Olympics," the person from the Israeli group replied. "Israel is allowed to compete like just any other country, it's not controversial ... OK, good for you, you did it, you freed Palestine, good job."
Employee removed from shift, not fired
The Games organizers said the matter had been dealt with immediately at the venue level, without clarifying if there would be further consequences for the employee.
In the video, someone in the background can be heard saying the person should be fired.
"Those involved were reassured, and the individual concerned was removed from the shift," the organizers said in a statement.

Elite South African school apologizes over refusal to play Jewish day school at fixture

An elite Anglican school in South Africa has formally apologized after its students refused to play a sports fixture against a Jewish day school earlier this month.
On February 3, a Jewish school in South Africa claimed that students at Roedean School, a prestigious Johannesburg-based girls’ school, refused to play against them in a tennis match. The Jewish students of King David Linksfield had traveled to Roedean for the fixture, but the Roedean girls had refused to walk out onto the court, and the fixture was ultimately canceled.
The South African Jewish Board of Deputies (SAJBD) condemned what it said was a “disturbing refusal to play Jewish tennis players.”
Discrimination has become acceptable
“It also conveys the message that hate and discrimination have become acceptable values at Roedean.”
The school originally denied the allegations, writing in a letter to parents that it had notified King David that it could not field a team because of prior commitments, including compulsory academic workshops, and it had requested either a postponement or, failing that, cancellation of the fixture.
However, South African outlet The Common Sense obtained an audio recording of a telephone conversation between senior staffers at Roedean and King David Linksfield schools, which contradicted the school’s claim that the cancellation was due to scheduling constraints.
In the audio, the Roedean staff member asks King David if it has had pressure from any other school to not attend fixtures, or if parents at other schools had complained about their children playing against a Jewish school.
The King David staff member said this had never happened before, and all fixtures since 2023 had gone ahead as normal.
The Roedean staff member then admitted that the parents at her school were putting pressure on the school not to play against King David, and that they felt they needed to “take a stance” in line with the government.
Despite this seemingly reference to the government’s stance on Israel-Palestine, and not on Jews, the Roedean staff member said “at the moment it’s presenting itself as a Jewish day school issue,” and that she would be attending the fixture “to make sure my parents behave.”
The King David staff member replied that this was “very worrying.”
Roedean then released a statement saying it “recognized the seriousness of the concerns that have been raised and the distress this matter has caused to students, families, and the wider school community,” and was communicating directly with King David.
It added that Roedean has a “long-standing commitment to inclusion and respect for all communities,” and “antisemitism has no place in our school.”
However, the SA Jewish Report discovered that Roedean School’s Senior School head, Phuti Mogale, left her post with immediate effect on February 9.
“What occurred between Roedean School and King David High School constitutes antisemitism,” said the South African Jewish Board of Deputies’ national director, Wendy Kahn.
“The tennis fixture didn’t fall away because of prior school commitments or academic workshops,” she said. “It fell away because in the words of Roedean’s school principal, ‘It’s presenting itself as a Jewish day school issue’.”
Roedean School finally sent a formal apology to King David on February 12, following mediation by the Independent Schools Association of Southern Africa (ISASA). It admitted that its actions were “deeply hurtful to the Jewish community”, and admitted that “while there were communication challenges which compounded this incident, these were not the cause of the cancellation of the match as Roedean originally understood and communicated, as has become clear from our ongoing independent investigations”.
The general manager of the South African Board of Jewish Education (SABJE), Rabbi Ricky Seeff, said, “We feel relieved. We had no interest in having long, protracted public spats with other independent schools. We want to resume normal relations. It was important to stand up to antisemitism. Now we just want to get our community and kids back to where they are meant to be – playing sports. “

Israel's female soldiers sacrifice for our country, we must not let them be harassed - editorial

Police officers rescued two female IDF soldiers on Sunday in Bnei Brak after a mob surrounded them when they came to carry out a welfare visit as part of their service, a police statement said. Officers protected the soldiers as rioters confronted a police car and hurled objects at it. Authorities reported 23 arrests.
Footage from the scene spread quickly, as did condemnation by politicians. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident serious and unacceptable while stressing that it came from an extremist minority that does not represent the broader ultra-Orthodox public.
Shas leader Aryeh Deri and United Torah Judaism (UTJ) leader Yitzhak Goldknopf also issued condemnations, and IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir described harm to soldiers by Israeli civilians as crossing a red line.
Israel cannot accept harassment of soldiers by a mob as just another ugly clip on a feed. Soldiers in uniform are not props for internal political posturing; they are public servants and they serve those who agree with them, the people who vote against them, and those who resent the system they represent.
Assault on female soldiers part of a wider narrative
The incident is part of a wider Israeli narrative that has unfolded since October 7, 2023, about the expanding role, responsibility, and burden shouldered by women in uniform, and the price they pay in doing so.
For over two years now, this newspaper has shown women fighting, commanding, rescuing, gathering intelligence, and holding the line under pressure. Caracal Battalion commander Lt.-Col. Or Ben-Yehuda has described female fighters engaging terrorists on October 7 and staying in the fight under extreme conditions.
Women have also been sent into arenas that were once discussed theoretically, then argued about, then postponed. The Post has reported on a co-ed battalion whose female troops went into Gaza, a first for the unit.
In late 2024, The Jerusalem Post reported on operational missions that took female combat soldiers into Lebanon, with their work framed as part of intelligence-gathering and operational support.
Their courage also includes roles that are less discussed around Israel’s Shabbat tables. IDF field observers, many of them young women, have borne a responsibility that the country did not fully appreciate until it had no choice.
Zamir has said female observers are “the eyes of the state.” He said, plainly, that the IDF failed on October 7 while the observers on duty did not fail, describing their actions as courageous and heroic under fire.
Meanwhile, the numbers have increased. In 2025, the Post reported that the IDF had recruited over 5,000 women for combat roles, marking a new record. The “why” is not mysterious. Many Israeli women watched October 7 and the months that followed and decided that, in this era, military service was part of adulthood.
These women are doing God’s work. They are saving lives. They are helping Israel stand back up.
Clearly, there are those in Israel who must still learn a basic national rule: Keep your hands off them. Do not surround them. Do not chase them. Do not spit at them. Do not scream at them as if you own the street and they are trespassers. The IDF uniform represents the entire country, including those who do not wear it.
A community can oppose a draft policy. A community can demand a different legal arrangement. A community can protest. None of that grants it the right to humiliate soldiers, especially those carrying out a welfare visit.
Anyone claiming religious justification for harassing women in uniform should hear the words used by haredi leaders in their condemnations, including language about desecration and disgrace. This is hilul Hashem (desecration of God’s name).
Israel also needs a practical response: Prosecutions should move quickly, and there should be severe consequences. A society teaches norms through enforcement as much as through rhetoric.
Political leaders who rely on haredi voters should stop treating the issue as “someone else’s problem.” The state should also ensure that soldiers are kept safe in public spaces, as it does other vulnerable public servants.
Israel has lived through two and a half years of wartime reality since October 7, 2023 and far too many soldiers and civilians have paid the ultimate price. It has carried too much. It has asked too much of the people who serve.
The very least Israel can do is protect the women who wear their uniform with pride and do the hard work.

Trump’s intervention turns Herzog’s pardon dilemma into a diplomatic trap - analysis

Even before US President Donald Trump publicly lashed out at President Isaac Herzog on Thursday for not yet pardoning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Herzog was in an impossible position.
Grant the pardon, and he alienates roughly half the country that wants to see Netanyahu’s trial continue, and, if the prime minister is convicted, pay the legal price. Refuse the pardon, and Herzog enrages the other half, which views the decade-long legal saga as unnecessary, excessive, corrosive, and long overdue for closure.
It was already a no-win situation. Trump’s most recent intervention – he first intervened in October when he publicly called for a pardon for Netanyahu from the Knesset podium – made it worse.
Responding to a question in the White House on Thursday, a day after meeting Netanyahu, Trump said Herzog should be “ashamed of himself” for not having pardoned the prime minister. He went further: “I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He’s disgraceful for not giving it.”
Those words reached Herzog during a 13-hour flight from Australia – where he had just completed a four-day visit marked by loud anti-Israel demonstrations calling for his arrest – to Abu Dhabi, before the final commercial leg home.
After being assailed in the streets and fiercely criticized in parts of the Australian press, the last place Herzog likely expected further invective was from the Oval Office in the White House. Yet there it was.
Trump’s comments did more than create diplomatic discomfort; they complicated Herzog’s overall calculus regarding the pardon.
On the one hand, Herzog could not ignore a public rebuke from the American president – particularly one who has positioned himself as Israel’s staunchest ally. On the other hand, any response had to be measured and respectful, mindful of Trump’s temperament and of the enormous importance of US-Israel ties.
The statement crafted by Herzog and his aides was careful and procedural. Netanyahu’s pardon request is currently with the Justice Ministry for a legal opinion, they said. Once that process is complete, the president will deal with the matter. That was consistent with what Herzog told reporters throughout his Australian trip, even before Trump’s intervention.
“Only after the process is concluded will the president examine the request in accordance with the law, the good of the state, and his conscience – and without any influence from external or internal pressures of any kind,” the statement read.
Herzog 'appreciates' Trump
Herzog stressed that he appreciates Trump for his significant contribution to the State of Israel and its security, while stressing that Israel is “governed by the rule of law” and that – contrary to the impression left by Trump’s comments – no decision has yet been made.
The message was two-fold: appreciation for Trump’s invaluable support, coupled with a polite reminder that Israel is “a sovereign state.”
But Trump’s intervention changes the political equation.
If Herzog ultimately grants the pardon, critics will argue he did so under American pressure. If he refuses, Netanyahu’s supporters will frame the decision as a slight to Trump – a rebuff to Israel’s most important ally and champion.
And that framing is not incidental. After calling Herzog “disgraceful,” Trump praised Netanyahu as a great wartime leader and declared, “I’ve been the best friend to Israel that they’ve ever had.”
The implied subtext is unmistakable: I am Israel’s best friend. I am asking for this. You owe me.
That is precisely what makes Herzog’s already fraught decision even more precarious. What was once a domestic dilemma has now acquired a new dimension – one that may have ramifications for the US-Israel relationship.
After the initial shock and the release of Herzog’s statement on Saturday, sources close to Herzog questioned whether Netanyahu put Trump up to this particular task. The timing, after all, was suspicious, with Trump’s diatribe coming just a day after he met Netanyahu in Washington.
They said that if Netanyahu did indeed have something to do with Trump’s remarks, this “constitutes crossing a red line.”
Sources close to the prime minister denied any involvement and said the remarks were entirely at Trump’s own initiative. They said Netanyahu heard about the remarks in the media and had no prior knowledge of them – just as he had no advance knowledge of the president’s call in the Knesset in October for a pardon.
In politics, perception matters
But in politics, perception often matters more than anything else.
The damage is not necessarily in coordination between Netanyahu and Trump – proven or unproven – but in optics. Trump’s very public intervention soon after meeting Netanyahu, in conjunction with his framing of the issue in personal and transactional terms, has reshaped the context in which the public will now judge any decision by Herzog.
Before Trump’s remarks, the president’s dilemma was domestic and legal. However controversial, a decision to pardon or not could have been debated on legal grounds, moral reasoning, precedent, or the need for national healing and for the country to move on. Now that space has narrowed.
If Herzog grants clemency, critics will not examine the logic in the Justice Ministry’s legal opinion or weigh the broader national interest. They will point to Trump’s demand and conclude that Israel’s president bowed to pressure from Washington. The decision will be interpreted not as a sovereign act of conscience, but as acquiescence.
If he refuses, Netanyahu’s supporters will argue that Herzog chose defiance over alliance – that he rebuffed Israel’s most forceful international backer in the midst of war and diplomatic strain to prove a point and to prevent coming under a barrage of criticism from the anti-Netanyahu camp.
In other words, Herzog is now effectively hemmed in. Trump, with or without prodding from Netanyahu, has shifted the debate from the merits of the pardon to the motivations behind it. And once motivation becomes the story, the actual substance of the matter becomes secondary.
To many Israelis, the whole saga is unseemly. Herzog may indeed want to decide this based on the dictates of his conscience and his reading of what is best for the country.
But Trump’s intervention has made that far more difficult. Any way Herzog turns, the decision will now be judged through a political lens – not because of what he decides, but because of the context in which he has been forced to decide.

Modern politics a 'clown show': Obama says Democrats have harder job than Republicans

Former US president Barack Obama said the current state of US political discourse feels like a “clown show,” in an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen on Saturday.
“Most Americans find this behavior deeply troubling,” Obama said. “Some public figures no longer seem to feel shame. But the majority don’t approve, and ultimately the answer will come from them.”
While he didnt mention current US President Donald Trump by name, Obama’s comment appeared to reference a video shared by Trump containing an AI-generated clip of Barack and Michelle Obama as apes.
The former president also claimed that while extraterrestrial life exists, he has never seen any aliens himself.
“They’re not being kept in Area 51 - unless there’s an enormous conspiracy that hid it from the president,” he said.
Obama said Democrats have harder job than Republicans
Obama also stated that in his eyes, Democrats have a harder job than Republicans, as, according to him, one group focuses on protecting norms while the other pursues its goals aggressively.
“We believe in government as a force for good, which means building majorities, persuading people, passing laws,” he said. “Tearing things down is easier.“
The former president said that he was able to get younger people to vote by building joy and community into his presidential campaign.
“The other side thrives on anger and division. Our strength is community. That spirit of shared purpose - that’s our home court,” he said.
When asked about how Democrats can avoid infighting as the 2028 election approaches, Obama insisted that divisions within the party have been exaggerated.
“A candidate in Virginia may run as a centrist; one in New York may run as an explicit socialist. That’s healthy. We don’t need to nationalize every issue. And we shouldn’t treat policy debates as moral betrayals,” he said.
“Take immigration. Morally, that child in Minneapolis deserves dignity. But voters also want orderly borders. We have to balance values with political reality.”

Some 539,000 Israelis aged 20 and over (8.6%) reported being victims of online crimes in 2024, according to data released by the Central Bureau of Statistics on Monday for National Safe Internet Surfing Week.
This accounts for over half of the people aged 20 and over who reported being victims of any crime (15%).
More men than women in the over-20 demographic were victims of cyberbullying and shaming, with 52.6% being men and 47.4% women.
Of the thousands of online crimes reported in 2024, over half of them involved theft and/or distribution of information (52.4%), with a higher likelihood of women being the victims.
Women were also more likely to be the victims of crimes involving impersonation and/or identity theft, which accounted for 30.8% of reported cybercrimes.
The age groups most likely to fall victim to online crimes, regardless of gender, were 45–54 (11.1%, or about 113,000 people) and 35–44 (10.2%, or about 122,000 people), while the lowest rate was among those over 65 (4.7%).
Generally, men were reported to be more likely to be victims of online crime, with the exception of the age group 35–44, where 8.7% of men reported victimization compared to 11.8% of women.
When divided by religious demographic, Jewish and other religions reported victimization at a rate six times higher than Arabs.
In Jewish communities, the highest rate of victimization was in the modern orthodox community (12.1%), while the lowest rate was among the ultra-Orthodox (5.1%).
Those with higher levels of education fell victim to cybercrimes more often
A majority of those victimized by online crime were individuals with master’s and doctoral degrees, with crime rates lowering with less formal education.
While those with high school degrees were most likely to fall victim to crimes involving theft and/or the distribution of information, those with advanced degrees were most likely to be targeted by crimes involving impersonation or identity theft.
According to the CBS, over 90% of victims did not actually report the crimes to the Israel Police, though about 40% of those who didn't said they had reported the crime to a separate authority instead.
About 13% of victims who chose not to report the crime cited the police’s inability to handle such cases, and nearly 10% said they did not feel the need to report what they considered a minor incident to police.
Some 42% of households in Israel have children aged 2-18, and 6.8% of those households have been the victim of at least one online crime. Theft, violence or threats of violence, sexual harassment, sexual offenses, online crime, and/or cyberbullying and shaming were prominent among those crimes.
In a majority of households where children aged 6–17 experienced victimization, it had occurred over the previous 12 months.
The rate of children victimized by online crime in Jewish households was 1.1%, while the estimate for Arab households could not be retrieved by the CBS due to the small number of cases.
Separately from the thousands who have already been victimized by online crimes, some 25.3% of adults aged 20 and over said they feared “to a very great extent” or “to a great extent” that they would become victims in the future.
Members of Arab society were the least afraid of falling victim to online crimes, at 15.7% compared to 27.5% for Jews and others.

United States Announces Need to Develop Mini-Interceptor for Tanker Aircraft
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

03:07:18 KST

The U.S. Air Force has identified a requirement for a miniature interceptor missile to defend tanker aircraft against incoming enemy missiles.
Aviation Week reported the development, citing Kevin Stamey, Program Executive Officer and Director for the Mobility and Training Aircraft Directorate at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center.
According to Stamey, aircraft in the U.S. Air Force tanker fleet require a new type of air-to-air interceptor capable of destroying incoming missiles.
By integrating such an interceptor into transport aircraft, the Air Force aims to reduce reliance on electronic countermeasures, which must be continually upgraded to keep pace with evolving adversary capabilities.
“Whether it’s an infrared seeker or a radar seeker, if we have a way to destroy it kinetically, we don’t have to rely on electronic attack or decoys that may be effective against some threats but not others,” Stamey said.
Kinetic interceptors would serve as a last line of defense, particularly against missiles equipped with dual-mode seekers.
“If all else fails and a threat penetrates other layers of defense, we would still have a means to protect the tanker aircraft,” he added.
Efforts to develop a mini-missile for aircraft self-defense are not new, but previous programs have not resulted in an operational system.
For example, in 2015, the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) disclosed work on the Miniature Self-Defense Munition (MSDM). At the time, AFRL said it was seeking a “highly maneuverable, highly responsive” miniature missile with a low-cost passive seeker and an overall length of about one meter.
AFRL initially contracted Raytheon and Lockheed Martin for the MSDM program. In 2020, Raytheon received an additional contract for what was described as a “miniature self-defense missile,” covering research and development of a flight-ready design. The effort appeared to continue the earlier MSDM work under a slightly revised name. However, Raytheon has not publicly presented a working prototype of such an interceptor.
In 2018, the United States Navy also issued a request for information on missile options to protect transport aircraft, tankers, and other support aircraft. The concept was also considered for use on advanced unmanned aerial systems.
In late January 2026, China released detailed imagery of the PL-17 ultra-long-range air-to-air missile, designed to target high-value aircraft. Its maximum range is estimated at about 400 kilometers.
Such weapons are primarily intended to engage large, high-value airborne assets, including tanker aircraft and airborne early warning and control platforms.

Russia revives election-day truce offer, proposes UN rule for Ukraine

Russia is ready to halt strikes on Ukraine for a single day of voting, Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in a Feb. 15 interview with the state-controlled news agency TASS, saying President Vladimir Putin's earlier proposal to pause strikes on election day "remains valid."
The remarks followed President Volodymyr Zelensky's comments at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 that Ukraine would be ready to hold elections after at least two months of a ceasefire. Zelensky also said Ukraine could "announce a ceasefire for Russians" if Russia were to hold elections itself.
Galuzin accused Kyiv of failing to hold elections, though Ukrainian law prohibits national voting under martial law imposed after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. He also called Zelensky "illegitimate" and suggested Kyiv could manipulate voting procedures.
He went further, proposing "temporary external governance" for Ukraine under the UN, which he said would allow elections and bring to power a government with which Russia could sign a peace treaty.
"We are ready to discuss temporary external governance of Ukraine under the UN," he said.
"Such a step would allow for democratic elections to be held in Ukraine and bring to power a capable government with which it would be possible to sign a full-fledged peace treaty and legitimate documents on the future cooperation between our two countries."
Zelensky has in recent weeks promoted the idea of holding a referendum and potentially presidential elections immediately after a ceasefire is reached to show international partners that Ukraine is serious about a potential peace deal.
The remarks came as Russia continues regular missile and drone attacks across Ukrainian . The strikes have targeted cities, civilian infrastructure, and energy facilities, contributing to a nationwide energy crisis and making 2025 the deadliest year for Ukrainian civilians since the start of the full-scale war.

Angus Taylor needs a convincing economic plan, and fast
New Liberal leader Angus Taylor has made improved living standards central to his pitch to become prime minister.
In his maiden press conference after being elected opposition leader on Friday, Taylor said: “I say to Australians, the first priority of the Liberal Party now under my leadership will be to restore our standard of living and protect our way of life.”
Most voters will welcome the sentiment; Taylor must not delay in presenting voters with detailed economic policies to match the rhetoric.
He takes on the Liberal leadership as the Albanese government confronts a list of tricky economic challenges. Damaging price pressures have re-emerged during the past six months; inflation is now running at 3.8 per cent, well above the Reserve Bank’s target band of 2 to 3 per cent.
The RBA has lifted rates once this year in a bid to end the inflationary surge and further increases are a strong possibility. This unwelcome news for millions of indebted households follows years of elevated public concern about the cost of living.
The May federal budget looms as a stern test for Treasurer Jim Chalmers.
There is a case to suggest government spending has played at least some role in the recent inflationary spike. Chalmers must ensure that the 2026 budget does not make the problem worse.
The government is also being pressured to boost productivity growth and to do more to address housing affordability. The budget, Chalmers’ fifth, is an obvious platform to unveil effective new solutions.
The Liberal Party is languishing in the polls, but the government’s economic problems present Taylor with a political opportunity. To make the most of it, he must move beyond hollow rhetoric.
At Friday’s press conference, Taylor repeatedly described the Albanese government as “rotten” and even said it was the “worst Labor government in Australian history”.
But vague attacks will not be sufficient to rebuild the opposition’s economic credibility.
The latest Resolve Political Monitor, published on Monday by this masthead, shows only 26 per cent of respondents believe the Liberal-National Coalition would be the best economic manager. That’s the same share as Labor, despite the government’s economic troubles.
The Coalition was also on par with Labor (on 26 per cent) for which party would perform best in managing government finances.
This underscores how nebulous criticism of Labor will be insufficient to rebuild the Liberal Party’s economic bona fides.
Taylor is often portrayed as a Liberal in the Howard-Costello tradition, but he should not dwell on the past. Economic conditions have shifted dramatically in the 30 years since the Howard government won office.
Unless Taylor can skilfully address contemporary economic challenges, he runs the risk of being branded yesterday’s man.
The thumping 34-17 victory over outgoing Liberal leader Sussan Ley in Friday’s party room ballot gives Taylor scope for bold action. He must now outline specific policies to achieve his promise to restore living standards.
The opposition leader needs a fresh and convincing economic plan, and fast.

Zelenskyy: Ukraine to receive new support packages
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has announced that Ukraine is to receive new support packages from its international partners.
Source: Zelenskyy in his evening address
Quote: "I'm already back in Kyiv after two very intense days at the Munich Security Conference. There were many meetings, and most importantly – there will be new support packages for Ukraine.
The key priority is missiles for air defence, for protection against ballistic missiles. This has been issue number one throughout this entire winter, as you know. That is why we discussed it in Munich with virtually every leader who can truly help us. Also with Marco Rubio, US Secretary of State. We hope the agreements will work as needed. Air defence is a daily necessity."
Details: Zelenskyy said meetings are expected to be held next week and work will be done on the new energy packages, focusing on both recovery after Russian strikes and the equipment that is needed.
Zelenskyy also mentioned the trilateral meetings with US and Russian representatives that are scheduled for next week.
Quote: "The Ukrainian delegation has the necessary framework for the discussion. Yesterday we coordinated with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. Ukraine will always be constructive. The American side knows this. But Ukrainians need to see real progress on security so there's real trust – trust both in diplomacy and in possible results. Overall, it is precisely the security issue that holds the key to ending the war. Security guarantees for Ukraine are necessary; this is the key priority."

Jordan, Qatar condemn Israeli decision to register West Bank land as ‘state property’
Amman says decision violates international law and amounts to annexation of occupied Palestinian territory
- Doha urges international pressure to halt illegal measure undermining Palestinian rights and the 2-state solution
ISTANBUL
Jordan and Qatar on Sunday condemned Israel’s decision to register land in the occupied West Bank as “state property,” calling the move a “flagrant violation” of international law, an attempt to annex Palestinian territory and unlawful plans to strip the Palestinian people of their rights.
The Israeli decision “undermines the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, ending the occupation and establishing an independent, sovereign state on the June 4, 1967 lines with East Jerusalem as its capital,” the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The ministry stressed that “Israel has no sovereignty” over the occupied West Bank.
It rejected any Israeli decisions or attempts “to impose sovereignty and laws” on the occupied West Bank, describing such actions as a “clear breach of international law and the existing legal status of the occupied territory.”
The ministry called on the international community to assume its legal and moral responsibilities and compel Israel, as the occupying power, “to halt dangerous escalation and unilateral measures” in the occupied West Bank.
“Fulfilling the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people, foremost among them the establishment of an independent state on their national soil, remains the only path toward achieving a just and comprehensive peace that ensures regional security and stability,” it stressed.
The UN and the international community consider the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, occupied territory, and regard Israeli settlements there as illegal under international law.
Qatar’s Foreign Ministry also denounced the Israeli move, describing it as an extension of an unlawful plan to strip the Palestinian people of their rights. It stressed the need for international solidarity and urged the global community to pressure Israel to halt implementation of the decision to avoid “serious consequences.”
The ministry reiterated Qatar’s “firm and longstanding” support for the Palestinian cause and reaffirmed its backing for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on international legitimacy and the two-state solution.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Brazil Carnival street party do's and don'ts: A survival kit from veterans to beginners
Veteran Carnival fans in Rio say the party is fun, but it also takes planning and endurance
- Bookmark
Carnival in Rio de Janeiro is for the uninitiated an energetic spectacle of joy, beauty and just-let-it-go. But for revelers with years of experience it is also a test of endurance, street-wise culture and pacing that allows them to still be standing after four days of festivities.
A balance between dos and don’ts is also needed, veteran Brazilian Carnival partygoers assure. Drinking water under Rio’s scorching summer heat is a must. But drinking too much of it requires revelers to find a bathroom, and that can be a scathing experience.
Eating a sound breakfast is key for energy, but a bit too much could mean a very slow walk along the cobblestone streets as other revelers speed up their pace.
Sunday marks the second official day of the bash, which ends on Ash Wednesday.
Geography and history professor Helena Lemos, 67, who also goes by her Hare Krishna name Kunti Devi Dasi, has been a Rio Carnival reveler since her teenage years. She is playing different drumming instruments in five street parties this year, and her survival kit is always with her.
“I am vegetarian, so my food kit is very light, just dried fruit, almonds, raisins. These will give you energy, won’t add to your weight and will keep you cool,” Lemos, who wore a light white shirt and sunglasses, told The Associated Press before her first street party on Friday in the bohemian region of Santa Teresa, in downtown Rio.
“Earlier, I had lemon tea for breakfast to have an easier digestion, had some tapioca pancakes and some coffee for stamina," she said. "I had a fruit smoothie to get some more energy and then some creatine. When I get back, I will have isotonic drinks because we can’t have them before the street parties.”
Pharmacist Ana Rodrigues Andrade, 44, is playing in nine street parties during this Carnival edition. Years ago she did 15 and still showed up at the city’s glitzy sambadrome to parade for three samba schools. Her main tips regard resting in between parties and bringing hygiene items.
“Under this sun you obviously need sunscreen, you leave home wearing it. You got to prepare it at home and also bring some. Women do need to bring toilet paper and hand sanitizers because the situation of bathrooms during a street party is not good at all. Bring it in a little purse,” Andrade said, as she carried a large drum kit by her belly. “It is also worth bringing a lot of adhesive tape if you’re playing an instrument, so you don’t hurt your hands.”
Physical education teacher Diego Tiriba, 49, has been a Rio Carnival reveler since his childhood. His strategy is being more frugal when he is on the streets and doing most of the preparation at home. He is also concerned about security in a city where criminal activity is considerable.
“I bring a money belt with some cash, a credit card, a bus card, my medical insurance card and the keys to my home, my cellphone and nothing else,” a shirtless Tiriba said, as he removed the money belt from under his shorts. Many women hide their cellphones and money under their shirts.
Most veteran revelers in Rio do not recommend buying food during street parties. Any indigestion might become a major problem at a time when millions are out and public bathrooms might be far. They also say that beer and fast-paced street parties do not go well together on very hot days, for that combination could end in dizziness.
But even longtime revelers make their mistakes.
“Once I spread sunscreen only on my face, the rest of my body was all red,” pharmacist Andrade said. “Today I will have trouble again, I forgot my knee braces to protect from the drum.”

Top British and German military chiefs press ‘moral’ case for rearmament

Britain and Germany’s highest ranking military leaders have made an unprecedented joint appeal to the public to accept the “moral” case for rearmament and prepare for the threat of war with Russia.
The pair said they were making the plea not just as the military leaders of two of Europe’s largest military spenders, but “as voices for a Europe that must now confront uncomfortable truths about its security”.
Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, the UK’s chief of the defence staff, and Gen Carsten Breuer, Germany’s chief of defence, said Russia’s military stance had “shifted decisively westward” and a “step change” was needed in Europe’s defence and security.
In a joint article published in the Guardian and the German newspaper Die Welt, in the wake of the Munich Security Conference, the soldiers said they had a duty “to explain what is at stake so that the public could understand why the UK and Germany have committed to the biggest sustained increases in defence spending since the end of the cold war”.
“There is a moral dimension to this endeavour. Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace,” they write.
There is significant reluctance among voters in Britain and Germany to accept economic pain in return for rearmament, even while majorities in both countries believe the outbreak of a third world war is more likely than not in the next five years.
In Britain, polling this month by YouGov found that a minority favour tax rises (25%) or spending cuts (24%) to fund greater spending on the armed forces – including those who say it is very important to increase UK hard power.
German and French voters are also now less likely than they were last year to support increased defence budgets if it meant a trade-off with other investment, according to a poll for Politico this month.
The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said at the weekend that there was an urgent need for Britain to have a closer defence relationship with Europe, covering procurement and manufacturing, so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup.
In a visit to the Munich Security Conference, he told the audience: “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years” as he argued that the long-term threat posed by Russia and the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defence required the UK to integrate more closely on defence procurement with European allies.
Europe was, he said, “a sleeping giant” but there had been fragmented industrial planning and procurement
Knighton and Breuer write: “If Russia perceives Europe as weak or divided, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. We know that Russian aggression and intentions extend beyond Ukraine.”
Echoing language used by government figures in Britain, Germany and other European states, Knighton and Breuer said the complexity of threats demanded a “an honest continent-wide conversation with our publics that defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone”.
They called for a “whole-of-society defence” with resilient infrastructure, research and development in technology from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats.
The UK and Germany have committed to deepening security and defence cooperation and signed what became known as the Trinity House agreement in 2024.
The German government is under pressure to meet its promise to revive economic growth after a prolonged downturn and to ramp up defence spending amid concerns over Russian aggression.
Germany is permanently stationing a combat brigade of 4,000-5,000 troops to Nato’s eastern flank and has amended its constitution to make essentially unrestricted funding available for defence.
Procurement of several thousand armoured vehicles has also started, alongside an expansion of industrial capacity.
Britain is building as many as six munitions factories, which are aimed at generating what the Ministry of Defence describes as an “always on” capability to sustain munitions stockpiles.
The debate about European security – almost four years after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and amid increasing ambiguity around the extent of US support for Nato after Donald Trump’s return to the White House – comes as the governments in Germany and the UK seek to rebalance spending after an era of investing a supposed “peace dividend” in public services.
Nato leaders at last year’s summit in The Hague committed to spending 5% of GDP on defence and security by 2035.
Such a move would expand the British economy in the short term, according to research, but there is still opposition on the left of the Labour party to defence hikes at the cost of spending on health and alleviating poverty. That debate is even more polarised in Germany, with opposition to increased defence spending on the left and, to a degree, from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party.
Speaking on the opening day of the Munich conference, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, singled out the threat Russia posed to Europe, warning “freedom can no longer be taken for granted”.
“We have to understand that in the era of big powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is at stake. We will need to show firmness and determination to assert this freedom,” he said.
Merz also disclosed he had held initial talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, over the possibility of joining France’s nuclear umbrella, underlining his call for Europe to develop a stronger self-standing security strategy.

Zelensky explains how Trump should pressure Putin
According to Ukrinform, he stated this in an interview with Politico.
Zelensky emphasized that the U.S. president should act without regard for Moscow's opinion. His top priority is providing Ukraine with security guarantees.
"I think so… He [Trump] has to give us security guarantees, strong security guarantees, without dialogue with Putin. Because it's security guarantees of the President of the United States," Zelensky said.
The second step is implementing plans for Ukraine's reconstruction. According to Zelensky, this is a necessary condition for moving toward peaceful life.
"Give us the package of reconstruction of Ukraine. It's the second step: that we will renovate, and it means that peace will come," the Ukrainian leader emphasized.
The next stage should be a direct demand to Putin to end the war.
"Third point: to call Putin and say: 'Look, you have to stop where you are now. We have to freeze the conflict now, and then we will meet trilaterally on the leaders' level and we will manage how to finish this war,'" Zelensky said.
As Ukrinform reported, the Ukrainian delegation, led by Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov, has already begun preparations for a trilateral meeting of representatives from Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, which will take place in Geneva on February 17–18.

As defence chiefs, we warn you today about Russia, and say this rearmament is not warmongering | Richard Knighton and Carsten Breuer

We write today not merely as the military leaders of two of Europe’s largest military spenders, but as voices for a Europe that must now confront uncomfortable truths about its security. Through the early years of our careers, Europe was emerging from the shadow of the cold war. Governments of all political colours chose to take what was known as the “peace dividend” – investing in public services and reducing spending on defence. That was an understandable choice at the time. Now it’s clear that the threats we face demand a step change in our defence and security. European leaders, along with military and civilian officials, have just discussed necessary consequences at the annual Munich security conference.
As military leaders, we see every day from intelligence and open sources how Russia’s military posture has shifted decisively westward. Its forces are rearming and learning from the war in Ukraine, reorganising in ways that could heighten the risk of conflict with Nato countries. This is a reality we must prepare for; we cannot be complacent. Moscow’s military buildup, combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention.
At the Hague summit last year, Nato leaders committed to spend 5% of GDP on defence and security by 2035. This reflects our new security reality and requires hard choices and prioritisation on public spending for all members.
As the chiefs of defence of two of Europe’s biggest security providers, we have a duty to explain what is at stake, so that people can understand why our governments have committed to the biggest sustained increases in defence spending since the end of the cold war. That’s why it’s important that we communicate the threat. People must understand the difficult choices governments have to take in order to strengthen deterrence.
History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. If Russia perceives Europe in this way, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. Indeed, we know that Moscow’s intentions range wider than the current conflict. But the good news is that Europe is powerful. Nato is the most successful military alliance in history and today, together, its military might is unsurpassed. We have sophisticated capabilities across land, sea, air and cyber domains, and nuclear deterrence. And we have long been adapting to the new security reality: through building a new model for European security, underpinned by engagement, readiness and collaboration.
This starts with Britain and Germany deepening cooperation. Our landmark Trinity House agreement in 2024 is paving the way for unprecedented cooperation that benefits both our security and economies.
Military readiness must mean a strong European defence industry. Ukraine shows us that industrial bases are key to sustaining and ultimately winning any major war. The increased defence spending under way across our countries proves that we are taking this seriously, as we cannot deter if we cannot produce. Our industries must be capable of sustained output – manufacturing the ammunition, systems and platforms our forces require at the pace modern conflict demands.
Britain is building at least six munitions factories, which will generate an “always on” capability to sustain munitions stockpiles. Germany is permanently stationing an entire combat brigade to the eastern flank and has amended its constitution to make essentially unrestricted funding available for defence. Procurement of several thousand armoured vehicles has started, accompanied by an expansion of industrial capacity.
In addition, the European Union’s Security Action for Europe (Safe) initiative will inject €150bn (£130bn) to strengthen Europe’s defence industrial base.
There is a moral dimension to this endeavour. Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace. Strength deters aggression. Weakness invites it.
Finally, the complexity of threats demands a whole-of-society approach and an honest, continent-wide conversation with the public that defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone. It is a task for each and every one of us.
Whole-of-society defence requires resilient infrastructure, research and development in hi-tech from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats. The path ahead calls for courage and an honest conversation with our citizens. Europe’s security is our shared responsibility, and we intend to meet it together.
When Europe acts together, we are a formidable force. And we act together, we are not Great Britain and Germany alone.

Transcript: Rep. Robert Garcia on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 15, 2026
The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Robert Garcia, Democrat of California, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 15, 2026.
ED O'KEEFE: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We turn now to the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, California Congressman Robert Garcia, who joins us this morning from Long Beach, where he used to be the mayor. Congressman, good to see you. Thank you for being with us.
REP. ROBERT GARCIA: Sure thing, thank you.
ED O'KEEFE: I want to start real quick because you are on the committee that essentially has oversight of the entire government. You're Democrats. You don't have control of the panel. You've held some unofficial hearings on ICE operations nationwide. I'm curious if you're talking to the Republicans at all about doing anything to investigate allegations of wrongdoing of ICE and the Border Patrol as they continue to carry on immigration enforcement operations.
REP. GARCIA: Look, I think it's just been very recently we actually see more and more Republicans actually speak out and begin to show some level of courage. ICE, CBP, DHS is completely out of control. We have heard, not just in hearings, but certainly in looking at what's happening across this country and folks talking and telling their stories. We're talking about U.S, citizens that are being shot. We're talking about U.S. veterans that are being detained for no reason. Children that are being deported as young as four or five years old, sending to detention in other cases, as we've seen. And so I think you're beginning to see some Republicans actually show concern. But, right now, DHS is causing terror across this country, and Donald Trump has turned not just DHS, but ICE specifically, which we now know is larger than it's ever been, into his own personal police force.
ED O'KEEFE: But you know of no Republican committee chairman currently planning to investigate all these allegations, right? Is that what you're saying?
REP. GARCIA: Oh, there's no chairmen out there that have come out publicly. Now, you begin to hear some Republicans show some concern, but they need to show more courage. I mean, Mike Johnson, at the end of the day, does whatever Donald Trump wants him to do--
ED O'KEEFE: --Yeah--
REP. GARCIA: --and Republicans need to go out there and start speaking the truth of what's happening on the street.
ED O'KEEFE: So the big reason I wanted to speak with you this morning is, of course, you're now trying to conduct a pretty aggressive review of the Epstein documents, as they've now been released by the Justice Department. There have been about three and a half million documents released, and based on a CBS News review, so far there doesn't appear to be enough evidence to criminally charge anyone else. Saturday night, the Department of Justice released this legally required list of all government officials and politically exposed persons in the Epstein files. More than 300 names on the list which they acknowledge are people who are here listed in a wide variety of contexts. DOJ says they're doing this ask because it was part of the law. It lists everyone from Beyonce to Joe Biden, George W. Bush, Princess Diana, Michael Jackson, Barack Obama, Mike Pence, the Trumps, Mark Zuckerberg, among others, because they came up in one way or another in the documents. A few questions, why was this asked for? And are you aware yet of any names being not on this list that should be on the list?
REP. GARCIA: We're reviewing that list, of course, but let's, let's be really clear, this is a massive cover up being led by the White House and the DOJ. The fact that 50%, half of the Epstein files have not been released to the public and to the Congress, and of those that have been released, the actual files that have been out in the public or that we've seen, they're overly redacted. Many of the survivors and victims, their names are actually appearing with where there's no protection for the survivors. Yet, the names of billionaires, the names of folks that could be co-conspirators that helped fund Jeffrey Epstein, that could have actually been involved in the terror and rape, as we know, abuse of women and children, some of those names continue to be redacted and protected. Why won't the DOJ actually follow the law? Not just of what was passed by Congress but the subpoena that was put in place by the Oversight Committee during the summer. And so this continues to be a cover up, and the American public understands that they continue to hide and protect and deflect. Why does Donald Trump, the president continue to, in our opinion, to protect these powerful men? We're not going to stop until we get justice for the survivors.
ED O'KEEFE: The Justice Department says they released everything they can, and the rest are protected by attorney privilege, contain victim information or contain child sexual assault material. I know there's been a back and forth in recent days about a handful of names that were redacted, should have been unredacted. Turns out, they didn't have anything to do with it. They just happened to be in an event or in a photo with Jeffrey Epstein, basically. But I want to ask you about your investigation, a congressional investigation. You told the attorney general on Friday, it would take more than seven years for members to check the redactions on those three million pages, which sounds unrealistic, but is it your intent to review all of those documents to see what other information is there? What other names are either mentioned or missing?
REP. GARCIA: Absolutely. Look, we have a great team on the committee that's reviewing, right now, every single document, going through all the files that are available to the public, looking at redactions, trying to understand and piecing together an investigation. And it's not just the documents. We're interviewing survivors. We're talking to key witnesses.
ED O'KEEFE: Right.
REP. GARCIA: We're going to be holding hearings in the future as well. So all of that is part of this, but at the end of the day, they have not given us all the documents. So until we actually get the full set of files, this is not going to be a complete investigation, and the cover up that's being led by the White House and Pam Bondi is continuing, and the American public sees this, and so they need to release all of the files.
ED O'KEEFE: All right. Well, working with what you've got so far, what are you looking for specifically? Are there names? Are there events? Are there situations to clarify that they've been released or that they're out there? What is it you're looking for?
REP. GARCIA: Look, there's a variety of things. Number one is we want to ensure that all the names of the men that either were co-conspirators, those that themselves terrorized and brutalized women and children, those people need to be exposed. That work has begun. An additional piece of this is who is financing Jeffrey Epstein? So, for example, this upcoming week, we'll be interviewing Les Wexner, who is likely have been the single largest benefactor in providing financial support to Jeffrey Epstein. Where did he get all of his money and for what? And where was that money going? That is another critical part of this investigation. We've subpoenaed also the bank records, so we're going through all those and that information is critical to our investigation. And then, of course, is who was involved in the trafficking of girls and women? It wasn't just Ghislaine Maxwell. Why were there so many women being attacked in places across the country, whether it was New York, but also Palm Beach. You look at Mar-a-Lago, why was Mar-a-Lago a location where women continue to be trafficked from? So these are questions that we need to ask. We have questions for, for President Trump. And the broader- I think the broader issue here is why wasn't this investigated when these, when these, when these accusations and these stories actually were heard by the FBI years ago? Where was the investigation? Where was the DOJ? And this, by the way, is an issue not just in Republican administrations but also ones led by Democrats. We have to get answers.
ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. You mentioned Wexner, who you're interviewing this coming week. Have you heard back yet from the man formerly known as Prince Andrew?
REP. GARCIA: We have not, but we absolutely have sent letters. We want to actually talk to Prince Andrew And it's not just Prince And- former Prince Andrew.
ED O'KEEFE: Right.
REP. GARCIA: I mean, what's happening right now across- over in the UK is pretty stunning, and it's actually a show of what is- what happens when the government listens to the public.
ED O'KEEFE: Sure.
REP. GARCIA: There are actually things happening to those have been involved. That example, that's happening over there and in other parts of the world, needs to happen in our country, and the fact that the White House continues to cover up for these files and for these men, I think, is shameful. Release all the files today, and last thing, they keep claiming that, oh, well, there is a, you know, there's attorney-client privilege or there's interagency communication we can't put out to the public. That might be true in the Epstein Transparency Act, but it's not true in the subpoena that asked for the exact same documents that was passed last July and August. And so there is no reason why Congress shouldn't have all of the documents in front of us right now.
ED O'KEEFE: Let me ask you about a few more specific names. I've heard about the cover up that you're alleging by the White House. Let's work through some of these names. Peter Mandelson, the former British ambassador to the U.S. You heard back from him yet?
REP. GARCIA: We have not, but we absolutely want to talk to him.
(CROSSTALK)
ED O'KEEFE: Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick. He had said in an interview last year he hadn't seen Howard Lutnick in years. Turns out, he went to see his island off the U.S. Virgin Islands with his family back in 2012, and he had business interests with him in 2014. Are you working with Republican Chairman Jim Comer to bring Howard Lutnick in for questioning?
REP. GARCIA: We have asked Jamie Comer to bring in Howard Lutnick, and we have yet no, had no response. Not only did he visit the island, he had tons of communication with Jeffrey Epstein after it was already known that Jeffrey Epstein was essentially convicted for preying on children. So it is, it is shameful that he's actually in our government. He should not be the Commerce Secretary. He should come talk to the Oversight Committee.
ED O'KEEFE: The Oversight Committee also voted last month to hold Bill and Hillary Clinton in contempt of Congress for failing to show up for similar testimony. They're now scheduled to appear later this month for closed door testimony. What's the point of having them come in?
REP. GARCIA: Look, we've said from day one that we're willing to talk to anybody, whether they're Republicans or Democrats, whoever they are, whatever, how powerful they are. If you have information about Jeffrey Epstein, we want to talk to you. We've been saying that about, about President Clinton for a while. I'm glad that he's coming in. Look, the one thing I'll say, I think both President Clinton and Secretary Clinton have also added that they would like those hearings to be public.
ED O'KEEFE: Right.
REP. GARCIA: That's something that we absolutely support. We have questions for, for President Clinton. We'll be asking those in New York in the weeks ahead, as you know, but there's a lot of people that we need to speak with, and the more that we can have these conversations in public, I think it's better for the American people. It's what they want to see, and they want to understand what was the truth about Epstein, who he knew, where he got his money from and why has there been a constant focus on covering up his crimes by so many in government?
ED O'KEEFE: Congressman Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, thank you for spending part of Sunday with us. We appreciate it, and we'll be right back.

How Jeffrey Epstein built the global network that protected him

"The minister glanced several times at his watch, so I took him aside and asked him to wait for half an hour. But it wasn't any use. Nobody came." This is how Francis Scott Fitzgerald, in 1925, described the pathetic funeral of Gatsby the Magnificent (The Great Gatsby), a mysterious man known for his extravagant parties and illegal fortune in the America of the Roaring Twenties. A century later, there was something of Gatsby in Jeffrey Epstein, the sexual predator who died alone in prison in the summer of 2019, after hosting some of the world's financial, political and cultural elite in a debauchery of sex and money. The recent release of thousands of new documents from the Epstein case revealed a worldwide grip, with unimaginable ramifications: threatening the British government and royalty, shaking Norway, implicating the International Olympic Committee and bringing down former French culture minister Jack Lang, with further ramifications in Russia and the Gulf states.
The comparison with Gatsby is not meant to excuse the financier's sexual crimes and child abuse, but rather to try to understand how one man – born in 1953 to a modest Jewish family in Brooklyn, the son of a municipal gardener and a childcare worker – managed to weave such a web of influence, from New York's wealthy elite to the scientific community of New England, passing through the global jet set, all with a sense of impunity. Without these connections, the predator probably could not have operated for so long.
Epstein was a predator, first convicted in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor, but also a gangster who built his fortune on the back of Leslie Wexner, 88 years old, the driving force behind the global success of the Abercrombie & Fitch and Victoria's Secret brands. He was also a seducer, offering his guests access to his business networks, political discussions and lavish parties, and also girls – "very young," according to numerous witnesses – to those who wanted them.

Karen thought she had $3 million in her super. She can’t get hold of a cent

Karen thought she had $3 million in her super. She can’t get hold of a cent
“Dear Chris, still no funds in the bank. I now have significant debt on several credit cards and am running low on what is available to live on. Could someone please explain what is happening and when funds will be available?”
Karen Hedberg was getting desperate. Her email, sent last November, was one of many over several months seeking repayment of her $3 million in superannuation and answers from Christopher Edwards, her accountant. Most went unanswered.
After 50 years as a veterinarian, the 74-year-old believed she was retiring with a multimillion-dollar self-managed super fund.
Over the second half of last year, Hedberg had trouble extracting her funds and clarity about her investments from Edwards, who is also a solicitor. Hedberg now believes she might need to sell her home to survive. She is not alone.
More than 20 clients and staff of Edwards spoke to this masthead as part of the investigation. All except Hedberg and one other did so on the proviso of anonymity. Some feared it could jeopardise their chances of recovering their funds. Others were yet to tell their families about the potential financial loss.
Nearly all told similar stories. They claimed Edwards had talked them into rolling their superannuation into self-managed super funds (SMSFs), and/or loaning him considerable sums, which were invested into his developments.
Collectively, they allege Edwards owes them nearly $25 million.
An employee, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential workplace matters, estimated the 65-year-old held at least $100 million across more than 100 clients.
More than a dozen clients have alleged he has engaged in impropriety and unethical conduct. Almost all have attempted to withdraw some or all of the funds they claim they are owed. Fourteen alleged those efforts have so far been unsuccessful.
Clients have lodged complaints about Edwards with NSW Police, the corporate regulator, Tax Practitioners Board and Australian Taxation Office. Police did not confirm whether they were investigating.
Last September, Edwards was banned by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) from providing financial advice without a licence. Edwards has told clients the ban does not affect his business. The regulator has an ongoing investigation into Edwards.
Clients fear any intervention will come too late.
Approached outside his Richmond office this month, Edwards denied any wrongdoing.
Asked why he hadn’t repaid his clients, Edwards said the civil courts would “determine whether I have contractual obligations or not”. Asked whether he had done anything wrong, Edwards replied: “Correct. I haven’t.”
The problems underscore the risks in the loosely regulated SMSF sector, which has grown to about $1 trillion today and represents nearly one-quarter of the superannuation system.
Accountants have not been permitted to advise on SMSFs without a financial licence for a decade.
The clients
The themes of each client’s story were nearly identical. Many spoke of financial hardship and mental distress.
Six said they had known Edwards for decades – some while he was teaching in the late 1980s, others while he studied law at University of Technology Sydney. Many described the relationship as friendship; one described him as family.
Hedberg says she was convinced to transfer her financial affairs to Edwards given he was a solicitor. She claims she has not been provided with any copies of contracts or agreements with the companies where her savings have been invested.
Edwards’ promise of high returns enticed several clients: rates of up to 10 per cent paid quarterly was a common arrangement. A source said Edwards convinced him that the returns of his retail super fund were inferior. So he transferred nearly $1 million into one of Edwards’ company’s bank accounts.
Funds were invested in corporate entities – primarily property developments across NSW and Queensland – in which Edwards held a financial interest and served as director.
Sources who have dealt with Edwards and his business partners for decades say the arrangements appeared to be beneficial to both him and his clients.
Since 2023, clients allege interest payments have become increasingly delayed – some have not been paid at all. Correspondence shows various explanations: medical episodes, frozen bank accounts and promises of “something more concrete” in coming weeks.
A signed contract, provided to this masthead by one source, shows Edwards repeatedly missed quarterly payments, and failed to repay the principal within the 48-month term. Repayment was now more than a year overdue, according to the deed of agreement.
At least 10 clients were chasing Edwards by the end of 2025 for missing quarterly payments.
Susan Templeman, MP for Macquarie whose federal electorate encompasses Richmond, said: “Their distress is profound – the stress, the hours of work involved in trying to sort their affairs, as well as the financial implications that they have described.”
Those anxieties were exacerbated when an email from Edwards’ office landed in their inboxes. Payments would be delayed because Edwards had been admitted to hospital just before Christmas for a “routine floppy bladder operation”, it was explained, asking them to allow 10 additional business days for the “large settlement of funds”.
Another email arrived in mid-January: a promise that Edwards would soon provide a more concrete date as to when the cash would arrive.
‘The banning of me as a financial planner is interesting because I am not one. Speaking candidly, I do not want to be one.’Accountant Christopher Edwards
On January 13, dozens of clients were told the delay was caused by an industry super fund freezing investor funds because of internal issues. Edwards’ email added that, “more fundamentally”, the ASIC investigation had resulted in his bank accounts being frozen.
“This did lead to a run-on-the-banks situation where many people who had been contacted by ASIC or read the ASIC press release decided to withdraw capital or not proceed with their obligations to the company,” he wrote.
“As a director, it is for this reason I had to freeze all capital withdrawals and also point out that there were contractual obligations to the company and these had to remain in place.”
The ban
“The news flash is misleading,” Edwards emailed Hedberg in September.
“The banning of me as a financial planner is interesting because I am not one. Speaking candidly, I do not want to be one.”
The correspondence arrived on September 19, two days after ASIC announced Edwards would be barred from providing financial advice until 2035.
It was just one of many investigations ASIC was undertaking, Edwards emailed Hedberg, urging her not to “lose sleep over this”.
“Fundamentally and from your perspective, please be assured all is fine with your invested funds,” he wrote.
In a statement, ASIC alleged that Edwards provided financial advice with “sufficient system, repetition and continuity” over a four-year period, despite not holding a licence. The regulator held “serious concerns” about other aspects of his conduct, particularly, the “significant conflict of interest” between his personal interest in securing funding for his property development companies and his obligations as a lawyer and an accountant.
“ASIC found Mr Edwards’ conduct in approaching his accounting and legal clients and making recommendations that they invest in companies which he controls was particularly serious,” ASIC wrote.
Despite saying the ban has no bearing on his business, Edwards has applied for a review of ASIC’s decision in the Administrative Review Tribunal. He told this masthead via email that responding to further questions would be “inappropriate” in light of those proceedings.
The investments
Three of Edwards’ investments are a long way from completion.
For years, Edwards has been trying to convert a derelict, asbestos-ridden abattoir in Gunnedah, a small town west of Tamworth, into a solar energy farm. Several million dollars had been kicked into remediating the site, but Edwards has faced cashflow problems recently, an employee with insights into the project said.
A Gunnedah Shire Council spokeswoman said there was no evidence of physical commencement of two development applications for proposed solar projects on the site. Work had commenced on a third subdivision.
Through two of his companies – Great Northern Morayfield and Great Northern Developments – Edwards has two property developments planned in Queensland.
Edwards’ plans to build 39 homes in Morayfield, north of Brisbane, shows no movement. The project’s town planner requested City of Moreton Bay council provide a two-year extension last April, saying the developer had engaged a new builder while the “plans and proposal requires further investigations before they can move forward”.
A development in a suburb of Bundaberg – a 47-home community proposed by Great Northern Development – remained covered by grass.
Great Northern Development has run into trouble in the past. In figures provided to a receiver appointed in 2019, Edwards estimated the company’s assets were valued at $36.6 million against total liabilities of $34.4 million – a net position of $1.15 million.
The receiver did not respond to requests for comment.
Those figures were similar to financial statements Edwards provided a decade earlier during litigation ASIC brought against Great Northern Development.
The staff
ASIC has subpoenaed staff and clients as part of the latest investigation into Edwards.
After efforts to talk Edwards into returning their funds, clients have engaged lawyers. Two civil matters are listed in the NSW Supreme Court for the end of February.
To avoid winding up Great Northern Development during the ASIC case in 2010, Justice Richard White gave the company an undertaking to appoint a trustee to act as a “safe harbour” for clients’ funds. ASIC brokered a deal with La Trobe Financial. The asset manager took out formal mortgages over Edwards’ company’s development sites, meaning the land could be seized and investors paid back if the investment failed.
Last month, La Trobe issued Great Northern Development with default notices, requiring the company to make payment on debts by late February. If Edwards doesn’t comply, La Trobe can use its powers as a secured creditor to appoint a receiver, sell off assets and wind up the Edwards’ company.
A spokesman for La Trobe declined to comment.
This masthead has uncovered allegations that Edwards has breached signed contracts, and lodged tax returns falsely declaring third-party audits of the SMSF accounts had not been qualified.
The daughter of one elderly client claimed Edwards’ staff member walked her mother to the local Commonwealth Bank branch to withdraw hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in his company. It was the last she saw of the money.
‘The ATO and ASIC. Why can’t they talk to each other? That’s the billion-dollar question.’Rakesh Sahgal
“It’s atrocious. He’s preying on vulnerable people,” she alleged, claiming Edwards was now failing to return calls or emails.
Two staff members claimed Edwards’ employees took clients to withdraw funds they believe ultimately went to his investments.
Rakesh Sahgal, one of the tax agents engaged by Edwards to audit his clients’ SMSF accounts, said he began refusing work from him after he issued a number of qualified reports because he could not independently corroborate the value of Edwards’ investments.
Sahgal said he reported Edwards to the Australian Taxation Office “so many times”.
“The ATO and ASIC. Why can’t they talk to each other? That’s the billion-dollar question,” he said.
A spokesperson for the ATO said: “The ATO is unable to comment due to our obligations under taxpayer confidentiality laws.”
“The ATO works alongside ASIC to regulate all self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and, where permitted under the confidentiality laws, will share information and other intelligence with ASIC that enables us to meet our joint objectives.”
A spokesman for the regulator said: “ASIC’s investigation into Mr Edwards remains ongoing. We cannot comment any further on an ongoing investigation.”

If the Liberals stand any chance, Taylor must learn which fights not to pick

Opinion
If the Liberals stand any chance, Taylor must learn which fights not to pick
There are three elements that help determine whether an opposition leader will succeed. Angus Taylor, the newly elected leader of the Liberals, probably won’t need all three. Sometimes, just one is enough. Still, at this early stage, there are signs that Taylor may not have any.
The first is luck, also known as timing. Are you taking over at a time when the government is advantaged or disadvantaged by external events? Here, first impressions can be misleading. In Anthony Albanese’s first term, inflation seemed to dominate, a clear obstacle for the government. But in the end, other events – Donald Trump’s tariff war and his meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky – gave Labor a huge boost.
The second element is about your personal ability to command attention. It’s hard to comprehend just how hard this can be from opposition. Little of what you do has any impact – it’s all hypothetical. So how do you get the public to give you their time?
There are two main aspects here. One is political charisma. Bob Hawke is the exemplar, but it’s a stranger quality than his success suggests: it is a little like “star quality”, which can turn shy people into movie stars. Kevin Rudd was, on the face of it, a completely different proposition from Hawke. And yet Rudd, like Hawke, had some ineffable ability to reach voters through the camera.
This is a type of genius; and like all genius, it’s impossible to copy. This is unfortunate for Taylor, who does not possess it. In his first press conference as leader, Taylor improved when it was time for questions. In his prepared remarks, he appeared oddly low-energy, which is closer to his usual mode.
This is shallow stuff, so it is fortunate for all of us that personality and performance are not the only way to reach voters. Opposition is about making something out of nothing: turning particular policies into national issues. In his first term as opposition leader, Bill Shorten was skilled at this, destroying Joe Hockey’s “lifters and leaners” budget in 2014 and dictating much of the political agenda, much as Rudd had in 2007.
There are often pointers to the existence of this skill before a politician becomes leader. Rudd was a dynamo as shadow foreign affairs minister, particularly on the wheat-for-weapons scandal. As a minister, Shorten made the NDIS into a national cause. Taylor has not had any policy wins that anyone can remember.
That said, neither Albanese nor John Howard, as opposition leaders, were attention magnets. Both, however, understood the third element perfectly.
In 2024, this final element was explained by my former colleague, Lachlan Harris, who worked closely with Rudd on his successful campaign: “It usually takes several election losses for oppositions to learn that it’s often the things you don’t do that matter the most. The policies you don’t launch. The fights you don’t pick. The party shibboleths you don’t pursue. Opposition leaders must show restraint and restrain their party to prove they are ready to govern.”
There are conflicting signals here from Taylor. On Friday, he emphasised two issues: “standard of living” and “protecting our way of life”. At the level of discipline, this is textbook – in Harris’ formula, “seeking to channel the voting public’s attention into a small number of carefully curated political fault lines”.
And yet on both topics, there are already doubts around whether Taylor can narrow them to issues on which most voters will be onside. “Senior sources” told The Australian before the leadership vote that Taylor “had been talking to colleagues about the party being full-throated on cultural issues like the primacy of the Australian national flag and caution on the overuse of Welcome to Country”. And indeed yesterday, speaking about immigration, Taylor said he wanted people “who are happy and proud to stand in front of the Australian flag”.
These are exactly the types of issues that helped paint Peter Dutton as a cultural warrior rather than an economic manager. Taylor’s repeated assertion that in immigration “standards have been too low” treads on similarly dangerous ground – especially when you add it to Jane Hume’s election reference to “Chinese spies” and Jacinta Nampijinpa Price’s comments about Indian migrants.
And here we come back to the question of timing.
Does Taylor understand contemporary Australia – a country in which almost one in three residents were born overseas? The same question arises with indications the Liberals will oppose any changes to the capital gains tax on property. This might work: opposing tax rises often does. But at this particular time in Australia, is standing against any measure with a chance of bringing down house prices a good idea? Or is this one of those fights you have to learn not to pick?
The final issue of timing is the most crucial.
It is likely the Coalition will get some poll boost from its new leadership. Some caution should be exercised here. As commentator Bernard Keane has pointed out, some of this will be the return of men who were unable to stomach a woman as leader. This leads into a crucial issue. There is a distinction between a section of the Coalition’s base returning and poll numbers that reflect a genuinely viable party of government.
This clash was illustrated by Sunday’s news that Charlotte Mortlock, founder and director of an organisation to promote women in the Liberal Party, had left both the organisation and the party. Is it still possible both to appeal to the party’s base and reach a wider group of voters? To win back both the voters who have left it for One Nation and voters who have left it for the teals? This is the problem Taylor’s ascent does not solve, at least not automatically. What if Howard’s “broad church” simply makes no sense any more?
It is a big ask for Angus Taylor: to surprise us all, showing qualities as leader we have not yet glimpsed. But can the Liberal Party surprise us too, at this precarious moment in its history? That is an even bigger question.

Isolated in a new country with her dying husband, Lidia didn’t want anyone to know
The Polish-born professor, physicist and air-quality expert, 73, was named one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2021 by Time magazine.
Each week, Benjamin Law asks public figures to discuss the subjects we’re told to keep private by getting them to roll a die. The numbers they land on are the topics they’re given. This week, he talks to Polish-born professor, physicist and air-quality expert Lidia Morawska. The 73-year-old was named one of the 100 Most Influential People of 2021 by Time magazine.
DEATH
Two weeks before you left Poland for Canada in the 1980s, you received news that your husband, Jan, had cancer. He eventually went into remission but, later, as you were leaving Canada for Australia in the 1990s, the cancer returned – and Jan passed away just over a year after arriving in Brisbane. Your children were 15 and 10. How did you navigate such a devastating loss? It definitely was very difficult. When we arrived in Brisbane [to take up a position at Queensland University of Technology], it was also a new country: new schools, new system, new position. But when you have a challenge, you deal with the challenge.
How old was Jan when he died? He was 39. He would have been 40 in November, the month after he died.
So young. And how old were you? He was a month younger than me.
Did anything help? All of our family was in Poland, so I was, in a way, completely alone. To be honest, I didn’t want anyone to know. If people know that you have a very big personal problem, you are treated a bit differently. Did I want to be treated differently? I didn’t. So it was only really in the last week, when it was very clear that it was the end and I couldn’t come to work, that I talked to the people at QUT. It was a very welcoming group of colleagues, so I felt immediately like I was among friends.
You’ve achieved so much: winning the David Sinclair Award [for excellence in aerosol science]; being listed as one of the Most Influential People in the world by Time magazine; winning a Prime Minister’s Prize for Science last year. Can you die happy? I don’t know. I certainly don’t have the feeling that I achieved everything that can be achieved in my area. We’re still in a not much different situation now than we were at the beginning of the pandemic in relation to indoor air quality. So this is the purpose now: to influence change.
SEX
Many scientific disciplines have been, historically, male-dominated. What was it like for you, as a woman, rising through the ranks in physics? I must say that for quite some time – maybe even until we were in Canada – I never thought about any issues around being a woman. I think the reason for this was that both my parents were educated. My mum had a degree in chemistry; my father had a degree in electrical engineering. There was that feeling that I could achieve whatever I wanted. But, in Canada, a mother of one of my daughter’s friends asked me, “Oh, how come you chose such a non-feminine topic?” I remember so vividly thinking, “What a silly question!”
What were the big social differences you noticed between Poland, Canada and Australia when it came to sex, relationships and romance? I don’t know whether these were topics of my conversations – maybe because when I left Poland, I already had family. At the same time, Poland is a very Catholic country, which is, of course, different to Canada and Australia. But still, there was a very liberal approach. I didn’t notice any major differences.
What do you find interesting and sexy about science? How do we make STEM disciplines appealing to young people? Well, everyone’s different and certain people are better at certain things. For example, as much as I love music or I love art, I cannot play instruments. It was very clear, at a young age, that I can listen, but I can’t make music. If we were all good at the same things, I guess the world would be very boring! But the other aspect is about making all these choices available to kids at a young age. And I had all those choices. It’s not about making things sexy: it’s about making them available.
POLITICS
You want to mandate good indoor air quality in Australia. To do that, though, you need to work with policy-makers. How are you finding the task? The biggest problem is that there is not just one government body responsible for this. If we are talking about outdoor air, it’s very clear: there’s one body in every state. But in relation to indoor air quality, there are residential buildings and public buildings. Mandating quality in residential buildings is pretty much impossible. And each type of public building belongs to a different government portfolio. So starting this conversation is very difficult.
What’s been your experience of engaging with politicians? It’s extremely frustrating. It’s obvious that this is a very basic thing we need and it isn’t being done. But it’s not simply the fault of politicians who don’t listen: it’s a much more complex problem. If people don’t realise there are problems with air quality or pollution, they don’t put pressure on politicians to effect change.
‘It’s extremely frustrating. It’s obvious that this is a very basic thing we need and it isn’t being done.’Professor Lidia Morawska
Does winning a Prime Minister’s Prize for Science help? I hope so!
What do you think constitutes good leadership? You have to have a vision. On the other hand, a good leader must also listen and not assume that what they think is the right direction is how something must be done. In particular, listen to those who have opposing views. Sometimes – as much as it might sound like complete nonsense – when you get to the bottom of what they’re saying, you start to see their point. And that point may require you to modify how you address things.
Many people look up to you, Lidia. Have you ever considered running for political office? Definitely not. Again, it’s about knowing what you are good at!

Gwenneth went to her local pub for a drink. Police found her body nine days later

Gwenneth went to her local pub for a drink. Police found her body nine days later
Malthouse Tavern was heaving when a bartender picked up the phone to call a taxi for a drunk woman at the bar.
The woman had been sitting at the Balga pub for most of the afternoon drinking and chatting to other patrons, but as midnight approached it was clear she’d had a bit too much.
It was the night before the WA Football League’s grand final, the crowd was restless and scattered, and a fight had broken out in the nearby car park as a barman ushered the woman out the front door.
She tottered into the car park with two beer bottles in a brown paper bag clutched in her hands to wait for her lift.
Police have never been able to say for certain if she got into a taxi that night. But they can say Gwenneth Graham’s body turned up nine days later.
50 years with no answers
The murder of Gwen Graham has remained unsolved for more than 50 years, and currently sits with WA Police’s cold case unit.
The case involved canvassing 4000 people, checking hundreds of cars and interviewing dozens of people of interest, but no one has ever been charged over the 46-year-old’s murder.
There are hopes a new $1 million reward could be the missing piece that finally helps detectives solve her death.
“Police continue to believe that someone in the community knows what happened, and it is time for that information to be shared,” a WA police spokesperson said.
“Her death was a devastating act of violence, and those responsible have never been held to account.”
A funny, quick and modern woman
Graham had two children before she was murdered.
She had been married a total of three times, and her eldest son, Steven, was from a relationship with motorcycle mechanic Bill.
“She was loving,” said Steven Wrightson, now 77 years old.
“She made me feel really loved.”
Wrightson has memories of sitting around with his mother while his father was at work, listening to their radio to pass the time.
He remembers her as warm, funny and charming – but also much more than a mother.
Records indicate when Graham – then named Gwen Murray — lied about her age to join the Australian Army in an administrative role.
She was also always on the move. She lived in Perth’s inner and outer suburbs, and even resided in the regional town of Geraldton for some time.
Wrightson, who strongly resembles his mother, said he was just six years old when his parents broke up, and he was forced to mainly stay in touch with her through letters and the occasional run-in on the streets of Perth.
He recalls visiting her in her new home in Balga for lunch at her state housing home.
“She had a nice little place,” Steven said.
“She kept a nice, very, very clean house, and she was a good cook.
“That was the last time I saw her until I found out about what happened.”
Bush in the city
Back in 1974, Balga was a patchwork of state housing, campsites, swamp, dirt tracks and bushland.
Children roamed freely, and wild horses and dogs would come and go as they pleased. The local pub was a central meeting point, as was the Balga Bazaar. One local remembered Balga as a typical pit stop for people moving in from the outback to the city.
“The street we lived in – we knew the neighbours on both sides, and we knew the people up the street. I was always outside running around looking for something to shoot with my brother,” he told this masthead.
“We played cricket, had running races, and all sorts out on the streets … it was a very new area, and it was just being established.
“It was all bush and dirt. But, paradise for a kid.”
Another remembered the sense of safety the suburb had for local kids.
“Back in the 70s, everyone knew everyone. I knew everyone on my street … I felt very safe there and I loved it. We were surrounded by bush.”
New to the neighbourhood
Graham was relatively new to the area in September 1974, and was living on Felpham Avenue in Balga with her husband Tom, where the couple had plans to buy the state housing property they lived in.
Tom worked at a nearby confectionary store making marshmallows and chocolate. He was Graham’s third marriage at the age of 46.
By today’s standards, the couple would have been considered as being in an open relationship, and Graham would often go to bars, sometimes disappearing for weeks at a time.
Tom – who was 10 years her senior – seemed unbothered by the arrangement.
On the night of her murder, the couple went their separate ways. Tom, to the nearby John Barleycorn Hotel in Nollamara, and Graham to the Malthouse Tavern in Balga.
Tom later told the papers the couple had gone to different venues because Graham had previously been “warned off” from returning to the Nollamara pub, for reasons unknown.
“Instead, she went to the newly-opened Malthouse Tavern where she was not well known,” he told local media at the time.
Tom was not surprised to come home to an empty house on the evening of September 27.
All he found was a note pinned to the door: “Don’t lock me out. Just wait as usual – Blondie”.
Tom said he didn’t call his wife Blondie, and noticed later on the writing on the note had deteriorated as it went on, perhaps indicating she had already had a bit to drink by the time she left the house.
He would later find out that “Blondie” was a nickname Graham had been given by her former husband, Steven’s father Bill, years prior – a private joke between them, given her hair was actually reddish brown.
Tom wasn’t concerned.
“She had been in the habit of going off drinking and had done it several times previously,” Tom would later tell the now-defunct Daily News.
“Plenty of times she had cleared off.”
It wasn’t until four days later he lodged a missing person’s report with the local police.
“My worry had built up,” he said at the time.
Gwen’s last night
For five days after Tom made his report, his home was quiet. Graham didn’t come home, and didn’t make any attempt to make contact. Bar staff remembered walking her to the door at the tavern but couldn’t remember whether they had seen her get into a taxi or accept another lift. By all accounts, she had disappeared into the evening.
In fact, the only sign Graham had even left the pub was found on the side of the road, about a 10-minute walk away from the tavern.
An unnamed Aboriginal woman had been walking on Redcliffe Avenue on the morning of October 2, about a week after Gwen left the pub.
She would later tell police she was walking near bushland when she found a pair of shoes discarded on the side of the road, and picked them up. Locals said they’d been lying there for about a week before the woman collected them.
She decided to bring them to a friend as a gift, and walked on.
If she had looked further, police said she would have also come across some discarded women’s underclothes and a white handbag thrown haphazardly into the shrub.
And just a few hundred metres away, she would have found a woman’s body concealed under an abandoned old refrigerator.

The banks’ fight over $285b in ‘free money’ has a lesson for savers

Opinion
The banks’ fight over $285b in ‘free money’ has a lesson for savers
When the Reserve Bank raised interest rates this month, most of the media’s gaze was on how the hike would sting people with mortgages. There’s been relatively little said about savers – probably because our hefty levels of household debt leave many people exposed to even fairly small rate rises.
This suits banks nicely. If the humble savings account gets far less scrutiny from politicians and the press than home loans, that makes it easier for banks to get away with tricky pricing.
Lately, however, financial markets have been paying plenty of attention to the $1.7 trillion market for people’s deposits, where there’s a growing fight between banks.
This battle for deposits is important for bank customers and shareholders alike. It has the potential to help people get a better return on their money, while for the big banks, serious profits are at stake.
A crucial reason big banks can make so much money is their easy access to deposits – a low-cost and stable form of funding, much of which comes from households. Banks benefit from the fact that deposits worth up to $250,000 are guaranteed by taxpayers. If banks can access this money more cheaply, it’s a big advantage to their shareholders, and if a bank can hold your money without paying any interest on it, even better for them.
As a result, it’s long been the case that most banks will come up with all sorts of ways to attract enough deposit money so they’re well funded, but also not pay out too generously. Typically, it means offering “bonus” or “reward” accounts that pay a decent rate of interest, but only if you jump through a bunch of complex hoops, such as growing your balance every month, or not making withdrawals.
While these sorts of rules obviously help the bank make more money, they mean that many customers get dudded out of a decent rate of interest on their money.
A 2023 report from the competition watchdog found more than two-thirds of “bonus” interest accounts didn’t receive any bonus interest at all. And if you don’t qualify for “bonus” interest, the “base” rate that you do get paid is typically miserly. Canstar said on Friday that the base rates on “bonus” savers for the big four ranged between 0.01 per cent and 0.25 per cent.
Why is this relevant today? Well, lately, deposit pricing has been on the agenda for a couple of reasons.
First, when official interest rates change, banks often use it as an opportunity to quietly “re-price” their own rates (changing their interest rates by a different amount to the RBA, in a way that suits the bank’s bottom line). Re-pricing mortgages risks a political backlash, but it’s easier for banks to do it on savings accounts.
Second, there’s been much discussion in financial markets about the rise of Macquarie Group, which is trying to disrupt the deposit market, as it has done in home loans.
Macquarie has sought to lure customers by avoiding the complex terms and conditions on savings accounts, and offering an interest rate that’s competitive, without the need to make deposits or a minimum number of transactions.
It’s grabbed a lot of business, doubling its market share from 3.1 to 6.3 per cent since 2020. Like “challenger” brands often do, it’s also taking shots at the bigger incumbents, saying the big four are sitting on about $285 billion in bank deposits that pay zero interest – what Barrenjoey analyst Jonathan Mott calls “free money”. (Macquarie has $5 billion in zero interest deposits from its business customers.)
When interest rates are rising, that “free money” becomes even more valuable to a bank because it still costs the bank nothing, but now it can lend that money out at a higher rate.
Macquarie is clearly doing this for its commercial own goals – it is known as the Millionaires’ Factory for a reason. But all the same, it is difficult to argue with more competition in a concentrated sector such as banking.
As Reserve Bank officials told a parliamentary hearing this month, there’s often less competitive pressure in the deposit market than in home loans, where mortgage brokers have educated much of the borrowing public that they need to regularly shop around for a decent rate.
RBA governor Michele Bullock told the hearing that compared with mortgages, it takes the public longer to think about switching for a better deal on their deposit account.
Bullock reminded customers of an age-old lesson in banking and finance: inertia is the enemy of a good deal. “It comes back to that people are always encouraged to look around for the best deal in mortgages, so look around for the best deal on deposit rates as well. Don’t just sit there. But people sometimes are a bit prone to inertia,” she said.
For the wider banking industry, on the other hand, Macquarie’s attempt to pinch their low-cost deposits is another competitive threat, and it comes just after Macquarie’s home loan onslaught.
For some analysts, such as Jarden’s Matthew Wilson, the disruptive threat of Macquarie’s deposit push is a major long-term threat to bank profits. Wilson, who has a “buy” rating on Macquarie, sees the complex terms and conditions that banks put on deposit accounts as an “unnecessary source of disgruntlement” for customers, and he sees the major banks’ deposit pricing tactics as leaving them open to disruption.
So far, however, recent results suggest Macquarie’s aggressive push for deposits isn’t having a huge impact on the big four banks. Commonwealth Bank last week said it had expanded its already dominant position in its latest half, including winning more deposits that pay no interest.
But over the longer term, Macquarie’s rapid expansion into mortgages has proven it can shake up the retail banking oligopoly. Whether the Millionaires’ Factory can keep on grabbing customers from the big four (and from other banks) looks set to remain one of the most intriguing battles in the local banking industry for years to come.
For customers, the fight brewing over deposits is good news, but as Bullock reminded people, it also requires customers to look around for a good deal. It will be interesting to see how many people follow her advice.

Looming shift in US Navy strategy bodes well for Australia’s subs

Looming shift in US Navy strategy bodes well for Australia’s subs
Washington: The United States Navy is preparing for a significant shift in its plans that could reduce its reliance on Virginia-class attack submarines, potentially making it easier for Australia to acquire the vessels as planned under the AUKUS agreement.
There are also signs the lagging rate of US submarine production is improving, with one shipyard boasting of a 14 per cent jump in productivity and saying the Virginia-class boats had a “very good year”.
The navy has recently advertised its plans for a “hedge strategy” that moves away from reliance on large and expensive aircraft strike carrier groups towards more flexible and adaptable fleets. The shift responds to what Chief of Naval Operations Daryl Caudle called “fiscal, industrial and operational realities”.
A January briefing paper by the Congressional Research Service cited a recent report in Jane’s Navy International, a specialist military publication, which revealed the navy was contemplating cutting its target number of attack submarines from its long-time goal of 66 to 54 – only slightly more than it has now.
The Jane’s report was based on draft plans for the so-called Golden Fleet, the navy’s next fleet iteration, that were seen by the author and under consideration by navy leadership.
If confirmed, the change would be significant because it would reduce the US Navy’s reliance on the Virginia-class subs, making it more likely that it can “spare” some for Australia. Under AUKUS, Canberra is due to purchase three to five boats, starting in 2032.
Bryan Clark, director of the Centre for Defence Concepts and Technology at the Hudson Institute, who has worked directly with the navy on its force level planning, confirmed it was heading in that direction.
He said the navy wanted to build a new generation of large-diameter submarines, as well as new unmanned vessels, making it unrealistic to keep growing the fleet of Virginias.
“I think the impact of the AUKUS subs on the US submarine inventory is decreasing over time,” Clark told this masthead. “Their long-term need for Virginia [subs] is going down a little bit. They’re seeing these uncrewed systems as a way of addressing what they need, so they don’t require a submarine any more.”
Clark said it was too early to be certain if the navy would actually reduce its target for the Virginia-class boats. “But I think internally they are starting to lock it down.”
The Pentagon directed inquiries to the navy, which didn’t respond to questions before deadline.
Since US President Donald Trump confirmed the AUKUS agreement was “full steam ahead” in October, the major roadblocks to the first stage of Pillar I remain the capacity of the US industrial base to produce enough of the submarines, and the US’s need for them.
Under AUKUS legislation, the US president of the day must be satisfied that the transfer of any submarine to Australia “will not degrade the United States’ undersea capabilities”.
The official production rate given by the navy last April was 1.13 vessels a year, but it needs to be at least 2.0. Caudle told his confirmation hearing that the rate needed to double for the US to fulfil its AUKUS commitments to Australia, and at the Apex Defence Forum in Washington last month, he noted that the US defence industrial base “continues to lag well below demand”.
However, there are limited signs that production is improving. The Virginia-class vessels are built by two US companies: General Dynamics Electric Boat (GDEB) and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) – the only two shipyards capable of building nuclear-powered submarines.
On an earnings call earlier this month, HII reported a 14 per cent increase in throughput – or productivity – on the Virginia-class boats in 2025.
“There’s an incremental walk-up in throughput required to get to the two Virginia-class per year. But they had a very good year last year,” the company’s president, Chris Kastner, said on the call.
The navy has also reported a slight improvement in progress on its first Columbia-class submarine. Head of strategic submarines Todd Weeks told the West 2026 conference that the vessel was tracking for delivery in 2028 instead of 2029.
The aforementioned Congressional Research Service report garnered attention in Australia for presenting an alternative option to AUKUS, whereby instead of selling submarines to Australia, the US Navy could operate up to eight of the vessels from Australian ports. However, that idea is not new, and has been part of the report in every update since June 2024.
Caudle called AUKUS “one of the most consequential defence partnerships of our lifetime” when he addressed the Naval Submarine League in San Diego last week.
“It’s not just about boats. It’s about shared deterrence, interoperability at the deepest levels, and a long-term commitment to peace through strength in the Indo-Pacific,” he said.
“It also sends an unmistakable message – our undersea advantage is collective, united and formidable, and we intend to keep it that way.”

First GreenWay, now ‘MetroWay’: Sydney’s next cycling route revealed
Residents in Sydney’s south-west will be able to walk, run or cycle along a 13.8-kilometre shared path linking Sydenham and Bankstown under plans to install the track alongside the final stage of the M1 metro rail line.
The project, dubbed the “MetroWay”, will follow the rail corridor and intersect with the six-kilometre GreenWay bike and pedestrian path at Dulwich Hill, connecting users to the route between the Cooks River and Iron Cove.
Transport Minister John Graham said the MetroWay would provide a “city-shaping active transport link” between Marrickville’s pubs and cafés, and the restaurants of Campsie and Bankstown, via Canterbury and Lakemba.
“Combining the MetroWay with the GreenWay will completely unlock the south-west and the inner west for runners, walkers and cyclists,” Graham said.
Commuters in the city’s south-western suburbs have endured lengthy disruptions to the final stage of the M1 metro rail project between Sydenham and Bankstown, which is due to open in the second half of this year.
The shared path will include trees, public art, rest stops, lights and signs. It will link to more than 350 bike spaces at rail stations in the south-west, which the government hopes will spur more people to leave their car at home.
Residents face a long wait for the project, as tenders open this week. A contract is expected to be awarded later this year, and early works should begin soon after. The government has declined to give an estimated cost or completion date for the project.
Graham said the path would connect stations along the M1 metro rail line with existing and planned bike networks and that it would be designed for people of all ages and riding abilities.
“This mega-project is about so much more than building a metro — it’s about housing uplift, new public spaces and ways of getting active,” Graham said.
The final sections of the $57 million GreenWay cycling and pedestrian route opened in December, connecting popular exercise routes along the Cooks River in Earlwood, and the Bay Run loop at Iron Cove.
Summer Hill MP Jo Haylen said the MetroWay would provide “a safe continuous pathway from Bankstown right through to the Iron Cove, connecting to the Greenway and the Bay Run”.
“This is about giving locals real options to walk, ride, and stay active, making our neighbourhoods better connected and easier to get around,” she said.
The final stage of the M1 metro line was due to be opened in late 2025 after a 12-month shutdown of the old heavy rail line. It was later delayed until the second half of this year.
Graham declined to give a target opening date for the project last month, prompting the NSW opposition to push for an explanation as to when services would start.
About 80 per cent of work to convert the existing heavy rail line between Sydenham and Bankstown to metro train standards has been completed, and high-speed testing has ramped up.
A metro train last month travelled the entire length of the 66-kilometre M1 line from Tallawong to Bankstown via the city, stopping at all 31 stations. The train reached speeds of 100km/h on the final section between Sydenham and Bankstown. Six trains are currently being used for testing along the route.

Board of Peace members pledge over $5B for Gaza reconstruction, humanitarian aid: Trump

US President Donald Trump said Board of Peace member states will announce at an upcoming meeting on Thursday a pledge of more than $5 billion for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.
In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump wrote that member states have also committed thousands of personnel toward a UN-authorised stabilisation force and local police in the Palestinian enclave.
The US president said Thursday's gathering, the first official meeting of the group, will take place at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, which the State Department recently renamed after the president. Delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend.
The board's creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of the Trump administration's plan to end the Israeli war on Gaza.
Israel and Hamas agreed to the plan last year, with a ceasefire officially taking effect in October, although Tel Aviv has repeatedly violated it.
According to Gaza's Health Ministry, more than 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the territory since the ceasefire began.
While regional Middle East powers including Türkiye, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel—as well as emerging nations such as Indonesia— have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western US allies have been more cautious.

After Bnei Brak riots, IDF chief Zamir slams police for failing to protect soldiers

IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir spoke with two female soldiers who were attacked earlier Sunday during a military mission in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak, expressing support and demanding accountability for those responsible.
“I asked to speak with you to tell you that the IDF and I stand fully and clearly behind you,” Zamir told the soldiers, according to a statement from the military. “No one may harm your dignity or interfere with the important mission you are carrying out.”
The military said Zamir assured the soldiers they have his full backing and that of the entire defense establishment. “We will investigate the incident to ensure it does not happen again,” he said. “A reality in which IDF soldiers cannot move freely within the State of Israel is intolerable and must be addressed. We will not accept harm to our soldiers, and I expect those who attacked you to be brought to justice.”
Earlier, during the unrest, Zamir issued a sharply worded condemnation, calling the attack on the soldiers “a serious crossing of a red line” and urging firm action against those involved.
The disturbances erupted after word spread among residents that the soldiers had arrived to distribute draft notices. The IDF said the two were in the city as part of a welfare visit related to their military duties.
During the unrest, three police officers were injured. Police used stun grenades to disperse the crowd and deployed a helicopter to the area. In one incident captured on video, a man pushing a baby stroller was seen near officers as stun grenades were thrown, shouting at them to stop.
Tel Aviv District Police Commander Haim Sargarof criticized the lack of coordination with the military. “The army must coordinate entry into the city with us,” he said at the scene. “When they enter without coordinating with us, we are left to respond.”
He said police are reviewing camera footage to identify those involved. “We have reached the person who set the motorcycle on fire. We need to carry out the arrests and restore quiet for residents who need to know there will be zero tolerance for disorder,” he said.

US boards oil tanker in Indian Ocean after tracking from Caribbean
Pentagon says Veronica III attempted to 'defy' Trump quarantine
ISTANBUL
US forces boarded sanctioned oil tanker Veronica III overnight in the Asia-Pacific region, the Defense Department said on Sunday.
"Overnight, US forces conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding of the Veronica III without incident in the INDOPACOM area of responsibility," the department said on the US social media company X.
The vessel "tried to defy President (Donald) Trump's quarantine -- hoping to slip away," according to the statement. "We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
The Pentagon said it "will deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain."
The boarding marks the latest in a series of such operations by US forces. It had previously boarded a crude oil tanker named Aquila II in the same area of responsibility.
The Veronica III is listed on the US Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals sanctions list for engaging in "illegal transportation" of sanctioned Iranian oil on behalf of the National Iranian Oil Company and China Concord Petroleum Company, according to OpenSanctions data.
The Panama-flagged tanker, built in 2006 and previously named Symphonic, Veronica and White Nova, is affiliated with Shanghai Future Ship Management Co Ltd, which Washington sanctioned in December 2024 for activities in Iran's oil sector.

Russia blasts 'fake' claims that opposition figure Navalny died by poisoning
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova says West tries to divert attention from its own problems
MOSCOW
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called "fake" a statement by five European nations claiming opposition figure Alexey Navalny died after being poisoned with a dart frog toxin.
Speaking in an interview with multiple Russian outlets, Zakharova said the Western countries are trying to divert attention from their internal problems.
"There will be test results, there will be formulas of the substances -- then there will be a comment," she said. "Without this, all statements and talk are a fake aimed at diverting attention from the pressing problems of the West."
The spokeswoman pointed out that the news appeared "at the moment when it would be necessary to present the results of the investigation into Nord Stream pipeline explosion.
The 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines was an unprecedented attack that caused extensive damage to the infrastructure connecting Russia and Germany beneath the Baltic Sea.
Serhii Kuznietsov, a former Ukrainian army officer accused of being involved in the sabotage, was arrested in Italy. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied any involvement.
On Saturday, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France released a joint statement, alleging Navalny was poisoned using epibatidine, a poison extracted from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog.
The conclusion was made based on an analysis of samples of Navalny's biological materials, according to the statement.
Moscow announced Navalny’s death in a Siberia prison in February 2024 while he was serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism.

Syrian army takes over al-Shaddadi base after US withdrawal
The move, in coordination with the US, is the latest implementation of the ceasefire agreement with Kurdish-led forces.
The Syrian army has taken over a military base in the northeast of the country following the withdrawal of United States troops, as part of a ceasefire deal with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Syria’s Ministry of Defence announced on Sunday that “forces of the Syrian Arab Army have taken over the al-Shaddadi military base in the Hasakah countryside following coordination with the American side”.

The US had been operating in al-Shadaddi since 2016, when the Kurdish-led forces seized it from ISIL (ISIS).
The US military and the SDF partnered in the fight against ISIL, but after the toppling of Syria’s longtime ruler, Bashar al-Assad, in 2024, Washington has backed interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa in his bid to impose control over the entire country.
The US helped broker the deal between al-Sharaa’s government and the SDF in January, after a dispute over the integration of the Kurdish-led forces into the Syrian army erupted into armed clashes.
Under the deal, the Syrian army also took control of the US base of al-Tanf, near the border with Iraq and Jordan, on Thursday.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that the implementation of the ceasefire agreement was “headed in a positive direction”.
“There’s been some days that have been very concerning, but we like the trajectory,” he said. “We have to keep it on that trajectory. We’ve got good agreements in place. The key now is implementation, and we’ll be very involved in that regard.”
He noted that similar agreements needed to be reached with the Druze, Bedouin and Alawite communities in the country.
“We think that outcome, as difficult as it’s been, is far better than the Syria that would have been broken up into eight pieces, with all kinds of fighting going on, all kinds of mass migration, so we feel very positive about that.”
Al Jazeera’s Heidi Pett, reporting from Aleppo, said that residents near al-Shaddadi had spoken of hearing “explosions and seeing fires at the base as Americans destroy remaining material, because they’ve been preparing to leave there for a number of weeks”.
The takeover of al-Shaddadi was “part of a broader change in US strategy in the region moving towards partnering directly with the Syrian government,” she said.
The US has been reducing its military footprint in Syria for months, going from 1,500 personnel in July to about 900 currently.
It has been consolidating its ground presence to Tower 22 in Jordan, although it continues to carry out air strikes on ISIL targets in Syria, with US Central Command (CENTCOM) announcing it had conducted 10 air strikes on 30 targets during the February 3-12 period, and killed or captured more than 50 people in two months.
Al Jazeera’s Pett said that over the past year, there have been joint US-Syria operations as well as intelligence sharing between the two countries.
Most notably, “a few months ago, Syria formally joined the international coalition against ISIL”, she said.
Despite the pullout from al-Shaddadi, “the US has signalled it’s not vacating the field entirely”, she said, pointing to the CENTCOM announcement on continued strikes on ISIL sites in Syria.
“What they’re saying is, while we’re physically pulling out of these bases, they will maintain a presence in the skies above Syria,” Pett said.

Powered by women, ‘Wuthering Heights’ digs up $34.8 million at the box office for a No. 1 debut
Powered by women, ‘Wuthering Heights’ digs up $34.8 million at the box office for a No. 1 debut
Emerald Fennell’s bold reimagining of “Wuthering Heights” brought crowds of women to movie theaters this weekend. The Warner Bros. release topped the box office charts and nabbed the title for the year’s biggest opening with $34.8 million in ticket sales in its first three days in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. According to PostTrak polling, an estimated 76% of those ticket buyers were women. By the end of Monday’s Presidents Day holiday, the total could rise to $40 million from its 3,682 locations.
The romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the star-crossed Catherine and Heathcliff, won out over the weekend’s other newcomers, including the animated “GOAT” and the heist thriller “Crime 101.” Its biggest day was Saturday’s Valentine’s Day holiday, where it earned $14 million. “Wuthering Heights” is also performing even better internationally, where it’s expecting to rake in an additional $42 million from 76 territories.
The Warner Bros./MRC production cost a reported $80 million to produce, not accounting for the millions spent on marketing and promotion. If the four-day totals match the estimates, that makes for a strong $82 million global debut. And the film still has several big openings on the horizon, in Japan and Vietnam on Feb. 27, and in China on March 13.
The success comes while the future of Warner Bros. hangs in the balance, as Paramount continues to sweeten its hostile takeover bid in hopes of winning out over Netflix. “Wuthering Heights” is the studio’s ninth No. 1 opening in a row.
Fennell’s version of “Wuthering Heights,” which takes many liberties with Emily Brontë’s novel, largely divided critics. It’s currently sitting at a mixed 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. While that didn’t dissuade audiences from buying tickets, only 51% of the opening weekend audience said that they would “definitely recommend” the film to friends. Moviegoers also gave it a less-than-stellar B CinemaScore.
The mid-February weekend has hosted big superhero movies on occasion, including “Black Panther” and “Deadpool,” but a more relevant comparison is “Fifty Shades of Grey” and its two sequels. The first movie opened to over $85 million, the third to $38.6 million.
“This was a solid if not record-breaking Presidents Day/Valentines weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, who heads marketplace trends for Comscore. “But that was to be expected without an MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) film.”
“GOAT,” an animated Sony release produced by basketball star Stephen Curry, landed in second place with an estimated $26 million from 3,863 locations. It’s projected to bring in another $6 million on Monday, which would bring its four day total to $32 million — the biggest animated debut since “Elemental” in 2023. It also pulled in $15.6 million internationally, bringing its global total to $47.6 million.
The family-friendly film was the only new opener of the weekend to get an A CinemaScore. Sony Pictures Animation was also behind “KPop Demon Hunters.”
In third place, “Crime 101” made an estimated $15.1 million in its first three days. Amazon MGM Studios opened the Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo led Los Angeles-set thriller in 3,161 theaters. It’s expected to pull in about $17.8 million by the end of Monday, but the movie has a long way to go to even hit its production budget, which reportedly exceeded $90 million. Audiences, who were 56% men, also gave “Crime 101” a B CinemaScore.
“Send Help” and “Solo Mio” rounded out the top five with $9 million and $6.4 million, respectively. Further down the charts, at No. 7, was Briarcliff Entertainment’s sci-fi comedy “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” starring Sam Rockwell and Haley Lu Richardson. It made an estimated $3.6 million from 1,610 locations.
The Walt Disney Studios also celebrated a milestone this weekend, becoming the first studio to cross $1 billion at the global box office in 2026, driven almost entirely by “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” but also helped by the continued success of “Zootopia 2,” which remains in the top 10 after twelve weekends in theaters.
The weekend is down significantly from the same weekend last year, when “Captain America: Brave New World” opened, but the pace is starting to pick up and theaters have “Scream 7” and “Project Hail Mary” on the horizon.
“It’s been a rather slow first quarter,” Dergarabedian said. “But this could ignite a spark at the box office.”
Top 10 movies by domestic box office
With final domestic figures being released Tuesday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:
1. “Wuthering Heights,” $34.8 million.
2. “GOAT,” $26 million.
3. “Crime 101,” $15.1 million.
4. “Send Help,” $9 million.
5. “Solo Mio,” $6.4 million.
6. “Zootopia 2,” $3.8 million.
7. “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” $3.6 million.
8. “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” $3.3 million.
9. “Iron Lung,” $3.1 million.
10. “Dracula,” $3 million.

Should people with autism and very high needs have a separate diagnosis? Takeaways from AP’s report

Should people with autism and very high needs have a separate diagnosis? Takeaways from AP’s report
As the definition of autism has widened, there’s been a growing push to create a new diagnosis, called profound autism, for those who need constant and lifelong care.
The reason? To ensure that they get the support and services they need.
Judith Ursitti, president of the Profound Autism Alliance, said people in this category now lack appropriate treatments, support and enough providers trained to handle their level of care. And the vast majority of clinical research doesn’t include them.
“If you don’t have research, you won’t have treatments. You won’t have achievable services and supports,” said Ursitti, whose adult son has profound autism. “There are people across the spectrum who have high support needs that are intermittent. The difference with our population is they’re constant.”
Autism rates have been rising for decades, and two of the main reasons for the increase have, in a strange twist, taken some of the focus off of helping people with round-the-clock needs. The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder is now very broad, including many people with low support needs. Also, better awareness of the condition has helped many more children get diagnosed than in the past — and most of those cases are relatively mild.
At the same time, the Trump Administration is promoting unproven and debunked claims about what causes autism, which experts say muddles efforts to understand the condition and fuels misinformation that threatens public health, even as officials funnel more money into research.
Overall in the U.S., an estimated 1 in 31 children has autism spectrum disorder.
Researchers estimate around a quarter have “profound autism,” a term introduced in 2021 by a group of experts, the Lancet Commission. It describes people who need constant care for life, have a certain level of intellectual disability and are nonverbal or minimally verbal.
In the past, these people may have been diagnosed with autistic disorder – one of five subtypes, along with Asperger’s, of a diagnosis called pervasive developmental disorders. But in 2013, the American Psychiatric Association removed that diagnosis and created autism spectrum disorder.
Some in the autism community worry that creating a separate diagnosis of profound autism would reduce attention on the broader spectrum and the individual needs of everyone on it.
Dena Gassner, an autistic senior research scientist at Drexel University and mother of an autistic adult with moderate support needs, said she struggles with the idea of assigning someone the label of profound autism. She said it could be stigmatizing.
She said there’s nothing wrong with being autistic; the problem lies in “the massive lack of supports and services” in our society. “We need to come together in a unified voice to talk about services for the entirety of the spectrum.”
Andy Shih, chief science officer for Autism Speaks, said no matter where people fall on the debate about profound autism, “there’s absolutely no doubt that we need to elevate awareness about the needs of this group.”

Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control

Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
Israel will begin contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in Israel gaining control over wide swaths of the area for future development, according to a government decision on Sunday.
It paves the way for the resumption of “settlement of land title” processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Mideast War in 1967. It means that when Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership.
The Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now said the process likely amounts to a “mega land grab” from Palestinians.
“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Peace Now’s Settlement Watch program. Area C refers to the 60% of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas’ office in a statement called the decision “a grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law,” which amounts to “de facto annexation.” It called on the international community, especially the U.N. Security Council and the United States, to intervene immediately.
Israeli steps in recent months
The decision is the latest step to deepen Israeli control over the West Bank. In recent months, Israel has greatly expanded construction in Jewish settlements, legalized outposts and made significant bureaucratic changes to its policies in the territory to strengthen its hold and weaken the Palestinian Authority.
Israel’s Foreign Ministry said Palestinian Authority civil planning maps show that the authority has been advancing land registration procedures in Area C for years in violation of agreements that give Israel civil and military control over the area. It said Sunday’s decision was made for greater transparency.
The decision was first announced last May but required further development before it was approved in this week’s Cabinet meeting. Under the decision, Israeli authorities will announce certain areas to undergo registration, which will force anyone who has a claim to the land to prove their ownership.
Ofran said the process for proving ownership can be “draconian” and is rarely transparent, meaning any land that undergoes the registration process in areas currently owned by Palestinians is likely to revert to Israeli state control.
“Palestinians will be sent to prove ownership in a way that they will never be able to do,” Ofran told The Associated Press. “And this way Israel might take over 83% of the Area C, which is about half of the West Bank.”
The registration process could start as soon as this year, she said.
The proposal had been put forward by some of Israel’s far-right members of the ruling coalition, including the Minister of Justice Yariv Levin. “The government of Israel is committed to strengthening its grip on all its parts, and this decision is an expression of that commitment,” he said.
A ‘dangerous escalation’
Jordan’s Foreign Ministry in a statement called on the international community to “assume its legal and moral responsibilities, and to compel Israel, the occupying power, to stop its dangerous escalation.”
Qatar’s foreign ministry said it considered Israel’s decision “an extension of its illegal plans to deprive the Palestinian people of their rights.”
Previous U.S. administrations have sharply condemned an expansion of Israeli activity and control in the West Bank, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a particularly close relationship with President Donald Trump. The two met last week in Washington, their seventh meeting in the past year.
And yet Trump has opposed annexation, Ofran noted.
Palestinians are not permitted to sell land privately to Israelis, though measures announced last week aim to nullify this. Currently, settlers can buy homes on land controlled by Israel’s government. Last week’s decision also aimed to expand Israeli enforcement of several aspects of in the West Bank, including environmental and archaeological matters in Palestinian-administered areas.
More than 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 from Jordan and sought by the Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Over 300,000 Palestinians are estimated to live in Area C of the West Bank, with many more in surrounding communities dependent on its agricultural and grazing lands, including plots for which families retain land deeds or tax records dating back decades.

Europeans push back at US over claim they face ‘civilizational erasure’
Europeans push back at US over claim they face ‘civilizational erasure’
MUNICH (AP) — A top European Union official on Sunday rejected the notion that Europe faces “civilizational erasure,” pushing back at criticism of the continent by the Trump administration.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas addressed the Munich Security Conference a day after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered a somewhat reassuring message to European allies. He struck a less aggressive tone than Vice President JD Vance did in lecturing them at the same gathering last year but maintained a firm tone on Washington’s intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its policy priorities.
Kallas alluded to criticism in the U.S. national security strategy released in December, which asserted that economic stagnation in Europe “is eclipsed by the real and more stark prospect of civilizational erasure.” It suggested that Europe is being enfeebled by its immigration policies, declining birth rates, “censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition” and a “loss of national identities and self-confidence.”
“Contrary to what some may say, woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure,” Kallas told the conference. “In fact, people still want to join our club and not just fellow Europeans,” she added, saying she was told when visiting Canada last year that many people there have an interest in joining the EU.
Kallas rejected what she called “European-bashing.”
“We are, you know, pushing humanity forward, trying to defend human rights and all this, which is actually bringing also prosperity for people. So that’s why it’s very hard for me to believe these accusations.”
In his conference speech, Rubio said that an end to the trans-Atlantic era “is neither our goal nor our wish,” adding that “our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
He made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on issues such as migration, trade and climate. And European officials who addressed the gathering made clear that they in turn will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday that Europe must defend “the vibrant, free and diverse societies that we represent, showing that people who look different to each other can live peacefully together, that this isn’t against the tenor of our times.”
“Rather, it is what makes us strong,” he said.
Kallas said Rubio’s speech sent an important message that America and Europe are and will remain intertwined.
“It is also clear that we don’t see eye to eye on all the issues and this will remain the case as well, but I think we can work from there,” she said.

Iran’s top diplomat to attend ‘indirect’ talks with US in Geneva, state-run IRNA news agency says

Iran’s top diplomat to attend ‘indirect’ talks with US in Geneva, state-run IRNA news agency says
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran’s top diplomat was traveling Sunday from Tehran to Geneva, where the second round of nuclear negotiations with the U.S. will take place, Iranian state media reported.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation left for the Swiss city after the first round of indirect talks took place in Oman last week. Oman will mediate the talks in Geneva, the IRNA state-run news agency reported on its Telegram channel.
Similar talks last year broke down after Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran, that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump has also threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests.
Gulf Arab countries have warned that any attack could spiral into another regional conflict.
The Trump administration has maintained that Iran can have no uranium enrichment under any detail, which Tehran says it will not agree to.
Iran continues to insist that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but officials however have increasingly threatened to pursue a nuclear weapon. Before the war in June, Iran has been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, just a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels.
Araghchi is also expected to meet with his Swiss and Omani counterparts, as well as the director general of the U.N.’s atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Earlier on Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington remains interested in a diplomatic solution to ending its differences with Tehran, and that President Trump’s envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were currently traveling for the new round of talks.
Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
Rubio said recent military deployments in the Middle East were a protective measure aimed at shoring up the defenses of U.S. facilities and interests. Iran has threatened to attack U.S. bases in the region if Washington decides to strike. Tehran in June attacked the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, though no American or Qatari personnel were harmed.
“No one’s been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we’re gonna try,” said Rubio at a news conference after meeting with Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava. “We are focused on negotiations.” Trump in recent weeks has suggested that his priority is for Iran to scale back its nuclear program, while Iran has said it wants talks to solely focus on the nuclear program. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who earlier this week met with Trump in Washington, has been pressing for a deal that would neutralize Iran’s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
The Israeli prime minister said in a speech Sunday that any deal between the U.S. and Iran must make sure that “all enriched material has to leave Iran.”
It remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump’s policy on Iran. Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, but then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear program. ___ Associated Press writers Kareem Chehayeb in Beirut and Areej Hazboun in Jerusalem contributed to this report.

Trump’s border czar says ‘small’ security force will remain in Minnesota after enforcement drawdown
Trump’s border czar says ‘small’ security force will remain in Minnesota after enforcement drawdown
WASHINGTON (AP) — White House border czar Tom Homan said Sunday that more than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota’s Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge.
A “small” security force will stay for a short period to protect remaining immigration agents and will respond “when our agents are out and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control,” Homan told CBS’ “Face the Nation.” He did not define “small.”
He also said agents will keep investigating fraud allegations as well as the anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church service.
“We already removed well over 1,000 people, and as of Monday, Tuesday, we’ll remove several hundred more,” Homan said. “We’ll get back to the original footprint.”
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s “Operation Metro Surge.” The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and proved successful. But the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile and two U.S. citizens were killed.
Protests became common. A network of residents worked to help immigrants, warn of approaching agents or film immigration officers’ actions. The shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through this week.
Homan said enforcement would not stop in the Twin Cities and that mass deportations will continue across the country. Officers leaving Minnesota will report back to their stations or be assigned elsewhere.
When asked if future deployments could match the scale of the Twin Cities operation, Homan said “it depends on the situation.”

A storm system sweeps across the Southeast triggering tornado watches and damaging winds
A storm system sweeps across the Southeast triggering tornado watches and damaging winds
ATLANTA (AP) — A weekend storm system sweeping across the Southeast brought tornado warnings to Mississippi and Louisiana, and then took aim at parts of Georgia and Florida, as people in the Northeast were finally getting a reprieve from weeks of bitterly cold temperatures.
Some of the fiercest weather in the South was reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana, where high winds from a thunderstorm overturned a horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float, damaged an airport jet bridge and flung the metal awning from a house into power lines. The damage was documented by National Weather Service employees who surveyed the area.
Power poles were snapped and toppled near the Louisiana towns of Jena, Cheneyville and Donaldsonville, the weather service reported.
No deaths or serious injuries were reported, but the damage reports came as the storm system continued into parts of south Georgia and the Florida Panhandle, which were under tornado watches on Sunday.
The storms led to some power outages across southern states, but nowhere near the massive number of outages caused by ice storms late last month in northern Mississippi and Nashville, Tennessee. By Sunday evening, a few thousand customers were still without electricity in Florida, Louisiana, Kentucky and Virginia, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.
Meanwhile, the Northeast was beginning to thaw after a weekslong stretch of uncommonly cold weather.
Boston was running nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius) below average for February last week, and the city was on pace for its coldest winter in more than a decade. Boston remained cold on Sunday, but this week’s forecast called for temperatures climbing into the high 30s and low 40s, which is closer to the seasonal average.
On the West Coast, much of California braced for a powerful winter storm that was expected to bring drenching thunderstorms, damaging winds and heavy snow in mountain areas. Jacob Spender, a weather service meteorologist in Sacramento, urged people to take precautions in the coming days.
“So if they are traveling, packing winter safety kits. Anything to be prepared. This is a bigger system, and a major system,” Spender said.
Rain that began Sunday in the San Francisco Bay Area was forecast to intensify throughout the day and overnight, bringing the risk of flooding. Forecasters said the Sierra Nevada, including ski resorts around Lake Tahoe, could see up to seven feet (two meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday.
To the south, Los Angeles area residents in some neighborhoods scarred by last year’s devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she’s ordered emergency crews and city departments to prepare to respond to any problems.

What to know about the investigation into Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance and the search for clues
What to know about the investigation into Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance and the search for clues
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Law enforcement agents have been gathering more potential evidence as the search for “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie ‘s mother heads into its third week.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Here’s what to know about her disappearance and the intense search to find her:
Video of masked man
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. It described him as a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build. The agency said he was carrying a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.
Investigators initially said there was no surveillance video available since Guthrie didn’t have an active subscription to the doorbell camera company. But digital forensics experts kept working to find images in back-end software that might have been lost, corrupted or inaccessible.
Studying DNA
Investigators collected DNA from Guthrie’s property which doesn’t belong to Guthrie or those in close contact with her, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said. Investigators are working to identify who it belongs to.
Evidence requiring forensic analysis is being sent to the same out-of-state lab that has been used since the beginning of the case, the department said.
Investigators found several gloves, the nearest about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home, and submitted them for lab analysis, the sheriff’s department said. It did not specify what type of gloves.
The sheriff stressed his department is working closely with the FBI.
Sorting through tips
The Pima County sheriff and the FBI announced phone numbers and a website to offer tips. Several hundred detectives and agents have been assigned to the case, the sheriff’s department said.
The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since Feb. 1, the day Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
The sheriff’s department has not said whether any tips have advanced the investigation.
Intensive searches
Late Friday night, law enforcement sealed off a road about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home as part of their investigation. A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock.
The investigators also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a nearby Culver’s restaurant parking lot late Friday.
The sheriff’s department said Saturday the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but no arrests were made.
On Tuesday, sheriff deputies detained a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson. Authorities didn’t say what led them to stop the man but confirmed he was released.
The same day, deputies and FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search in Rio Rico, about an hour’s drive south of the city.
Family pleas
Savannah Guthrie, her sister and her brother have shared on social media multiple video messages to their mother’s purported captor.
The family’s Instagram videos have shifted in tone from impassioned pleas to whoever may have their mom, saying they want to talk and are even willing to pay a ransom, to bleaker and more desperate requests for the public’s help.
The latest video on Thursday was simply a home video of their mother and a promise to “never give up on her.”
A quiet neighborhood
Nancy Guthrie lived alone in the upscale Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where houses are spaced far apart and set back from the street by long driveways, gates and dense desert vegetation.
Savannah Guthrie grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and once worked at a television station in the city, where her parents settled in the 1970s. She joined “Today” in 2011.
In a video, she described her mother as a “loving woman of goodness and light.”

Trump says Board of Peace will unveil $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting
Trump says Board of Peace will unveil $5 billion in Gaza reconstruction pledges at inaugural meeting
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — President Donald Trump said Sunday that members of his newly created Board of Peace have pledged $5 billion toward rebuilding war-ravaged Gaza and will commit thousands of personnel to international stabilization and police forces for the territory.
The pledges will be formally announced when board members gather in Washington on Thursday for their first meeting, he said.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honor to serve as its Chairman,” Trump said in a social media posting announcing the pledges.
He did not detail which member nations were making the pledges for reconstruction or would contribute personnel to the stabilization force. But Indonesia’s military said Sunday that up to 8,000 of its troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission. It’s the first firm commitment that the Republican president has received.
Rebuilding the Palestinian territory will be a daunting endeavor. The United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimate that reconstruction of the territory will cost $70 billion. Few places in the Gaza Strip were left unscathed by more than two years of Israeli bombardment.
The ceasefire deal calls for an armed international stabilization force to keep security and ensure the disarming of the militant Hamas group, a key demand of Israel. Thus far, few countries have expressed interest in taking part in the proposed force.
The Oct. 10 U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal attempted to halt a more than 2-year war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones.
It is not clear how many of the more than 20 members of the Board of Peace will attend the first meeting. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who held White House talks with Trump last week, is not expected to be there.
Trump’s new board was first seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. But it has taken shape with his ambition for a far broader mandate of resolving global crises and appears to be the latest U.S. effort to sidestep the United Nations as Trump aims to reset the post-World War II international order.
Many of America’s top allies in Europe and elsewhere have declined to join what they suspect may be an attempt to rival the Security Council.
Trump also confirmed that Thursday’s meeting will take place at the U.S. Institute of Peace, which the State Department announced in December it was remaining the Donald J. Trump U.S. Institute of Peace.
The building is the subject of litigation brought by former employees and executives of the nonprofit think tank after the Republican administration seized the facility last year and fired almost all the institute’s staff.

Gaza’s Nasser Hospital condemns MSF decision to suspend most services
Gaza’s Nasser Hospital condemns MSF decision to suspend most services
CAIRO (AP) — One of Gaza ’s last functioning large hospitals condemned the decision by Doctors Without Borders to pull out of operations over concerns about armed men, claiming on Sunday that the facility had installed civilian police for security.
The rare public friction between two well-known health care providers in Gaza came as the Palestinian death toll since the current ceasefire surpassed 600. At least 11 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire in the last 24 hours, hospitals said.
Doctors Without Borders, also known by its acronym MSF, said in a statement Saturday that all its noncritical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to security breaches that posed “serious” threats to its teams and patients. MSF said there had been an increase in patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the compound since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire was reached.
Nasser Hospital said Sunday the increase in armed men was due to a civilian police presence aimed at protecting patients and staff and said MSF’s “allegations are factually incorrect, irresponsible and pose a serious risk to a protected civilian medical facility.”
One of Gaza’s few functioning hospitals
Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated daily at Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages as part of the current ceasefire deal.
MSF said its teams had reported “a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons.” The suspension occurred in January but was only recently announced.
Nasser Hospital staff say that in recent months it has been repeatedly attacked by masked, armed men and militias, which is why the presence of an armed civilian police force is crucial.
Hamas remains the dominant force in areas of Gaza not under Israeli control, including the area where Nasser Hospital is located. But other armed groups have mushroomed as a result of the war, including groups backed by Israel’s army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip.
Israel’s military said it had intelligence that Nasser Hospital is being used as a headquarters and military post for senior Hamas officials, without providing evidence. It called MSF’s move “an important decision, but one that comes too late.”
Throughout the war, which began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has repeatedly struck hospitals, including Nasser, accusing the militant group of operating in or around them. Hamas security men often have been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas.
Some hostages released from Gaza have said they spent time during captivity in a hospital, including Nasser Hospital.
11 Palestinians killed in strikes across Gaza
At least 11 Palestinians were killed Sunday by Israeli fire in Gaza, hospital authorities said.
The dead include five men in their 20s who were killed in the eastern part of Khan Younis, according to Nasser Hospital, which received the bodies. The strike hit a group of people close to the Yellow Line that separates Israeli-controlled areas from the rest of Gaza, it said.
Rami Shaqra said his son, al-Baraa, was among the militants securing the area from potential attacks by Israeli forces or Israeli-backed armed groups when they were hit. He said they were killed by an airstrike.
“They were in the area they say is safe,” Shaqra said.
Associated Press footage from the morgue showed at least two of the men had headbands denoting membership in the Qassam Brigades, the militant arm of Hamas.
In northern Gaza, a drone strike hit a group of people in the Falluja area of Jabaliya refugee camp, killing five people, according to Shifa Hospital. A separate drone strike killed a man in Gaza City, according to the hospital.
Israel’s military said it had carried out multiple strikes in response to several ceasefire violations near the Yellow Line, including militants attempting to hide in debris and others who attempted to cross the line while armed.
The U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal that took effect Oct. 10 attempted to halt more than two years of war between Israel and Hamas. While the heaviest fighting has subsided, the ceasefire has seen almost daily Israeli fire.
Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones, killing 602 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. It does not give a breakdown of civilians and militants.
Militants have carried out shooting attacks on troops, and Israel says its strikes are in response to that and other violations. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed.
Two Israeli soldiers attacked by ultra-Orthodox Jews
In Israel, two female Israeli soldiers were rescued from riots in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak. Footage shows two soldiers being hurried away by police from thousands of ultra-Orthodox men running after them and yelling.
Many in Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community are furious over laws that may force them to serve in the Israeli military, holding frequent protests.
Israeli police said the soldiers were performing a welfare visit but had not coordinated it with police. At least 22 people were arrested as protesters set police motorcycles on fire, attacked officers, threw trash and overturned a police car, police said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu strongly condemned the attack on the soldiers but blamed an “extremist minority” for the violence.
Roughly 1.3 million ultra-Orthodox Jews make up about 13% of Israel’s population and oppose enlistment because they believe studying full time in religious seminaries is their most important duty. The broad exemptions from mandatory military service have reopened a deep divide in the country and infuriated much of the general public, especially during the war in Gaza.

Hunting for the flaming pearl was among their favorite pursuits, nine was their lucky number and the entire universe was their home. These are just a few of the many facts visitors learned at the Musée du Quai Branly-Jacques-Chirac in Paris about the dragon, as it has traversed the Chinese imagination for five millennia. Do not imagine it as evil and fire-breathing, as it is often depicted in the West. Instead, it is an embodiment of vital energy, as evidenced by the sumptuous objects on loan from Taiwan for the "Dragons" exhibition. The dragon's many avatars take many forms, from vases to headdresses, tripod cauldrons and inkstones.
It first appears emerging from the egg during the Neolithic era, in jade ornaments unearthed in the tombs of high-ranking individuals. It does not yet have its majestic appearance: more like a "dragon-pig," it emerges with a snout and small ears on one of the very first objects depicting it, which dates to around 3,000 BCE.

Netanyahu says US deal with Iran must dismantle nuclear infrastructure
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
JERUSALEM - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Feb 15 he told US President Donald Trump last week that any US deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process.
Speaking at the annual Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organisations, Mr Netanyahu also said Israel still needs to "complete the job" of destroying all tunnels in Gaza. Israel, he said, has already dismantled 150km of an estimated 500km.
A second round of talks between the US and Iran
Mr Netanyahu said he is sceptical of a deal but it must include enriched material leaving Iran.
“There shall be no enrichment capability - not stopping the enrichment process, but dismantling the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said.
Iran and the US renewed negotiations earlier in February to tackle their decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme and avert a new military confrontation.
The US has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks do not succeed, US officials have told Reuters.
Mr Netanyahu also said that he aimed to end US military aid to Israel within the next 10 years, after the current 10-year deal of receiving US$3.8 billion (S$4.8 billion) a year - which is largely spent in the United States on equipment - ends in 2028.
Due to a thriving economy, "we can afford to phase out the financial component of the military aid that we're receiving, and I propose a 10-year draw down to zero.
Now, in the three years that remain in the present memorandum of understanding and another seven years draw it down to zero," Mr Netanyahu said.
"We want to move with the United States from aid to partnership," he said. REUTERS

Lawmakers accuse Pam Bondi of ‘purposefully mudding’ list of names associated with Epstein in new DOJ letter

Lawmakers accuse Pam Bondi of ‘purposefully mudding’ list of names associated with Epstein in new DOJ letter
In a six-page letter to members of Congress, the DOJ said it has released ‘all’ documents related to the required disclosures and listed a series of high-profile names – including those of Marilyn Monroe and Janis Joplin
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Lawmakers who pushed the Department of Justice to release the Epstein files are dissatisfied with its latest disclosure of high-profile names mentioned in the three million documents, believing the DOJ is being purposefully vague to protect those with close ties to Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell.
Saturday evening, the DOJ sent a six-page letter to Congress, including the names of celebrities, politicians, businesspeople and more who were mentioned at least once in the files. But the extensive list failed to explain how the people are connected to the pedophile financier and his fellow offender.
Names ranged from President Donald Trump, who was once friends with Epstein but ceased communication before his 2008 Florida conviction, to apparently unrelated figures whose names happen to have been mentioned, like Marilyn Monroe, the Hollywood star who died when Epstein was nine years old, and the singer Janis Joplin, who died in 1970.
“The DOJ is once again purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email,” Rep. Ro Khanna, one of the lawmakers leading the effort, said on X.
“To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files is absurd,” Khanna added.
Khanna called on the DOJ to “stop protecting predators” and release all the files with only the names of survivors redacted.
The Independent has asked the Justice Department for comment.
The letter, which was required per the Epstein Files Transparency Act, was sent to members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department had “released ‘all records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Department’ that relate to’ Epstein,” signaling it would be the final release.
It listed names of “politically exposed persons” named at least once. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche noted that the lawmakers never defined what that means.
As a result, names such as Elvis Presley, Janis Joplin, Cher, Beyonce and other notable celebrities are listed because they are mentioned in emails. But that does not mean the individuals had any connection with, or even knew, Epstein.
Current lawmakers, who may have been mentioned in the DOJ’s press briefings or FBI daily news emails, are also mentioned.
“So one loser sends another loser a NEWS ARTICLE with my name in it and the cover up clan at the DOJ wants to put me in the same drawer as Donald Trump,” Rep. Eric Swalwell wrote on X.
Other lawmakers joined the call for more disclosures, despite the DOJ signalling that the recent three-million-document dump is the final release of the Epstein files.
Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who has also helped lead the effort for transparency on Epstein, said that the Justice Department is “missing names” on the list. She also promised to push for more disclosures.
“I want to be abundantly clear about the DOJ memo released tonight: Citing ‘Work Product Privilege’ will NOT save the DOJ from releasing all the Epstein files,” Mace wrote.
“If they can give the names, then they can give them in unredacted files. The list is an admission that they can remove those redactions,” she added.
“Not buying this at all and Americans shouldn’t either. I went to the ‘unredacted’ files yesterday and HUNDREDS of pages are still completely blacked out,” Rep. Laura Friedman said on X.
Although more than three million documents have been released, officials initially indicated six million files could be released. Some documents are being withheld because they meet the criteria laid out by Congress in the act – such as protecting the medical privacy of victims, containing images or descriptions of child sexual abuse, being involved in an ongoing prosecution, or other reasoning.
Members of Congress, such as Khanna and his co-sponsor on the Epstein files push, Rep. Thomas Massie, have viewed the unredacted version of the files at the DOJ. They’ve accused Bondi and other officials of purposefully redacting the names of powerful individuals to protect them from prosecution.
No person mentioned on the list has been charged with a crime associated with Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes, other than the two themselves. Being named in the Epstein files does not mean a person participated in, or even knew of, Epstein and Maxwell’s crimes.
Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial in a New York jail in 2019, while Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking offenses.

Board of Peace members to allocate $5 bln to restore Gaza — US president

WASHINGTON, February 15. /TASS/. The Board of Peace member countries, who will gather for their first meeting in Washington on February 19, will announce the allocation of more than $5 billion to restore the Gaza Strip, US President Donald Trump said.
"On February 19th, 2026, I will again be joined by Board of Peace Members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where will announce that Member States have pledged more than $5 billion dollars toward the Gaza Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts, and have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans," he wrote on his Truth Social platform.
On January 22, representatives of 19 countries signed the charter establishing the Board of Peace for Gaza in a ceremony on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. According to US President Donald Trump, more countries have joined it. While the Board was established to govern the enclave, its mission is expected to extend to conflicts in other parts of the world as well.

Air raid alerts announced in Kyiv, several regions due to ballistic threat
Ukrinform
In Kyiv and several regions of Ukraine, air raid alerts were issued in connection with the threat of strikes by Russian forces using ballistic missiles.
The Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated this on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
"There is a ballistic threat from the north," the message said.
In a subsequent post, the Air Forces also warned of the threat of Russian forces using ballistic weapons from the temporarily occupied territory of Crimea.
At 19:44, the Air Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine announced the all-clear for the air raid alert.
As Ukrinform reported, this week the Russian army launched about 1,300 attack drones, over 1,200 guided aerial bombs, and 50 missiles at Ukraine, almost all of which were ballistic.

Trump claims ‘board of peace’ will give $5bn in aid to rebuild Gaza
Many Western countries, such as France and Norway, have said they will not join Trump’s initiative yet

Donald Trump has claimed that the “board of peace” has pledged more than $5bn (£3.67bn) towards rebuilding Gaza.
The US president’s board of peace was originally envisioned as a small group of world leaders to oversee the Gaza ceasefire plan, but the Trump administration has since suggested it could play a role as a global conflict mediator after inviting dozens of nations, including Ukraine and Russia to join.
In a post on Truth Social, the president said that member states would be meeting next week at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where they would announce the pledge of billions of dollars alongside thousands of personnel set to maintain security and peace in the war-torn strip.
Delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend.
“The Board of Peace has unlimited potential,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Last October, I released a Plan for the permanent end to the Conflict in Gaza, and our Vision was unanimously adopted by the United Nations Security Council. Shortly thereafter, we facilitated Humanitarian Aid at record speed, and secured the release of every living and deceased Hostage.
“Just last month, two dozen distinguished Founding Members joined me in Davos, Switzerland, to celebrate its official formation, and present a bold Vision for the Civilians in Gaza, and then, ultimately, far beyond Gaza — WORLD PEACE!”
Concerns have been raised by European nations over the unexpected invitation extended to Russian president Vladimir Putin, who has waged a brutal war in Ukraine since February 2022. There has also been anger among Arab states over the inclusion of Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, whose war in Gaza has led to the deaths of 72,000 Palestinians.
Concerns have also been raised about the role of former British prime minister Tony Blair, who is expected to sit on the “founding executive board” despite concerns raised about his involvement in the Iraq war.
Dozens of countries have so far committed to joining the board, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Hungary, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.
Trump continued: “On February 19th, 2026, I will again be joined by Board of Peace Members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where we will announce that Member States have pledged more than $5 BILLION DOLLARS toward the Gaza Humanitarian and Reconstruction efforts, and have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans,” he continued.
“Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarization. The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History, and it is my honor to serve as its Chairman,” he added, signing off with his full name in capital letters.
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire plan last year, with it officially taking effect in October, although both sides have accused each other repeatedly of violating the terms. More than 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the territory since the ceasefire began, according to Gaza's health ministry.
Israel has said four of its soldiers have been killed by Palestinian militants in the same period.

Gaza Civil Defense launches campaign to recover bodies from rubble
Civil defense teams begin efforts in Beit Lahia as officials estimate thousands remain missing under rubble of destroyed homes
GAZA CITY, Palestine
Palestinian civil defense crews in Gaza launched a campaign Sunday to recover the bodies of Palestinians killed during Israel’s genocidal war and still trapped under the rubble of their homes in northern Gaza.
The initiative, titled “Dignifying the Martyrs,” began in the town of Beit Lahia, where rescue teams started retrieving remains from the destroyed home of the Abu Nasr family. The house was hit in an Israeli airstrike on Oct. 29, 2024, when it was sheltering about 200 family members and displaced people.
According to official estimates in Gaza, around 9,500 Palestinians remain missing under the rubble, as rescue teams struggle to reach them amid widespread destruction and a lack of heavy equipment.
The campaign “marks the start of broader efforts to recover victims from multiple sites across northern Gaza,” said Mohammed Tamous, an officer with the civil defense, adding that the first phase focuses on homes believed to contain large numbers of bodies.
“We are standing today on the rubble of the Abu Nasr family home, and dozens of bodies are still inside,” Tamous said. “We hope to continue the campaign until all the martyrs are recovered from across the Gaza Strip.”
He said thousands remain buried under debris, while the civil defense lacks sufficient bulldozers and machinery to carry out large-scale recovery operations. One of the vehicles currently in use was provided by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), he added, calling on humanitarian organizations to supply additional equipment.
Aya Abu Nasr, a survivor of the strike, said her extended family had sought refuge in the five-story building as Israeli attacks intensified. About 200 people were inside when it was hit.
She told Anadolu that roughly 150 people were killed in the strike, with dozens more injured, while others remained trapped under the rubble.
Initial recovery attempts during Israeli bombardment were “limited and dangerous,” she said.
“Some bodies were retrieved, but those in the lower floors could not be reached,” Abu Nasr said. “More than a year later, the family is still waiting to recover the remains of those still buried to bury them properly.”
Holding up photos on her phone, she said her brother Mohammed is still missing, expressing hope that his body will be found.
Civil defense personnel have been operating in hazardous health conditions since the start of the Israeli war, with decomposing bodies in exposed areas and limited access to protective gear and biological testing tools.
The Israeli restrictions and blockade on the entry of essential medical supplies have further complicated their work, leaving rescue workers vulnerable to disease and infection during recovery operations.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said Sunday that 726 bodies have been recovered since the Oct. 10 ceasefire deal with Israel.
The ceasefire ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 601 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,600 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

UK’s wet weather expected to continue amid flood warnings and alerts

Anyone hoping for relief from the UK’s wet weather may be disappointed next week, with more flooding expected and patches of snow forecast.
The Environment Agency has issued 73 flood warnings, meaning flooding is expected, mainly in areas of the south-west of England and the Midlands. There are also 177 flood alerts – which indicate possible flooding – in place across England.
According to Natural Resources Wales, two flood alerts are in place in South Pembrokeshire and the Lower Severn catchment in Powys. The Met Office said blustery showers would spread across many areas overnight on Sunday, with chilly temperatures for many and frost in the north.
Monday will bring sunny spells and showers, with some heavy rainfall expected. There is a risk of hail and thunderstorms, as well as snow showers in the far north. It will be largely drier and brighter on Tuesday.
There will be the risk of some rain and snow in the south on Wednesday and Thursday but it will be mostly dry in the north, according to the Met Office. Although there are no weather warnings currently in place, the Met Office said it may have to issue them as conditions evolve later this week.
Provisional statistics published earlier this month by the Met Office show Northern Ireland experienced its wettest January in 149 years and second wettest on record.
Southern England recorded its sixth wettest January since the data series began in 1836. Parts of Devon, Cornwall and Worcestershire had rainfall for 40 consecutive days.
Since the beginning of this year, storms Goretti, Ingrid and Chandra have brought misery for people and businesses, with flooding in several regions including Devon and Somerset.
The wet weather is not expected to ease next weekend, with longer spells of rain predicted on Friday and over the weekend.
The Met Office said the weather was likely to be unsettled heading into the weekend but there would be some drier interludes between weather systems.

Renowned Shakespearean actor voices doubts over Oscar frontrunner Hamnet
- Sir Ian McKellen, a renowned Shakespearean actor and Academy member, has voiced his reservations about the film Hamnet, despite its significant Oscar buzz.
- McKellen stated he is “not very interested in trying to work out where Shakespeare’s imagination came from” and believes it did not solely originate from family life.
- He predicted the film would win several Oscars but described certain plot details, such as Jessie Buckley's supposed ignorance of plays, as “improbable”.
- The film, based on Maggie O'Farrell's novel, fictionalises how the death of Shakespeare's 11-year-old son might have inspired his famous play Hamlet.
- Hamnet has garnered eight Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, and has achieved box office success, grossing $74m globally.

20,000 patients needing urgent care blocked from leaving Gaza

20,000 Palestinians needing urgent medical care denied departure through Rafah crossing
Around 20,000 Palestinians require urgent medical evacuation from the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, yet only a few dozen have so far been permitted to leave through the partially reopened Rafah border crossing.
According to Gaza’s Ministry of Health, Israel’s limited and highly restricted operation of the crossing has resulted in only a small number of medical evacuations, leaving thousands of critically ill patients trapped inside the enclave.
The ministry warned that the scale of departures falls dramatically short of urgent medical needs.
Data released by Gaza’s Government Media Office shows that since the crossing reopened, just 488 people have passed through Rafah out of an expected 1,800 who were due to move in both directions - a compliance rate of roughly 27%.
The ministry said that despite the announcement of the crossing’s partial reopening on 2 February, the number of patients allowed to travel remains extremely low and wholly disproportionate to the accumulated medical demand.
It described the current measures as inadequate, failing to meet even the most basic humanitarian obligations towards the sick and wounded.
Officials added that those awaiting evacuation include patients with cancer, heart disease and kidney failure, as well as individuals suffering severe injuries that cannot be treated inside Gaza.
The ministry warned that continuing under the existing evacuation mechanism poses a direct threat to thousands of lives and further deepens the health and humanitarian crisis, urging the international community to fulfil its legal and moral responsibilities.
The statement also referenced what it described as “harsh and painful” testimonies from patients who were able to leave Gaza, many of whom reported being subjected to complex procedures and additional restrictions.
These conditions, the ministry said, compounded their psychological and physical suffering while they were already in extremely poor health.
Gaza’s Ministry of Health called for the permanent and regular opening of the Rafah crossing, which borders Egypt, to ensure unrestricted and timely movement for patients and the wounded.
It also demanded the immediate evacuation of critical cases and a significant increase in the number of travellers in line with the scale of medical need.
The ministry further appealed for urgent intervention by international and humanitarian organisations to guarantee patients’ right to treatment and travel - a right protected under international law - stressing that patients’ lives “are not mere numbers to be postponed”.
Since the crossing reopened, Israel has allowed travel only for a small number of pre-approved and heavily vetted individuals, while the pace of medical evacuations has fallen far short of the figures previously promised.
During the first week following the reopening of the crossing, between 2 and 5 February, only 135 Gaza-based residents, most of them patients and their companions, were able to leave the territory to seek treatment.
Movement has also occurred in the opposite direction, with dozens returning to Gaza during the same period. More recently, 41 Palestinians entered Gaza through Rafah this week, bringing the total number of returnees since reopening to 72.
Meanwhile, only about 250 people have left Gaza overall, according to the Government Media Office.
Multiple reports also indicate that Palestinians attempting to leave Gaza have been subjected to humiliating searches and lengthy interrogations by the Israeli military, which controls the Palestinian side of the Rafah crossing.
Rafah remains the sole entry and exit point for nearly all of Gaza’s more than two million residents. The crossing was kept closed by Israel for most of its genocidal war on Gaza since 7 October 2023.
Following reported pressure from the United States, Israel eventually permitted its partial reopening- a move long demanded by the United Nations and aid groups, and a central element of US President Donald Trump’s proposed "ceasefire" framework for Gaza.
Despite this, humanitarian conditions remain dire, with Israeli attacks continuing to claim Palestinian civilian lives.

Thomas Massie labels Trump’s presidency the ‘Epstein administration’ amid dispute over files

Thomas Massie labels Trump’s presidency the ‘Epstein administration’ amid dispute over files
Kentucky congressman has become Trump’s #1 foe in the GOP over Epstein discharge petition
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Rep. Thomas Massie branded Donald Trump’s presidency the “Epstein administration” on Sunday as he laid into the president and his deputy, Attorney General Pam Bondi, for what some members of Congress have described as an effort to stonewall the release of the Epstein files.
The Republican representative from Kentucky was one of two members of Congress, along with Rep. Ro Khanna, to lead a discharge petition last year aimed at forcing the Justice Department to publish the extent of its gathered evidence and information relating to Jeffrey Epstein. The measure passed after gaining widespread bipartisan support last year, and was begrudgingly signed into law by the president.
The congressman was asked about the president’s anger towards him during an interview Sunday with ABC’s Martha Raddatz on This Week, and responded by claiming that the Trump administration was still working to protect powerful men named in the files.
"Donald Trump told us that even though he had dinner with these people in New York City and West Palm Beach, that he would be transparent, but he's not. He's still in with the Epstein class. This is the Epstein administration,” said Massie. “There are billionaires that are friends with these people, and that’s what I’m up against in D.C.”
The Independent has contacted the White House for comment.
Massie became a personal foe of the president as a result of breaking with him on various policy issues, culminating with the Epstein files vote. Trump later vowed to bankroll a primary challenge against him.
On Sunday, Massie also reacted to the testimony of Bondi last week before the House Judiciary Committee, where he and several other lawmakers attempted to press the attorney general on redactions in the files and delays in their publication
The DOJ now says it has released all of its files pertaining to the investigation, but Massie and other members of Congress have complained that their access to the unredacted versions — which can only be viewed at DOJ headquarters under surveillance — is still being restricted in some ways.
“They took down some of the most significant documents, two of them involving Virginia Giuffre’s case,” Massie said on ABC. “We want to be able to look at all these files. They can't keep those documents down after they've already produced them."
The Department of Justice remains adamant that the evidence gathered as part of the agency’s 2019 investigation into Epstein did not turn out incriminating evidence against any powerful figures save for Epstein himself and his girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, who remains in a U.S. prison. The billionaire financier was found dead in his cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on child sex trafficking charges, with federal authorities labeling it a suicide.
Members of Congress who have viewed the unredacted versions say the files contain references to victims as young as nine years old. They’ve criticized the agency over redactions made in the public versions of the files.
“We didn’t want to see any redactions of the names of co-conspirators, accomplices, enablers, abusers, rapists, simply to spare them potential embarrassment, political sensitivity or disgrace of some kind,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat on the Judiciary committee, said last week.
“And yet nonetheless, the Epstein […] documents that were released are filled with redactions of names and information about people who clearly are not victims and may fall into that other category.”
Though no one else has been held criminally accountable for associations with Epstein or Maxwell, the fallout from relationships exposed in the files has already been enormous, with a global reach. In the U.K., controversy over former ambassador and Labour peer Peter Mandelson’s association with Epstein led to him resigning from the House of Lords while questions about his appointment have pressured Keir Starmer, the prime minister.
Trump, whose name appears “more than a million times” in the unredacted files according to Rep. Raskin, has not been accused of wrongdoing. But his friendship with Epstein and admission that Virginia Giuffre previously worked at Mar-a-Lago, where she met the sex trafficking pedophile Epstein, have caused massive headaches for the president.
The president has frequently called on Republican voters to drop their interest in the investigation, to little avail.

Trump's border czar says 'small' security force will remain in Minnesota after enforcement drawdown
More than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota’s Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge
- Bookmark
White House border czar Tom Homan said Sunday that more than 1,000 immigration agents have left Minnesota's Twin Cities area and hundreds more will depart in the days ahead as part of the Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge.
A “small” security force will stay for a short period to protect remaining immigration agents and will respond “when our agents are out and they get surrounded by agitators and things got out of control,” Homan told CBS's Face the Nation. He did not define “small.”
He also said agents will keep investigating fraud allegations as well as the anti-immigration enforcement protest that disrupted a service at a church service.
“We already removed well over 1,000 people, and as of Monday, Tuesday, we’ll remove several hundred more,” Homan said. “We’ll get back to the original footprint.”
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's “Operation Metro Surge.” The Department of Homeland Security said it was its largest immigration enforcement operation ever and proved successful. But the crackdown came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile and two U.S. citizens were killed.
Protests became common. A network of residents worked to help immigrants, warn of approaching agents or film immigration officers’ actions. The shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through this week.
Homan said enforcement would not stop in the Twin Cities and that mass deportations will continue across the country. Officers leaving Minnesota will report back to their stations or be assigned elsewhere.
When asked if future deployments could match the scale of the Twin Cities operation, Homan said “it depends on the situation.”

Peace with Israel 'not possible' under constant violations of Palestinian rights, says foreign minister
Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen calls for full ceasefire compliance before phase 2, urges global action against annexation, recognition of Palestine
MUNICH
Palestine's foreign minister on Sunday said peace with Israel is "not possible" while Palestinian rights continue to be violated, stressing international law must be upheld and unilateral measures halted.
Speaking to Anadolu on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen said "peace with Israel under conditions of constant violation of Palestinian rights is not possible."
She argued that unilateral Israeli actions in occupied territory, West Bank and East Jerusalem, such as illegal settlement expansions and legalizations, undermine prospects for a negotiated settlement.
"Everything that Israel is undertaking unilaterally in occupied territory should be considered null and void," she said, stressing annexation "is in violation of international law, and it is a crime that needs to be stopped."
Shaheen also addressed the Gaza ceasefire process, saying progress to the next stage depends on full implementation of initial commitments.
“We would like to go into phase two, but we need to ensure that phase one obligations are undertaken," she said. The first phase ended after an exchange of Israeli hostages with Palestinian prisoners, and the second includes reconstruction of the enclave Israel destroyed in two years of bombing.
"We still see that we don't have a complete ceasefire. We have a partial ceasefire. The humanitarian assistance is not getting in to the extent that is needed. The Rafah border crossing is partially opened," she added, noting that further measures are required for a smooth transition.
Calling for stronger international action, Shaheen pointed to existing legal and diplomatic frameworks.
“What we would like is for the world to stand up and say, 'Look, enough is enough. International law is very clear,'" she said, referring to international rulings and UN resolutions that deem settlements and occupation illegal.
Shaheen said recent attacks reinforce what she described as Israel being "for no peace,” arguing that if it genuinely sought peace, it would halt violations of international law and Palestinian rights. Instead, she said, Israel is continuing "annexationist colonialist measures" and seeking to "legalize criminality." She urged the international community to say "enough is enough" and uphold international law, including the ICJ ruling and UN Resolution 2334, which she said deem settlements and occupation illegal.
Asked about her call to Germany and Finland to join other European countries in recognizing Palestine, she said: "They will consider at the right time. The vision of recognition is there, but they need to be moving towards it according to their convenience. But to me, the matter is very clear. If you are a two-stater, if you believe in international law, if you want to comply with international law, you need to recognize, because there is no justification whatsoever for not recognizing."
On regional diplomacy, she described Türkiye as a significant actor in reconciliation efforts and humanitarian assistance.
"Türkiye is an important player," she said. "Its humanitarian assistance and development assistance in Palestine is extremely important and we expect that Türkiye, as a key player in the region, to continue this role towards peace."

Report: Trump tells Netanyahu he backs Israeli strike in Iran if talks fail

President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in December that he would support strikes on Iran’s ballistic missile program if negotiations between Washington and Tehran fail, CBS News reported, citing two sources familiar with the matter.
According to the report, the conversation took place during a meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of national security discussions.
CBS News further reported that in recent weeks, senior figures within the U.S. military and intelligence community have begun internal discussions about how Washington might assist in the event of renewed Israeli strikes on Iran.
The report said the deliberations have centered less on whether Israel would act and more on the nature of potential U.S. support. Options under consideration include providing aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft and seeking overflight permissions from countries along a possible route, according to U.S. officials cited by CBS.
It remains unclear which countries would grant such permission. Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have previously stated publicly that they would not allow their airspace to be used for strikes on Iran or for Iranian attacks on other countries.
The reported discussions come as the Trump administration continues diplomatic efforts with Tehran over its nuclear program.
Netanyahu, who has expressed skepticism about diplomacy with Iran, traveled to Washington last week for talks with Trump. He has said any agreement must address not only Iran’s nuclear activities but also its ballistic missile program and funding of regional proxy groups.
Iranian officials have indicated conditional willingness to curb certain levels of uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief, though no written agreement has been announced.
A second round of indirect talks between the United States and Iran is expected to take place Tuesday in Geneva. Iranian state media reported that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation were en route for the discussions.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that Trump prefers diplomacy and confirmed that envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are traveling for meetings related to the negotiations.
Speaking at the White House on Friday, Trump described the deployment of additional U.S. naval forces to the region as a precaution in case talks collapse, signaling that Washington is maintaining military readiness alongside diplomatic efforts.

‘People want to help’: Canadians rally round Tumbler Ridge after school shooting

When Jim Caruso heard the news of the school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, he knew immediately he needed to be there. He packed his bags and boarded a plane for the community 700 miles away. “I wanted to be here to bring some level of comfort,” he said. “I wanted to hug people, pray for them and, most importantly, to cry with them.”
On Tuesday, a shooter opened fire in the town’s secondary school, killing eight people, most of them young children. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Canada’s history and has left the country reeling.
But it has also elicited a wave of support for the British Columbia town from across Canada, in the form of civic resources, grief and trauma counsellors, therapy animals, food and donations. Hotels are fully booked, pushing new arrivals to towns more than a hour’s drive away.
Caruso, who retired four years ago, worked as a paramedic, pastor and police chaplain – a career at the nexus of grief, tragedy and compassion that he said made him suited to the moment.
“It’s hard but I’m wired for this. I spent my life with first responders. And so I know the police, firefighters, paramedics – they’re just wrecked. They’re destroyed,” he said. “But so are the people here in Tumbler Ridge. And how they’re cared for right now is so important.”
On Friday, police said the shooter had been, “for lack of a better term, hunting”. Armed with two guns, “they were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with”.
Investigators have identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar. Police said Van Rootselaar is a transgender woman.
The prime minister, Mark Carney, who travelled to Tumbler Ridge with other federal party leaders in a show of national unity, praised the heroism of first responders and the courage of students and teachers who had been trapped in the school as the shooter stalked the halls..
“Standing here together in your home, we wanted you to hear that Canadians are with you and we will always be with you,” Carney said. “Whatever portion of your sadness that Canadians can bear to help you ease your heavy load, we will gladly do so.”
Caruso said the grim details of the attack would add a layer to how counsellors and support workers would help victims and the broader community navigate the unpredictable and turbulent nature of grief.
“It’s not like there was a car accident. It’s not like it’s a terminal illness. This was murder. Someone did this in cold blood. And as a result, something innocent was stolen,” he said. “I’ve learned over the years that life will go on. But it will also take a piece of you.”
Caruso and his wife intend to spend the next months in town to help residents rebuild emotionally. “It’s hard to not to ask what if I had been here earlier, if we could have been here to bring compassion,” he said. “But there is hope. It might not feel like there is for the parents who lost their kids, or the victims that are gone. But there’s hope for those that remain. That’s what funerals are all about. It’s not for the person that’s gone. It’s for the people around you.”
Speaking at a vigil, Carney said Tumbler Ridge was defined by people who cared for each other. “You held each other – as you’re holding each other right now. This is grace. It’s what we do for each other; it’s what we receive from each other,” he said. “Open hearts when the world falls apart.”
That the tragedy occurred in a community of less than 2,500 people means first responders knew the victims and not a single person was untouched by loss. In a part of the province known as the Peace region, when the residents of Tumbler Ridge hurt, the pain is felt deeply nearby.
“I just wanted to be part of the solution and to do whatever I could to help people,” said Milo MacDonald, the city manager of nearby Fort St John, who had recently arrived in Tumbler Ridge with colleagues. “There’s an awful lot of people right now that want to help. They want to reduce suffering.”
Neighbouring communities are sending large-scale resources and small gestures that have an outsized impact. MacDonald said lifeguards and skating technicians had been sent down from his community to ensure places such as the community swimming pool and ice rink could remain open for children.
MacDonald, who worked as a police officer for 25 years, including relief stints in Tumbler Ridge, said he was devastated by the horror inflicted on a group of “genuinely good” people.
“I experienced tragedies as a police officer, but never anything close to this magnitude,” he said. “And I’ll admit it’s incredibly hard because my sons are a similar age. My hope is that these kinds of things make us focus on our humanity and our common ground. In moments like this you need a confirmation of humanity.”
While the droves of people arriving from outside the community have overwhelmed the town’s infrastructure, their presence is nonetheless welcomed by residents.
Lynn Way, 82, who has lived in the town for more than three decades, said: “When I lost my son not too long ago, I wanted to just shut the world out. I wanted to just die. He didn’t want a service but I had a get-together and people came from all over. People I didn’t even know. I knew then how much my son was loved. And they wanted to come and let me know. That’s what’s happening in this town right now.”
Way said there was a “heaviness” in the air when she stepped outside, but Tumbler Ridge was still a safe town. “You can still leave your door unlocked. That hasn’t changed. This town will get through it, but those poor people that lost their children and their loved ones, it’s going to take longer. That’s a fact of life. All we can do is just say: ‘Hey, if you need something, I’m here for you.’”
In recent days, a logo with mountain peaks and a red heart has appeared with the words Tumbler Ridge Strong, a nod to the collective resilience needed in the town and a confidence that it exists within each resident.
“What feels so hard right now is that none of this is real,” Way said. “It won’t be real until the first funeral. Then you see the grief you never thought possible. When you lose someone close to you, it takes a year before you can really live with it. And you do. But you don’t ever forget. Ever.”

US forces board second sanctioned oil tanker in Indian Ocean

WASHINGTON - US forces boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that violated President Donald Trump’s blockade of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean and fled the region, the Pentagon said on Feb 15.
The Panamanian-flagged Veronica III “tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down,” the Pentagon said on X.
The post included a video of US forces boarding a helicopter and then boarding the tanker ship.
The Pentagon intercepted the Aquila II
In December, Mr Trump ordered a “blockade” of sanctioned oil vessels heading to and from Venezuela. At least nine ships have been seized thus far.
But those ships seized in recent months make up only a tiny fraction of the total number of sanctioned “shadow fleet” vessels operating worldwide to evade sanctions, which a senior US Coast Guard officer said number up to 800.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on Jan 3 – the same day that US special forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid – carrying around 1.9 million barrels of oil, TankersTrackers.com said.
The ship is listed under US sanctions relating to Iran, according to the website of the US Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control.
“The Department of War will deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain,” the Pentagon said on X. AFP

Iran’s foreign minister heads for Geneva for 2nd round of indirect talks with US
Abbas Araghchi to attend Oman-mediated negotiations in Geneva, hold meetings with Swiss, Omani officials and UN nuke watchdog chief
ISTANBUL
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi left Tehran on Sunday for Geneva to participate in a second round of indirect nuclear talks with the US, the Foreign Ministry said.
Araghchi is heading a diplomatic and expert delegation to the Swiss city, where he is also scheduled to hold a series of consultations on the sidelines of the talks, the ministry said in a statement cited by the state-run Press TV.
The second round of negotiations between Iranian and American delegations is set for Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
According to the ministry, Araghchi will meet with his Swiss and Omani counterparts, Ignazio Cassis and Badr Albusaidi, as well as Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other international officials based in Switzerland.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on Feb. 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after US President Donald Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.

Indonesia says 8,000 troops ready for possible peacekeeping mission in Gaza by June
Indonesia's military said Sunday that up to 8,000 troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of a humanitarian and peace mission, the first firm commitment to a critical element of U. President Donald Trump’s post-war reconstruction plan.
The Indonesian National Armed Forces, known as TNI, has finalised its proposed troop structure and a timeline for their movement to Gaza, even as the government has yet to decide when the deployment will take place, army spokesperson Brig. Gen. Donny Pramono said.
"In principle, we are ready to be assigned anywhere," Pramono told The Associated Press, "Our troops are fully prepared and can be dispatched at short notice once the government gives formal approval."
Pramono said the military prepared a composite brigade of 8,000 personnel, based on decisions made during a Feb. 12 meeting for the mission.
Under the schedule, troops will undergo health checks and paperwork throughout February, followed by a force readiness review at the end of the month, Pramono said. He also revealed that about 1,000 personnel are expected to be ready to deploy as an advance team by April, followed with the rest by June.
Pramono said that being ready does not mean the troops will depart. The deployment still requires a political decision and depends on international mechanisms, he said.
Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said any Indonesian role in Gaza will be strictly humanitarian. Indonesia’s contribution would focus on civilian protection, medical services, reconstruction, and its troops would not take part in any combat operations or actions that could lead to direct confrontation with armed groups.
Indonesia would be the first country to formally commit troops to the security mission created under Trump’s 'Board of Peace' initiative for Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has held since 10 October following two years of devastating war.
Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim majority nation, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has long been a strong supporter of a two-state solution. It has been deeply involved in providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, including funding a hospital.
Indonesian officials have justified joining the Board of Peace by saying it was necessary to defend Palestinian interests from within, since Israel is included on the board but there is no Palestinian representation.
The Southeast Asian country has experience in peacekeeping operations as one of the top 10 contributors to United Nations missions, including in Lebanon.

Trump: 'Board of Peace' members pledge $5 billion for Gaza
February 15, 2026US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the member states of his so-called "Board of Peace" have pledged more than $5 billion (€4.2 billion) for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts in Gaza.
In a post on his Truth Social platform, the US president announced that he will formally unveil the pledges when the board meets in Washington on Thursday.
The event is expected to draw delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state.
Reconstruction of Gaza is expected to cost $70 billion, according to United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimates, after more than two years of war.
The US-brokered October 10 ceasefire calls for an armed international force to provide security and disarm Hamas, but few nations have expressed interest.
Trump wrote that the member states of the board have committed thousands of personnel to the UN-authorized international stabilization and police force in the Palestinian enclave, calling the board "the most consequential international body in history." He didn't name which countries were planning to contribute.
Indonesia's military, however, confirmed on Sunday it expects up to 8,000 troops to be ready by late June for a possible peace and humanitarian mission, the first concrete commitment to the proposed force.
Trump calls on Hamas to disarm
Trump is also urging Hamas to move ahead with full disarmament under his postwar plan for Gaza.
"Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization," he wrote in his Truth Social post.
Disarmament is an important part of the second phase of the US-mediated ceasefire plan that was agreed in October between Israel and Hamas. This plan aims to end the conflict that began after Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces will gradually withdraw from Gaza, and that Hamas will disarm. An international stabilization force will be deployed to ensure security.
Although Hamas has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority, it has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line.
Both parties accuse each other on a daily basis of ceasefire violations. According to Gaza's Health Ministry, Israeli troops have killed more than 590 Palestinians in the territory since the ceasefire began. During the same period, Israel reported that four of its soldiers were killed by Palestinian militants.

The Guardian view on Donald Trump and the climate crisis: the US is in reverse while China ploughs ahead | Editorial

Devastating wildfires, flooding and winter storms were among the 23 extreme weather and climate-related disasters in the US which cost more than a billion dollars last year – at an estimated total loss of $115bn. The last three years have shattered previous records for such events. Last Wednesday, scientists said that we are closer than ever to the point after which global heating cannot be stopped.
Just one day later, Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, announced the elimination of the Obama-era endangerment finding which underpins federal climate regulations. Scrapping it is just one part of Mr Trump’s assault on environmental controls and promotion of fossil fuels. But it may be his most consequential. Any fragment of hope may lie in the fact that a president who has called global heating a “hoax” framed this primarily as about deregulation – perhaps because the science is now so widely accepted even in the US.
The administration claimed, without evidence, that Americans would save $1.3tn. Never mind insurance or healthcare costs; a recent report found that US earnings would be 12% higher without the climate crisis. The Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehouse called the decision “corruption, plain and simple”. In 2024, Mr Trump reportedly urged 20 fossil fuel tycoons to stump up $1bn for his presidential campaign – while vowing to remove controls on the industry.
In the same week as this reckless and destructive US decision, it emerged that China had recorded its 21st month of flat or slightly falling carbon emissions. As Washington tears up environmental regulations, Beijing is extending carbon reporting requirements. China remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, though its per capita and cumulative historical emissions are still far behind those of the US. But clean energy drove more than 90% of its investment growth last year.
The Carbon Brief website, which published the emissions analysis, says the numbers suggest that the decline in China’s carbon intensity – emissions per unit of GDP – was below the target set in the last five-year plan, making it hard to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement. The shift in emissions may not prove enduring. There is fear that China’s focus may change; the next five-year plan, due in March, will be key. Some subsidies for renewable power have already been withdrawn. The installation of huge quantities of renewable energy infrastructure has been accompanied by a surge in constructing coal-fired power plants, though the hope is that these are intended primarily as a fallback.
There are other grave concerns, including evidence of the use of forced labour of Uyghur Muslims in solar-panel production in Xinjiang. China’s chokehold on critical minerals hampers the ability of others to develop their own technology. And while its cheap renewables technology has resulted in the cheapest electricity in history, it has also hit manufacturers in other countries.
No one can compensate for the grim reversal of belated US action on emissions. There is also a vacuum in climate diplomacy that China shows no signs of filling. But Beijing has a vested interest in encouraging others to cut emissions, even if some nations now want to challenge its “green mercantilism”. In contrast, US billionaires look forward to prospering at the cost of wallets and lives – not only at home, but around the world.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. A man in Odessa tried to cut off his hand with an angle grinder to evade forcible mobilization, the Ukrainian media outlet Strana reported.
According to it, the man suffered serious injuries and is currently in the hospital.
General mobilization was announced in Ukraine in February 2022 and has been extended several times since, with the authorities doing everything possible so that draft-age men cannot evade military service. Videos of forcible mobilization and clashes with draft officers are regularly surfacing on Ukrainian social networks. Draft-age men use every opportunity to evade being sent to frontlines, for which ends they buy disability certificates, enter universities or illegally flee the country, often risking their lives.

Iran FM heads to Geneva for second round of nuclear talks with US: ministry
Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi headed to Switzerland on Sunday for the second round of renewed nuclear talks with the United States later this week, his ministry said.
Araghchi "left Tehran for Geneva late on Sunday heading a diplomatic and technical delegation to conduct the second round of nuclear talks and hold a number of diplomatic consultations," the ministry said in a statement.
"Indirect Iran-US nuclear talks will be held on Tuesday with the mediation and good offices of Oman."
During his visit to Geneva, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials, the foreign ministry statement said.
Tehran and Washington restarted nuclear negotiations in Muscat on 6 February, months after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June that started a 12-day war.
The latest talks came with Washington having threatened Tehran with military action and deployed an aircraft carrier group to the region following Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.
On 6 February, Araghchi led the Iranian delegation in indirect nuclear talks with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner in Muscat.
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
It has represented US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
Iranian deputy foreign minister Hamid Ghanbari said Tehran was seeking a deal with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, particularly in sectors such as aviation, mining and oil and gas, the Fars news agency reported.
"For the agreement to be viable, it is essential that the United States also be able to benefit from it in areas with strong and rapid economic return potential," he was quoted as saying.

Hungary's opposition leader Magyar calls for privacy protection in latest campaign speech

Magyar has promised greater protection of personal privacy in his latest campaign speech after accusing Orbán's government of allegedly blackmailing him with a secretly recorded sex tape with his former partner in a Budapest apartment in 2024.
Hungary's main opposition leader Péter Magyar held a campaign event in Budapest on Sunday, calling on the government to respect people's privacy after what he described as blackmail and a honeytrap set up by the government to discredit him.
According to opinion polls, Magyar's Tisza Party is leading Viktor Orbán's ruling Fidesz party, ahead of the parliamentary elections on the 12th of April.
Orbán, a far-right conservative politician, has been governing Hungary since 2010 with an absolute majority.
Magyar said earlier this week that he was blackmailed by government figures with a sex tape showing him and his former partner, secretly recorded in a Budapest flat in 2024. So far, the video has not been released, but one picture showing a bedroom has spread online.
"If you want Viktor Orbán to spy in your bedroom, then feel free to vote for the ruling Fidesz party," said Magyar.
He added that Orbán's party is afraid of losing power and is ready to do disgusting things to discredit the Tisza opposition.
"If they can disclose my private life, they can do the same to others," asserted Magyar.
The opposition leader, whose Tisza party leads most national opinion polls, called on Orbán to participate in an electoral debate.
'Hungary will not be dragged into war'
Magyar appeared to target young voters with his campaign event on Saturday, which followed a speech delivered by the Hungarian leader.
The main opposition leader described the upcoming April vote as the "biggest party of the decade" and urged young people to mark the election date in their calendars.
The opposition Tisza party candidate also rejected the government's narrative, which claimed that an opposition win would drag Hungary into war.
Magyar promised his government would reject military conscription, noting that his party condemns Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but stressing that Budapest will not be dragged into the conflict.
He also vowed that, in the event of winning the elections, he would keep the barrier at Hungary's southern border to prevent illegal migration.
Magyar also announced that his party does not support the European Union's migration pact or Ukraine's fast-track accession to the bloc.
The opposition candidate also addressed reports about a recent chemical leak that occurred in a battery factory near Budapest, with the level of toxic substances exceeding government-allowed thresholds.
"We are making full, independent, and public measurements mandatory. Internal measurements and data from factories cannot remain secret," he said.
Magyar met with EU leaders at Munich Security Conference
Magyar spent Friday and Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, where he held discussions with 12 European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković.
The Tisza party leader said he informed the leaders about his plans in the event of winning the elections.
"The most important task of the future Tisza government will be to bring back the EU funds due to the Hungarian people," Magyar said after his talks in Munich.
He added that his government will aim to adopt strict anti-corruption measures, ensure the independence of the courts, freedom of the press and higher education institutions.
He also shared that he made clear his position on Ukraine's accelerated EU bid to leaders in his talks.

Paul Anka, 84, teases possible retirement after 70 years in show business

Paul Anka, 84, says that after 70 years in show business, he’ll know when it is time for him to retire.
The iconic “My Way” singer and songwriter reflected on his career in an interview with CBS News.
“When it's time for my body to say enough, I'll know,” he said on the outlet’s Sunday morning program. “I'm playing with the house's money now. I'm one lucky guy!”
For now, Anka has stayed busy with his latest album Inspirations of Life and Love, released Friday. The legendary ‘60s musician has also kicked off 2026 with a North American tour that goes until May 24.
He told People earlier this month, “I know what retirement is. I don't want to retire. He added: “Let’s say I do 75 days a year. I got the rest of the year to do what the hell I want. I get to write. I got my things. This is so much fun. If you can’t have fun in life or in a job that you’re doing, don’t do it.”
The singer has been in the music business since he was just 10 years old, growing up in Ottawa, Canada.
“It was very difficult to go from a modest background in a small town, to everybody's all over you and you're famous and you're a celebrity,” Anka told CBS News.
Anka has stayed on Billboard ‘s Top 100 chart for nearly his entire career. He wrote Frank Sinatra’s classic “My Way,” along his own hit songs like “Diana” and “Lonely Boy.”
Rising to fame in the ‘50s and ‘60s, he performed with Rat Pack legends like Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. He has recorded over 130 albums and worked with music icons including Michael Jackson, Connie Francis, Celine Dion and Patti LaBelle.
The singer spiked in popularity again in 2020, when singer Doja Cat used a sample of his song “Put Your Head On My Shoulder” in her song “Freak,” subsequently going viral on TikTok.
Although the singer is busy touring, he said that he makes sure to prioritize his family amid his busy schedule. Anka has a large family, including six children and nine grandkids — two from his daughter Amanda and son-in-law actor Jason Bateman.
Anka is also a single dad to his 20-year-old son Ethan after winning custody of him in 2017 after a legal battle with his ex-wife Anna Aberg.

Hourly power outages to be in effect in most regions on Monday
Ukrinform
On Monday, February 16, in most regions of Ukraine, hourly electricity shutdown schedules will apply for household consumers throughout the day, while industrial consumers will face power restrictions.
Ukrenergo stated this on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.
It is emphasized that the situation in the energy system may change. The timing and extent of the restrictions will be communicated by local energy companies on their official social media pages.
Citizens who currently have electricity are urged to use it sparingly.
The company reminds that these restrictive measures have been introduced due to the consequences of Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian energy facilities.
As Ukrinform previously reported, restoration work continues at energy facilities damaged by strikes from the Russian army.

The Guardian view on AI: safety staff departures raise worries about industry pursuing profit at all costs | Editorial

Hardly a month passes without an AI grandee cautioning that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity. Many of these warnings might be hazy or naive. Others may be self-interested. Calm, level-headed scrutiny is needed. Some warnings, though, are worth taking seriously.
Last week, some notable ground-level AI safety researchers quit, warning that firms chasing profits are sidelining safety and pushing risky products. In the near term, this suggests a rapid “enshittification” in pursuit of short-term revenue. Without regulation, public purpose gives way to profit. Surely AI’s expanding role in government and daily life – as well as billionaire owners’ desire for profits – demand accountability.
The choice to use agents – chatbots – as the main consumer interface for AI was primarily commercial. The appearance of conversation and reciprocity promotes deeper user interaction than a Google search bar. The OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig has warned that introducing ads into that dynamic risks manipulation. OpenAI says ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. But, as with social media, they may become less visible and more psychologically targeted – drawing on extensive private exchanges.
It is worth noting that Fidji Simo, who built Facebook’s ad business, joined OpenAI last year. And OpenAI recently fired its executive Ryan Beiermeister for “sexual discrimination”. Several reports say she had strongly opposed the rollout of adult content. Together, these moves suggest that commercial pressures are shaping the firm’s direction – and probably that of the wider industry. The way Elon Musk’s AI Grok tools were left active long enough to generate misuse, then restricted behind paid access before finally being halted after investigations in the UK and EU, raises questions about monetising harm.
It is harder to evaluate more specialised systems being built for social purposes such as education and government. But since the frenetic pursuit of profit tends to introduce irresistible bias to every human system we have, the same will be true of AI.
This is not a problem within a single company. A more vague resignation letter by the Anthropic safety researcher Mrinank Sharma warned of a “world in peril”, and that he had “repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions”. OpenAI was once ostensibly entirely non-profit; after it committed to commercialisation starting in 2019, Anthropic emerged promising to be the safer, more cautious alternative. Mr Sharma’s departure suggests that even firms founded on restraint are struggling to resist the same pull of profits.
The cause of this realignment is clear. Firms are burning through investment capital at historic rates, their revenues aren’t growing fast enough and, despite impressive technical results, it’s not clear yet what AI can “do” to generate profits. From tobacco to pharmaceuticals, we have seen how profit incentives can distort judgment. The 2008 financial crisis showed what happens when essential systems are driven by short-term needs and weak oversight.
Strong state regulation is needed to solve this problem. The recent International AI Safety Report 2026 offered a sober assessment of real risks – from faulty automation to misinformation – and a clear blueprint for regulation. Yet despite it being endorsed by 60 countries, the US and UK governments declined to sign it. That is a worrying sign that they are choosing to shield industry rather than bind it.

India hammer Pakistan to qualify for T20 World Cup Super Eights
Ishan Kishan defies a tricky Colombo pitch with 77 as India beat Pakistan by 61 runs in Group A of cricket’s T20 World Cup.
Defending champions India have thumped Pakistan by 61 runs in a grudge Group A match of the Twenty20 World Cup to secure their place in the Super Eight stage of the cricket tournament.
Ishan Kishan’s breakneck 77 powered India to 175-7 on Sunday at the R Premadasa Stadium, where Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack managed to apply the brakes to an extent after the opener’s exit.

The tournament co-hosts returned to bundle out Pakistan for 114 in 18 overs to register their third win in a row.
The match went ahead after Pakistan earlier reversed their decision to boycott the game in solidarity with Bangladesh, whose team refused to tour India over safety concerns and were replaced by Scotland.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and his India counterpart Suryakumar Yadav did not shake hands at the toss, though.
India were reinforced by the return of Abhishek Sharma, who missed the first two matches with a stomach infection. But the opener could not make it count.
Pakistan’s Salman sprang a surprise by opening the attack himself, and the move paid off as the spinner trapped Abhishek lbw to remove the reigning number one batter in T20 Internationals.
Pakistan used three spinners in the powerplay to try and stem boundary flow, and India’s score of 52-1 after six overs suggested the ploy worked to an extent.
Kishan could not be contained, though, and the diminutive southpaw tore into the Pakistan attack with his take-no-prisoners batting.
The opener took only 27 balls to race to his second successive fifty of the tournament.
Saim Ayub ended Kishan’s 40-ball blitz, but India were 92-2 at the halfway stage of their innings.
Ayub (3-25) dismissed Tilak Varma (25) and Hardik Pandya with successive deliveries to turn the heat back on India.
Suryakumar (32) and Shivam Dube (27) could not quite provide the late flourish to take India past the 200-mark that had looked well within their reach at one stage.
Pakistan became the first team to employ six spinners in a T20 World Cup match, but the joy of having restricted India under 200 evaporated soon as they slumped to 13-3 in two overs in their chase.
Pandya removed Pakistan’s in-form opener Sahibzada Farhan for a duck, and Jasprit Bumrah dismissed Ayub and Salman in the same over to pin down Pakistan.
Babar Azam (five) did not last long either, and Pakistan were gasping at 38-4 after the six powerplay overs.
Usman Khan (44) defied India for a while, but Axar Patel lured him out to be stumped to effectively snuff out Pakistan’s chances of an unlikely victory.

Western allegations of Navalny poisoning are 'fake', aim to divert attention: Russia

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called "fake" a statement by five European nations claiming opposition figure Alexey Navalny died after being poisoned with a dart frog toxin.
Speaking in an interview with multiple Russian outlets, Zakharova said the Western countries are trying to divert attention from their internal problems.
"There will be test results, there will be formulas of the substances—then there will be a comment," she said. "Without this, all statements and talk are a fake aimed at diverting attention from the pressing problems of the West."
The spokeswoman pointed out that the news appeared "at the moment when it would be necessary to present the results of the investigation into Nord Stream pipeline explosion.
The 2022 sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines was an unprecedented attack that caused extensive damage to the infrastructure connecting Russia and Germany beneath the Baltic Sea.
Serhii Kuznietsov, a former Ukrainian army officer accused of being involved in the sabotage, was arrested in Italy. The Ukrainian government has repeatedly denied any involvement.
On Saturday, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France released a joint statement, alleging Navalny was poisoned using epibatidine, a poison extracted from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog.
The conclusion was made based on an analysis of samples of Navalny's biological materials, according to the statement.
Moscow announced Navalny’s death in a Siberia prison in February 2024 while he was serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism.

The search for Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of NBC’s Today show anchor Savannah Guthrie, has entered its third week, as investigators ask neighbors within a two-mile radius to share home video footage and authorities await DNA test results from a pair of gloves found near the home.
Nancy Guthrie was last seen on the evening of 31 January, when she was dropped off at her home in the Catalina foothills north of Tucson, Arizona, after having dinner with her older daughter and son-in-law. She was reported missing the following day, after she failed to arrive at a friend’s house to watch a church service.
Authorities have been investigating her disappearance as a kidnapping, and as of Sunday morning, two weeks since she was reported missing, no arrests have been made and no one is in custody.
On Sunday, the FBI said in statement reported by several news outlets, that the gloves found around two miles from Guthrie’s home – one of roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days – “appear to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video”.
The agency said that they sent the gloves to a lab in Florida for DNA testing, and that they received preliminary results on Saturday and “are awaiting quality control and official confirmation today”.
“This process typically takes 24 hours from when the bureau receives DNA,” the FBI added.
Most of the gloves collected by investigators for examination turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the vicinity, the FBI said.
But the one with a DNA profile recovered from it is “different”, according to the FBI statement.
Investigators have released doorbell camera footage recovered from Guthrie’s home, which showed a masked individual arriving in the early morning hours of 1 February, carrying a backpack and what appeared to be a holstered handgun.
On Thursday, the FBI released new details about the person in the video, describing them as “a male, approximately 5’9” – 5’10” tall, with an average build”.
As the search continues, authorities are requesting that residents within a two-mile radius of Guthrie’s home submit any surveillance footage recorded between 1 January to 2 February. They have asked neighbors to provide “all video footage that includes vehicles, vehicle traffic, people/pedestrians, and anything neighbors deem out of the ordinary or important”.
As the investigation enters its third week, and continues to draw huge national attention, some crime bloggers and true crime podcasters have traveled to Arizona to cover the case.
On Saturday night, Arizona state representative Alma Hernandez, released a statement, saying that she was “sick of watching” the “insane speculation, lies, and BS by random wannabe journalists and YouTubers who have now caused more harm than good to this entire situation and put this serious case in jeopardy.
“Please GO HOME,” she said. “Let law enforcement do their jobs. Stop following them during swat operations and playing detectives.”
Late on Friday night, law enforcement converged on an area around two miles from Guthrie’s home, where they searched a home, and also investigated a car at a nearby Culver’s parking lot.
On Saturday, the Pima county sheriff’s department confirmed that a federal court-ordered search warrant had been carried out at a residence in connection with the case. But they said that no arrests were made during the operation.
Authorities had briefly detained a man earlier in the week, but he was released after questioning.
Investigators have said that splashes of blood found on the front porch of Guthrie’s home tested positive for her DNA. They also said that additional DNA collected from her property, that does not match Guthrie or those in close contact with her, is undergoing testing, along with several gloves reportedly discovered several miles from her residence.
“All collected evidence has been submitted for laboratory analysis,” officials said this week.
The FBI has increased the reward to $100,000 for information that helps find Guthrie, or leads to an arrest and conviction of those involved in her disappearance. The bureau has said it has received more than 13,000 tips from the public about the case since 1 February.
There have also been unverified reports about ransom notes sent to several Arizona television stations, and celebrity news website TMZ.
Since Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings have posted several videos on social media, pleading for help from the public in finding their mother.
A spokesperson for the Pima county sheriff’s department told CNN on Sunday that no news conferences are currently planned.

Hungarian opposition leader Magyar vows to pull Hungary back toward the West in campaign launch
Hungarian opposition leader Péter Magyar is launching his election campaign and says he can return Hungary to a stronger European path
- Bookmark
Hungarian opposition leader Péter Magyar launched his party's election campaign in Budapest on Sunday, vowing to restore Hungary's Western orientation just eight weeks before he faces Prime Minister Viktor Orbán in a pivotal vote.
Magyar, a former insider in Orbán's nationalist Fidesz party, burst onto Hungary's political scene in 2024 after breaking with his political community and quickly forming the center-right Tisza party.
After taking around 30% of the vote in European Parliament elections in June 2024, he has grown Tisza into the most formidable political force Orbán has faced during his 16 years at Hungary's helm. Most independent polls show Tisza with a significant lead before the April 12 vote, an advantage which has held steady for more than a year.
“We’re standing on the threshold of victory with 56 days left to go,” he told supporters during his speech at an exposition center in Budapest on Sunday. “Tisza stands ready to govern.”
Magyar has vigorously campaigned across Hungary's rural, conservative heartland — traditionally an Orbán stronghold — holding rallies and town hall events in scores of villages and towns. He has focused on bread and butter issues such as low wages and rapidly rising living costs that have made Hungary one of the poorest countries in the European Union.
Magyar accuses Orbán and his government of mismanaging Hungary's economy and social services, and overseeing unchecked corruption he says has led to the accumulation of extreme wealth within a small circle of well-connected insiders while leaving ordinary Hungarians behind.
He has also criticized Orbán for conducting a combative foreign policy with the EU while maintaining close ties to Russia despite its war in neighboring Ukraine.
On Sunday, Magyar pointed to meetings he held with numerous European leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany over the weekend, and said he would put an end to Hungary “drifting out of the European Union” under Orbán.
“Hungary’s place is in Europe, not only because Hungary needs Europe, but also because Europe needs Hungary,” he said.
Magyar's comments contrasted starkly with statements Orbán made a day earlier at his own campaign launch, where he said the real threat facing Hungary was not military aggression from Russia, but the European Union.
Tisza’s program
In a 239-page program released last week, Tisza outlined its plans for how it would govern Hungary if it wins April’s elections. Fidesz has not released a program, arguing that after governing for 16 years, its voters know what kinds of policies to expect.
On Sunday, Magyar reiterated that his party plans to retain a fence Orbán's government built along the country's southern border in 2015, and said he would maintain Fidesz's policies of opposing illegal immigration and any accelerated procedure for Ukraine to join the EU.
However, Magyar has vowed to bring home billions in funding the EU has suspended to Hungary over its concerns that Orbán has eroded democratic institutions, reduced judicial independence and failed to tackle corruption.
The program also pledges to fulfill conditions for adopting the euro currency by 2030, and to invest in Hungary's faltering state health care and public transportation sectors. Tisza also plans to crack down on corruption and recover public funds it argues have been funneled into the hands of government-connected oligarchs.
"It is time to call corruption what it is: theft," Magyar said Sunday.
Tisza's candidates
For its candidates in each of Hungary's 106 individual voting constituencies, Tisza has largely drawn on political neophytes locally active as entrepreneurs, doctors, economists, educators and other professionals.
Leading the ticket alongside Magyar are international energy expert Anita Orbán (no relation to the prime minister), whom the party tapped as its prospective foreign policy chief, and former Shell executive István Kapitány, who would fill a senior economy position in a future Tisza government.
Such candidates, Magyar has argued, will provide sectoral expertise he says is lacking under Orbán's government, and will help rebuild relations with Western partners and end Hungary's international isolation.
"I am proud that our experts are once again showing what it means to take the country’s fundamental issues seriously and to plan our shared future,” he said Sunday. “We don’t plan to dominate this country, but to serve it."

Europe looks to shore up own defenses amid US uncertainty
February 15, 2026Europe's collective defense still relies on the NATO trans-Atlantic alliance, the EU's top diplomat told the Munich Security Conference on Sunday.
But there is an urgent need, Kaja Kallas said, for Europe to take the lead in its own defense.
Kallas, the European Commission's high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, channeled the Avengers superhero franchise with her address, titled "Europeans Assemble! Reclaiming Agency in a Rougher World."
She singled out Russia as Europe's biggest threat, saying its "endgame" was not the Donbas region of Ukraine but a wider assault on the region.
"Russia already seeks to cripple economies through cyberattacks, disrupt satellites, sabotage undersea cables, fracture alliances with disinformation, coerce countries by weaponizing oil and gas," said Kallas. "And of course there is also the nuclear threat."
Europe's shield, she said would be a new security strategy, pursuit of a larger bloc with the addition of new member states and new trade agreements beyond its borders like those with India, Mercosur and an upcoming deal with Australia. These partnerships also include security agreements.
"We are getting there, dusting off our capes, pulling on our boots, revving up our engines," she said.
Stoltenberg: Europe has increased defense spending
Speaking on Sunday, MSC head Wolfgang Ischinger stressed the need to plan for European defense, in particular to "ramp up defense production and to create a more cohesive and globally competitive European defense market."
Woven throughout speeches and soundbites from European leaders at the three-day event was an insistence they had started to deliver that, responding to demands from the Trump administration to pull their weight in NATO.
"The European Union is mobilizing up to €800 billion [...] investing in the capabilities we need — from air and missile defense to drone and military mobility," said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday. "We are delivering."
Former NATO chief-turned-Norwegian finance minister Jens Stoltenberg said the US ultimatum had led to European allies and Canada spending "significantly" more on capability.
"When you listen to the US or the Trump administration, the criticism is not primarily against NATO, it's against NATO allies not paying for NATO. And I think that's a valid point, and Europeans are delivering," Stoltenberg told DW.
EU members spent an estimated €381 billion ($452 billion) on defense in 2025 — up from €251 billion in 2021, prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
For Kallas, though, it's not merely that NATO members need to meet Donald Trump's demand for 5% of GDP spending on defense, but ensuring it's spent wisely. She said European nations needed to cast their procurement nets wider to maximize return on investment.
"We have too many standards, we have too many different capabilities, and in order to bring down the costs, also bring down the procurement times, we really need to work together," said Kallas. "It's not only how much we spend, but actually how to spend it more wisely."
Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said pooling Ukraine's defense capabilities — now tested for four years in its conflict with Russia — was an opportunity for Europe to advance its own security.
"We need to understand in Europe that it's not about a different national interest, about the defense industry," Tsahkna told DW.
"There is no competition between each other. We actually need more support, more new innovation, and Ukraine is our opportunity."
Europe considers defense future without US
In late January, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told lawmakers at the European Parliament that those who thought Europe could defend itself without the United States should "keep dreaming."
And US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a speech focused on preserving Western culture and defense in line with Trump's values, said Saturday it wasn't Washington's "goal" to see the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance. Other US lawmakers mingling with the politicians, policymakers and security experts in Munich also tried to ease fears of a Trump-led withdrawal from the continent.
"Let us show [Europe] that we are trustworthy," Delaware Senator Chris Coons — a Democrat — told DW. "That we are the reliable partners that you've come to count on for decades, and find ways that we can share the burden of our shared defense and security needs and find a positive path forward."
But this weekend made it clear that Europe is prioritizing non-US partnerships — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen explicitly singled out what she called Europe's "closest partners" Norway, Iceland, the UK and Canada for new security collaborations, with the US a notable omission.
While talking up collective defense, European leaders were quick to emphasize the role of NATO for the continent's overall security, particularly for its nuclear deterrent.
Leaders also scuttled talk of a unified European army as a kind of backup to NATO.
"NATO is actually the frame which is working, it's not a theoretical thing, these are the plans and commitments protocols, so we cannot start creating something different," said Tsahkna.
"If we become stronger in conventional capabilities, in cyber, in crisis management — if we take better care of Europe and other continents and thereby also relieve the United States — then I feel safe under the American nuclear umbrella, because the Americans also need us," said Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, head of the European Parliament's defense committee.
Washington's message was that "the US needs a stronger Europe," said Tsahkna. "Actually, we need a stronger Europe. And I think that this Munich conference showed that Europe is waking up."

After Chinese vessel detained, Japanese premier vows firm enforcement against illegal fishing

After Chinese vessel detained, Japanese premier vows firm enforcement against illegal fishing
Statement comes after Tokyo released detained fishing vessel captain as China submitted documentation guaranteeing payment of deposit
ISTANBUL
Japan’s prime minister on Sunday pledged firm enforcement of laws against illegal fishing after a captain of a Chinese fishing boat was detained last week.
Sanae Takaichi said on the US social media company X that Tokyo will continue to take firm enforcement action to prevent and deter illegal fishing operations by foreign fishing vessels.
On Friday, Japanese authorities released the detained captain of the vessel after China submitted documentation guaranteeing payment of a deposit.
The Japan Fisheries Agency said it seized the vessel on Thursday and detained the captain for allegedly defying an order to stop while within Japan's exclusive economic zone off Nagasaki.
It was the first time a Japanese agency seized a Chinese fishing boat in waters off southwestern Japan since 2022.
Beijing said it hopes Tokyo “will uphold the China-Japan fisheries agreement, enforce the law fairly, and safeguard the lawful rights and interests of the people concerned.”
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said China “always” urges its fishermen to operate “in accordance with laws and regulations,” and that Beijing will firmly safeguard its “lawful rights and interests.”
Relations between China and Japan have been strained since Takaichi said in November that a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan, possibly enabling the exercise of collective self-defense.
Beijing strongly criticized the comments and advised Chinese citizens against traveling to Japan, and also reinstated a ban on Japanese seafood imports.
- Japan logs diplomatic protest with China
Japan has lodged a diplomatic protest with China over remarks by Beijing, a Foreign Ministry statement said Sunday.
The statement said “a Chinese participant made inappropriate remarks regarding the security policies of the Japanese government at the Munich Security Conference on February 14.”
“Given that China’s assertions are factually incorrect and ungrounded, the Government of Japan hereby reiterates its position,” the statement said.
Saying that some countries have been “rapidly increasing their military capabilities in a non-transparent manner” and “intensifying unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion,” it added that Tokyo “opposes such moves and distances itself from them.”
“Japan’s efforts to strengthen its defense capabilities are in response to an increasingly severe security environment and are not directed against any specific third country. We expect that the issue surrounding Taiwan will be resolved peacefully through dialogue, and this stance remains unchanged,” the statement added.
“The Government of Japan remains open to dialogue with China and intends to continue responding calmly and appropriately going forward.”
The statement came after China’s foreign minister on Saturday criticized remarks by Takaichi on Taiwan, saying the comments undermine China’s territorial sovereignty.
“This is the first time in eight years that a Japanese Prime Minister has uttered such words. It directly violates China’s territorial sovereignty, and it directly challenges the fact that Taiwan has been returned to China,” Wang said.

Gaza's Nasser Hospital condemns move by MSF to suspend most services
One of Gaza’s last functioning hospitals condemned the move by Doctors Without Borders to pull out of operations over alleged concerns about armed men, claiming on Sunday that the hospital had installed civil police for security.
MSF said in a statement on Saturday that all its noncritical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to security breaches that posed "serious" threats to its teams and patients.
MSF added that there had been an increase in patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the compound since the US-brokered October ceasefire was reached.
Nasser Hospital said on Sunday that the increase in armed men was due to a civilian police presence aimed at protecting patients and staff and said MSF's "allegations are factually incorrect, irresponsible, and pose a serious risk to a protected civilian medical facility".
Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis is one of the territory’s few functioning hospitals. Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated there daily, and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli captives as part of the current ceasefire deal.
"MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons," the organisation claimed. The suspension occurred in January but was only recently announced.
Nasser Hospital staff say that in recent months it has been repeatedly attacked by masked, armed men and militias, which is why the presence of an armed civilian police force is crucial.
Hamas remains the dominant force in areas not under Israeli control, including in the area where Nasser Hospital is located. But other armed groups have been operating across Gaza as a result of the war, including groups backed by the Israeli army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip.
Throughout the war, Israel has repeatedly struck hospitals, including Nasser, after claiming that Hamas were operating in or around medical facilities. Israel's attacks on hospitals plunged healthcare facilities into disaster, leaving thousands of patients without adequate care.
12 Palestinians killed in strikes across Gaza
Gaza's civil defence agency reported that Israeli strikes killed at least 12 people since dawn on Sunday.
The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south.
Five people were killed and several injured when an air strike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement.
Five more were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the agency said, adding that one more was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City.
The agency also said that one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia in north Gaza.
The Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed they had received the bodies of at least seven people.
"Israel doesn't understand ceasefires or truces," said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.
Dozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the bodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds.
Men and women stood in prayer ahead of the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound.
Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem in a statement on Sunday accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire.
"Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the ceasefire agreement," Qassem said.

Israeli government approves new West Bank land policy

Israeli government approves new West Bank land policy
February 15, 2026Israel's government on Sunday approved a contentious plan to make it easier for Israeli settlers to purchase land in the occupied West Bank and further sideline Palestinian authorities.
Under the decision, Israeli authorities will announce certain areas to undergo registration, requiring anyone claiming the land to prove ownership, even though ownership of the biggest part of West Bank land has never been formally registered.
The decision, endorsed earlier by Israel’s security cabinet, allows private Israeli citizens to buy land and also shifts parts of the administration in the territory from the military to civilian authorities.
The Palestinian Authority rejected the move, which marks the first formal land-registration process in the West Bank since 1967.
It also sparked criticism from the European Union and several Arab states.
Germany condemned the security cabinet’s earlier approval last week, with a Foreign Ministry spokesperson calling the measures "a further step towards de facto annexation" and saying they violate international law.
Far‑right ministers welcome the move
Talking to broadcaster N12, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz described Sunday's approval as "a significant security and administrative step aimed at ensuring full control, enforcement and freedom of action for the State of Israel in the area."
Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the government was "continuing the revolution in settlement policy and control over all parts of our country."
He added that, for the first time since Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the 1967 Six Day War, the government was "restoring order and governance" to land administration.
He referred to the Palestinian territory as "Judea and Samaria," the term some Israelis use for the West Bank.
More than 700,000 Israeli settlers live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem alongside roughly 3 million Palestinians. The West Bank is among the territories that the Palestinians seek for a future independent state.
According to the Times of Israel, most of the new land registration rules apply to the West Bank's Area C, where Israel has full military and civilian control.
The newspaper said two-thirds of West Bank land has never been formally registered, including most of Area C.
However, the easing of rules about private land purchases by Israelis and the publication of land registries for the first time, applies beyond Area C, to the broader territory.
PA, Peace Now condemns ‘massive land theft’
The Palestinian Authority, which runs the rest of the West Bank, said the move constitutes "a de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory," which it said was "aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity."
The Israeli advocacy group Peace Now denounced the government’s decision, saying it amounted to "authorization for a massive theft of land in the West Bank on the way to de facto annexation."
In a statement, the group accused the Israeli government of ignoring international law and dismissing criticism from allied countries, warning that the policy was "dragging us into disaster."
The United Nations' highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible.
Israel disputes this view, claiming historical and biblical ties to the land.

Europe's new gamble on Russia's exiles, explained

Europe's new gamble on Russia's exiles, explained

Nearly four years after Russia's expulsion from the Council of Europe, the Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) has launched a new platform for dialogue with exiled Russian forces.
The move is a major shift in how Europe engages with Russian opposition figures at a time when Moscow remains isolated from the continent's main human rights body and the war in Ukraine continues with no clear end in sight.
The 15 participants of the Russian PACE platform published their first joint statement on Feb. 6, which focused primarily on the war in Ukraine.
In the statement, they place responsibility for launching the war on Russia and describe their home country as "fascist." They call for continued military support for Ukraine, accountability for aggression and other alleged crimes, and the use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's recovery.
Yet alongside declarations of solidarity and institutional backing, fundamental questions remain about how much the platform can achieve — and who, exactly, it represents.
The Kyiv Independent spoke with several participants to understand how the platform came into being and what its broader political significance might be.
What is PACE?
PACE is an advisory body of the Council of Europe, which brings together 46 countries, including EU member states as well as non-EU countries such as Turkey, Ukraine, and Georgia.
The Assembly works to promote human rights and democracy across member states.
Unlike the European Parliament, PACE does not pass laws, and its resolutions are not legally binding. Even so, the political weight it carries often shapes policy debates.
Russia joined the Council of Europe in 1996 and took an active part in PACE for more than two decades. After Moscow's illegal annexation of Ukraine's Crimea in 2014, PACE stripped Russia of its voting rights, and the Russian delegation stopped attending sessions.
In 2019, the Assembly restored Russia's powers, a decision that was controversial at the time.
For years, the Russian delegation — led by lawmaker Pyotr Tolstoy — included representatives from all of the country's parliamentary factions. None of the permitted factions were opposed to the regime.
That arrangement ended in 2022. After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Council of Europe expelled Russia, automatically terminating its participation in PACE.
The newly-created platform, however, is not a replacement for that delegation — a distinction that has already caused confusion.
A platform, not a delegation
In September 2025, PACE's Political Affairs Committee proposed establishing a platform inside the Assembly for dialogue with "Russian democratic forces in exile."
The Assembly set out strict criteria: delegates must be individuals "of the highest moral standing" who unconditionally recognize Ukraine's territorial integrity and commit to working toward "regime change" in Russia.
Delegates will serve one-year terms and may attend committee meetings and discuss "issues of common concern" with Assembly members, but they will not be able to vote on PACE resolutions or hold the formal status once granted to Russia's official delegation.
The platform includes 15 members, though PACE has not publicly detailed how it selected the candidates — a lack of transparency that has fueled debate about the body's legitimacy.
Among the selected participants are Dmitry Gudkov, a former member of the Russian parliament; Vladimir Kara-Murza, an opposition politician and vice president of the Free Russia Foundation; Garry Kasparov, former world chess champion and co-founder of the Free Russia Forum; and Nadya Tolokonnikova, co-founder of the feminist group Pussy Riot.
Five seats are reserved for representatives of Russia's indigenous and minority communities. Among them are Ruslan Kutaev, a Chechen opposition figure; Ekaterina Kuznetsova, an artist and founder of Ingria House, a project focused on Finno-Ugric cultures; and Lana Pylaeva, an indigenous rights consultant and founder of the Komi Daily media outlet.
The remaining participants also include Russian opposition politicians, independent journalists, civil society activists, and other public figures.
Unprecedented advocacy, questions of legitimacy
For representatives of Russia's indigenous peoples and minority communities, participation in the PACE platform offers a rare opportunity to circumvent the federal authorities and entrenched institutions that have long monopolized Russian political discourse.
"I believe that strategically, representatives of Russia's indigenous peoples and Ukrainians are allies," Pylaeva told the Kyiv Independent. "We face a common challenge and a common misfortune: the imperial and colonial nature of Russia."
"As a result, indigenous and regional perspectives are marginalized and effectively ignored," she said. "This platform is the result of serious international efforts and gives indigenous peoples the opportunity to speak directly."
The wide range of perspectives included among the PACE platform's participants, each reflecting different priorities, is generally seen by them as a source of strength for the work that lies ahead.
"It was very important to us that the platform is not dominated by just one or two (opposition) groups. Instead, it brings in a wider range of people and organizations, ensuring there's no monopoly," Natalia Arno, president of the Free Russia Foundation, told the Kyiv Independent.
"We oppose Putin's monopoly in Russia, and we didn't want to see anything similar in such an important international, pan-European institution like PACE."
Nevertheless, the composition of the platform raises a delicate question: by what authority do these 15 individuals claim to represent Russia's democratic opposition?
While Belarus's opposition can point to the 2020 presidential election, which demonstrated strong support for Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Russian democratic opposition figures have no recent electoral mandate to establish a comparable claim to legitimacy.
The Belarusian opposition also benefits from formalized recognition. In 2022, the Council of Europe created a "Contact Group on Belarus," where representatives of Tikhanovskaya's team participated.
Russian opposition leaders, by contrast, have thus far lacked any comparable institutional platform.
However, Pylaeva explained that the PACE forum is not a national delegation, but a provisional space for dialogue otherwise unavailable within Russia.
"This is a platform for dialogue, created in a situation where Russia is waging an aggressive war," she said. "PACE is establishing a format for communication with representatives of the opposition and civil society."
She acknowledged the criticism but framed it against the stark political realities within Russia, where independent institutions are weak, dissent is suppressed, and meaningful channels for representation — especially for indigenous and regional communities — are virtually nonexistent.
"I see the first year and format of this platform as an experiment," Pylaeva said. "It is a tool, and I believe it is important to use it."
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the exiled businessman and opposition activist who also joined the platform, described the formation process as foundational rather than final.
"It must subsequently be revised using a procedure of elections among anti-war Russians," he said. "The main thing now is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new institution in representing the interests of this segment of Russian society."
Notable absence of Navalny's allies
Strikingly absent from the list of PACE platform participants are any allies of the late opposition leader Alexei Navalny, whose network of activists and political operatives has long challenged the Kremlin's authority and shaped Russia's opposition landscape.
Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) continues to operate after his death under the leadership of his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, and his close associates.
With a robust online footprint, the organization commands YouTube channels and social media platforms that reach millions across Russia and around the world.
A senior FBK representative told the Kyiv Independent that the group received multiple invitations to join the PACE platform but decided, for now, to decline.
"We were indeed invited several times to take part in the work of the platform," the representative said. "We discussed this issue extensively within our organization and decided, at this stage, to refrain from participating."
"Our priority is working… with anti-Putin and anti-war forces within the country," the representative added.
According to FBK, PACE officials said they would monitor the platform's performance for a year before deciding whether any adjustments were needed.
"We will also be watching," the representative said, leaving open the possibility of reconsidering the organization's involvement. "I do not exclude at all that in a year, for example, we may revise our decision."

Support for Ukraine
As Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine enters its fourth year, one of the questions surrounding the Russian democratic opposition is how effectively and to what extent they might use the PACE platform to call for increased military aid to Ukraine.
Tolokonnikova is among those calling for support that goes beyond mere statements of solidarity, urging concrete action to provide Ukraine with more weapons.
"I think it's very important to represent the voices of those fighting Putin not just with words but with actions, including with weapons for the Russian partisan movement inside Russia, as well as people who left to fight on Ukraine's side," Tolokonnikova told the Kyiv Independent.
"These are some of the brightest representatives of the anti-war movement, and yes, their voices are important."
Arno emphasized that Ukraine has "every right to defend itself by all available means" and said that the Free Russia Foundation provides legal support to pro-democracy Russians residing and working in Ukraine as volunteers and soldiers.
The Free Russian Foundation's Kyiv branch is also actively aiding in the search to locate Ukrainian POWs and civilians kept in Russian shadow prisons, she added.
"Unfortunately, we know Russian prisons all too well. We understand the system, and far too many of our people — including our Vice President Vladimir Kara-Murza — have experienced it firsthand," Arno said.
"We have submitted numerous reports to the ICC, the UN mechanisms, and the OSCE. We also bring delegations of Ukrainian families — both those whose loved ones are still imprisoned and those who have been released — so they can share their personal stories."
"Additionally, we document the methods used by Russian authorities, such as the widespread practice of charging Ukrainians with terrorism. Monitoring and exposing these abuses is one of our organization's top priorities."
A long-standing criticism of the Russian democratic opposition has been that some of its leaders frequently invoke the vision of a "beautiful Russia of the future," yet offer little clarity on the practical realities of a post-Putin transition.
Self-proclaimed pessimist Tolokonnikova told the Kyiv Independent that imagining the so-called beautiful Russia of the future is becoming "harder and harder each year" and that it's important for the Russian democratic opposition to convey the threat posed by Russia not only to Ukraine but to all of Europe.
"I can't guarantee to anyone that after Putin's departure, Russia will necessarily become democratic," she said.
"That's why I think it's necessary to contain Russia as a dangerous neighbor to Europe on all possible levels. What's needed is the language of strength and coercion, not the language of requests."

Rubio says US not disputing report of Navalny’s fatal poisoning by frog toxin
Five European governments blamed Russia for killing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny while he was held in an Arctic penal colony
Reading Time:2 minutes
Why you can trust SCMP
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday that Washington is “not disputing” a report by five European countries that imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was fatally poisoned with a rare frog “toxin”.
Rubio said the report released on Saturday by Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden was “very troubling”. Britain, which has outright blamed Russia for Navalny’s death, said it was considering new sanctions on Moscow as a result.
Navalny, a staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, died in a Siberian prison on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence. While Russia has never explained the circumstances, it has said Navalny died suddenly and the foreign ministry in Moscow has dismissed the European report.

Rubio, on a brief visit to Slovakia, said Navalny’s death was “very serious” and the US decision not to join the report “doesn’t mean we disagree with the outcome”.
The report said Navalny was poisoned with a “rare toxin”, epibatidine, from an Ecuadorian dart frog. The Europeans also said that Russia was the prime suspect.

Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) has begun flight tests of the next-generation Arrow 4 interceptor.
Defense-Update reported the development.
The new interceptor is intended to serve as the upper tier of Israel’s missile defense architecture, replacing earlier-generation Arrow systems.
The program is being developed jointly with the United States, with the participation of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. The project aims to counter maneuverable and hypersonic threats that are increasingly appearing in the arsenals of countries in the region.
Arrow 4 is designed to replace Arrow 2 and Arrow 3. The new interceptor features greater maneuverability and improved accuracy in the terminal phase of engagement.
According to the developer, the system is equipped with advanced satellite-aided inertial guidance.
New aerodynamic control surfaces enable the missile to execute rapid maneuvers at very high speeds.
IAI President and CEO Boaz Levy previously reported that serial production is scheduled to begin in late 2025, paving the way for initial deployment as early as 2026.
In addition to Israel, the Bundeswehr plans to acquire the Arrow 4 missile defense system.
Combined with the deployment of Arrow 3, the first unit of which is set to become operational in northeastern Germany by the end of the year, the system is expected to provide coverage across a broad range of altitudes.
One of the stated advantages of the Arrow 4 interceptor is its compatibility with existing Arrow radars and launchers.
This is expected to make the system a cost-effective solution.

Trump told Netanyahu he would support Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program, sources say
President Trump told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in December that the president would support Israeli strikes on Iran's ballistic missile program if a deal between Washington and Tehran could not be reached, according to two sources familiar with the matter who spoke to CBS News on condition of anonymity to discuss national security issues.
Two months later, CBS News has learned that internal discussions between senior figures in the U.S. military and intelligence community have started to contemplate the possibility of supporting a fresh round of Israeli strikes on Iran. American deliberations have focused less on whether Israel could act than on how the United States might assist, including the provision of aerial refueling for Israeli aircraft and the delicate matter of securing overflight permission from countries along the potential route, said two other U.S. officials with knowledge of the matter.
It's not clear what countries would grant overflight permission for the U.S. to refuel Israeli aircraft for a potential strike. Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have all publicly said they would not allow their airspace to be used for any strikes on Iran or Iranian strikes on any other country.
But the ongoing conversations inside the national security apparatus coincided with a visible show of force from the United States towards Iran. On Thursday, CBS News reported that a second U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford and its flotilla of warships, would be dispatched to the Middle East, joining an already substantial American presence. Four U.S. officials said the carrier strike group is expected to redeploy from the Caribbean, a movement that would place formidable firepower within range of Iran at a moment of heightened strain.
All of it comes as the Trump administration pursues negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu remains openly skeptical of diplomacy with Iran and flew to Washington last Wednesday for talks with President Trump. Netanyahu released multiple statements insisting that any Iran accord include restrictions on ballistic missiles and funding of proxies in the region, issues that would extend any deal beyond the nuclear program itself.
Iranian officials have signaled a conditional willingness to curb some uranium enrichment in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions, but it is unclear what that looks like and talks have yet to produce any written agreement.
The U.S. and Iran are expected to hold a second round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Tuesday in an effort to reach a deal that prevents war. Iranian state media is reporting that Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and his delegation are on their way to Geneva for the indirect talks, according to the Associated Press.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that he has "made clear he prefers diplomacy" on Iran, and he confirmed that U.S. envoy Steve Wiktoff and Jared Kushner are traveling "to have important meetings" with Iran.
"We'll see how that comes out," he added.
Mr. Trump, speaking at the White House on Friday, framed the carrier deployment as prudent insurance if negotiations between the United States and Iran fail. By shifting additional naval power into the region, Mr. Trump appears intent on sharpening the leverage behind his demands.

Russia claims capture of another settlement in Ukraine
Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov says over 200 square kilometers of Ukraine's territory came under Russian control in February, including 12 settlements
MOSCOW
Russia claimed on Sunday that its forces had captured the settlement of Tsvitkove in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region.
The Defense Ministry said in a statement that units of the Vostok (East) group of forces continued their advance after capturing the village.
Separately, Chief of General Staff Valery Gerasimov said the Russian army established control over 12 settlements in the first half of February.
On an unannounced visit to inspect the group of forces Tsentr (Center) in a combat zone, Gerasimov said that over the same period, more than 200 square kilometers (77.2 square miles) of Ukraine's territory came under Russian control.
In another development, Ukraine's railway company Ukrzaliznytsia accused Russia of striking railway infrastructure in the Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions.
In Odesa, buildings on the territory of a depot were damaged by the attack. A large fire broke out in the area when a tank car caught fire, the company said.
"There were no casualties. The damage did not affect train traffic," it added.
In the same region, it added, critical infrastructure and some consumers were left without power.
Independent verification of the claims is challenging due to the ongoing conflict.

Six Nations: France only team left who can claim Grand Slam after crushing Wales
France

02:12:50 KST

France turned on the flair with a devastating eight-try show of power as they thrashed Wales 54-12 in their Six Nations meeting at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff on Sunday, February 15. Wing Theo Attissogbe scored twice in the second half as France made it two wins from two. The Bordeaux-Begles no. 10 showed off his pace and skills as he scored one try and teed up three others as France made it two wins from two.
After two rounds they are the only side that can still claim a Grand Slam while Wales sit bottom of the table with two thumping defeats. Steve Tandy's side have won just two of their last 25 Tests and have not won in the Six Nations for three years.
The French came into the match on the back of an equally eye-catching win at home to Ireland and the breadth of their game and the pace and power of their runners were far too much for a Welsh side that suffered a similar 48-7 hammering at Twickenham last week.
The new center pairing of Pau teammates Emilien Gailleton and Fabien Brau-Boirie both touched down in the first half, with Louis Bielle-Biarrey also dotting down for his 23rd try in his 24th Test.
Wales responded with a try by Rhys Carre, but France dominated the second period as Attissogbe scored twice with further scores for hooker Julian Marchand and lock Charles Ollivon, both of whom were playing their 50th Tests. Mason Grady picked up a consolation try for Wales in the 78th minute.
Brau-Boirie scores on debut
The first try came after just 90 seconds, Antoine Dupont and Attisogbe combining down the right, feeding to Ollivon who presented Gailleton with the easiest of run-ins. The second came 10 minutes later when Jalibert sent a perfectly-flighted crosskick over to an unmarked Bielle-Biarrey. Two minutes later, Jalibert showed his pace as he cut through the Wales midfield before popping the ball inside to 20-year-old Brau-Boirie who went through to score on his debut in the center.
Wales refused to buckle, and forced their way up to the French line where they were awarded a penalty. Last week captain Dewi Lake made the fundamental error of forgetting to tap before charging at the English line. This time the skipper got it right and from the ensuing ruck, Carre barged his way over.
France threatened with every attack but the Welsh defense stood firm until a minute before the break when a casual grubber from a turnover ricocheted off a blue shirt and bounced into the arms of Attisogbe. A quick inside pass from the wing sent Jalibert away for the score which pocketed an attacking bonus point.
It took the French all of four minutes to get on the board in the second half, a 5-meter line-out resulting in hooker Julian Marchand, winning his 50th cap, crashing over. Shortly after, Bielle-Biarrey burnt down the left wing before feeding inside for Attisogbe to finish. The Pau wing claimed his double when another Jalibert crosskick found him in acres of space on the right. France posted the half-century when Ollivon went over on the hour. It was France's biggest ever score against Wales, improving on the 51 at Wembley in 1998.

Scottish government launches campaign urging boys not to share sexist content
First Minister of Scotland John Swinney says ministers will do "everything we can" to eradicate violence against women and girls
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Scottish Government has launched a new advertising campaign urging boys and young men to avoid sharing misogynistic content online, with the unequivocal message: "sexist content is never harmless". The initiative encourages critical thought before engaging with such material.
One video clip shows a boy watching content on his phone, as a voiceover states, "sexist content is never harmless, it hurts girls in real life – including the ones you know". Emojis on his screen transform into the face of an upset girl, mirroring the person beside him, illustrating real-world impact.
The five-week campaign runs on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitch, YouTube, and outdoor advertising.
First Minister John Swinney said: "Social media plays a significant role in most young people’s lives, and the rise of online misogyny means that young boys and men are often seeing harmful, sexist content, even when they have not been searching for it. This is deeply concerning, particularly given that so many of these young audiences may be easily influenced.
“Our campaign is designed to make boys and young men aware of the impact of sexist content on social media and how interacting with that can harm the women and girls they know in the real world – including their sisters, friends and classmates. By choosing not to like, share or comment on sexist content online, boys and men can help stop it spreading."
Mr Swinney said ministers will do "everything we can" to eradicate violence against women and girls.
Rebekah MacLeod, project lead for White Ribbon Scotland, which tackles violence against women and girls, said: "Everyone has a role to play in ending violence against women and girls, but especially men and boys. There is often a disconnect in understanding of how the content that young people consume and share online impacts upon how they see, speak to, and treat the women and girls around them.
“In an online world shaped by algorithms and increasingly divisive and dangerous narratives, harmful attitudes can be normalised, reinforced, and rewarded at speed and scale. We cannot emphasise just how important this campaign is. This campaign empowers men and boys to understand that they play a powerful role by choosing not to engage or share this harmful content."

Tunisian police detain opposition figure Olfa Hamdi at airport

TUNIS, Feb 15 - Tunisian police detained opposition figure Olfa Hamdi as she arrived at the country’s main airport on Sunday, local media reported, in the latest move against a critic of President Kais Saied.
Hamdi, leader of the Third Republic party, was detained shortly after disembarking from a flight, the reports said. She resides abroad and previously served as CEO of Tunisia's national carrier Tunisair.
Hamdi has repeatedly criticized Saied’s rule and called for the formation of a transitional government and early presidential elections.
Opposition figures described the arrest as part of a wider crackdown on dissent, as Tunisia grapples with deepening polarization since Saied assumed sweeping powers in 2021, a move critics have denounced as a coup.
Authorities made no immediate comment on the arrest. Reuters has been unable to contact Hamdi's lawyer or any of her relatives.
In early February, police arrested a member of parliament known for mocking the president, in what opposition called an effort to stifle critic voices.
Many opposition leaders, along with activists and journalists, are behind bars, with critics accusing Saied of having turned Tunisia into a prison since 2021.
Saied rejects the accusations, insisting that he is not a dictator and that the law applies to everyone, regardless of their position. REUTERS

21 Palestinians displaced when Israeli demolishes family home in occupied West Bank
Rights group says 160-square-meter house razed in Jiyus near Qalqilya, leaving children and elderly family members without shelter
RAMALLAH, Palestine
Twenty-one Palestinians were displaced Sunday after Israeli forces demolished their family home in the town of Jiyus, north of Qalqilya in the occupied West Bank, according to a Palestinian rights organization.
Bedouin rights group Al-Baydar said the 160-square-meter (1,722-square-foot) house was demolished over the alleged lack of a building permit.
The displaced family includes children and elderly members who were left without shelter following the demolition, it added.
Israeli authorities prohibit construction or land reclamation in Area C of the West Bank without permits that Palestinians say are “nearly impossible” to obtain.
According to the Colonization and Wall Resistance Commission, Israel carried out 59 demolition operations in January, targeting 126 Palestinian structures, including 77 inhabited homes. It also reported 40 additional demolition notices, most of them concentrated in the city of Hebron.
Separately, the Israeli government on Sunday approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property” for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation – including killings, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion – as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
At least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, about 11,500 wounded, and more than 21,000 detained during that period, according to Palestinian estimates.
In a landmark opinion last July, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Rio Carnival parades kick off with divisive ode to Lula in election year

‘Ola Lula’: Rio Carnival ode to Brazil’s president sparks political storm
One of Rio de Janeiro's top samba schools kicked off this year's Carnival with a lavish ode to Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, tracing his rise from rural poverty to superhero status among the working classes, symbolised by a colossal metal figurine of the president. But in an election year that sees Lula seeking a fourth term, the tribute has sparked a political debate.
A colossal metallic robot depicting Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva towered over Rio de Janeiro's famed Sambadrome avenue on Sunday night, in a Carnival parade that has drawn fire for its tribute to a sitting president in an election year.
Samba school Academicos de Niteroi kicked off three days of dazzling parades with the homage to Lula, tracing his life as a boy growing up in poverty in the arid northeast, to a metalworker, union leader and then president.
The opposition has slammed the parade as veiled early campaigning ahead of October polls in which the 80-year-old Lula is seeking a fourth term.
Lula and his wife Rosangela "Janja" da Silva watched the parade from one of the many VIP boxes lining the avenue.
There were striking workers, dancers draped in giant lightbulbs to represent access to electricity and those depicting the poor getting benefits in what was also an ode to a raft of leftist concerns.
The crowd seated along the 700-meter avenue sang along to the theme song chosen by Academicos de Niteroi, which included the catchy refrain often used by the president's supporters: "Ole, ole, ole, ola; Lula, Lula!"
Luena Holliday, 51, an events organiser, said she was a fan of the veteran leftist, but she was torn about the choice of theme.
"I find it confusing. I support Lula ... but we're in a very divided moment in the country, and I don't know how appropriate it is to associate Carnival with Lula," she told AFP.
Bolsonaro as a clown
The parades of the city's top 12 samba schools – a ferocious competition featuring massive, animated floats, thundering drum sections and scantily-clad samba queens – are the showpiece of Rio's Carnival.
Behind the pomp and glitter, each school chooses an annual theme, often linked to Afro-Brazilian heritage, social or political commentary, mythology or environmental issues.
The parade – the first to honor a serving president – made no mention of the election, but did not shy away from politics.
The theme song declares "no amnesty" – the leftist chant against efforts to free former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro from a 27-year jail term he is serving for plotting a failed coup.
And one of the floats depicted a giant Bozo the Clown in prison stripes behind bars, with a massive ankle bracelet, a clear reference to Bolsonaro, who has often been nicknamed "Bozo" by his critics.
Bolsonaro was moved from house arrest to prison before the official start of his sentence after trying to remove his ankle monitoring bracelet with a soldering iron.
"Bozo in Jail? That's where he is supposed to be," a glitter-covered Nelia Macedo, 44, told AFP, praising a parade which "exceeded all expectations."
Marcia Alves, 59, a retired businesswoman, who admits she is not a supporter of Lula, said "you shouldn't mix Carnival with politics. It's for everyone to have fun, everyone has their own opinion."
Warnings from electoral court
Bolsonaro has anointed his eldest son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, as his political heir and presidential candidate.
Shortly before the start of the parade, Flavio published an AI-generated video of a parade mocking Lula "the thief," showing him behind bars in reference to his 2018 jailing on a corruption charge that was later annulled.
Brazil's electoral court, the TSE, on Thursday unanimously rejected requests filed by two opposition parties to stop Academicos from parading Sunday.
The court said it could not block a parade before it happened, but warned it could still investigate after the show.
On Friday, the presidency warned officials attending carnival events not to make "statements that could be characterized as early electoral propaganda."
"We did not come here to campaign," said Leonel Querino, one of the directors of Academicos de Niteroi.
"We came here to celebrate the story of a worker in Brazil."

Europe seen as key market for data sovereignty technology

“This technology is the first technology that's going to start to take data away from big tech," says tech entrepreneur Eric Swider.
On the sidelines of the World Governments Summit in Dubai, Eric Swider, an American technology entrepreneur, told Euronews Next the event provides a platform for global discussions to translate into practical outcomes, as governments focus on data ownership, privacy and artificial intelligence (AI).
Asked about the function of international summits, Swider said the World Government Summit allows global conversations to move beyond theory.
“I think that having an opportunity to attend a summit like this is very unique because of the fact that you're able to meet so many people from around the globe but yet take those conversations to a very local level, a level that becomes something that you can actually act on and you can move a technology or an idea or a platform forward,” he said.
Swider was in Dubai to outline what he described as a new “reality intelligence-based platform”, which he said is designed to shift control of data away from large technology companies and back to individuals and governments.
“So just from a very high level of our platform, we're calling it the very first, the world's very first reality intelligence-based platform,” he said. “What we're doing is we're bridging the gap between the physical world and the data that you own.”
Swider said the platform differs from conventional artificial intelligence models by relying on user-owned data rather than large-scale external datasets.
“And the way that we do that is we take all of your data, we put it inside of a private blockchain that you control, and that gives data back to the sovereign, back to the individual,” he said.
“So now the individual controls their data, monetises their data, and that data becomes the LLM (large language model) that helps you in your life.”
Swider said the approach might significantly alter how personal data is used online, particularly in digital commerce.
“This technology is the first technology that's going to start to take data away from big tech,” he said. “Our users will make the money off of the data, not Google and not Amazon.”
He said Europe may be particularly receptive to the platform, citing the region’s regulatory leadership on data protection and privacy.
“I actually think that Europe is going to be one of the places that appreciates this technology the most,” he said. “Europe has been leading the charge in data privacy and getting data back to the owners.”
He added that potential applications extend to healthcare, allowing individuals to retain ownership of sensitive information.
“If you can imagine a unified medical record that's on top of a blockchain, now every citizen of Europe or the United States or Africa owns their own medical data,” he said. “They decide who to share it with, when to share, and they commoditise it if they so choose.”
Responding to concerns around security, Swider acknowledged scepticism but said blockchain-based systems offer strong safeguards.
“If you believe in the concept of a blockchain, then you can believe in the concept of data security inside of that blockchain,” he said, adding that encrypted records would be significantly harder to compromise than traditional databases.

Haaretz has learned that the State Attorney's Office plans to file an indictment against Yinon Levi, the settler who was filmed shooting Awdah Hathaleen to death in the West Bank village of Umm al-Kheir in July 2025.

Iraqi embassy in Saudi Arabia issues clarification on viral video of ambassador
The Iraqi Embassy in Saudi Arabia issued a statement today regarding a social media video featuring Ambassador Safia Talib Al-Suhail.
Some posts alleged the video showed "undiplomatic behaviour" toward an official Iraqi delegation.
According to the statement, the ambassador and Iraqi delegation attending the Saudi Defence Exhibition 2026 hosted an event at the embassy’s official residence.
The gathering included Saudi dignitaries and members of the Iraqi community. The embassy emphasised that Iraq was the host, and Saudi guests attended by invitation.
The embassy clarified that the event followed diplomatic customs, with seating arranged by precedence. The occasion was social and introductory, not a formal protocol ceremony.
The statement noted that the video was taken out of context. It showed the ambassador and delegation moving within the residence to invite guests to dinner, in line with the social traditions of both countries. The embassy stated this scene was misinterpreted and did not reflect the actual event.
The embassy explained that the ambassador's and delegation’s movements signalled that the invitation included both Saudi guests and all Iraqi delegation members. This was a routine organisational procedure consistent with hospitality customs, with no breach of protocol or precedence.
The embassy emphasised that the meeting was conducted in a friendly atmosphere, reflecting strong Iraq–Saudi Arabia relations and mutual respect. All actions followed international diplomatic practices, preserving Iraq’s standing and showing full appreciation for the guests.
The embassy affirmed its right to clarify any incomplete or inaccurate public information to maintain transparency and uphold the fraternal relationship between the two countries.
Parliament Orders Investigation
Following the event in Riyadh, Parliament Speaker Haibat al-Halbousi directed the formation of an investigative committee, requested communication with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and called for the Iraqi ambassador in Saudi Arabia to be summoned within 48 hours.
Iraqi social media users are divided over the video. One group stated that the invitation occurred at the ambassador’s residence and that, in Iraqi culture, it is customary for the host to stand and greet guests, which shows respect and does not breach diplomatic protocol.
The other group argues the ambassador and staff violated diplomatic etiquette, suggesting Iraq was "belittled" while Saudis were seated and Iraqis stood.

Dumping Ley may have been the answer, but One Nation has radically changed the question

Dumping Ley may have been the answer, but One Nation has radically changed the question
In the end, the numbers just got worse – no matter what Sussan Ley did.
These poll results offer both a damning indictment of the final days of her leadership and vindication for the Liberal Party’s decision to sack her.
They also offer a glimpse at the momentous challenge ahead for Angus Taylor, even if he has delivered a small lift to the Coalition’s plummeting primary vote.
The official opposition and One Nation each secured a primary vote of 23 per cent, a record low for the Coalition and a record high for Pauline Hanson’s party, as support in the polls has almost quadrupled since 6.4 per cent of Australians voted for her candidates at the election last May.
This month’s Resolve poll was conducted from February 8 to 14, a week that began as Ley struck a bargain with Nationals leader David Littleproud to reunite the Coalition, but ended with Taylor in charge of the Liberal Party. All 1800 respondents were asked to express their primary vote intention with Ley as leader and then with Taylor in charge and the results, for Ley, were disastrous.
With Ley in charge, the Coalition secured a primary vote of just 20 per cent, whereas One Nation won the primary vote of 25 per cent of voters. In other words, things had gotten so bad under Ley that the Coalition was trailing One Nation, for the first time ever in the Resolve poll, by 5 percentage points.
That is a statistically significant movement outside the margin of error of plus or minus 2.3 per cent and it underscores the extent to which voters had switched off from Ley.
Voters started deserting the Coalition for One Nation soon after the last election, and the Coalition’s months-long civil war only hastened the decline in the Liberal primary vote.
One Nation’s popularity has also created a new problem for pollsters estimating the two-party-preferred vote, which has led this masthead – and others – to hold back from highlighting those results.
When voters were asked to state their preferences, Labor held a 10 percentage point, 55-45 lead over the Coalition in the two-party-preferred vote.
But those numbers are potentially inaccurate because in some seats where One Nation is polling well, a two-candidate preferred count that pitched Labor against One Nation, or the Coalition against One Nation, would be more accurate.
One Nation support is typically concentrated in a smaller group of seats – rural and outer urban – so it is not yet clear which seats should be polled on a two-candidate-preferred basis.
Resolve Pollster Jim Reed said the two-party-preferred vote “only works at a national level when you have a binary contest”.
“We’ve always preferred to focus on primary vote, which is how we were able to call the Greens and teals wins in 2022,” he said.
“The political shift here is beginning to look more like the UK experience now, where Reform began cannibalising one side of politics, but then went on to damage both sides of politics.”
The preferred prime minister rating has also not been in the spotlight this month, as it usually is, as the data compared only Ley and Albanese, rather than Taylor and Albanese.
Even if Ley were still the opposition leader, this result would be a disaster as Albanese holds a substantial 16 percentage point lead over Ley, 38-22, with the rest undecided. Last month, Albanese led Ley by 4 points, 33-29.
The ongoing collapse in support for both major parties is spelt out here and in other polls. At the election in May last year, 33.6 per cent of voters gave their first preference to other options, including One Nation, the Greens or an independent.
Less than 12 months later, 45 per cent of voters say they would vote for someone other than the major parties in a contest between Albanese and Taylor. Just under half, 49 per cent of voters, would have voted for minor parties and independents while Ley still led the opposition, an even worse result.
These figures highlight just how far the Coalition has fallen out of favour. The recovery by a couple of percentage points in the first flush of the Taylor-led opposition is nice, but to form government one day, the opposition needs its primary vote to be closer to 40 per cent than 20 per cent.
Oh, before Labor starts gloating, Albanese should remember that his party could be next as disaffection for the major parties grows.

A storm system sweeps across the Southeast triggering tornado warnings and damaging winds

Severe storm triggers tornado warnings across the South
The most intense storms were reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana
- Bookmark
A powerful storm system has unleashed severe weather across the southeastern United States, triggering tornado warnings in Mississippi and Louisiana before advancing towards parts of Georgia and Florida. This turbulent weather front arrives as the Northeast enjoys a welcome reprieve from weeks of bitterly cold temperatures.
The most intense storms were reported near Lake Charles, Louisiana, where high winds from a thunderstorm caused significant disruption. A horse trailer and a Mardi Gras float were overturned, an airport jet bridge sustained damage and a metal awning was ripped from a house, landing in power lines. These incidents were documented by National Weather Service employees who surveyed the area.
Further reports from the weather service indicated snapped and toppled power poles near the Louisiana towns of Jena, Cheneyville, and Donaldsonville.
While no fatalities or serious injuries have been reported, the storm system continues its trajectory, placing parts of south Georgia and the Florida Panhandle under tornado watches throughout Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Northeast was beginning to thaw after a weeks-long stretch of uncommonly cold weather.
Boston was running nearly 7 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 14 Celsius) below average for February by midweek, and the city was on pace for its coldest winter in more than a decade. Boston remained cold on Sunday, but the week’s forecast called for temperatures climbing into the high 30s and low 40s, which is closer to the seasonal average.
Elsewhere in the U.S., parts of California were bracing for showers, thunderstorms and snow showers. Jacob Spender, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento, said a storm system was moving on shore in California throughout Sunday and through the week.
Heavy snow was forecast for elevated areas, Spender said.
“As we get up into the mountains and the foothills, we’re going to be looking at some snowfall,” Spender said. “So there will be snowfall all the way down into the foothills as well."
Spender said people should heed travel advisories in the coming days.
“So if they are traveling, packing winter safety kits. Anything to be prepared. This is a bigger system, and a major system,” Spender said.

Indonesia says 8,000 troops ready to deploy to Gaza by June as Trump touts effort

Indonesia says 8,000 troops ready to deploy to Gaza by June as Trump touts progress
US president says members of Board of Peace, meant to oversee the postwar Strip, pledging over $5 billion toward reconstruction and ‘thousands of personnel’ to oversee security
Indonesia’s military said on Sunday that up to 8,000 troops are expected to be ready by the end of June for a potential deployment in a humanitarian and peace mission to Gaza, as US President Donald Trump said countries had committed “thousands of personnel” to a postwar force for the Strip.
Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza envisions an International Stabilization Force overseeing the territory’s security as the Israel Defense Forces gradually withdraws. But Trump has struggled to get countries to commit soldiers to the mission, amid uncertainty over whether Hamas will agree to disarm and conflict will again escalate in the territory.
On Sunday, however, he broadcast optimism over the force coming together. The Board of Peace, chaired by Trump and meant to oversee postwar Gaza, will hold its first meeting on Thursday in Washington, DC.
Trump wrote on Truth Social that over $5 billion in pledges toward the reconstruction of Gaza will be announced at Thursday’s Washington summit.
The Times of Israel first revealed the planned donations last week, with two Arab diplomats saying that the US was aiming to announce donations from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Kuwait at around $1.25 billion each. The New York Times reported that the US is also planning on making a similar donation.
Trump said in his Sunday Truth Social post that the Thursday meeting will also see countries announce plans to contribute “thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force (ISF) and local police to maintain security and peace for Gazans.”
“Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization,” Trump said.
Hamas officials have denied ever making such a commitment and have pledged to hold on to their weapons.
The Indonesian commitment, first announced last week, marks a step forward for the peacekeeping force. Spokesperson Brig. Gen. Donny Pramono said the Indonesian National Armed Forces, known as TNI, has finalized its proposed troop structure and a timeline for their movement to Gaza, though the government has yet to decide when the deployment will take place.
“In principle, we are ready to be assigned anywhere,” Pramono told the AP. “Our troops are fully prepared and can be dispatched at short notice once the government gives formal approval.”
Pramono said the Indonesian military prepared a composite brigade of 8,000 personnel, based on decisions made during a February 12 meeting about the mission.
Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry has repeatedly said any Indonesian role in Gaza will be strictly humanitarian. Indonesia’s contribution would focus on civilian protection, medical services and reconstruction.
Indonesian troops would not take part in any combat operations or actions that could lead to direct confrontation with armed groups, making it unlikely that the country would play a meaningful role in the effort to get Hamas to disarm.
Under the Indonesian military’s schedule, troops will undergo health checks and paperwork throughout February, followed by a force readiness review at the end of the month, Pramono said. He also revealed that about 1,000 personnel are expected to be ready to deploy as an advance team by April, with the rest following by June.
Pramono said that being ready does not mean the troops will depart. The deployment still requires a political decision and depends on international mechanisms, he said. Last week, the Indonesian ministry denied reports in Israeli media that the deployment of Indonesian troops would be in southern Gaza’s Rafah and Khan Younis.
Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim-majority nation, does not have formal diplomatic relations with Israel and has long been a strong supporter of a two-state solution, which would see a Palestinian state established alongside Israel. It has been deeply involved in providing humanitarian aid to Gaza, including funding a hospital.
Indonesian officials have justified joining the Board of Peace by saying it was necessary to defend Palestinian interests from within, since Israel is included on the board but there is no Palestinian representation.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is due to attend the meeting of the board this week. His spokesman Prasetyo Hadi said last week that there would be negotiations before Indonesia paid the $1 billion being asked for permanent membership on the Board of Peace. He did not clarify whom the negotiations would be with.
The Southeast Asian country has experience in peacekeeping operations as one of the top 10 contributors to United Nations missions, including in Lebanon.
Addressing the UN General Assembly in September, Subianto said the world must respect Israel’s right to live in security, and ended his speech saying, “Shalom.”

Israel’s law shaped Trump’s historic recognition of Golan Heights - opinion
Unknown

“The State of Israel took control of the Golan Heights in 1967 to safeguard its security from external threats. I, Donald J. Trump, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim that the United States recognizes that the Golan Heights are part of the State of Israel.”
This was the text of the historic proclamation Trump issued as he stood next to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on March 25, 2019. In response to the president’s proclamation, the United Nations Press Office reported, “Most Security Council members expressed regret today over the decision by the United States to recognize Israel’s sovereignty over the Syrian Golan, stressing the importance of upholding international law, as the 15-member organ heard briefings on the situation in that occupied territory.”
Why was President Trump’s proclamation so controversial?
In the Six Day War of 1967, Israel, facing existential threats from Egypt, Jordan and Syria, heroically reclaimed its ancient biblical heartlands in a stunning display of resilience and strategy. This triumphant return to historic Jewish lands culminated in securing the Golan Heights from Syrian aggression, ensuring lasting security for Israel’s northern communities.
The world’s opposition to Israel’s control of the Golan Heights stems primarily from the post-World War II principle that the acquisition of territory by force, even in self-defense, is inconsistent with international law, as enshrined in the UN Charter and reinforced by resolutions like Security Council Resolution 497 (1981), which declared Israel’s annexation that year “null and void” and without legal effect.
Most nations see the Golan Heights as occupied territory
Most nations view the area as occupied Syrian territory, demanding withdrawal to the 1967 lines per Resolutions 242 and 338. Critics highlight ongoing settlement expansion, displacement of Syrians, and resource exploitation as violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention. Only the United States recognizes Israeli sovereignty, while the international community, including annual UN General Assembly votes, overwhelmingly rejects it.
A fascinating note to mark is that although most of the world assumes Israel annexed the Golan Heights, and did so illegally, the Jewish state never actually did. Instead, Israel extended its sovereignty to the Golan Heights. The difference between extending sovereignty and annexing is important and instructs Israel’s future policies.
In a 1994 piece for the Brooklyn Journal of International Law, Leon Sheleff explained that Israel’s 1981 Golan Heights Law, pushed through by prime minister Menachem Begin, never actually annexed the territory Israel took from Syria in 1967. Instead, it simply extended Israeli law, administration, and jurisdiction over the area.
Begin, still recovering from illness at the time, moved fast on this amid ongoing Syrian threats. Notice how the law itself carefully avoids the word “annexation,” a deliberate contrast to something like the explicit unification of Jerusalem.
Back then, after 1967, the Golan had almost no Syrian institutional footprint left. Most people had fled, and the remaining Druze communities were basically running things under their own customary rules. Applying Israeli law filled that empty space without forcing citizenship on anyone. Residents kept their Syrian nationality, and only a small number ever asked for Israeli citizenship voluntarily, a fact Israeli courts later confirmed.
Sheleff pointed out a larger distinction: Applying domestic law isn’t the same as extending sovereignty outright. He brings examples from international practice where laws get imposed on territory without transferring sovereignty, which fits with the rules against one-sided annexation of occupied land.
Philosophically, Begin refused to annex the Golan Heights because he maintained that a nation can’t annex land that has historically always been theirs. He included the Golan Heights in historically Jewish land and therefore felt it could not be annexed.
The economic Cooperation Foundation is a leading Israeli think-tank that was critical of Israel’s extension of sovereignty over the Golan Heights. It described the Israeli Golan law as unilaterally extending Israeli jurisdiction and administration to the Golan Heights. This effectively constituted an annexation of the territory that was occupied from Syria during the 1967 Six Day War.
Passed almost 40 years ago, it doesn’t seem likely that the Golan law will ever be reversed. The discussion over its legal significance seems largely academic, but in truth, it has significance in today’s discussions over other areas aside from the Golan that Israel took control over in 1967, including Judea and Samaria and even Gaza.
Opponents of an Israeli annexation of the other territories claim that Israel isn’t intending to annex these lands.
Instead, they claim, Jerusalem is planning to slowly extend sovereignty over these areas and follow the path taken in the Golan law. Regardless of whether that ever happens, they claim an expanding Israeli footprint in Judea and Samaria is creating de facto Israeli sovereignty.
Proponents of Israeli sovereignty over Judea and Samaria fall into two camps. There are those who campaign for immediate Israeli annexation of Judea and Samaria. Others follow Begin’s path and argue that Israel can’t annex Judea and Samaria because it is historically already Jewish land. They argue for a Golan-like extension of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria.
To summarize, despite widespread assumptions and international condemnation, Israel never formally annexed the Golan Heights in 1981. Instead, through the Golan Heights Law, it extended Israeli law, jurisdiction, and administration, a deliberate distinction allowing governance without explicit sovereignty transfer. This approach, rooted in security needs and historical claims, preserved diplomatic flexibility for potential peace negotiations while achieving de facto control.
President Trump’s 2019 recognition affirmed Israeli sovereignty amid ongoing threats, yet the nuanced legal framing continues to influence debates on whether to apply similar models to other territories like Judea and Samaria, balancing practical retention with sensitivities to international law.

Labour calls on Reform’s Matt Goodwin to reject aides’ ‘racist content’

Reform UK’s candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection must distance himself from “racist content” shared by members of his campaign team, the Labour party has said.
In a letter to Matt Goodwin, Lucy Powell, Labour’s deputy leader, said an investigation by the Manchester Mill revealed five separate members who had campaigned with Goodwin had shared racist content online and had expressed support for far-right groups.
Goodwin is hoping to become Reform UK’s ninth MP as he runs for the hotly contested seat in Manchester, where Labour’s 13,000-vote majority could be overturned by a Reform or Green candidate.
The report, which referenced research from the anti-fascist campaign group Hope Not Hate, highlighted social media posts by Goodwin’s interim campaign manager in Tameside, Adam Mitula. These included his suggestion that “60-70%” of transgender people were paedophiles, that he would “never touch a Jewish woman”, and his use of the n-word.
The Guardian also found tweets published by Mitula where he claimed there were “Muslim no go ghettos in the UK”. In addition, in response to a post on Black fathers, he wrote: “They are the best in leaving muims [sic] with no support. But those who care about families are very good people.”
The campaign manager also expressed support for the online influencer Andrew Tate, despite the fact Romanian and British authorities have been actively investigating Tate on suspicion of human trafficking and rape. In response to an interview with Tate by Piers Morgan, Mitula wrote in September of last year: “Well said by potentially future prime minister.”
The Mill also reported on another individual pictured campaigning with Goodwin, Kelly Cooling, who had allegedly shown her support for the far-right Britain First party last summer.
Alanna Vine, who has also been pictured with Goodwin during the campaign, was reportedly suspended by the Conservative party in 2022 for “social media posts which were deemed discriminatory towards those of the Islamic faith”, according to the Manchester Mill.
Goodwin’s campaign has been mired in controversy since he was announced as Reform’s candidate in late January. Just this week, he was accused of wanting a “Handmaid’s Tale future” after YouTube footage was discovered from 2024 in which he called for “young girls and women” to be given a “biological reality” check.
It has also emerged that Goodwin said last year it was “insane” that a man had been jailed for social media posts calling for people to “start the slaughter” of migrants.
Goodwin made the comment in December after Luke Yarwood, of Christchurch, Dorset, was jailed for 18 months for inciting racial hatred. The original post by Yarwood called for British people to head to hotels housing migrants and “burn them to the ground”.
Goodwin posted: “Welcome to the UK. Where you go to prison for 18 months for anti-immigration tweets. This is insane.”
In her letter, Powell said Goodwin may not have been aware of the comments “when they offered to help your campaign, but you are aware of it now”.
“You can ensure that they are not part of your campaign in the future, make clear that you disagree with their vile views, and state clearly that racism and conspiracism like this is not welcome in Reform and not compatible with campaigning for you,” the letter read.
“If you do not now distance yourself from the views of these supporters and take action to remove them from your campaign, people will conclude that you and Reform UK are happy to be associated with them.”
Reform UK and Mitula have been contacted for a response.

US ‘not disputing’ European assessment of Navalny poisoning, Rubio says
The secretary of state says Washington will not fight European partners on their findings as the UK considers new sanctions.
The United States says it is not disputing European findings that Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was poisoned with a rare frog toxin as the United Kingdom signals possible new sanctions against Moscow.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking during a visit to Slovakia on Sunday, called the European report “very troubling” and “very serious”.

- list 4 of 4Europeans say Russia poisoned dissident Alexey Navalny with dart frog toxin
The UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden on Saturday accused the Russian state of killing Navalny two years ago in a Siberian penal colony.
In a joint statement, the five countries said laboratory analysis of samples from his body found epibatidine, a toxin associated with South American dart frogs, and argued there was no innocent explanation for its presence.
The announcement, made almost exactly two years after Navalny’s death in February 2024, increases pressure on the Kremlin and raises the prospect of further coordinated Western action.
While Washington did not join the European statement, Rubio said the decision did not signal its disagreement.
“We don’t have any reason to question it,” Rubio said, adding that the US was not seeking “a fight” with its European partners over the findings.
UK threatens further sanctions
The UK warned that it was considering imposing further sanctions on Moscow.
Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC that the government would “continue to look at coordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime”.
“We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime,” she said.
The five European nations said epibatidine is not found naturally in Russia and Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the toxin while Navalny was imprisoned.
They said the findings underlined the need to hold Russia accountable under international conventions banning chemical and biological weapons.
Russia has denied any involvement. The Russian embassy in London dismissed the accusations as propaganda and questioned the credibility of Western experts.
Moscow has previously said Navalny died of natural causes and has not publicly detailed the circumstances.
Navalny, President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent domestic critic, died while serving a 19-year sentence on “extremism” and other charges he rejected as politically motivated.
His death prompted protests and memorials across European capitals and intensified Western scrutiny of Russia’s human rights record.
Any new sanctions would add to sweeping measures imposed on Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine four years ago, further straining relations between Moscow and Western governments.

Google reinstates popular Palestinian UpScrolled app after brief suspension
UpScrolled, a social media app developed by a Palestinian-Australian software engineer as an alternative to censorship on other platforms has been reinstated on the Google Play Store on Sunday after a suspension lasting approximately one day.
The app, launched by Issam Hijazi in June 2025 after accusations that TikTok was censoring pro-Palestinian content, has grown rapidly to over 2.5 million users, becoming one of the most widely downloaded apps on the Play Store and the App Store.
Many users began switching to UpScrolled when TikTok’s US operations were acquired by a consortium of pro-Israel investors.
It has marketed itself as a space free of the influence of billionaires and algorithms which engage in shadow-banning.
At one point downloads of UpScrolled surpassed those of TikTok in the US, the UK, and Australia and its servers were overwhelmed.
Google initially removed the app from the Play Store on Saturday without providing any explanation, and users searching for it received a “not found” message.
UpScrolled issued a statement sarcastically linking the ban to Valentine’s Day and saying it was working to resolve the issue with the Google Play team.
However, on Sunday, UpScrolled announced that it was back on Google.
"It's official… We're back together! Google Play reinstated," the platform said on the social media platform X.
While still marketing itself as a censorship-free space, UpScrolled has recently expanded its moderation team in response to criticisms that some harmful content was available on the app.

Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time and its medal count continues to climb at the Milan Cortina Games

It’s official: Host nation Italy is having its best Winter Olympics of all time.
Italy picked up four medals in quick succession on Sunday — two golds, a silver and a bronze — to reach 22 and surpass its previous best medal haul of 20, set more than 30 years ago at the Lillehammer Games in 1994.
And there are still seven days left of competition at the Milan Cortina Games.
Italy's cross-country team set the day off with bronze in the men's 4 x 7.5-kilometer relay, and then came a flurry of three medals in less than an hour.
Federica Brignone won an incredible second gold medal with a victory in the giant slalom, barely a month after returning to racing following a horrific injury last year.
Half an hour later, Michela Moioli and Lorenzo Sommariva finished second in the mixed team snowboard cross to pick up Italy’s 21st medal. Shortly after that, Lisa Vittozzi won gold in the 10-kilometer pursuit biathlon race.
“We are witnessing something historic, for our talented and extraordinary athletes,” local organizing committee president Giovanni Malagò said. "But this success makes us so happy also because we are reaping the fruits of years and years of hard work.”
The total is more than the target of 19 medals set by Italian Olympic Committee president Luciano Buonfiglio before the Games began.
The breakdown so far? Eight gold medals, four silver and 10 bronze.
In Lillehammer, Italy finished fourth in the final medal table — behind Russia, host nation Norway and Germany. At Milan Cortina, the Italians have consistently been in the top two, trailing Norway (24 medals) early on Sunday.
At the last Winter Olympics, in Beijing, Italy won 17 medals. It fared worse the last time it hosted the Games, collecting 11 in Turin in 2006.
The signs that Italy could do something special at its home games were there right from Day 3, when it had a record-breaking day on home snow and ice with a haul of six medals, the most the nation had ever won in a single day at the Winter Olympics.
“What an incredible day: Six medals in 24 hours at the Winter Olympics will go down in history,” Malagò said. “And what’s also incredible is the multidisciplinary nature of the medals. We have become a country that is capable of being competitive in sports where we have never been.
“That is fundamental in the Olympic program and in the final medal table. … I have always been of the opinion that the strength of a country can be seen in how many medals in different sports you manage to earn, not necessarily the number of golds.”
The stories behind some of the medals have added to the feel-good moment sweeping the country.
The 35-year-old Brignone skied through the pain to win gold in the women’s super-G on Thursday, following a year spent largely in rehab after breaking multiple bones in her leg.
Arianna Fontana, the most decorated short track speedskater of all time, won her 12th and 13th medals, equaling fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti’s record for most Olympic medals by an Italian athlete — a mark that has stood since 1960.
“We’re getting to see the Italian team do incredibly well. … I’ve been very fortunate to have gotten to witness Federica’s and Arianna’s golds, which were just incredible,” International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry said on Friday. “Their stories of resilience and fight and everything good in humanity was really showcased.
“Both athletes I have so much respect for … Arianna is now the most decorated Italian athlete, summer or winter Olympian. And to do that at home, it’s so cool. I’m so excited for her. And you could feel in the stadium yesterday, last night, just the passion and the love and the respect.”

Israeli cabinet approves West Bank land registration, Palestinians slam 'de-facto annexation'
Israel's cabinet on Sunday approved further measures to tighten Israel's control over the occupied West Bank and make it easier for settlers to buy land, in a move Palestinians called "a de-facto annexation".
The West Bank is among the territories that the Palestinians seek for a future independent state. Much of it is under Israeli military control, with limited Palestinian self-rule in some areas run by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA).
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing an election later this year, deems the establishment of any Palestinian state a security threat.
His ruling coalition includes many pro-settler members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, land captured in the 1967 Six-Day War following an illegal invasion.
Ministers voted in favour of beginning a process of land registration for the first time since 1967.
"We are continuing the revolution of settlement and strengthening our hold across all parts of our land," said Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right member of Netanyahu's government.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said land registration was a vital security measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for Israel in the area to "protect its citizens and safeguard national interests".
The cabinet claimed in a statement registration was an "appropriate response to illegal land registration processes promoted by the Palestinian Authority," and would end disputes.
The PA presidency rejected the cabinet's decision, saying it constitutes "a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity".
US President Donald Trump has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but his administration has not sought to curb Israel's accelerated settlement building, which the Palestinians say denies them a potential state by eating away at its territory.
The United Nations' highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible. Israel disputes this view, saying it has historical and biblical ties to the land.
The land registration adds to a series of measures taken earlier this month to expand control.

Tops Swiss diplomat says sure Russia wants to make step toward peace in Ukraine

GENEVA, February 15. /TASS/. Russia really wants to take a step toward peace in Ukraine, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis said, commenting on his talks with his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, in Moscow a week ago.
"After these talks, I got the impression that Russia really wants to take a step toward peace. The question is not whether it wants this, but at what price," he said in an interview with the SRF television channel.
"I think that if I had not visited Moscow a week ago, it would have been difficult to imagine that this meeting would now take place in Geneva," he said, referring to another round of talks on the Ukrainian settlement due to be held in Geneva on February 17 and 18.
On February 6, Lavrov held talks with Cassis, who arrived in Moscow in the capacity of Chairperson-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) along with OSCE Secretary General Feridun Sinirlioglu. The talks focused on ways to get out of the current profound crisis of the organization. The OSCE officials also raised the issue of the organization’s role in promoting dialogue on the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine.
On January 23, the first day of trilateral security consultations took place in Abu Dhabi. A second meeting was held on January 24. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces’ General Staff. The Ukrainian part of the trilateral working group was headed by National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov. The second round of trilateral talks were also held in Abu Dhabi on February 4 and 5. Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov announced another round of trilateral talks on Ukraine in Geneva on February 17 and 18. The Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Without Ukraine, discussions on European security are impossible – Poroshenko following the Munich Conference
Member of Parliament of Ukraine and leader of the European Solidarity party Petro Poroshenko said following the Munich Security Conference that discussions on Europe’s security situation without Ukraine are impossible.
“Both during the war, which must be stopped, and after the war, as the most powerful army on the continent – the Armed Forces of Ukraine – will remain a key factor for security on the continent,” he said in an interview with Polish broadcaster Slawa TV.
According to him, conference participants demonstrated a growing awareness of the risks associated with a potential reduction of the U.S. role in European security, while the dominant view in Munich was recognition of Ukraine’s key role in ensuring security on the continent.
“…if anyone raises the issue of the United States withdrawing from Europe, this would create a vacuum, and that vacuum would be filled. It would be filled by Russia through elements of hybrid warfare, support for radical left-wing and far-right regimes, and the use of democratic mechanisms to destroy democracy in Europe,” he stressed.
Poroshenko also underlined the importance of transatlantic unity.
“What unites us is not a shared history. What unites us is values. […] Therefore, the key result we must achieve is transatlantic unity,” he said.
The former president added that, in his view, Russia cannot be trusted.
“The only language Putin understands, and the one that can prevent further aggression, is the language of strength,” Poroshenko reiterated.
He noted that effective security guarantees for Ukraine require the presence of partner countries’ military contingents.
“What can stop a future attack by Putin? Not security guarantees if they are limited to weapons supplies, financing, and sanctions coordination. Security guarantees mean only one thing – boots on the ground. The presence of armed forces of partner countries on Ukrainian territory. This is the only thing that can stop Putin from attacking,” Poroshenko said.
Poroshenko also stressed that Ukraine’s accelerated accession to NATO remains relevant, and that allied support is essential during the transition period.

Israeli woman arrested in Italy at Russia’s request

Police in Italy have arrested an Israeli woman at Milan’s airport at Russia’s request over a role she allegedly held during the country’s 2018 elections, according to Russian independent media and her husband.
The independent Russian outlet SVTV reported Saturday that security services at Milan’s airport confirmed the arrest.
In an anonymous Facebook post seeking legal and diplomatic assistance, the woman’s husband described the case as political persecution. He said Russian authorities declared her wanted over her role on a local election commission during the 2018 vote.
“We knew a criminal case had been opened against her after she left Russia in 2022 and that she had been placed on an international wanted list,” he wrote.
According to the husband, she was declared wanted after failing to appear for a court hearing. After she left Russia and moved with him to Israel, where the couple obtained citizenship, an international arrest warrant was issued, he said.
“I desperately need assistance on this matter — who to contact and what to do in this situation?” he wrote.
He said the couple had traveled to Europe twice since leaving Russia without incident. The situation changed during a visit to Lithuania, where customs officials informed the woman that Russia was seeking her and warned the couple. However, he said, they were reassured that they could move freely within Europe without fear.
She was later detained at Milan’s airport, he said.
Human rights activists condemned the arrest, calling it political persecution. Activists who spoke to the independent outlet Port said they had attempted to contact officials at Milan’s airport but were refused information about the reasons for the detention and were referred instead to the Russian consulate.

Trump says Board of Peace members pledged over $5B for Gaza

U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that countries in the Board of Peace will commit more than $5 billion for Gaza’s rebuilding and humanitarian relief at a meeting scheduled for Thursday.
In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Trump wrote that member states have also committed thousands of personnel toward a U.N.-authorized stabilization force and local police in the Palestinian enclave.
The U.S. president said Thursday's gathering, the first official meeting of the group, will take place at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, which the State Department recently renamed after the president.
Delegations from more than 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend. The board's creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of the Trump administration's plan to end Israel’s war on Gaza.
Rebuilding the Palestinian territory will be a daunting endeavor. The United Nations, World Bank and European Union estimate that reconstruction of the territory will cost $70 billion. Few places in the Gaza Strip were left unscathed by more than two years of Israeli bombardment.
Israel and Hamas agreed to the plan last year with a ceasefire officially taking effect in October, although Israel continued attacks in Gaza, killing more than 590 Palestinians since. Israel’s brutal war on the blockaded enclave killed more than 71,000 people, mostly women and children, since Oct. 7, 2023.
The ceasefire deal calls for an armed international stabilization force to keep security and ensure the disarming of Hamas, a key demand of Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu previously warned Hamas would be disarmed "the easy way or the hard way, but it will happen."
Hamas has not publicly committed to disarmament, though senior official Khaled Meshal recently suggested the group intends to retain its weapons, stating: "As long as there's an occupation, there's resistance," while adding that armed action against Israel may not be likely "in the next 10 to 15 years."
Thus far, few countries have expressed interest in taking part in the proposed force. Indonesia has said up to 8,000 troops are expected to ready by the end of June for a potential deployment in Gaza. It would be the first country to formally commit troops to the security mission created under Trump’s board.
It is not clear how many of the more than 20 members of the Board of Peace will attend the first meeting. Netanyahu, who held White House talks with Trump last week, is not expected to be there.
While regional Middle East powers including Türkiye, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Israel, as well as emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious.
Trump's new board was first seen as a mechanism focused on ending the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. But it has taken shape with his ambition for a far broader mandate of resolving global crises and appears to be the latest U.S. effort to sidestep the United Nations as Trump aims to reset the post-World War II international order.

Rallies held across the world in support of Iran’s anti-government protesters

Hundreds of thousands of people have taken part in rallies around the world to show their solidarity with anti-government demonstrators in Iran whose continued protests have been met with brutal and deadly repression.
On Saturday, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah, addressed a crowd of 200,000 people in Munich, telling them he was ready to lead the country to a “secular democratic future”.
Pahlavi urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrating, calling on them to chant slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8pm (4.30pm UK time) on Saturday and Sunday to coincide with the protests in Germany and elsewhere.
Thousands more people took part in solidarity demonstrations in cities including Los Angeles, Washington, Toronto, Tel Aviv, Lisbon, Sydney and London.
Washington is preparing for a fresh round of talks with Iranian government representatives in Geneva this week despite Trump’s insistence that a change of power in Tehran would be the “best thing”.
Pahlavi – who is based in the US and who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy – told the crowd in Munich that he could lead a democratic handover.
“I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future,” he said. “I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box.”
One protester, a 62-year-old who is originally from Iran and gave his named only as Said, told Agence France-Presse (AFP): “The Iranian regime is a dead regime. It must be game over.”
Speaking on Friday as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on Tehran, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.
Trump had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
Although Trump had initially said the US was “locked and loaded” to help demonstrators when the government crackdown began, he has since focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck last June during Israel’s 12-day war with Iran.
Representatives of Iran and the US, which have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the 1979 revolution, held talks on the nuclear programme last week in Oman.
On Sunday, a Swiss foreign ministry spokesperson told AFP that Oman would host talks in Geneva next week.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans despite the crackdown, as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists’ News Agency, at least 7,010 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the crackdown, though they and other rights groups say the toll is likely far higher. It said more than 53,845 people had been arrested.
The Iranian opposition remains divided and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel and making a highly publicised visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father’s autocratic rule.

Zelenskyy: "I'm younger than Putin, he doesn't have much time"
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stressed that he is younger than Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin and that Putin "does not have much time".
Source: Zelenskyy in an interview with Politico at the Munich Security Conference
Quote: "I think Putin is also in a difficult position, because I can speak with you and shake hands, I'm not afraid, I want to be free…
I'm here, you see. I'm a free person. And I'm younger than Putin. Believe me, this is important. He does not have much time. Not much time, God bless."
Details: Speaking about possible elections in Ukraine, Zelenskyy said that 90% of Ukrainians oppose elections being held during the war.
"It's interesting that 90% [of Ukrainians – ed.] are against elections now. If anyone is interested in what Ukrainians think," he said.
"If President Trump gives me, by pushing Putin, a ceasefire for two-three months, we will do elections," Zelenskyy promised.
Asked how exactly Trump should exert pressure on Putin, Zelenskyy named three steps: ensure Ukraine has strong security guarantees, provide a recovery package, and call Putin to tell him to "stop where you are now".
Quote: "But if Putin says 'no', President Trump has to give us everything we need to save ourselves and defend ourselves and stay strong. But I think that we need to finish the war, not continue fighting."

UK's new ammunition factory for Ukraine unable to start operations for over six months
According to Ukrinform, The Guardian stated this in an article.
The new plant in Wales, considered crucial for increasing the UK's ammunition production, has not been operational for over half a year after its planned launch date. The explosives factory in Glascoed, South Wales, was expected to increase the UK's artillery shell production capacity sixteenfold, replenishing domestic stocks and boosting supplies for Ukraine.
The Guardian found that production was supposed to begin last summer but has still not started. BAE Systems, the company operating the plant, confirmed the delay, explaining that it was caused by a 2025 mid-construction decision to double the factory's production capacity.
The UK aims to sharply expand its domestic explosives production to reduce reliance on other countries for ammunition. Previously, BAE Systems imported RDX explosives, used in artillery shells, from the U.S. and France.
The delay is also linked to government hesitations over increasing defense spending amid warnings that the British Armed Forces could face a GBP 28 billion funding shortfall over the next four years.
As previously reported, defense companies worldwide have increased weapons production due to Russia's war against Ukraine, but shortages of raw materials and long manufacturing cycles continue to limit the replenishment of stockpiles and meeting Ukraine's needs.

Türkiye slams Israeli plan for land registration in occupied West Bank

01:43:37 KST

Türkiye on Sunday strongly condemned Israel's new decision on land registration in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of international law.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move aims to impose Israel’s “authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities."
"This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel's unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void," the ministry said.
"Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories," the ministry added, saying that the expansionist policies pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government undermine peace efforts and damage prospects for a two-state solution.
Backing two-state solution
Türkiye called on the international community to take a firm stance against Israeli attempts to create facts on the ground.
The ministry said Türkiye will continue to support efforts to "establish an independent, sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” daily Israel Hayom said ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.

There’s no end in sight to Starmer’s struggles | Letters

What a great editorial (The Guardian view on Starmer’s trust crisis: it is unlikely to be managed away, 13 February). Your statement that the prime minister has “learned nothing and forgotten nothing” sums up much of his and our present situation. He was put where he is now by apparatchiks who failed to suggest that without any vision he would be at the mercy of people who would tug him to and fro – which they have. This weakness – which was shared by Boris Johnson, and why Dominic Cummings called Johnson “the Trolley” – means few people have any reason to trust him.
That Starmer’s judgment is flawed is demonstrated by the number of U-turns that he has been forced to make. I heard somebody on Radio 4 saying that Starmer “emanates blandness”. On the benches behind him are many stronger people. He needs to be ditched before the country is totally shrouded in gloom.

Your analysis of Keir Starmer’s probable slide out of power quotes his use of the word “fight”. He was well trained by Morgan McSweeney to appear aggressive. But aggression is for opposition. A prime minister should look to govern, aiming for communal unity. As you say, Starmer has learned nothing, instead bigging up the opposition. He has chosen a foolhardy path that will lead him, and perhaps his party, to oblivion.
Andy Jordan
Wirksworth, Derbyshire
As so often, John Harris illuminates the thoughts and feelings of disappointed and sceptical voters, and the political and ethical vacuum at the heart of the McSweeney-Starmer project (Politicians ‘don’t live how we live’, voters tell me, 8 February).
The Starmer government’s disdain not just for critics of Peter Mandelson’s privileged lifestyle and friendships, but for advocates of anything resembling principled leftwing policies, has been responsible for numerous missteps that seem to confirm the “Politicians are all the same” narrative. This applies as much to the international as the domestic sphere.
We should not forget that the main argument (accepted by both Labour and the Tories) for appointing Mandelson as ambassador to Washington was the perceived need to appease Donald Trump. Let’s hope that the Mandelson-Epstein scandal will prompt not just a procedural inquiry into who knew what and when, but also a reckoning with Labour’s overriding obeisance to Trump and his foreign policy.
Dr Chris Sinha
Cringleford, Norfolk
A few of us predicted Starmerism would end, but not in the way that Owen Jones thinks (The left warned that Starmerism would end like this. Now all of Britain faces the fallout, 9 February). Labour’s left wing, the biggest election-losing machine in the party’s history, has lost no time in getting its knives deployed into Keir Starmer’s back.
One expects confected outrage from the opposition to, well, anything, but it is particularly damaging when the party itself is publicly intent on destroying its leader – particularly one who is barely a year into delivering a huge programme of national renewal. If there was ever a time for the left and its supporters to keep their own counsel, this is it, because the only winners out of the current furore will be Reform UK.

Europe aims to rely less on US defence after Trump’s Greenland push
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen reflected a feeling of profound change among European leaders at last weekend’s Munich Security Conference when she said: “Some lines have been crossed that cannot be uncrossed any more.”
Transatlantic ties have already been strained over the past year by US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House. But Mr Trump’s push to annex Greenland
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered limited reassurance to Europeans in his speech at the conference.
He said the US wanted to work with Europe,
With the war about to enter its fifth year and Moscow viewed as an increasing threat by its European neighbours, leaders from the continent declared they would accelerate efforts to boost their own defences and rely less on the US.
That, in theory, puts them on the same page as Mr Trump. His administration says it expects Europe to take primary responsibility for the conventional defence of the continent in the coming years. In return, Washington will keep its nuclear umbrella over Europe and uphold NATO’s mutual defence pact.
A ‘European pillar’ of NATO
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged their commitment in Munich to a stronger “European pillar” within NATO.
But a stronger home-grown defence is also a hedge against Mr Trump or a future US leader deciding not to defend Europe.
“This new beginning is right under all circumstances. It is right if the United States continues to distance itself. It is right as long as we cannot guarantee our own security on our own,” Mr Merz said at the conference on Feb 13.
In another sign of the nervousness surrounding US security commitments, Mr Merz said he had begun talks with Mr Macron about a European nuclear deterrence.
France holds the only truly independent nuclear deterrent in Europe, since Britain’s Trident nuclear missiles are made and maintained by the US.
Will deeds match words?
The big question for Europe and its leaders is whether they can match their words with deeds – to buy and develop new weapons systems, to fill gaps in their arsenals in areas such as long-range missiles, and to coordinate their work.
The signs so far are mixed. Driven by fears of Russia and Mr Trump’s exhortations, European countries have boosted defence spending.
NATO members agreed in 2025 to raise spending on core defence from 2 per cent of gross domestic product to 3.5 per cent, with a further 1.5 per cent to be spent on other security-related investments.
European defence spending has risen nearly 80 per cent since before the war in Ukraine began, Dr von der Leyen said at the Munich conference.
European countries are forming consortia to build complex weapons systems. Defence ministers from France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Sweden signed a letter of intent on Feb 12 to advance work on the European Long-range Strike Approach, a project to develop “deep strike” missiles.
On the sidelines of a NATO defence ministers’ meeting on Feb 12, coalitions of European countries agreed to work together on four projects, including ballistic missile defence and air-launched munitions.
Projects struggle due to squabbles
But some high-profile pan-European projects have struggled to get off the ground. The future of the FCAS French-German-Spanish fighter jet project has been in the balance for months, with the partners unable to agree on the share of work for the companies involved.
Debates on European Union defence projects have seen wrangling over whether they should be limited to EU companies or open to others.
France has been the strongest advocate to “buy European” provisions, while the likes of Germany and the Netherlands argue for a more open approach.
Amid the debates at the swanky Bayerischer Hof hotel, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky brought home the reality of modern war, surrounded by giant screens showing images and statistics of Russian attacks. In January alone, Ukraine was attacked by over 6,000 drones and 150 missiles. “During this war, weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them,” he told the delegates. REUTERS

Regarding your report (Lake District village struggles to find GP – despite ad pledging ‘we’ll never run out of beer’, 11 February), Coniston’s situation is not a question of marketing flair but of structural pressure in rural general practice.
Findings from a recent survey of our member doctors working in rural and remote areas underline the scale of the challenge. One in four doctors told us that working in a single-handed practice has negatively affected their wellbeing or contributed to burnout.
A striking 71% believe rural and remote healthcare is not properly understood by government and policymakers. Doctors have told us that there is a “lack of rural-proofing policy”, with services increasingly centralised and general practice described as “defunded and salami-sliced”. Others describe the pressure of covering wide areas with limited staff and patients who face long journeys to access secondary care.
Rural general practice remains professionally rewarding. But unless policy reflects the realities of isolation, workload and access, recruitment campaigns alone will not secure its future.

Community energy’s success depends on more than money | Letter

Ed Miliband’s £1bn pledge for community energy is a landmark moment (9 February), but its success depends on more than the size of the cheque.
As our Community Energy Citizen Science project shows, the transition is powered by “quiet labour”. Volunteers do the heavy lifting at kitchen tables, translating complex policy into practical advice and managing the invisible burdens of governance and safeguarding.
There is a disconnect between government rhetoric on “cheap local power” and the regulatory reality. To bridge this gap, we must move beyond short-term grants for physical infrastructure, such as heat pumps or solar panels, and provide long-term funding for the people behind it. Without stable support, vital local knowledge is lost each time a contract ends.
Ultimately, this is a social project. One resident who was able to secure insulation and heating said that she was simply glad to be able to sit and sew in a warm room. If this funding is to be transformative, it must value the persistence and care required to ensure the transition is locally rooted and leaves no one behind.

Sir Ian McKellen opens up about mortality after stage fall
- Sir Ian McKellen has reflected on mortality, stating that "death is ever present" two years after his fall from the stage during a West End performance.
- The 86-year-old actor sustained wrist and neck injuries after losing his footing during a fight scene in the play Player Kings at the Noel Coward Theatre in June 2024.
- McKellen was forced to withdraw from the production following medical advice, despite hoping to return to the stage.
- He shared that the incident led him to accept his own mortality and feel "shame" for letting down the production, reliving the fall multiple times.
- Despite the accident, McKellen is promoting an experimental VR production and will reprise his role as Gandalf in the upcoming Lord of the Rings film, The Hunt for Gollum.

French rape survivor Pelicot says mindsets need to change
On the eve of her memoir’s release, Gisele Pelicot gives candid interviews about the druggings and rapes that shocked the world
Mindsets need to change in the fight against sexual violence, according to Gisele Pelicot, who was repeatedly drugged, abused and offered to strangers for rape by her then husband over nearly 10 years.
“I believe this can only be achieved through education and through respect and empathy for one another,” the 73-year-old French woman told the news portal of German public broadcaster ZDF in an interview published on Sunday. “We must continue this fight. We must not relent.”
Pelicot became a feminist icon in France due to her resolute stance and her decision not to conduct the trial behind closed doors.
“I believe that this trial has heightened society’s awareness of how men treat women,” Pelicot told ZDF. She said it brought many things to light.
“This continues to this day, as every day we see the tragedies associated with chemical submission.”
The term “chemical submission” in French refers to the malicious drugging with medication or drugs.

Off-trail avalanche kills 2 and injures 1 in northern Italy
Italian officials say an off-trail avalanche has killed two skiers and injured another on Italy's side of Mont Blanc
- Bookmark
An off-trail avalanche killed two skiers and injured another on Sunday on the Italian side of the Mont Blanc massif, near the border between France and Switzerland, officials said.
At least three skiers were caught up in Sunday morning’s avalanche in the Couloir Vesses, a well-known freeride route in Courmayeur, in the upper Val Veny, according to Italy's Alpine Rescue.
One of the victims was taken to a hospital in serious condition but later died, the agency said. Fifteen rescuers, three canine units and two helicopters took part in the search and rescue efforts.
Courmayeur, a town with about 2,900 inhabitants, is some 200 kilometers (124 miles) northwest of Milan, one of the venues hosting the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.
Another person was partially buried by an avalanche in Trentino, but was rescued by his companions, authorities reported Sunday.
A record 13 backcountry skiers, climbers and hikers died in the Italian mountains over a week ending Feb. 8, Alpine Rescue said last Monday, including 10 in avalanches triggered by an exceptionally unstable snowpack.
Fresh snowfall during recent storms and wind-swept snowcaps on weak internal layers have created especially risky conditions along the entire Alpine crescent bordering France, Switzerland and Austria, Alpine Rescue said.

Powered by women, ‘Wuthering Heights’ digs up $34.8 million at the box office for a No. 1 debut
Emerald Fennell’s new “Wuthering Heights” has opened in first place at the North American box office
- Bookmark
Emerald Fennell’s bold reimagining of “Wuthering Heights” brought crowds of women to movie theaters this weekend. The Warner Bros. release topped the box office charts and nabbed the title for the year’s biggest opening with $34.8 million in ticket sales in its first three days in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. According to PostTrak polling, an estimated 76% of those ticket buyers were women. By the end of Monday's Presidents Day holiday, the total could rise to $40 million from its 3,682 locations.
The romantic drama starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as the star-crossed Catherine and Heathcliff, won out over the weekend’s other newcomers, including the animated “GOAT” and the heist thriller “Crime 101.” “Wuthering Heights” is also performing even better internationally, where it’s expecting to rake in an additional $42 million from 76 territories.
The Warner Bros./MRC production cost a reported $80 million to produce, not accounting for the millions spent on marketing and promotion. If the four-day totals match the estimates, that makes for a strong $82 million global debut. And the film still has several big openings on the horizon, in Japan and Vietnam on Feb. 27, and in China on March 13.
Fennell’s version of “Wuthering Heights,” which takes many liberties with Emily Brontë’s novel, largely divided critics. It’s currently sitting at a mixed 63% on Rotten Tomatoes. While that didn’t dissuade audiences from buying tickets, only 51% of the opening weekend audience said that they would “definitely recommend” the film to friends. Moviegoers also gave it a less-than-stellar B CinemaScore.
The mid-February weekend has hosted big superhero movies on occasion, including “Black Panther” and “Deadpool,” but a more relevant comparison is “Fifty Shades of Grey” and its two sequels. The first movie opened to over $85 million, the third to $38.6 million.
“GOAT,” an animated Sony release produced by basketball star Stephen Curry, landed in second place with an estimated $26 million from 3,863 locations. It's projected to bring in another $6 million on Monday, which would bring its four day total to $32 million — the biggest animated debut since “Elemental” in 2023. It also pulled in $15.6 million internationally, bringing its global total to $47.6 million.
The family-friendly film was the only new opener of the weekend to get an A CinemaScore. Sony Pictures Animation was also behind “KPop Demon Hunters.”
“Crime 101” made an estimated $15.1 million in its first three days. Amazon MGM Studios opened the Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo led Los Angeles-set thriller in 3,161 theaters. It’s expected to pull in about $17.8 million by the end of Monday, but the movie has a long way to go to even hit its production budget, which reportedly exceeded $90 million. Audiences, who were 56% men, also gave “Crime 101” a B CinemaScore.
Further down the charts was Briarcliff Entertainment’s sci-fi comedy “Good Luck, Have Fun, Don’t Die,” starring Sam Rockwell and Haley Lu Richardson. It made an estimated $3.6 million from 1,610 locations.
The Walt Disney Studios also celebrated a milestone this weekend, becoming the first studio to cross $1 billion at the global box office in 2026, driven almost entirely by “Avatar: Fire and Ash,” but also helped by the continued success of “Zootopia 2,” which remains in the top 10 after twelve weekends in theaters.

The UN says al-Hol camp population has dropped sharply as Syria moves to relocate remaining families
The U.N. refugee agency says residents are leaving Syria’s al-Hol camp in large numbers, and Syrian authorities plan to relocate those who remain
- Bookmark
The U.N. refugee agency said Sunday that a large number of residents of a camp housing family members of suspected Islamic State group militants have left and the Syrian government plans to relocate those who remain.
Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, UNHCR's representative in Syria, said in a statement that the agency “has observed a significant decrease in the number of residents in Al-Hol camp in recent weeks."
“Syrian authorities have informed UNHCR of their plan to relocate the remaining families to Akhtarin camp in Aleppo Governorate (province) and have requested UNHCR’s support to assist the population in the new camp, which we stand ready to provide,” he said.
He added that UNHCR “will continue to support the return and reintegration of Syrians who have departed Al-Hol, as well as those who remain.”
The statement did not say how residents had left the camp or how many remain. Many families are believed to have escaped either during the chaos when government forces captured the camp from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces last month or afterward.
There was no immediate statement from the Syrian government and a government spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
At its peak after the defeat of IS in Syria in 2019, around 73,000 people were living at al-Hol. Since then, the number has declined with some countries repatriating their citizens. The camp’s residents are mostly children and women, including many wives or widows of IS members.
The camp’s residents are not technically prisoners and most have not been accused of crimes, but they have been held in de facto detention at the heavily guarded facility.
Forces of Syria’s central government captured the al-Hol camp on Jan. 21 during a weekslong offensive against the SDF, which had been running the camp near the border with Iraq for a decade. A ceasefire deal has since ended the fighting.
Separately, thousands of accused IS militants who were held in detention centers in northeastern Syria have been transferred to Iraq to stand trial under an agreement with the U.S.
The U.S. military said Friday that it had completed the transfer of more than 5,700 adult male IS suspects from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody.
Iraq’s National Center for International Judicial Cooperation said a total of 5,704 suspects from 61 countries who were affiliated with IS — most of them Syrian and Iraqi — were transferred from prisons in Syria. They are now being interrogated in Iraq.

Mikaela Shiffrin's giant slalom at Milan Cortina ended without a medal but plenty of optimism
Mikaela Shiffrin sees her 11th-place giant slalom at the Milan Cortina Olympics as proof she is back in the fight
- Bookmark
Mikaela Shiffrin stood at the start gate atop the giant slalom course at sun-splashed Tofane and made a promise to herself.
“I’m going to do this whole thing here,” she said.
Considering the path the American star has taken to reach the Milan Cortina Olympics, and to this event in particular, that was enough.
So while the leaderboard near the finish line during Sunday's GS needed to flip to the second page before Shiffrin's name appeared in 11th, the most decorated skier in the history of the sport didn't view her finish as a disappointment.
Disappointment is washing out, which she did four years ago in Beijing. Disappointment is wondering if the speed that once came so easily would ever return while recovering from a harrowing crash during a World Cup start in Killington, Vermont, in late 2024 that left her abdomen punctured and her confidence shaken.
What happened during what Shiffrin called “the greatest show of GS skiing we've had in a really long time” was not disappointment. If anything, it was the opposite.
Yes, Shiffrin finished outside the top 10. The way the snow felt underneath her skis and the razor-thin margin that separated the silver medalists from the chasing pack — there was no catching Italy's Federica Brignone on this day — offered evidence she's trending in the right direction heading into slalom, her best event, on Wednesday.
“To be here now like within touch of the fastest women, that’s huge for me,” Shiffrin said. “So I’m proud of that.”
The gap between Shiffrin and co-runners-up Sara Hector of Sweden and Thea Louise Stjernesund was an impossibly tight 0.3 seconds in a discipline that requires skiers to make two runs.
When Shiffrin won gold in the GS in Pyeongchang eight years ago, the gap between silver and 11th was around 1.4 seconds. Four years ago in Beijing, it was nearly 2 seconds. Three weeks ago at a World Cup event in Czechia, where Shiffrin earned her first podium in the GS in two years, it was over 3 1/2 seconds.
On Sunday, Shiffrin was right there. A turn here. A turn there. On a course that was a little flatter and a little less technically demanding that what Shiffrin and the rest of the best skiers in the world usually see — one almost explicitly designed to create a safe and ultracompetitive race — the difference between a medal and the middle was nearly imperceptible.
Shiffrin promised to “learn” after slogging down through the slalom in the women's combined last week, when her skis couldn't seem to “go.” Perhaps too aware of the perception of an Olympic slump — the Games are the only place she hasn't won in the last eight years — she did her best to refocus and block out the noise.
In her mind, she did just that. She could feel herself taking power from the course. As “Killing In The Name Of” by Rage Against the Machine blasted over the speakers during her second run, Shiffrin felt like she was in the moment and not in her head.
“It felt good to push, which was amazing,” she said, later adding: “It felt really good to ski high intensity.”
Shiffrin's intensity feels as if it is slowly but steadily ramping up. She wore bib No. 3, a nod to the fact she's back in the top 7 in the world in the GS, something she considered a “challenging task” when the season began. It's become doable, but Shiffrin has learned progress isn't linear.
While she continues to dominate slalom — in which she's already clinched her ninth World Cup series title with two races to go — GS is another matter. Sure, Shiffrin's 22 career GS victories are a record. But she hasn't won a GS race since late 2023.
Her climb back up the GS rankings has been fueled by consistency. The “lights-out speed” she knows is required to finish atop the podium doesn't come quite as easily as it did when she was at the peak of her powers. That's fine.
“The task ahead of me for the coming months (and) in the coming years is to try to bring that kind of intensity and fire and to continue to work with the team to find those hundredths (of a second) that it takes to actually win races,” she said.
That didn't happen under the snowcapped peaks of the Dolomites on Sunday. Maybe on another course, one with a more difficult setup that would allow her to lean in to her experience, things may have played out differently.
It's not a conversation Shiffrin seems particularly interested in having. The layout allowed for competitive racing. And she pointed to the medal stand — where the 35-year-old Brignone won her second gold in four days and Hector added silver to go with the gold she captured in Beijing in 2022 — as proof the results were not fluky.
“It wasn’t like somebody won who wasn’t supposed to win,” Shiffrin said.
Brignone emerged as a deserving champion. Behind her, however, was chaos. Shiffrin doesn't think that's a bad thing.
“(We were all) close and that’s how that’s how high the competition level, is I think,” she said. “That’s a beautiful show of our sport on an Olympic stage.”

US forces board second Venezuela‑linked oil tanker in Indian Ocean

US military forces boarded another sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an effort to target illicit oil connected to Venezuela, the Pentagon said on Sunday.
Venezuela had faced US sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure the president, Nicolás Maduro, before Maduro was apprehended in January during a US military operation.
Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast after the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The defense department said in a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding”.
The Pentagon said: “The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away,. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down.”
Video posted by the Pentagon showed US troops boarding the tanker.
The Veronica III is a Panamanian-flagged vessel under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the website of the Treasury department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control.
The Veronica III left Venezuela on 3 January, the same day as Maduro’s capture, with nearly 2m barrels of crude and fuel oil, TankerTrackers.com posted on Sunday on X.
“Since 2023, she’s been involved with Russian, Iranian and Venezuelan oil,” the organisation said.
Samir Madani, the co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, told the Associated Press in January that his organisation used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document that at least 16 tankers left the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its efforts to take control of Venezuela’s oil. The Pentagon did not say whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under US control. It told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond its post.
Last week, the US military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II. The ship was being held while its fate was decided by the US, according to a defence official who spoke last week.

UK considers new Russia sanctions after Navalny frog toxin finding

01:29:34 KST

The UK is mulling fresh sanctions against Moscow after pinning blame on the Kremlin for the poisoning of the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, Yvette Cooper has suggested.
The Foreign Office and four of the UK’s allies – Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands – announced on Saturday they had determined that Navalny’s death was most likely the result of poisoning using dart frog toxin arranged by the Russian state.
The Russian embassy in London has denied Moscow was involved in Navalny’s death two years ago in a Siberian penal colony and described the announcement as illustrating the “feeblemindedness of western fabulists”.
In a rebuke on the BBC’s Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg programme, Cooper, the foreign secretary, said the accusation against Russia was “deeply serious” and a product of two years of evidence gathering.
She said: “Only the Russian regime had the means, the motive and the opportunity to administer this poison while he was in a Russian prison.”
Analysis of samples from Navalny’s body revealed the presence of a toxin called epibatidine, which is produced by dart frogs in South America. The UK and its allies said Navalny could not have ingested the poison accidentally as it is not found in Russia and is generally produced only by the frogs in the wild.
The five European countries have reported the Kremlin to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons after accusing Moscow of breaching its conventions.
Cooper said the incident showed that “the cold war peace dividend we all believed in and hoped for has gone, and we need to be ready for Russian aggression continuing towards Europe”.
She suggested further sanctions could follow. “We continue to look at coordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime. As you know, we have been pursuing this as part of our response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, where we are also coming up to the fourth anniversary of that invasion as well.
“We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime.”
Noting that the government would continue to provide military support to Ukraine and remain vigilant towards other different, hybrid threats, Cooper added: “The other thing that I would say, specifically about Alexei Navalny, is one of the things he said was ‘tell the truth, spread the truth’, because that is the most dangerous weapon of all.”
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Sunday that Washington had no reason to question the “troubling” conclusions of the five European allies.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” Rubio told reporters at a news conference in Bratislava during a visit to Slovakia.
When asked why the US had not joined the five countries in making a statement on their findings, Rubio said this was an endeavour by them. “Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. [It] doesn’t mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn’t our endeavour. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing based on the intelligence they’ve gathered.”
He added: “We’re not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there.”
The UK’s shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, warned of an “axis of authoritarianism” comprising Russia, China, North Korea and Iran faced by the UK and other western nations.
Speaking on Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme in advance of making a speech at the Munich Security Conference, the senior Conservative said the US remained a “natural ally” and partner for European powers.
A statement from the Russian embassy in London denied any involvement in Navalny’s death. It said: “There is no reason whatsoever to credit such ‘findings’ by western ‘experts’. As with the Skripal case, there are strident accusations, media hysteria, zero evidence, and a host of questions the accusers would rather ignore. So what was it in the end – poison derived from the skin of a South American frog or novichok?
“We have become accustomed to the feeblemindedness of western fabulists. One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog. Yet what truly shocks is the method now favoured by western politicians – necro-propaganda. This is not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace – a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign.”

Rumen Radev to Reveal Coalition Partners and Program by March 4 Ahead of Early Elections
Former president Rumen Radev said he will announce the structure, name and program of the political formation with which he will take part in the upcoming early elections no later than March 4. By that date, the coalition will be officially registered with the Central Election Commission, in line with all statutory deadlines.

Radev explained that there is not enough time to establish and register a new political party before the vote. For this reason, he will run as part of a coalition made up of already registered parties. He confirmed this both in Bulgaria and during a meeting with the Bulgarian community in Berlin, stressing that participation in the elections is guaranteed. He declined to name the parties involved at this stage, citing concerns over possible pressure and last-minute obstruction.

According to Radev, his decision to withhold details is motivated by what he described as a “captured judicial system” and the risk of targeted actions against his partners. He argued that premature disclosure could lead to attempts to block the coalition’s participation through institutional or legal mechanisms. For this reason, he said, the names of coalition partners, candidates and coordinators will be announced only when all legal procedures are completed.
Radev added that a broad group of supporters is forming around his initiative, united by the goal of dismantling what he called an entrenched oligarchic model of governance. While acknowledging public expectations about his electoral prospects, he said the outcome should be left to voters rather than predictions.
He also confirmed that the coalition’s political program will be presented together with the official registration. On the same date, March 4, Radev plans to open a public bank account through which citizens will be able to provide voluntary financial support. He noted that even now he is receiving messages from people across the country expressing willingness to back the initiative.
Radev underlined that all steps will be taken strictly within the framework of Bulgarian law and electoral rules, insisting that the coalition will appear fully prepared and formally compliant once the registration deadline is reached.

The Palestinian Authority on Sunday warned that an Israeli government decision to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” amounts to a “de facto annexation” of the occupied territory and a violation of international law.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Wafa, the Authority said the Israeli move constitutes “a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions” and poses a threat to security and stability.
It described the measure as a “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian land” and an official launch of annexation plans aimed at consolidating the occupation through illegal settlement expansion.
It also constitutes “a termination of the signed agreements and clearly contradicts the resolutions of the UN Security Council, especially Resolution 2334, which considers all settlement activity in the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal.”
The Authority stressed that unilateral Israeli actions “would not confer legitimacy over Palestinian land and would not change the legal and historical status of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza as occupied territory under international law.”
It called on the international community, particularly the UN Security Council and the US administration, to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli measures and compel Tel Aviv to comply with international law to prevent further escalation.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61 percent of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its genocidal war in Gaza on October 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

MUNICH — European and American leaders spent three days pledging cooperation and offering to slap a new coat of paint on the façade of the transatlantic relationship. But the cracks are still showing.
The United States was less combative than a year ago in its showing at the Munich Security Conference, when Vice President JD Vance launched a scorching attack on Europe.
But the gathering showed that while the alliance continues to function, the old order that bound the two sides of the Atlantic for decades has broken down. There is no consensus on how the relationship can move forward given the regular seismic shocks the Trump administration revels in delivering to the system.

Production of FA-50PL Light Fighters for Poland Delayed by at Least Two Years

Poland’s Armaments Agency and Korea Aerospace Industries have officially revised the FA-50PL delivery schedule, postponing the start of deliveries until mid-2027.
The Aviationist reported the delay.
On January 9, 2026, the Polish Armaments Agency and Korea Aerospace Industries signed an addendum to the original September 2022 contract, formally shifting the delivery timeline for the FA-50PL.
Under the initial schedule, the aircraft were to be delivered between 2025 and 2028. According to the updated plan, the first FA-50PL is now expected in mid-2027, with all 36 aircraft due to be delivered by early 2029.
The delay is attributed to a combination of factors, including supply chain constraints, integration of advanced avionics and U.S.-made weapons, notably the AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120C AMRAAM missiles, as well as broader geopolitical considerations.
The FA-50PL is being developed as a significantly more capable platform than the existing FA-50GF, tailored to Poland’s operational requirements. Key upgrades include Raytheon’s PhantomStrike active electronically scanned array radar, an aerial refueling capability, the AN/AAQ-33 Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod, a helmet-mounted display, increased external fuel capacity, and compatibility with AIM-9X Sidewinder and AIM-120C AMRAAM air-to-air missiles.
While Poland has already signed an agreement with the United States to support integration of the AIM-9X short-range missile on future FA-50PL aircraft, integration of the AIM-120 AMRAAM remains planned for a later stage.
In addition to the FA-50PL delay, initial plans had called for upgrading 12 FA-50GF aircraft to the FA-50GL configuration. However, in late 2025, it was reported that the upgrade was deemed “economically unjustified,” and the aircraft would instead be used primarily for pilot training.

Israel approves new West Bank land policy, Palestinians decry ‘de-facto annexation’

The Israeli government on Sunday approved a new proposal to tighten Israeli control over the occupied West Bank and register large areas there as "state property," for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in a move Palestinians called "a de-facto annexation".
The public broadcaster KAN said the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
"The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030," Israel Hayom newspaper commented ahead of the government decision.
Palestinian Authority (PA) presidency rejected the cabinet's decision, saying it constitutes "a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity."
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
According to the paper, the main implication of the government decision is "the conversion of very large areas into state land, provided that no other ownership is proven."
"In this sense, even in the absence of a political decision to apply the law, Israel significantly strengthens its hold on the land by registering plots that are not owned by other parties in the land registry," it added.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
If approved, the Israeli government's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) will be responsible for organizing and registering land ownership in Area C.
The process includes issuing sale permits, collecting fees, and overseeing registration procedures, while preventing the Palestinian Authority from carrying out such tasks in those areas.
The move is part of a series of measures approved by Israel's Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv's control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel's civil administration.

Lindsey Vonn preparing to leave Italy after Olympics crash, says ski team chief

Lindsey Vonn is preparing to leave Italy one week after Winter Olympics crash, says U.S. Ski Team chief
Lindsey Vonn is preparing to return to the United States, the U.S. Ski Team's chief told The Associated Press on Sunday, saying the champion skier was getting ready to fly back home for further treatment after wiping out in the women's Olympic downhill competition last weekend.
Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, told the AP the team's medical staff has been coordinating Vonn's recovery since the crash and subsequent helicopter evacuation at the Milan Cortina Games and would try to accompany her home. Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
"We're working through all of that at the moment," Goldschmidt said. "We've got a great team around helping her and she'll go back to the U.S. for further surgeries."
Spectators tuning in to see Vonn attempt to win a medal at age 41 with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were thrown into shock when the American standout got hooked on a gate 13 seconds into her run — resulting in a spinning, air-born crash that sent her careening down the Dolomite mountain.
"The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury," said Goldschmidt, who was in attendance for the fall. "There's a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.
"I mean, putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes, actually on the broadcast, it's really hard to get that across," Goldschmidt added. "Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won't have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports."
Vonn said on Friday that she was expecting to have another surgery for the leg injury, which was slated to happen on Saturday. In a video shared to social media, Vonn told her followers that she could potentially return to the U.S. after that surgery if it went well. At that point, she had already undergone three surgeries since her crash.
But Vonn has no regrets about skiing in the 2026 Olympics.
"When I think back on my crash, I didn't stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences," Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. "I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.
"But just because I was ready, that didn't guarantee me anything. Nothing in life is guaranteed. That's the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don't try you'll never know," Vonn added.
Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, "She's not in pain. She's in a stable condition."
"She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way," Goldschmidt said. "But what she's done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they're winning."

Trump says Board of Peace members pledge $6b for Gaza, calls for ‘full and immediate’ disarmament of Hamas
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WEST PALM BEACH, Florida - US President Donald Trump on Feb 15 urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza, and said members of his so-called “Board of Peace”
“Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarisation,” Mr Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a Feb 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
Disarmament is a key part in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire plan sealed in October between Israel and the Palestinian militant group to end the war triggered by Hamas’s attack on Israel in October 2023.
The United Nations endorsed the plan in November.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilisation force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Both sides accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Although originally intended to oversee Gaza’s rebuilding, the charter for the “Board of Peace” does not seem to limit its role to the Palestinian territory.
“The Board of Peace has unlimited potential,” Mr Trump said on Feb 15 in his post.
After an initial meeting on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum
Countries have been asked to pay US$1 billion for permanent membership of the board, and the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose country invaded Ukraine in 2022, has drawn criticism.
Key US allies including France and Britain have expressed doubts.
Mr Trump said the US$5 billion in pledges by member states would be formally announced then, and that members also “have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and Local Police to maintain Security and Peace for Gazans.”
Mr Trump has said the organisation will work “in conjunction” with the United Nations.
“The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History,” he said.
Under the ceasefire plan, a Palestinian technocratic committee has also been set up with a goal of taking over governance in the battered Gaza Strip. AFP

Gaza Board of Peace member nations "have committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force," United States President Donald Trump confirmed in a Truth Social post on Sunday.
The personnel are set to participate in a local police force that will, in collaboration with the International Stabilization Force, maintain security and peace for Gazans, he added.
In addition to personnel, board members have pledged over $5 billion to humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Gaza, Trump announced.
An official announcement regarding personnel and funding will be made during a board meeting scheduled for Thursday at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, he said.
The board, which Trump is chairman of, "has unlimited potential" and "will prove to be the most consequential International Body in History," he claimed.
Trump calls for Hamas disarmament
Trump added a call for Hamas to uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization.
Hamas's disarmament and demilitarization may begin as early as March, two sources involved in the board told KAN News on Saturday.
The implementation of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, a technocratic body tasked with governing the Gaza Strip, will kick off the disarmament process.

Criticism without a platform, the problem with Bennett’s return - opinion
Unknown

01:12:32 KST

As Israel moves toward elections that could shape the country’s trajectory for years to come, one striking feature of the political landscape stands out: not the intensity of debate, but the absence of substantive policy discussion at its center. This void is especially evident in the emerging campaign of former prime minister Naftali Bennett.
No one doubts that Bennett is an intelligent and accomplished individual. He has succeeded in business and worked his way, impressively, through the political system. Yet his political re-entry has been framed almost entirely around opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu the man, rather than to his policies. While Bennett has criticized the lack of a State Commission of Inquiry and the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) draft issue, substantive policy proposals have largely been absent.
Criticism of a sitting prime minister can be legitimate and even necessary. But criticism alone is not a governing platform. Leadership begins where critique ends and responsibility begins. To date, Bennett has offered little clarity about what he would actually do if entrusted once again with power.
Rather than advancing a coherent agenda on security, the economy, housing, judicial reform, or governance, Bennett’s campaign has leaned heavily on sharp rhetoric and personal attacks. This approach may generate attention, but it does not amount to a serious roadmap for Israel’s future. A public grappling with war, economic pressure, and deep social strain deserves more than slogans and rhetorical flourishes.
That tone was on full display in early February, when Bennett mocked Netanyahu’s response to the state comptroller, likening the prime minister to “Forrest Gump.” However biting such metaphors may be, ridicule is not a substitute for strategy: It offers no answers to the complex challenges Israel faces. For someone who openly broke a major public campaign promise in the past, it is striking that attacks on character and truthfulness would be the strategy he now chooses to pursue.
Bennett’s policy ambiguity, opportunistic alliances
More revealing than the rhetoric is what remains unsaid. Bennett has yet to articulate clear positions on several of the most consequential issues confronting the country. There is no detailed proposal for post-war governance in Gaza, no articulated framework for long-term security control, and no clear vision for rebuilding deterrence while managing international pressure.
On the economic front, he has offered little guidance on tax reform, cost-of-living relief, or how to address the growing burden on Israel’s productive middle class, including the hundreds of thousands of reserve soldiers who dropped everything over the past two years to fight for their country. Similarly absent is a concrete plan for Judea and Samaria, an area that once stood at the core of his political identity.
This lack of policy definition has been accompanied by an increasing willingness to engage in ad hoc political alliances. Once regarded as a consistent figure within the national camp, Bennett now signals openness to partnerships that appear driven more by coalition arithmetic than by shared principles. Tactical pragmatism, untethered from a clearly articulated worldview, risks sliding into opportunism.
His repeated overtures toward figures such as Yair Golan underscore this concern. Golan represents an ideological outlook fundamentally at odds with Bennett’s past positions. He continues to champion a two-state solution rooted in the Oslo framework, has publicly disparaged residents of Judea and Samaria, and has made controversial statements regarding Israel’s soldiers and the role of religion in Israeli society. These views stand in sharp contrast to the values Bennett once championed, yet they no longer appear to pose a barrier to political cooperation.
This approach is not merely theoretical. Bennett has even floated the idea of appointing Golan as energy minister in a future government. The remark, delivered casually, suggested a view of governance in which ministerial portfolios are treated as bargaining chips rather than as serious responsibilities. Israel’s political history offers ample evidence of the costs of appointments driven by coalition convenience rather than merit. The Energy Ministry oversees strategic assets central to Israel’s economic strength and geopolitical standing. It is not a portfolio for improvisation.
The same standard applies across government. Finance, defense, health, and internal security are not ceremonial roles. They demand leadership grounded in knowledge, experience, and judgment. A campaign that treats these responsibilities lightly offers a preview of how its candidate would govern.
At its core, Bennett’s challenge is not stylistic but structural. A campaign defined primarily by negation leaves little room for coherent policy development. In the absence of clear principles, alliances become transactional and governance risks becoming reactive rather than strategic.
Many Israelis recognize that the country must move forward from the current government and its divisive model. They are seeking an alternative that places at its center those who work, serve, pay taxes, and shoulder shared national responsibility.
But Israel deserves better than a campaign built on negation. It deserves a leadership conversation focused on real choices: security doctrine, economic reform, governance, and national resilience. The question voters must ask is not whether Naftali Bennett can criticize Benjamin Netanyahu – we already know he can. The real question is whether he has demonstrated the clarity, competence, and governing vision required to lead a country facing historic challenges.
So far, that answer remains absent.

Religious Zionism is under attack in Israel - opinion
Unknown

Anybody reading the secular or the haredi (ultra-Orthodox) press in recent months knows that the Religious Zionist sector is under attack from both opposing sides of the political spectrum. And anybody reading the religious and right-wing press in recent months knows that the Religious Zionist sector is also tearing itself apart.
The issue at hand is the draft exemption law for the haredi world, which is being debated in the Knesset.
Obviously, the Religious Zionist public and political and rabbinic figures associated with it are broadly supportive of efforts to draw haredi men into national and military service. The debate is over how demanding to be in the intent to draft haredi men, how fierce a draft law – or how weak a draft exemption law – to pass, and whether to risk the current and possibly future nationalist-haredi coalition governments over this matter.
I am strongly in favor of forcing real societal change through tough sanctions on the haredi world, which refuses to participate in the privilege of national security service – although I understand those who fear the shattering of the political Right if haredi leaders are pushed harder.
What I cannot tolerate is the demonizing of the Religious Zionist public in this debate – especially the savaging of brave Religious Zionist women, wives, and mothers of courageous soldiers – who have led campaigns for the passage of an effective and enforceable haredi draft law.
Devoted military service
No sector in Israeli society has “carried the burden” of the past two years of war with more devoted military service, and alas with more casualties, than the Religious Zionists.
This assessment was borne out in a first-of-its-kind detailed academic study published last month. Writing in The Israeli Journal of Society, Military, and National Security (published by the Maarachot think-tank of the Defense Ministry and The Association of Civil-Military Studies in Israel), Dr. Roe Naon and Prof. Uzi Ben-Shalom assert that the Religious Zionist sector suffered four times the losses of any other in Israel.
The authors studied the conscript and reserve units serving in the Israel-Hamas War (Swords of Iron) as well as the rolls of wounded and fallen soldiers.
They found that 257 fallen soldiers, equaling 34 percent of all soldiers killed in the war, were “religious” Israelis; way beyond the less-than-10% of the overall public that identifies as “dati.” Again, the losses among the religious soldiers are four times larger than the size of this community within the broader Israeli public, and 2.5 times larger than the size of this community in relation to men of draft age.
Among reserve soldiers, religious men account for a whopping 45% of the casualties in this war. They are 29% of the casualties among soldiers in the standing army, and 27% of those in the professional army ranks.
Among junior officers in the military, religious soldiers account for 43% of the fallen. Among non-commissioned officers (NCOs), religious soldiers are 41% of the fallen. Among infantry-based NCOs, religious soldiers make up 30% of the fallen.
In the units most implicated in frontline, heavy combat, namely in the engineering, armored, and infantry corps, over one-third of the fallen are religious soldiers.
Additionally, a preponderance of these fallen religious soldiers hail from Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, and peripheral towns in Israel – where many religious Jews live – as well as from the lower socioeconomic strata of Israeli society.
In summary, the authors of the study note the high degree of ideological, communal, familial, and national commitment of the Religious Zionist sector to the military defense of Israel, and the great emphasis on “national unity” and the “privilege” of serving the country that marks this sector.
All of this accounts for the disproportionate share of fallen and wounded soldiers in this sector of Israeli society.
What Naon and Ben-Shalom have not yet studied are the large families that these religious soldiers often have – especially reservists – and the deep, disrupting, and traumatizing impact that long military service, wounding, and death have had on very many religious families.
All the more ugly
This reality, both heroic and bone-chilling, makes the current attacks on Religious Zionists all the more ugly.
It is bad enough that some radical secular leftists accuse Religious Zionists of uber-nationalism (calling them “messianic” or “bloodthirsty”), while the defeatist policies of the Left ever since Oslo have led Israel to disaster.
And it is bad enough that haredi leaders accuse Religious Zionists of “abandoning Torah values,” while haredi indifference to the suffering and national burden of all other Israelis is the very opposite of Torah values.
But it is outrageous and infuriating to witness the savage attacks on brave women like Noa Mevorah and Shvut Raanan of Shutafim LaSheirut (Partners in Service: Religious Women in Favor of IDF Service).
They are being called “traitors” and “useful idiots of the Left” for their outspoken, principled advocacy of strong haredi draft legislation.
These are women whose husbands and sons have collectively served thousands of days of tough military duty, and they have every right to demand a sea change in the “contract” between the serving Israeli public and the mostly non-serving haredi public.
They are now facing an avalanche of delegitimizing ads and digital posts across a broad swath of right-wing and religious newspapers (such as B’Sheva), magazines circulated in synagogues (like Olam Katan and dozens of other haredi publications), and broadcast platforms, notably Channel 14.
The attacks have broadened to include assaults on all religious women who do “only” national service and on religious men who do “only” hesder service (program for religious men, alternating yeshiva study with active IDF service and long and intensive years of frontline reserve duty).
Netanyahu’s coalition
Alas, the unifying theme behind these attacks appears to be slavish devotion to the principle of “Thou shalt not harm Netanyahu’s coalition,” while downplaying the overarching moral demand for equalizing military service responsibilities at the historic inflexion point now before Israeli society.
Unfortunately, a “hardal” coalition of 40 rabbis (composed of community rabbis and yeshiva deans within Religious Zionism who tend toward haredi ideology and religious practice) this week joined the fracas against Shutafim LaSheirut and in support of Religious Zionist Party leader Betzalel Smotrich – who is leaning toward adoption of the current draft evasion law concocted by Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee Chair Boaz Bismuth.
They bury the real ideological and political questions of the day under a blanket of smarmy niceties about “brotherly love” for the haredi public. They glibly term opposition to draft-evasion legislation as a “trap” caused by “troublemakers” meant to bring down the current right-wing government.
They furthermore make the nonsensical assertion that the proposed legislation will indeed help draft many haredi soldiers – “three times as many haredi soldiers.” (Three times what? The current number of near-zero.)
And, in a further insult to our intelligence, these narrow-minded rabbis aver that the Bismuth bill will “ease the burden on reservists,” including, supposedly, the many Religious Zionist reservists whose communities they helm – although even the most ardent advocates of the bill do not make this ridiculous claim.
It will take decades of effective haredi draft until a mass of combat soldiers is sufficiently absorbed and trained enough to lead to a real easing of the reservist burden.
As a deeply religious Zionist myself, even an unabashed “messianist,” I too seek brotherly love and unity but not at the expense of ideological distortions, false narratives, and malicious defamation.

The Reform candidate in an upcoming Westminster by-election is under scrutiny after saying it was “insane” a man was jailed for 18 months for social media posts calling for people to burn asylum hotels to the ground.
Matt Goodwin responded to a Daily Mail report from December that Luke Yarwood, from Christchurch, Dorset, was jailed inciting racial hatred. He said in a post on X: “Welcome to the UK. Where you go to prison for 18 months for anti-immigration tweets. This is insane.”
Yarwood had reportedly called on Brits to “gang together, hit the streets and start the slaughter” in a series of anti-Muslim and anti-immigration posts from 21 December 2024 to 29 January 2025.
“Violence and murder is the only way now. Start off burning every migrant hotel then head off to MPs' houses and Parliament, we need to take over by FORCE”, he said, following a car attack in Germany which killed six people, as misinformation spread on social media suggesting it was linked to Islamic extremism.”
While his lawyer reportedly defended him by pointing out that only 33 people had read the post, he was still jailed for 18 months.
Reform UK hit back at criticism around Mr Goodwin’s tweet, claiming it was “desperate stuff” from Labour after The i reported about his post and the party’s deputy leader Lucy Powell called on the Denton and Gorton candidate to reject support from members of his campaign team that have been accused of racism.
A Reform UK spokesman said: “This is desperate stuff from a Labour Party that has also just been revealed to have been smearing journalists. Criticising the fact that people are being jailed for what they write on social media is clearly not the same as defending those views.
“The fact that our political opponents are conflating these two things is outrageous and a sign of how desperate they have become. Vote Reform, vote for common sense.”
Mr Goodwin hit the headlines last week after The Independent revealed he had called for women and young girls to be given a “biological reality” check as he warned of an impending “fertility crisis”.
This publication also revealed that he had previously suggested people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment and warned that “many women in Britain are having children much too late in life”.
The polling cited by Mr Goodwin, who is standing for Reform UK in the Gorton and Denton by-election at the end of this month, also showed more than 50 per cent of the public wanted taxes and spending to increase, while 40 per cent wanted them to remain the same.
He also once described his party’s economic plans as an “utterly toxic combination”, explaining that he “cannot stress enough how UNPOPULAR slashing taxes and cutting spending on public services is” in a post on LinkedIn three years ago.
The former academic was pointing to polling from the highly respected British Social Attitudes survey which showed that reducing both was backed by just 6 per cent of the public.
In November, Nigel Farage said his party “will cut spending” and “we want to cut taxes”. And last month he doubled down, saying: “We are going to reduce excessive government spending.”
In a speech last year, Mr Farage said “substantial tax cuts” were not realistic at the current moment “given the dire state” of the country’s finances but said that his party would raise the threshold at which workers start to pay tax and scrap Labour’s ‘family farm’ inheritance tax changes.
However, he rowed back from his party’s 2024 election promise to cut £90bn of taxes, which leading economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said Reform had failed to set out how they would achieve.
Last month Mr Farage also told an event in Davos that he thought “the one big lesson of the Liz Truss-Kwasi Kwarteng Budget is that they did not propose to cut spending. So for our programme to work, what we absolutely have to tell people that we are going to reduce welfare spending, we are going to reduce excessive government spending.”
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “Matt Goodwin’s comments show that it’s not just Labour saying Reform’s economic plans are ludicrous – their own candidate thinks so too.
“Reform UK offers nothing but a return to austerity, enacted by a party stuffed full of the same Tories that broke our public services in the first place.”
A Reform spokesperson told The Independent: “Labour’s campaign in Gorton and Denton truly must be on the ropes if they have had to resort to polling analysis by Matt from three years ago when the economy was in a much different place.
“We will take no lectures from a party under whose watch the economy has tanked. By voting Reform the voters of Gorton and Denton can get Keir Starmer out and help bring an end to this failed Labour government.”

Israel resumes contentious West Bank land registration in new step to deepen control
Israel is resuming a land registration process in the occupied West Bank that critics say can shift large areas into state control
- Bookmark
Israel will begin a contentious land regulation process in a large part of the occupied West Bank, which could result in the country gaining control over wide swaths of the area for future development, according to a government decision on Sunday.
The decision paves the way for the resumption of “settlement of land title” processes, which had been frozen in the West Bank since the Mideast War in 1967. It means that when Israel begins the land registration process for a certain area, anyone with a claim to the land must submit documents proving ownership.
“This move is very dramatic and allows the state to gain control of almost all of Area C,” said Hagit Ofran, the director of Israeli anti-settlement watchdog group Peace Now. Area C refers to the 60 per cent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli military control, according to agreements reached in the 1990s with the Palestinians.
The decision is the latest step to deepen Israeli control over the West Bank. In recent months, Israel has greatly expanded construction of Jewish settlements, legalised outposts and made significant bureaucratic changes to its policies in the territory to strengthen its hold and weaken the Palestinian Authority.
Sunday’s decision was first announced last May but required further development before it was approved in this week’s Cabinet meeting.
Under the decision, Israeli authorities will announce certain areas to undergo registration, which will force anyone who has a claim to the land to prove their ownership.
Ms Ofran said the process for proving ownership can be “draconian” and is rarely transparent, meaning any land that undergoes the registration process in areas currently owned by Palestinians is likely to revert to Israeli state control.
“Palestinians will be sent to prove ownership in a way that they will never be able to do,” Ms Ofran told The Associated Press. “And this way Israel might take over 83 per cent of Area C, which is about half of the West Bank.”
The registration process could start as soon as this year, she said.
The proposal had been put forward by some of Israel’s far-right members of the ruling coalition, including the justice minister Yariv Levin. “The government of Israel is committed to strengthening its grip on all its parts, and this decision is an expression of that commitment,” he said.
Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas’ office in a statement called the decision “a grave escalation and a flagrant violation of international law”, which amounts to “de facto annexation.” It called on the international community, especially the UN Security Council and the United States, to intervene immediately.
Previous US administrations have sharply condemned an expansion of Israeli activity and control in the West Bank, but prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a particularly close relationship with Donald Trump. The two met last week in Washington, their seventh meeting in the past year.
And yet Mr Trump has opposed annexation, Ms Ofran noted.
Palestinians are not permitted to sell land privately to Israelis, though measures announced last week aim to nullify this. Currently, settlers can buy homes on land controlled by Israel’s government. Last week's decision also aimed to expand Israeli enforcement of several aspects of in the West Bank, including environmental and archaeological matters in Palestinian-administered areas.
More than 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 from Jordan and sought by the Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Over 300,000 Palestinians are estimated to live in Area C of the West Bank, with many more in surrounding communities dependent on its agricultural and grazing lands, including plots for which families retain land deeds or tax records dating back decades.

Offer to join Trump’s new era is met with growing sense of European steeliness

If JD Vance’s thuggish speech to last year’s Munich Security Conference, directed at the solar plexus of Europe, marked the moment when a transatlantic breakup started, this weekend’s conference, in a rainy and cold Bavaria, was where the debate about the terms of the divorce settlement got under way.
Marco Rubio, the chosen Washington representative this year, is a diplomat, so he softened the Trumpian tone with references to German beer, the Beatles, Dante and the Mayflower. But his speech was a stern warning that if Europe wanted to continue on its path of civilisational decline, as this US administration sees it, America would not be interested and has different hemispheres on which to focus.
“Yesterday is over,” he said, and then he spelled out what yesterday meant. Mass migration threatening civilisational erasure and the continuity of Christian culture, unfettered trade, massive welfare states, weak defences, climate cults, the outsourcing of sovereignty to international institutions, the rationalisation of a broken status quo by people “shackled with guilt and shame”. Unlike Vance, he did not laud rightwing European populist parties, but he nonetheless wrapped himself in their ideology. His next stop after Munich was Budapest, where Viktor Orbán faces a battle in April to remain in power.
And yet there were some, such as the organiser of the conference, the distinguished German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, who claimed to be reassured by the conditional offer to join this journey into a new era with Donald Trump. If Europeans were reassured by Rubio, it was, as Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, observed, “a classic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations”. One reference by the US secretary of state to his country being “a child of Europe” and the older romantics of transatlanticism melted.
But that was not the dominant European mood at this sprawling conference. An iron has entered the European soul about Trump, egged on by the many Democrats attending, and there is a willingness if not to confront him then at least to end the dependence and learn the lessons of the standoff over Greenland.
Talk of a stronger independent European pillar of Nato was heard repeatedly, and even adopted by Keir Starmer in his speech pledging greater integration on defence with Europe. His Valentine’s Day speech to Europe was remarkable for two other reasons. He declared the Brexit era was over and, unlike Rubio, he praised societal diversity and a Britain where “people who look different to each other can live peacefully together”. So much for Rubio’s risk of civilisational erasure.
But the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who is due to go to China in April, said the era of US hegemony was coming to an end, and more quickly than many thought if the US believed it could act alone. “We don’t believe in tariffs and protectionism but in free trade. And we stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we are convinced that we can only solve global challenges together,” he said.
Merz signalled Berlin was already preparing for a smaller American footprint in Europe, and that Germany may at times diverge from the US. “We Europeans are taking precautions. In doing so, we arrive at different conclusions than the administration in Washington,” he said.
The dispute over Ukraine and Trump’s leniency towards Vladimir Putin still appals much of Europe and is at the centre of what is driving Trump and leaders on the continent apart. It was an American, Hillary Clinton, who expressed the anger best: “The effort that Putin and Trump are making to profit off the misery and death of the Ukrainian people is a historic error and corrupt to the nth degree … He’s betrayed the west. He’s betrayed human values.”
The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, now a leading contributor to European defence technology, said “war reveals forms of evil we did not expect” and asked why it was, he felt, Ukraine and not Russia being asked by Trump to make the concessions. He admitted he felt keenly the mistake of Europe’s absence at the negotiating table.
Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, further made the point. He said it was natural for the US to take the lead in the negotiations when it was providing the bulk of the military assistance. “But we are now paying for this war. The US outlay for the war last year was close to zero. We are buying the weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. There is no prospect of a package in Congress. If we are paying, and it is affecting our security and not just Ukraine’s, we deserve a seat at the table.”
Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, rebuked Mark Rutte, the Nato secretary general, for telling Europe to dream on if it thought it could defend itself without the US.
At one level, the US and Europe vehemently agree that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own conventional defence. Elbridge Colby, the deputy secretary for war and the nearest thing the Trump administration has to a theoretician, said: “People get it, 2025 was the year to reframe and reorient, and now we have a lot of buy-in. Look at what Germany has been doing with a massive increase in spending.”
But what the US and Europe have only started to debate is what this more independent Europe will be permitted to do by the US. For the moment an interregnum exists.
Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in a speech that lost some impact owing to its late scheduling, was the one who spelled out the wider consequences of Europe becoming its own protector. With new responsibilities came new rights, some of which Trump may dislike.
Not only did Europe deserve a place at the Ukraine negotiating table, since it was Europe’s existential challenge, it had a right to speak to Putin directly apart from the US, Macron said. Ideally, the US should be weaned off its belief that a just deal is acceptable in the short term.
In any negotiations about what may replace the collapsed arms control agreements with Russia, Europe could not again be a bystander while the US unilaterally withdrew from agreements such as the INF treaty. He had learned of the US withdrawal from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in the newspapers, as did all allies, Macron complained.
Macron argued that to be credible at such a negotiation, Europe needed better deep strike capacities to match those of Russia. European defence firms should not be browbeaten into buying US military hardware. “We will be credible only if we are able to procure and produce what we need, without foreign strings attached.”
Europe could strengthen its own rules on tech and AI. It would be “crazy” if free speech meant giving “the mind, the brain, the heart of my teenagers to the algorithm of big guys with whom I’m not totally sure I share their values”, he said.
Above all, Macron, Merz and Starmer referenced the deeply sensitive discussions on which they are to embark as to how France and the UK could make their nuclear deterrents available to Europe, thus reducing the need for the US nuclear umbrella. It is a hugely expensive and politically fraught undertaking.
Merz made a brief but deliberate reference to the initial talks he had held with Macron, and in an article for Foreign Affairs he said he hoped to agree the first concrete steps this year. Macron was also an enthusiast, pointing to the cooperation with Britain.
If European sovereignty ever extends this far it will make the US uncomfortable. But it is a sign of the times that it is on the agenda. Yesterday is truly over.

Gaza’s real reconstruction problem isn’t concrete, it’s culture - opinion

Imagine a society in which a child walks to school on a street named for a mass murderer, studies in a building honoring a terrorist ideologue, and spends afternoons in youth centers commemorating men famous for killing civilians. Imagine further that this child is taught – by state-sanctioned television – that the highest aspiration in life is death, preferably violent, preferably in the service of God.
This is not a dystopian thought experiment. It has been everyday life in Gaza.
Before October 7, a Palestinian child might have walked along Abu Jihad Street – named for the architect of a bus hijacking that killed 38 Israelis, including 13 children – before arriving at a school bearing the name of Hamas founder Ahmad Yassin.
After class, the same child could attend activities in a center honoring Abu Iyad, one of the planners of the Munich Olympics massacre.
On a popular Palestinian TV program, an adult host asks an 11-year-old girl if martyrdom is beautiful. “Very, very beautiful,” she replies. “Everyone yearns for shahada. What could be better than going to Paradise?”
This cultural environment did not emerge by accident.
Majority of Palestinians express support for Hamas before the October 7 massacre
And it helps explain a grim statistic often treated as impolite to mention. On October 7, polls showed that roughly 70 percent of Gazans and 80% of West Bank Palestinians expressed support for Hamas. For decades, scholars and policymakers have warned about the institutionalized radicalization embedded in Palestinian education, media, and civic life – a culture that prizes martyrdom over life and grievance over coexistence.
And for decades, those warnings have been met with a familiar response: denial, relativism, and money – lots of it. Over the past 10 years alone, billions of dollars – a large part from Europe – have flowed into Gaza, with few conditions and fewer consequences, helping sustain a system that glorifies death while promising peace.
Now, after October 7, the Middle East stands at a rare historical inflection point. Israel’s military and diplomatic gains have widened the opening created by the Abraham Accords: a chance to privilege pragmatism over ideology, realism over fantasy.
Gaza, too, sits before such a moment, if the world has the nerve to seize it. Reconstruction, however, cannot mean repeating the errors that led to ruin. Rebuilding Gaza without dismantling the ideology that destroyed it would be less an act of compassion than an exercise in willful blindness. Concrete poured atop radicalization is not reconstruction. It is preparation for the next war.
This brings us to a word that is endlessly invoked and rarely understood: “deradicalization.” Hamas’ disarmament is essential, but it is not sufficient. Weapons can be confiscated, but ideas require confrontation.
Deradicalization is not merely about convincing militants to lay down their arms. It is about dismantling the narratives, symbols, institutions, and incentives that normalize violence and sanctify hatred.
There is a useful distinction here. Deradicalization refers to the ideological retreat from extremist beliefs – something that can happen to individuals (as in the case of Mosab Hassan Yousef, author of The Green Prince and son of a Hamas founding member) or even groups (as with the IRA in late 1990s Ireland).
Counter-Radicalization, by contrast, is preventative, ensuring that extremist ideas fail to capture new generations. Gaza requires both. But above all, it requires societal change.
History offers a precedent that is often invoked and rarely absorbed. Post-war Germany did not abandon Nazism because it was gently persuaded to do so. It did so because Nazism was systematically uprooted. Symbols were removed, and textbooks were rewritten. Media was regulated, and former perpetrators were barred from power.
Accountability was imposed.
Denazification succeeded not because Germans were flattered, but because reality was enforced.
The lesson is uncomfortable but unavoidable: Radicalized societies do not heal through dialogue alone. They require structural reform. For Gaza, that means rewriting curricula that glorify jihad, renaming streets and institutions that honor terrorists, regulating media that incites violence, and permanently excluding Hamas from political authority. Without these steps, the “day after” will look disturbingly like the day before.
This transformation cannot be imposed solely from above. Palestinian civil society, both local and international, must play a role in building cultural immunity against extremism. That includes educational initiatives, exposure to alternative narratives, and yes, carefully structured encounters with the very people Hamas has spent decades demonizing, the Jews.
I say this not as an optimist by temperament, but as someone who has spent years speaking with former jihadists who abandoned ideologies they once embraced unto death. Change is possible. But it is never accidental.
The consequences of failure extend well beyond Gaza. Hamas has proved remarkably adept at exporting its worldview, fusing Islamist extremism with Western progressive rhetoric.
What began as the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust has metastasized into a global antisemitic movement, turbocharged by social media and absorbed by students who cannot locate Gaza on a map but chant slogans calling for Israel’s erasure. The spectacle borders on the surreal: LGBTQ activists chanting Hamas slogans and progressive students donning Hamas costumes in European capitals. In the name of liberation, they excuse misogyny, homophobia, honor killings, theocracy, and the murder of Jews, while congratulating themselves on their moral sophistication.
Western governments should recognize the boomerang effect. Funding radicalization abroad imports illiberalism at home. Some Arab states already understand this.
Morocco and the United Arab Emirates have concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood ideology is a threat not only to Israel or the West but also to their own societies. They have acted accordingly, by reforming textbooks, regulating religious discourse, producing media that promote coexistence, and appointing officials explicitly tasked with countering extremism.
Gaza deserves no less seriousness – and no more indulgence.
If the Abraham Accords demonstrated that peace in the Middle East is possible without illusions, then Gaza’s future depends on applying the same realism to Palestinian society itself.
Ideological disarmament is not collective punishment. It is a collective rescue. The window is open, but history will not keep it that way for long.

Group of European countries express support for talks on joint nuclear deterrent – Politico
According to Ukrinform, Politico stated this in an article.
Latvian Prime Minister Evika Silina said that Riga is ready to participate in such discussions. She stated that nuclear deterrence could provide new opportunities and asked, "Why not?" while warning that any steps must comply with "our international commitments."
Estonia's Deputy Minister of Defense Tuuli Duneton indicated that her country does not rule out joining early-stage negotiations on a European joint nuclear deterrent.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron addressed European nuclear deterrence in speeches at the Munich Security Conference. Macron emphasized the need to rearticulate nuclear deterrence, taking into account the use of conventional weapons such as long-range missiles.
Latvian Foreign Minister Baiba Braze stated that "Nuclear deterrence is a prominent subject" at this year's conference.
Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken also participated in a closed discussion on the subject during the conference.
According to two European officials, European countries could theoretically help support France's nuclear capability by providing conventional military assets such as submarines. Sources added that Paris may also consider expanding its nuclear arsenal with subsidies from other countries.
As previously reported, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius believes that Europe must assume significantly greater responsibility for the conventional defense of the continent while maintaining U.S. strategic and nuclear support.

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Polish President Karol Nawrotski has said that Poland should seek to possess nuclear weapons.
"I am an advocate of Poland joining the nuclear project. This path, taking into account all international rule, is the oath we should opt for," he said in an interview with the Polsat television channel.
He stressed that he supports any strengthening of Poland’s security, "even on the basis of nuclear capacities."
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said earlier that the Polish government is not discussing stationing nuclear weapons on the country's territory. The country’s former President (2015-2025) Andrzej Duda repeatedly advocated for deploying American nuclear weapons in Poland.
In the spring of 2025, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said that Poland would strive to gain access to the most modern types of weapons, including nuclear weapons, backing French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea to extend the French "nuclear umbrella" to other European countries.

Israeli Cabinet approves West Bank land registration, Palestinians condemn ‘de-facto annexation’
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
JERUSALEM - Israel's Cabinet on Feb 15 approved further measures to tighten Israel's control over the occupied West Bank
The West Bank is among the territories that the Palestinians seek for a future independent state.
Much of it is under Israeli military control, with limited Palestinian self-rule in some areas run by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA).
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is facing an election later in 2026, deems the establishment of any Palestinian state a security threat.
His ruling coalition includes many pro-settler members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, land captured in the 1967 Middle East war to which Israel cites biblical and historical ties.
Ministers voted in favour of beginning a process of land registration for the first time since 1967.
"We are continuing the revolution of settlement and strengthening our hold across all parts of our land," said far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said land registration was a vital security measure while the cabinet said in a statement it was an “appropriate response to illegal land registration processes promoted by the Palestinian Authority.”
The foreign ministry said the measure would promote transparency and help resolve land disputes.
The Palestinian presidency condemned the step, saying it constitutes “a de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement activity.”
Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said the measure could lead to dispossession of Palestinians from up to half of the West Bank.
US President Donald Trump has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but his administration has not sought to curb Israel’s accelerated settlement building.
The United Nations’ highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there are illegal and should be ended as soon as possible.

US not leaving NATO, stronger European defence makes alliance more powerful: Rubio

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio dismissed speculation about Washington leaving NATO, arguing stronger European defence capabilities would enhance rather than weaken the alliance.
"We're not leaving NATO. We're not leaving ... We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," Rubio told reporters on Sunday alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.
He criticised narratives suggesting that asking European allies to contribute more equates to American abandonment of the alliance.
"Every time we say this, people go crazy. They think that means you're going to abandon NATO, you're going to abandon your allies," Rubio said, clarifying: "The point we're making is that the stronger our allies are, the stronger we are collectively."
He emphasised Washington does not view increased European military capability as threatening to US influence but rather as a necessary partnership evolution.
"We are not threatened or feel that it's hostile to see NATO grow in its own capabilities, not independent of the United States, in conjunction with the United States," he said.
‘US wants to be Europe’s partner’
He rejected the notion that Europe should remain dependent on American protection, saying: "We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner."
"We don't think it's a negative thing that other countries have more influence in NATO," Rubio added.
He also emphasised the Trump administration's focus on Central Europe. "We are going to show in the weeks and months and years to come that under President (Donald) Trump, this administration is going to make not just Slovakia but Central Europe a key component of how we engage the continent and the world," he said.
"When the national interest of the United States, for example, and the national interest of Slovakia are aligned, this is an extraordinary opportunity for cooperation," he said, noting the US is "very happy" with Slovakia's selection of the F-16 program to strengthen its air force. "We hope you'll consider some others as well ... that we can work together on."

‘Adopt a Statue’ program for Milan’s iconic Duomo restores centuries-old marbles
A restored 15th-century Duomo statue is now on public display in Milan through a donor-backed loan program
- Bookmark
A 15th-century statue that once stood outside Milan’s iconic Duomo has found a new home.
The Bearded Saint with Book was recently restored under the “Adopt a Statue” program, launched in 2020 by the centuries-old institution that oversees the cathedral’s conservation. As of Feb. 13, it is on display at Piazzale Cadorna, behind a glass window at the headquarters of FNM, a Lombardy-based transport company.
The program recruits donors — either companies or individuals — to fund restoration of a statue under a loan agreement that allows it to occasionally be displayed outside the Duomo.
“The uniqueness of this project is that statues that would otherwise remain in our deposits are restored and brought back to their original beauty,” the program’s project manager, Elisa Mantia, said in an interview with The Associated Press. “In that way, they can continue to tell the story of the Duomo even in places that are far from the monument.”
These agreements are in some cases granted for an initial one-year term and may be renewed. The initiative follows previous fundraising campaigns in which donors could adopt gargoyles or spires in exchange for inclusion in the Duomo’s donor register, where contributors’ names are recorded as part of the cathedral’s long history of support.
From storage to public display
The construction of the Duomo began in 1386, under the rule of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, then lord of Milan, in collaboration with the city’s archbishop. The cathedral was built on the site of two preexisting basilicas and its completion took more than five centuries. One of its bronze doors was not installed until 1965.
Because construction spanned centuries, the Duomo’s statues were carved by artists from different regions and periods, resulting in a monument that reads as a timeline of evolving artistic styles.
The Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, which oversees the cathedral’s conservation, has sought funding to restore statues removed over the centuries for maintenance or safety reasons.
“Culture can save the world,” Andrea Gibelli, president of FNM, said during a press conference on Feb. 13 to mark the unveiling of Bearded Saint with Book. “We want to spread the cultural riches we are fortunate to have, which are often overlooked or not fully appreciated."
Other sculptures adopted under the program by different sponsors have included a 16th-century David, a depiction of Samson and the Lion, and a statue of Saint Matthew the Apostle.
While the number of adopted statues isn't disclosed and not all are displayed in public spaces, Mantia said that her institution has preselected around 30 sculptures as eligible for restoration. Each case must be authorized by Italy’s cultural heritage authorities, as the process involves a formal loan agreement subject to conservation, insurance and transport regulations.
“We usually select them because they are very beautiful and not so damaged that they would be unsafe to loan,” Mantia said.
Once a donor reaches out, experts like Mantia accompany them to the Duomo’s storage facilities to choose a sculpture. After it is selected, restoration typically takes between one and three months.
Centuries-old marble
Bearded Saint with a Book was originally displayed outdoors. Aside from a black crust from air pollution on its surface, it had no structural damages preventing its loan.
“This often involves only surface finishing or an intervention with compresses or mechanical cleaning,” Mantia said.
The marble used for both the statues and the Duomo itself comes from the quarries of Candoglia in Italy’s Piedmont region. The same stone has been used since the late 14th century, under the supervision of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo.
“Beyond being the symbol of Milan, the Duomo is also a symbol of its history,” Mantia said. “It is a monument that grew together with the city, that tells within itself, in its statues and in the style with which it is decorated, the entire history of the city.”

In another ceasefire violation, Israeli soldiers cross UN-demarcated border into Lebanon
Israeli drone crashes near town of Houla, says Lebanese media
BEIRUT, Lebanon / ISTANBUL
Israeli army soldiers crossed the border into southern Lebanon on Sunday, marking a new violation of a ceasefire agreement in place since November 2024, local media reported.
The state-run National News Agency said two Israeli military vehicles stopped at the southern border, with several soldiers crossing the UN-demarcated Blue Line, a de facto border, into the area of Darb al-Hawrat, southeast of the town of Mays al-Jabal, before withdrawing to the other side of the border.
In a separate development, an Israeli drone crashed near the town of Houla in southern Lebanon, with no further details given.
Israeli ceasefire violations have killed and wounded hundreds of Lebanese, while Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
Israel began military operations against Lebanon in October 2023 against the backdrop of the Gaza war and escalated them into a full-scale war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people and wounding about 17,000 others.
Lebanese officials have repeatedly called for pressure on Tel Aviv to halt its attacks and abide by the ceasefire, while Hezbollah has affirmed on more than one occasion its commitment to the truce, calling for withdrawal from the areas occupied by Israel during the last war.

Rubio visits central Europe to bolster ties with pro-Trump leaders

BUDAPEST, Feb 15 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio vowed to deepen cooperation with central Europe on Sunday as he kicked off a trip to Slovakia and Hungary, whose conservative leaders have warm ties with President Donald Trump.
In Slovakia, which, like Hungary, relies on Russian oil and gas and has uneasy relations with the rest of the European Union, Rubio discussed energy and defence with Prime Minister Robert Fico and President Peter Pellegrini.
It was the first visit in seven years by a U.S. secretary of state to the country of 5.5 million people that borders Ukraine.
"Under President Trump, this administration is going to make not just Slovakia but central Europe a key component of how we engage the continent and the world," Rubio said.
"We are not just going to engage in meetings and pleasantries, but in concrete actions that we will take together in ways that are beneficial to your people and our people."
RUBIO COMBINED CRITICISM OF EUROPE WITH MESSAGE OF UNITY
On Saturday Rubio, who is also Trump's national security adviser, delivered a message of unity at the Munich Security Conference while maintaining the administration's criticism of Europe following a scarring year for Transatlantic ties.
Trump's criticism of Europe, imposition of tariffs on EU countries and his ambition to acquire Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark have prompted Western European leaders to increasingly look at carving an independent path.
"We expect every country in the world to act in their national interest. That is what countries are supposed to do," Rubio said. "When our national interests are aligned ... this is an extraordinary opportunity for cooperation and partnership."
Fico, who has said the European Union is in "deep crisis", visited Trump last month in Florida and showered the Republican president with praise, saying he would bring peace.
Both Fico and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, whom Rubio will meet on Monday in the second leg of his trip, have been accused by EU institutions of weakening the judiciary, media and anti-corruption enforcement.
They have also maintained ties with Moscow, criticised and at times delayed the imposition of EU sanctions on Russia and opposed sending military aid to Ukraine.
ORBAN MEETING ON MONDAY
In remarks before departing Washington on Thursday, Rubio said Trump is very supportive of Orban, who is trailing in most polls ahead of an election in April when he could be voted out of power.
Orban, one of Trump's closest allies in Europe, is considered by many on the American hard-right as a model for the U.S. president's tough policies on immigration and support for Christian conservatism.
Budapest has repeatedly hosted Conservative Political Action Conference events, which bring together conservative activists and leaders, with another due in March.
While other European Union countries secured alternative energy supplies after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, including by buying U.S. natural gas, Slovakia and Hungary have continued to buy Russian gas and oil, a practice the U.S. has criticised. Rubio said this would be discussed during his brief tour.
On nuclear cooperation, Slovakia signed an agreement with the United States last month.
Fico said he hoped an agreement with U.S.-based Westinghouse could be signed by next year that would lead to a consortium that will build a new nuclear power plant in Slovakia by 2040. He added that Slovakia wants to buy four more F-16 fighter jets.
Hungary and Slovakia have raised defence spending to 2% of GDP, less than some others and still far off the 5% of GDP by 2035 agreed by NATO last year after pressure from Trump. Fico said Bratislava was aware it needed to raise its military capabilities and was working on it.
Fico has diverged from Washington in one area, when he criticised the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in early January. When asked about the issue at the news conference, Rubio shrugged off the difference of opinion.
"A lot of countries didn't like what we did in Venezuela. That's okay. That was in our national interest ... So what? That doesn't mean we're not going to be friends," Rubio said. REUTERS

Nature reconsidered: why it's making us anxious

Why we are becoming afraid of the outdoors
February 15, 2026Strolling in a forest, nurturing a garden or even just looking at rolling green hills are interactions with nature that are often seen as a balm for the soul.
There is even a word for the love of nature: biophilia. At the other end of the spectrum is biophobia — the fear of nature.
It might traditionally be used to describe fear of large predators or phobias of spiders, snakes and other poisonous or dangerous creatures.
But in recent years, researchers have been observing biophobia of entirely different proportions.
A team at Sweden's Lund University analyzed almost 200 studies on the relationship between humans and nature.
The result: our relationship with nature seems to be deteriorating.
Many humans no longer have everyday contact with nature
Johan Kjellberg Jensen from Lund University, who led the overview study, said it reveals a clear link between a negative relationship with nature and a growing trend toward urban living.
And that could have impacts down the line, according to Jensen.
"Today, the majority of the world's population lives in cities, which means that future generations could be at increased risk of biophobia," he told DW.
Science has been observing people's alienation from nature since the late 1970s. That's according to Berlin psychologist Dirk Stemper, whose research interests include anxiety management and personal development.
This applies mainly to industrialized nations.
"Children are increasingly growing up in highly sealed, non-natural environments and spend most of their time indoors and in digital environments," he said. "There is a lack of physical and sensory experiences, such as climbing, getting dirty or observing animals."
What happens when nature becomes unfamiliar?
But it is precisely these kinds of experiences that build familiarity with nature — familiarity that psychologist Lea Dohm says is important in terms of planetary stewardship.
"The willingness to stand up for environmental, nature and climate protection is greater when we experience ourselves as connected to nature," said Dohm, who is a member of the German Alliance for Climate Change and Health (KLUG).
Jensen added that the idea of soil being "dirty" and earthworms being "disgusting" can be passed down from one generation to the next.
"If parents have negative attitudes towards nature, that can influence their children, which can then lead to a downward spiral of [less and less] closeness to nature," he said.
Stemper adds that when children are repeatedly told to "be careful of ticks" or not to touch certain things, they are likely to view nature as a place of danger.
Helping people to reconnect with nature
Environmental educator Susanne Sigl has also experienced this.
She works at Querwaldein, a non-profit organization in the German city of Cologne aimed at instilling a positive relationship with nature in people, especially children.
"When we ask children to collect long branches in the forest, some only touch them reluctantly, others even use a handkerchief and some don't touch them at all and don't bring any," she says.
According to Sigl, many children won't touch pinecones or chestnuts, prefering to just look at them. They are even less likely to touch earthworms or harmless insects such as small beetles.
The Lund University team also found that a fear of nature can even turn into hostility. There is research to back up the connection between biophobia and calls for the killing of certain predators such as bears, wolves or sharks.
How stories shape our view of the natural world
Our relationship with nature is also strongly determined by our culture and the stories we have heard about it.
"In Central Europe, the forest used to be seen as a place of danger, wild animals, starvation, predators and magical threats," the psychologist Stemper pointed out.
It was only with the cultural movement of Romanticism in the early 19th century that woodlands became places of longing in Germany.
In the Romantic period — in the late 18th century to mid-19th century — many artists and writers focused on the individual's search for magical, supernatural or miraculous phenomena as a reaction to the rapid technological progress of the time.
"Today, we are experiencing a kind of return of the fear of nature: not due to predators and wild animals, but to alienation, media frames and digital distraction," Stemper said.
He added that digital media often portrays a distorted image of nature, a kind of "hyperreality" that blurs the boundaries between the original and the — mostly filtered — copy.
As a result, "virtual nature experiences such as Instagram feeds or computer games have a more intense and 'real' effect than actual encounters with forests, meadows or animals," he explained.
Too little contact with nature harms our health
So why go into the real woods when the "safe" forest on Instagram looks so much nicer?
Because it's good for us. "When we spend time in nature, it promotes our mental health," Dohm said.
"Studies show that forests and nature alleviate ADHD symptoms, improve attention and concentration, reduce sensory problems and promote emotional regulation," Stemper added.
But because biophobic people avoid nature, they miss out on all these health benefits. So what to do?
Jensen says knowledge can help: the more people know about plants and animals and understand how nature works, the more they can appreciate them. And if the fear of natural hazards is actually justified, it helps to avoid risks, for example by protecting livestock from predators.
Susanne Sigl says the best way to help children reestablish contact with nature is through play: "If children fall down while playing tag in the forest, hide behind a tree or crouch in the bushes, then touching branches is usually no longer a problem."

Starmer facing calls for inquiry into Labour thinktank’s investigation of journalists

Keir Starmer is facing calls from the Conservatives and his own MPs for an inquiry into the commissioning of a report that made “baseless claims” about journalists who were investigating a thinktank linked to the prime minister.
The calls add to pressure on the Cabinet Office minister Josh Simons, who commissioned a report in 2023 on journalists investigating Labour Together, the thinktank that would help propel Starmer to power.
The Conservatives have now written to Labour’s chair, Anna Turley, calling for an immediate investigation into Simons’ role and that of other directors of Labour Together, including serving cabinet ministers.
The research was paid for and subsequently reviewed by Simons when he was director of Labour Together, according to sources and documents seen by the Guardian.
In an agreement addressed to Simons, drawn up by Apco Worldwide, the PR consultancy agreed to “investigate the sourcing, funding and origins” of a November 2023 Sunday Times report about the thinktank, in addition to other journalistic investigations into the group.
The Sunday Times reported that the contents of Apco’s investigation were informally shared with Labour figures in 2024, including present cabinet ministers and special advisers. The report contained allegations about Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, journalists at the paper, which then spread around Westminster.
The paper reported that Tom Harper, Apco’s senior director and a former Sunday Times employee, wrote that he had examined the “sourcing, funding and origins of the Sunday Times story” using documents and “discreet human source enquiries”.
Harper was said to have made “baseless claims” that the emails underpinning the published story were likely to have come from a suspected Kremlin hack of the Electoral Commission.
“The likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state,” he reportedly wrote. Apco’s report was also said to have referred to Pogrund’s Jewish background and made baseless allegations about his faith, upbringing and personal and professional relationships.
Simons was close to the prime minister’s recently departed chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who previously ran Labour Together and whose own role in the operation to gather material on journalists is under scrutiny.
An investigation into Apco’s research has been launched by the Public Relations and Communications Association’s standards committee, and this has been welcomed by Simons.
He said in a statement: “I was surprised and shocked to read the report extended beyond the contract by including unnecessary information on Gabriel Pogrund.”
Simons said he had asked for the information to be removed before passing the report to the intelligence agency GCHQ. No other British journalists were investigated in any document he or Labour Together ever received, Simons said.
The Conservative party chair, Kevin Hollinrake, said that Labour Together’s behaviour showed “a contempt for the free press”.
“With its close and widely known links to the heart of government, serious questions must be answered about who was aware of these actions, including whether senior figures around the prime minister knew,” he said.
Alison Phillips, the former Daily Mirror editor who joined Labour Together as chief executive three months ago, emailed its staff on Sunday evening.
She said: “As a former journalist and editor, it should come as no surprise that I was horrified that investigators hired by Labour Together would look into the background and sources of reporters even if I am assured that this was not the intention.”
The focus had to be on the future, and the organisation was “under new leadership”, she added.
John McDonnell, the veteran Labour backbencher and former shadow chancellor, said on Saturday he had written three times in recent weeks to the general secretary of the Labour party to call for an independent inquiry into the affair.
“I copied Keir Starmer into each request,” McDonnell said. “Clear to me as secretary of the NUJ’s parliamentary group if true this is unacceptable.”
Another Labour MP, Karl Turner, said the prime minister needed to look into the affair himself and should meet McDonnell to discuss it.
The contract showed that Simons asked for information specifically on the sources for a book by Paul Holden about McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s rise, as well as related articles by the US journalist Matt Taibbi.

U.S. President Donald Trump said the Board of Peace will announce this week that member states have pledged more than $5 billion toward humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Gaza and committed thousands of personnel to an international stabilization force and local police in the territory.
In a post on Truth Social, Trump said the announcement will be made Feb. 19, 2026, at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, where he will be joined by member states of the organization, which he chairs.
Trump wrote that member states have pledged more than $5 billion toward Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts and have committed thousands of personnel to an international stabilization force and local police to maintain security and peace for residents of the enclave.
He also said Hamas “must uphold its commitment to full and immediate demilitarization.”
Trump described the Board of Peace as having “unlimited potential” and said it would prove to be “the most consequential international body in history,” adding that it is his honor to serve as its chairman.

Zelenskyy: Putin not being in prison is the biggest compromise the world has made
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that the world has made its biggest concession regarding Russia, given that Vladimir Putin and his inner circle are still at liberty.
Source: European Pravda, citing Zelenskyy in an interview with Politico
Details: Zelenskyy said he is receiving signals from the United States and President Donald Trump about the need to compromise with Russia.
Quote: "There are some signals from the American side, from President Trump. They say, 'Look, this is the time for compromises, you can make some steps forward.'
We made a lot of compromises. Putin and his friends, they are not in prison. This is the biggest compromise that the world has made already."
Details: Zelenskyy also said that when Trump proposed concluding a truce and temporarily freezing the war, Ukraine agreed to an unconditional ceasefire, but Putin has refused to consider it.
The Ukrainian leader believes this state of affairs will persist until the Kremlin ruler is put under real pressure.
Quote: "Yeah, of course he will refuse… Today one reason, tomorrow another reason, etc. We need pressure on him… Putin will stop this war if real pressure is on him."
Background:
- On 14 February, Zelenskyy said proposals that Ukraine withdraw from Donetsk Oblast without a fight are perilous, stressing that Russia's ambitions go beyond the eastern region.
- He also said he hopes the negotiations with the US and Russia on a potential end to the war will not be slowed down by the changes in the Russian negotiating team.
- New talks on ending the war in Ukraine are to be held on 17-18 February in Geneva. Russia is expected to send Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to Putin, to the talks.
- Rustem Umierov, Secretary of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, recently announced the names of the delegates Ukraine plans to send to the talks.

Türkiye condemns Israel's land registration move in West Bank
Ankara says Israel has no sovereignty over occupied Palestinian territories, calling decision ‘null and void’
ISTANBUL
Türkiye on Sunday strongly condemned Israel's new decision on land registration in the occupied West Bank, calling it a violation of international law.
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Türkiye’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the move aims to impose Israel’s “authority over the occupied West Bank and expand settlement activities."
"This step, which seeks to forcibly displace the Palestinian people from their land and accelerate Israel's unlawful annexation efforts, constitutes a clear violation of international law and is null and void," the ministry said.
"Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories," the ministry added, saying that the expansionist policies pursued by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government undermine peace efforts and damage prospects for a two-state solution.
Türkiye called on the international community to take a firm stance against Israeli attempts to create facts on the ground.
The ministry said Türkiye will continue to support efforts to "establish an independent, sovereign and contiguous" Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israeli public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” daily Israel Hayom said ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Oslo II Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation – including killings, arrests, displacement, and settlement expansion – as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Crowds thronged Kathmandu’s Pashupatinath Temple for Shivaratri, where worship, music and a rare legal tolerance of marijuana marked the festival.
Nepal marked Shivaratri on Sunday as crowds filled Kathmandu and queued for hours at Pashupatinath Temple. Tens of thousands came to pray, sing and dance in honour of Shiva. Although marijuana is banned most of the year, police allow limited use during the festival, reflecting Shiva’s long link to cannabis.
Across the Bagmati river, ash-covered holy men and mostly young devotees smoked openly on nearby hills. Visitors also travelled from India to join the rituals.
Nepal outlawed marijuana in 1976, after decades of legal sales, and recent efforts to decriminalise it remain stalled. For one day at least, tradition takes priority over the law.

Spike Lee brings Palestine message to NBA All-Star Weekend
Oscar-winning filmmaker Spike Lee made a clear show of solidarity with Palestine during an NBA game over All-Star Weekend, appearing with a prominent accessory featuring the Palestinian flag.
The acclaimed director - best known for films such as Malcolm X and Da 5 Bloods - was seen courtside at the game in Los Angeles carrying a bag adorned with the Palestinian flag and a traditional keffiyeh. He also wore a hoodie marking US Black History Month.
As one of the most widely watched events in American basketball, NBA All-Star Weekend ensured Lee’s attire drew significant attention, both in the arena and online, highlighting his long-standing advocacy for human rights and the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
"Spike Lee with the Palestine flag on All Star weekend that’s that legendary sh*t in a weekend where the league is trying they’re hardest to push Israel" one user wrote on social media platform X.
Others, however, expressed concern that Lee’s visible pro-Palestine stance could prompt repercussions.
"Spike Lee with the Palestine flag and keffiyeh on his bag for All Star Weekend they’re [about to] ban him from ever being courtside again," another user posted.
Lee’s latest symbolic gesture comes amid his continued public support for Palestine.
He has repeatedly used his social media platforms to draw attention to the suffering of Palestinians, particularly in Gaza, since the outbreak of Israel's war in 2023, including sharing images of the Palestinian flag.
The director also served as an executive producer on the Oscar-nominated film The Voice of Hind Rajab, which centres on the killing of five-year-old Gaza resident Hind Rajab by Israeli forces in 2024.
His high-profile appearance at All-Star Weekend follows growing criticism from basketball fans over what they see as a lack of acknowledgement by the NBA’s biggest stars of Israel’s two-year genocidal war on the Strip.
This stands in contrast to prominent athletes in other sports- including footballer Mohamed Salah and NFL player Azeez Al-Shaair- who have spoken out publicly about the conflict.
In December 2023, former NBA player and activist Etan Thomas addressed the issue in an op-ed published on his website, writing that after commenting publicly on Gaza he received "over a dozen messages from different active NBA players and even more from retired NBA players thanking me".
While many NBA stars have remained silent, some players have openly expressed solidarity with Gaza, including WNBA guard Natasha Cloud and NBA star Kyrie Irving.

Trump says Board of Peace members to pledge over $5B for Gaza reconstruction on Thursday
US president announces thousands of personnel also committed to planned international stabilization force, local police in Gaza Strip
ISTANBUL
US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that member states of the new Board of Peace will announce pledges exceeding $5 billion for Gaza's reconstruction and thousands of personnel for a planned international stabilization force during a Thursday gathering in Washington.
"On February 19th, 2026, I will again be joined by Board of Peace members at the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C., where we will announce that member states have pledged more than $5 billion dollars toward the Gaza humanitarian and reconstruction efforts," Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social.
Member states have also "committed thousands of personnel to the International Stabilization Force and local police to maintain security and peace for Gazans," he added.
Trump said the Board of Peace "has unlimited potential," recalling that last month "two dozen distinguished founding members" joined him in Davos, Switzerland, to celebrate its formation and "present a bold vision for the civilians in Gaza, and then, ultimately, far beyond Gaza -- world peace."
"The Board of Peace will prove to be the most consequential international body in history, and it is my honor to serve as its chairman," he wrote.
Trump’s words came amid reports that Indonesia is planning to potential deploy up to 8,000 troops to Gaza.
The White House last month announced the formation of a "technocratic" National Committee for the Administration of Gaza to oversee the transition of power as part of Trump's 20-point plan for the war-battered enclave.
A ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war in Gaza that killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, and destroyed 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 601 Palestinians have also been killed and over 1,600 others injured in Israeli attacks since the truce, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

The top 3 affordable cities for retirement with low-cost, high-quality healthcare access
Award-winning hospitals, affordable healthcare and cost of living are the sweet spot for retirees

Medical costs can make up a chunk of retirement expenses - but where a retiree chooses to live can have a significant impact on that spending.
Most adults 65 or older will rely on the government’s Medicare program for health insurance when they retire. On average, a retiree would need up to $428,000 saved to cover Medicare premiums, deductibles and prescription drugs in their golden years, according to a 2025 study from nonpartisan benefits and public policy research firm Employee Benefit Research Institute. Yet, the average retiree has just under $290,000 saved for retirement.
Therefore, finding a city that has affordable and high-quality healthcare is as important as ever for those getting ready to exit the world of work.
The Independent analyzed all 50 states based on three categories: overall cost of living, state Medicare performance and average annual medical expenses.
In the three states that came out on top, these cities beat the national average for cost of living and had hospitals recognized for outstanding care.
Steeltown savings
Pittsburgh’s blue-collar reputation belies the city’s rise over the past decade as a hot spot for culture, according to tourism publication VisitPITTSBURGH. Overall, Pennsylvania offers a solid trio of affordable cost of living, top-20 Medicare performance, and top-15 health cost of living:
- Overall cost of living: No. 25
- Medicare performance: No. 16
- Health cost of living: No. 12
Pittsburgh’s overall cost of living is 2 percent below the national average, according to workplace compensation firm Payscale. Travel + Leisure magazine named it the best city in Pennsylvania for retirement in 2024, and U.S. News & World Report named Pittsburgh among the top-10 places to retire the same year.
“Steeltown’s” University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is home to multiple award-winning hospitals. Magee Women’s Hospital earned a top-100 award for joint replacements from healthcare ranking and reviews site Healthgrades.
Pittsburgh’s UPMC Presbyterian has earned Healthgrade awards for outstanding patient experience (in 2023 and 2024) and ranked among the top 100 hospitals in the country for gastrointestinal and stroke care.
Cornhusker care
Omaha, Nebraska, has an excellent cost of living and Medicare performance that balances out an average health cost of living:
- Cost of living: No. 13
- Medicare performance: No. 15
- Health cost of living: No. 24
The city’s cost of living is 10 percent below the national average, according to Payscale. The city earned a spot in the National Education Association’s 2026 list of 23 affordable retirement spots for educators.
Omaha’s Methodist Hospital has a consistent track record of providing excellent outpatient care, earning Healthgrades’ Outstanding Patient Experience Award in 2023, 2024 and 2025, and winning Healthgrades’ Excellence Award in 2025 and 2026 for its outpatient joint replacements and prostate care.
The city’s CHI Health Lakeside was named to Healthgrades’ 2026 lists of the 250 best hospitals in the country and the 100 best hospitals for critical care.
Healthy hawkeyes
Des Moines, Iowa, offers a strong combination of excellent cost of living and a top-20 rating for Medicare performance and health cost of living:
- Overall cost of living: No. 9
- Medicare performance: No. 18
- Health cost of living: No. 17
The city’s cost of living is 16 percent lower than the national average, according to employment data site Payscale.
The city’s MercyOne Des Moines Medical Center was named to hospital rankings site Healthgrades’ list of America’s 250 best hospitals in 2024 and was among Healthgrades’ top 100 hospitals for coronary intervention in 2026. Additionally, the hospital won a Healthgrades Coronary Intervention Excellence Award in 2025.

Family Guy hits huge milestone as fans all say the same thing about season premiere
Hit animated series aired its 450th episode Sunday night

Family Guy has hit a major milestone with its season 24 premiere.
Fox’s hit animated series — which aired Sunday night — marked its 450th episode.
“Season 24 will continue to push comedy boundaries, providing an unexpected take on current events, pop culture and family itself,” an official description of the premiere episode read. “The season premieres with its landmark 450th episode, when for the first time in the show's history, Lois and Stewie finally understand each other -- thanks to Brian's edibles — and explore and try to explain their complicated relationship.
As fans watched the highly anticipated season premiere unfold — and as Lois and Stewie bonded on a new level —many applauded the series on a job well done.
“Great first episode back,” one fan wrote on X while another agreed, “Best Family guy in years!”
A third said: “it's not surprising I'll tear up to a family guy episode though. im a huge family guy fan and I'm very passionate about it. so seeing members of the griffin family interact with each other like family is pretty good.”
“New family guy episode was actually really good, Lois and Stewie dynamic will always be great,” a fourth wrote.
However, not everyone was pleased by the season premiere, with one fan saying, “Dude Family Guy used to be so funny.”
Created by Seth MacFarlane, Family Guy premiered in 1999 and centers around the Griffin family. In addition to MacFarlane, the cast features the voices of Alex Borstein, Seth Green, Mila Kunis, and Arif Zahir.
The show has a history of controversial jokes and rarely holds back when choosing to mock certain celebrities. Still, it has retained somewhat of a loyal following — enough to keep it on the air for well over two decades.
Taking a look at how the animated series survived 20 seasons in the era of political correctness, The Independent’s Louis Chilton wrote in 2021: “Family Guy’s enduring survival could be down to a gradual maturation in other areas. The animation, a full-blown eyesore in its early days, has improved ten-fold.
“Increasingly, the humor has scaled back the frenzied, puerile cutaway gags, and increasingly takes a more self-aware tone. More risks are taken, too, with its format, such as an entire episode devoted to a fake in-universe DVD commentary, or a triptych emulating the filmmaking aesthetics of Quentin Tarantino, Wes Anderson and Michael Bay.
“This long-term creative stamina is nothing to be scoffed at: by its own 20th season, The Simpsons was over a decade past its peak and had already lost all trace of what made it such a monumental piece of TV. Regardless, Family Guy’s viewing figures have declined substantially over the years, at least on traditional TV. In 2000, and 2002, Family Guy was twice cancelled by Fox for low viewership ratings, before being revived due to high DVD sales and the popularity of Adult Swim re-runs.
“Now, it draws less than half of what it did at its lowest pre-cancellation ebb. Maybe there just aren’t enough people still watching to really cultivate much offence.”
Season 24 of Family Guy will continue to air Sundays on Fox. Streaming will be available the next day on Hulu.

Renderings show most detailed vision for Trump’s White House ballroom

New renderings released this week provide the most detailed vision yet of Donald Trump’s proposed $400m White House ballroom addition.
The renderings, submitted by the project’s architects and released on Friday by the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC), depict a vast sprawling structure, expected to be around 90,000 sq ft, from multiple angles.
In the images, the proposed building stands level with the White House mansion.
The renderings appear in a 28-page document titled “East Wing Modernization” and is dated 11 February. It was submitted ahead of a 5 March NCPC hearing, when board members are scheduled discuss the proposal.
Trump has appointed several allies to the NCPC commission and he has installed loyalists at the Commission of Fine Arts, which is also tasked with reviewing the ballroom plans.
According to CNN, the renderings were removed from the NCPC website shortly after being uploaded on Friday. The commission did not respond to requests for comment from CNN about the removal.
The ballroom project has generated headlines and outcry from the outset. In October, Trump sparked public backlash when he abruptly began demolishing the East Wing, to clear space for his ballroom, before construction plans had been submitted to oversight bodies.
At the time, White House officials said that demolition did not require the commission’s approval, and said that they would present plans for any construction to the proper commissions.
In December, the National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a federal lawsuit, seeking to block the construction of the new ballroom, arguing that the administration violated multiple laws by tearing parts of the White House “without any review whatsoever”.
Also in December, Trump replaced the architect originally selected to design the gilded ballroom, following reports of disagreements. The White House subsequently chose Shalom Baranes Associates to lead the project.
The most recently reported cost estimate for the ballroom stands at $400m. The project is being financed by private donors and large corporations including Meta, Apple, Amazon, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Google and Comcast.
Earlier this week, Trump shared two renderings of the ballroom on social media.
“It is on budget, and ahead of schedule!” Trump wrote. “When completed, it will be the finest Ballroom ever built anywhere in the World, one that has been sought by Presidents for over 150 years – and now they are getting THE BEST!”.
“Because of its unprecedented structural, safety, and security features, it will also be used for future Presidential Inaugurations,” he added.
In a 5 February memo to the NCPC, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, defended the administration’s decision to demolish the East Wing.
“Based on analysis, demolition of the existing East Wing structure and reconstruction of a new East Wing provided the most effective solution to many longstanding issues affecting the White House and delivered the best long-term risk reduction,” he wrote.
Fisher said that that preservationists from the National Park Service and General Services Administration “advised on and documented the removal of historical elements of the building and oversaw the manner in which the removals took place” and that “significant historical items associated with the buildings have been meticulously preserved”.
Some of the preserved features include the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and more, he said.
“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure,” he added.
Fisher also stated that “all heavy equipment has been kept at a safe distance from the White House mansion as based on industry standards to prevent inadvertent damage to the structure” and said that “to date, the government evaluation following the removal of the East Colonnade and the East Wing buildings is that the condition of the east façade of the White House Mansion is excellently preserved.”
Later in the memo, Fisher said that beyond the ballroom, the administration has plans “for beautifying the visitor experience” including in areas such as Lafayette Park, Sherman Park, First Division Park, and the Ellipse, and said that they are also working to establish a “superior, more efficient, White House visitor security screening center”.

Thousands of Western nationals fought Israel’s war on Gaza: What to know
Thousands of Western nationals joined the Israeli military in its genocidal war on Gaza that killed over 72,000 Palestinians.
Thousands of Western nationals joined the Israeli military amid its genocidal war in Gaza, raising questions over international legal accountability for foreign nationals implicated in alleged war crimes against Palestinians.
More than 50,000 soldiers in the Israeli military hold at least one other citizenship, with a majority of them holding US or European passports, information obtained by the Israeli NGO Hatzlacha through Israel’s Freedom of Information Law has revealed.

Since October 7, 2023, Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 72,061 people in military actions that have been dubbed war crimes and crimes against humanity by rights groups.
Rights organisations around the world have been trying to identify and prosecute foreign nationals, many of whom have posted videos of their abuse on social media, for their involvement in war crimes, particularly in Gaza.
So, what does the first such data reveal about the Israeli military? And what could be the legal implications for dual-national soldiers?
Which foreign nationals enlist most in the Israeli military?
At least 12,135 soldiers enlisted in the Israeli military hold United States passports, topping the list by a huge margin. That is in addition to 1,207 soldiers who possess another passport in addition to their US and Israeli ones.
The data – shared with Al Jazeera by Israeli lawyer Elad Man, who serves as the legal counsel for Hatzlacha – shows that 6,127 French nationals serve in the Israeli military.
The Israeli military, which shared such data for the first time, noted that soldiers holding multiple citizenships are counted more than once in the breakdown.
The numbers show service members enlisted in the military as of March 2025, 17 months into Israel’s devastating war in Gaza.
Russia stands at third, with 5,067 nationals serving in the Israeli military, followed by 3,901 Ukrainians and 1,668 Germans.
The data revealed that 1,686 soldiers in the military held dual British-Israeli citizenship, in addition to 383 other soldiers who held another passport in addition to their British and Israeli ones.
South Africa, which brought a case of genocide against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also had 589 of its citizens serving in the Israeli military ranks.
Furthermore, 1,686 soldiers hold Brazilian citizenship, 609 Argentine, 505 Canadian, 112 Colombian, and 181 Mexican, in addition to their Israeli nationality.
Israel’s military comprises an estimated 169,000 active personnel and 465,000 reservists – of whom nearly eight percent hold dual or multiple citizenships.
Can dual nationals be tried for war crimes in Gaza?
Ilias Bantekas, a professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar, told Al Jazeera that “war crimes incur criminal liability under international law, irrespective of what the law of nationality says”.
Otherwise, Nazi Germans, whose law allowed and obliged them to commit atrocities, would incur no liability, Bantekas added. “Dual nationality is immaterial to criminal liability,” he said.
However, the major issue in prosecuting the accused “is getting [them] on your territory and putting them before a court”, he noted.
Bantekas also added that there is no difference in the question of liability between native soldiers and those of dual nationalities.
Dual nationals, in fact, “may in addition be liable under laws that prevent military service in foreign conflicts or joining armies of other nations”, the professor said.
Prosecuting foreign nationals has been “pretty much the norm”, he noted.
“Think of Nazi Germans tried by Allied war crimes tribunals after World War II, Japanese officers tried by US military courts, and crimes committed during the Bosnian conflict where alleged offenders were tried by various courts in Europe,” Bantekas told Al Jazeera.
Last May, the United Kingdom’s Foreign Office said that allegations of war crimes should be submitted to the Metropolitan Police.
“The UK recognises the right of British dual nationals to serve in the legitimately recognised armed forces of the country of their other nationality,” it said. “Allegations of war crimes should be submitted to the Met Police for investigation.”
Have foreign nationals been tried for Gaza war crimes?
Nationals with dual or multiple citizenships have not yet been arrested for committing war crimes in Gaza. But rights groups, including lawyers, are trying to get them prosecuted.
In the UK last April, the Gaza-based Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and the UK-based Public Interest Law Centre (PILC) filed a 240-page report to the Metropolitan Police.
Accusations against the 10 British individuals, whose names have not been publicly disclosed, include murder, forcible transfer of people, and attacks on humanitarian personnel, between October 2023 and May 2024.
In September last year, a case was filed in Germany against a 25-year-old soldier, born and raised in Munich, for participating in the killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, by PCHR, the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), Al-Haq, and the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights.
The sniper, with shootings documented near Gaza’s al-Quds and Nasser hospitals between November 2023 and March 2024, was a member of a unit known as “Refaim”, “ghost” in Hebrew.
Legal proceedings against members of the same unit are also under way in France, Italy, South Africa, and Belgium.
The Belgian public prosecutor’s office also opened a judicial investigation last October into a 21-year-old Belgian-Israeli citizen, a member of Refaim.
The mandatory military service law in Israel exempts dual nationals residing abroad, making the enlistment a voluntary act, an important distinction when such crimes are tried in foreign courts. Lawyers have reportedly noted that the voluntary nature of the soldiers’ service makes them more liable for alleged crimes.
What does international law say about soldiers in foreign wars?
South Africa brought its case to the ICJ in December 2023, arguing that Israel’s war in Gaza violates the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.
While a final ruling could take years, the ICJ issued provisional measures in January 2024 ordering Israel to take steps to prevent acts of genocide in Gaza and to allow unimpeded access for humanitarian aid. But Israel has continued curb the supply of aid into Gaza in violation of the ICJ interim order.
Under the 1948 Genocide Convention, countries that are party to the treaty have a binding obligation to prevent and punish genocide. Countries can investigate and prosecute individuals who may have committed or been complicit in this crime.
In March last year, the International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) announced the “Global 195” campaign to hold Israeli and dual-national individuals accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.
The coalition aims to work simultaneously within multiple jurisdictions to apply for private arrest warrants and initiate legal proceedings against those implicated, including the Israeli military members and the entire Israeli military and political command in its scope.
For countries that are parties to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC), there is an additional layer, where the ICC can assert its jurisdiction. Palestine has been a state party since 2015.
The State of Palestine is recognised as a sovereign nation by 157 of the 193 UN member states, representing 81 percent of the international community. Most recently, it has been recognised by France, Belgium, Canada, Australia, and the UK.
A foreign national, whose country considers Palestine a “friendly state”, would also be vulnerable to prosecution for participating in the Israeli military’s war crimes in Gaza.
How is the Hind Rajab Foundation tracking alleged war criminals?
The Hind Rajab Foundation – named to honour a five-year-old Palestinian girl whose killing by Israeli soldiers on January 29, 2024 became emblematic of Israel’s genocide in Gaza – has been amassing troves of data with identifiable information about Israeli soldiers.
The Belgium-based foundation is the force behind an international effort for accountability over war crimes in Gaza – and has since filed several cases, including a landmark challenge targeting 1,000 Israeli soldiers.
The foundation identified numerous individuals with dual citizenship, including 12 from France, 12 from the US, four from Canada, three from the UK, and two from the Netherlands, in the complaint.
The foundation has scoured TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, where the Israeli soldiers boast about atrocities in Gaza, to collect information on the soldiers. It has been using those pieces of evidence to pursue the trail of the accused for war crimes.
“We are in possession of many more profiles of dual nationals beyond the 1,000 soldiers named in our complaint to the ICC. We will be pursuing legal action against all of them in the national courts of their respective countries,” the foundation had said in October 2024. “Impunity must end, everywhere.”
The Hind Rajab Foundation says it pursues criminal accountability for Israeli war criminals, from those who planned and ordered operations to those who executed them, including foreign nationals who have participated in or financed these crimes.
Its founder, Dyab Abou Jahjah, was also threatened by Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli, who told him to “watch your pager” in a post on X, an allusion to deadly attacks on Hezbollah members’ communication systems in September 2024. At least 12 people were killed and more than 3,000 people were wounded when thousands of pagers were detonated by Israeli operatives during those attacks.
In January last year, a complaint filed by the Hind Rajab Foundation led to a Brazilian judge ordering an investigation into an Israeli soldier vacationing in the country. The soldier had to flee, prompting the Israeli military to order all troops who participated in combat to conceal their identities.
“Criminal liability under international law cannot be dissolved by time bars. It extends forever, and no statute of limitations is applicable,” said Bantekas of Hamad Bin Khalifa University.
However, prosecuting Israeli military members “is practically difficult for two reasons”, he said, noting the difficulty of obtaining firsthand evidence and the wariness of national prosecutors who may fear political or other repercussions.
“If public opinion and political opinion in Europe shifts far more in favour of Palestine than it is now, then national prosecutions will feel more at ease to initiate prosecutions,” he told Al Jazeera.

Jonathan Powell rejects overtures to replace McSweeney as Starmer’s chief of staff
Unknown

00:32:54 KST

Keir Starmer’s national security adviser, Jonathan Powell, has rejected overtures to become the prime minister’s chief of staff after the resignation of Morgan McSweeney, the Guardian has been told.
Powell’s allies say his decision not to take forward discussions about the job – the same role he undertook under Tony Blair’s premiership from 1997 to 2007 – was largely motivated by an intention to return to the mediation consultancy that he set up in 2011, with little interest in returning to a job he has already done.
He is said to be weighing up a departure from Downing Street at the end of the year, which would represent another significant departure from the prime minister’s senior team.
Downing Street sources firmly denied that Powell had any plans to step down, saying he was not leaving Downing Street and would continue as national security adviser. They said any suggestion Powell had been offered the role of chief of staff was untrue.
Powell is credited with playing a key role in shaping Starmer’s policies on the world stage. The prime minister’s efforts to build a relationship with Donald Trump and act as a self-styled bridge between the US and Europe are seen as one of the more successful elements of his tenure at No 10.
In a continued Downing Street clear-out after the controversy over the decision to make Peter Mandelson the ambassador to Washington, it was announced on Thursday that Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, was stepping down “by mutual consent” after just over a year in the job.
It is understood that Powell very strongly advised Starmer not to appoint Mandelson as ambassador, an opinion that could emerge in internal government memos due to be published after a Commons vote earlier this month.
Downing Street sources said they would not comment on advice given to the prime minister.
The mass of documentation, which ministers agreed to release after the controversy over Mandelson’s long-term links to the child sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, will be released after sensitive items are filtered by parliament’s intelligence and security committee.
Powell’s recommendation did owe to any special knowledge of Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein but was because he felt from his personal experience during the Blair government that Mandelson courted controversy and would represent trouble for the prime minister.
As Blair’s chief of staff, Powell had to handle two cabinet resignations by Mandelson and on both occasions felt Mandelson did not handle the controversy as well as he could have done. His opposition to Mandelson underlines the extent to which Starmer and McSweeney ignored top-level foreign policy advice from inside No 10 and the Foreign Office over the appointment.
David Lammy, who was foreign secretary at the time of the appointment, has also let it be known that he opposed the plan, but he may have been reflecting a Foreign Office view that such a high-level diplomatic appointment should go to a professional diplomat and not a former Labour minister.
Powell has been regarded as a highly effective national security adviser, acting as a key liaison between No 10 and the European “coalition of the willing” built to support Ukraine. He has also been at the centre of the controversy over the decision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.
His consultancy, Inter-Mediate, specialises in working behind the scenes to bring together parties in a conflict. Powell always regarded the highly demanding national security job as a fixed-term appointment.
At Inter-Mediate, Powell – considered to have been one of the key architects of the 1999 Good Friday agreement – played a role in supporting negotiations to end the Basque conflict and demobilise the Eta separatist group. In addition, he served as a peace adviser to the former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos on his Nobel prize-winning settlement with the Farc rebels.
Powell also worked alongside Mozambique’s former president Filipe Nyusi to end the country’s long civil war through a landmark agreement signed in summer 2019.

22 arrested in Bnei Brak riots; female IDF soldiers say they hid in dumpsters

Two female IDF soldiers rescued by police from violent unrest in the ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak said they had asked their commanders not to enter the area but were instructed to proceed.
“We hid inside dumpsters,” one of the soldiers said in testimony. “I wasn’t carrying a weapon, and that’s fortunate, because in any case I wouldn’t have been able to use it against them.”
The unrest erupted after word spread that the soldiers had arrived to distribute military draft notices. The IDF said the soldiers were in fact conducting a welfare visit as part of their duties.
According to one of the soldiers, a woman who saw them entering a building warned them to hide and told them they were not allowed to be there. “I even wore a skirt in advance to avoid this,” she said.
Tel Aviv District Police Commander Haim Sargarof criticized the lack of coordination with the military.
“The army must coordinate entry into the city with us,” he said at the scene. “When they enter without coordinating with us, we are left to respond.”
He said police are using camera footage to identify those involved in the violence. “We have reached the person who set the motorcycle on fire. We need to make the arrests and restore quiet for residents who need to know there will be zero tolerance for disorder,” he said.
Sargarof said there was no immediate expectation of further unrest but that police were prepared for road closures and additional disturbances. “The incident went from zero to 100,” he said. “We are not updated when soldiers enter for activity, it is not coordinated with us, and we are surprised. Had we been informed, we would have escorted and supported them and would not have allowed them to enter the heart of Bnei Brak, the center of the Jerusalem Faction, without accompaniment.”
Police Commissioner Danny Levy said officers would restore order and arrest everyone involved. “In the State of Israel there is law and it must be respected,” he said. “Anyone who raises a hand against soldiers or police officers, or overturns patrol cars, has a personal problem with me and with my organization.”
Police said 22 people were arrested during the unrest. According to a statement, rioters threw stones at officers, overturned a patrol car and set a police motorcycle on fire, along with tefillin that were on it. Two officers were injured. Stun grenades were used to disperse the crowd, and a helicopter was deployed to the area.
Video from the scene showed hundreds of ultra-Orthodox men surrounding the soldiers as garbage bins were overturned and scattered across the street. In one instance, a man pushing a baby stroller was seen walking near officers as stun grenades were thrown, shouting at them to stop.
Police declared a district-wide emergency protocol, mobilizing forces from stations across the Tel Aviv District, and officers extracted the soldiers from the crowd.
IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir condemned the attack. “I view with severity and strongly condemn the attack on IDF soldiers who carried out a military mission earlier today in Bnei Brak,” he said. “Any harm to IDF soldiers by civilians is a serious crossing of a red line and the attackers must be dealt with firmly. I expect the law to be fully enforced.”
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also condemned the violence, calling it the actions of “an extreme minority” that does not represent the broader ultra-Orthodox community. “We will not allow anarchy, and we will not tolerate any harm to IDF servicemembers and security forces personnel who carry out their duties with dedication and determination,” he said.
Chief Rabbi Kalman Meir Bar denounced the violence, saying Jewish law strictly forbids raising a hand against another person and that the Torah’s ways are “ways of pleasantness and peace.”
Opposition leaders also sharply criticized the events. Former Prime Minister Naftali Bennett called the attack “anarchy” and said a “bright red line” had been crossed. He later visited Bnei Brak and said those responsible should be jailed as quickly as possible.
Opposition leader Yair Lapid called for immediate arrests, saying it was unacceptable for soldiers and police officers to be attacked and that those involved “must find themselves in prison today.”

Transcript: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," Feb. 15, 2025
The following is the transcript of the interview with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, that aired on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan" on Feb. 15, 2026.
ED O'KEEFE: We turn now to House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who joins us this morning from New York City. Leader Jeffries, thank you for being here.
DEMOCRATIC LEADER HAKEEM JEFFRIES: Good morning. Great to be with you.
ED O'KEEFE: So as this shutdown continues, I want to remind our viewers what it is, exactly, congressional Democrats are seeking to reopen the Department of Homeland Security. You want immigration agents to show IDs, to wear body cameras, take off their masks, stop racial profiling and seek judicial warrants to enter private property. Talks between the White House and congressional Democrats are continuing. Are you willing to compromise, to let any of these go, to get the government reopened?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, our value proposition is simple, taxpayer dollars should be used to make life more affordable for the American people, not brutalize or kill them, as we horrifically saw in Minneapolis with the cold blooded killings of Rene Nicole Good and Alex Pretti. We know, and the American people clearly know, that ICE is totally out of control and they need to be reined in. Because the American people deserve immigration enforcement that is fair, that is just, and that is humane. And so, we need dramatic change at ICE, including, but not limited to, the types of things that you laid out before any DHS funding bill moves forward.
ED O'KEEFE: With the exception of some flexibility on body cameras, because they're starting to spend some money to get those out there, some Republicans have rejected this list of policy reform proposals. You guys still seem miles apart. So when, conceivably, will we see this resolved? And again, I ask you, if- are there any of these points that you're willing to let go in order to get the government reopened?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we're willing to have a good faith conversation about everything, but fundamentally we need change that is dramatic, that is bold, that is meaningful and that is transformational. And these are common sense things. For instance, judicial warrants should be required before ICE agents can storm private property or rip everyday Americans out of their homes. We need to make sure that there are actual independent investigations, so that if state and local laws are violated, in many cases, violently violated, that state and local authorities have the ability to criminally investigate and criminally prosecute anyone who has violated the law. Because we cannot trust Kristi Noem or Pam Bondi to conduct an independent investigation. We believe that sensitive locations should be off limits, sensitive locations like houses of worship, schools, hospitals or polling sites, and that fundamentally ICE should be targeting violent felons who are here unlawfully, as opposed to violently targeting law abiding immigrant families, which is completely inconsistent with what Donald Trump promised the American people he would do.
ED O'KEEFE: Right. And we, of course, this past week reported that about 14% of those detained had violent criminal records. About 60% of them were wanted on criminal records overall. But it was that 14%, violent criminals. Again, I just- it sounds like this is going to go on a while, because Tom Homan wasn't terribly flexible on anything, especially on the issue of warrants and masks. You're not ceding any ground. So there's a few things coming up here. For example, State of the Union is scheduled for a week from Tuesday. Should it be held if the Department of Homeland Security is shut down?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. It is certainly my hope--
ED O'KEEFE: --Sounds like you're going to get to it, though. I mean--
REP. JEFFRIES:--we can come to a resolution in advance of it. Well, here's the thing, the administration and Republicans have made a clear decision that they would rather shut down FEMA, shut down the Coast Guard and shut down TSA, than enact the type of dramatic reforms necessary so that ICE and other DHS law enforcement agencies are conducting themselves like every other law enforcement professional in the country. For instance, police officers don't use masks. County Sheriffs don't use masks. State troopers don't use masks. Why is it that ICE agents who are untrained, are being unleashed on American communities with this type of lawlessness, violence and brutality. Unacceptable, unconscionable, and it's un-American.
ED O'KEEFE: Yeah, and we went over this with Tom Homan a little earlier. Of course, they point out that assaults against ICE officers have gone up over 1,300% this past year, from about 275 compared to 19 the year before. So there are some legitimate concerns about those agents being targeted, but your broader point about--
REP. JEFFRIES: --We're going to- yeah--
ED O'KEEFE:-- whether or not law enforcement should behave the same as our law enforcement is heard.
REP. JEFFRIES: Yes, and we're going to continue, of course, to encourage the American people to exercise their constitutional rights, their freedom of assembly and their freedom of speech and their freedom of expression peacefully, as we saw overwhelmingly done in Minneapolis.
ED O'KEEFE: All right, well we'll stay tuned on the shutdown and the negotiations. Let me ask you a few other things while we have you. First of all, you're a member of the Gang of Eight who gets briefed on national security matters. The Pentagon is reportedly planning for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if diplomacy fails and the president opts to attack. What do you know about those plans? Or what would you want to learn as a member of the Gang of Eight?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, the administration, as has been the case since the very beginning of this presidency, has been slow to provide information both to the Gang of Eight members of Congress, the legislative leadership and the top Democrats and Republicans on the Intel Committee and certainly hasn't provided a significant amount of information to Congress in general. These people within the administration, the extremists, they don't seem to believe that Congress is a separate and co-equal branch of government. We are. In fact, the power to declare war is exclusively given to Congress in Article I of the United States Constitution. Now, the American people want Donald Trump and Republicans to actually keep their promise and focus on driving down the high cost of living and fixing our broken health care system. It was Donald Trump, who promised, in fact, that costs will go down on day one. Costs haven't gone down. We're in the midst of an affordability crisis that hasn't been resolved. Perhaps the president should focus on making life better for the American people. Period. Full stop.
ED O'KEEFE: I hear you on that. I want to remind our viewers of the current tick tock tight margins in the House. You've got to net at least three seats to take the majority at this point. I want to play for you part of what you had to say about the 2026 elections when you were asked this past Thursday. Take a listen.
(BEGIN TAPE)
REP. JEFFRIES: We only need to net three. It's happening. Democrats are going to take back control of the House, and the only question is, what's the margin?
(END TAPE)
ED O'KEEFE: Right now, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee considers 44 of the 435 seats in the House in play, including, you just added five new ones this past week, South Central Virginia, a district in South Carolina, southern Minnesota, central Colorado and the at-large seat in Montana. Parts of the country where Democrats don't normally win elections, we should point out. So if the election were held today, at minimum, at minimum, how many seats do you see Democrats winning?
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, if the election were held today, we're taking back control of the House of Representatives, and I'm not convinced that it would necessarily be close. But these are battles that are going to be waged, district by district by district, we know we're winning seats now in deep red territory. We saw that in Miami in December, where we won the mayor's race for the first time in 30 years by 20 points. And then in January, of course, we flipped a seat in the Texas State Senate that Donald Trump had just won by 17 points. The Democratic candidate won it by 14. That was a 31 point over performance. And then just last weekend in Louisiana, we flipped the House seat that Trump had won by 14. We won that- or 13--
ED O'KEEFE: So you won it–
REP. JEFFRIES: --by 24 points. That was a 37 point over performance. My point is we're winning across the country, in blue states and purple states and red states, because the American people know we're the only ones focused on driving down the high cost of living, fixing our broken health care system and making sure that immigration enforcement is fair and just.
ED O'KEEFE: You've got to get at least three. Twenty to 25 seats, all 44 seats. What do you think right now? Give me a number.
REP. JEFFRIES: Well, I'm not in the prediction business. I'm in the let's win on behalf of the American people so we can end this national nightmare business.
ED O'KEEFE: All right. Leader Jeffries, to be continued on the shutdown and on the midterms. We appreciate you spending some time with us this morning. We'll talk to you soon, and we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.

Canada Begins Payments for New Batch of F-35As to Keep Its Place in Line

Canada has begun making initial payments for long-lead components required to produce 14 additional F-35A fighter jets.
AeroTime reported the move, citing Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney.
Together with the first batch of 16 F-35As already under contract, this brings the total number of aircraft in Canada’s production pipeline to 30. Under current plans, the first Canadian F-35As are expected to be delivered in 2026. They will be based in the United States, while Canada prepares the necessary infrastructure domestically.
During this period, Royal Canadian Air Force pilots and technicians will undergo training at U.S. bases. The aircraft are not expected to be stationed in Canada before 2029.
Responding in the House of Commons to Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet, who accused the government of inconsistency following Carney’s remarks at the World Economic Forum about strategic autonomy from the United States, the Prime Minister confirmed the payments. He said the step is intended to preserve options rather than serve as final confirmation of the full purchase.
“Yes, the government is paying a small amount to maintain options. It is good for our defense and helps preserve our negotiating position with the Americans,” Carney said.
So-called long-lead funding typically involves pre-ordering components that must be manufactured well before final assembly of the aircraft. This helps maintain production schedules and keeps procurement options open.
The confirmation comes amid a politically sensitive review of Canada’s fighter replacement program. Officials are considering scenarios that could reduce the overall F-35 purchase and potentially introduce a second aircraft type. Saab’s Gripen E is frequently cited as a possible alternative.

US Navy intercepts Iran-linked tanker in high seas operation

00:26:35 KST

ALBAWABA - On Sunday, the U.S. Department of Defense said that American military forces had tracked a sanctioned oil tanker from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, where they boarded it. Officials said this was part of a larger effort to stop illegal oil shipments linked to Venezuela.
The Pentagon says that U.S. forces boarded the ship Veronica 3 at night and followed what it called standard procedures for maritime visits, inspections, interdictions, and boarding. Officials said that the tanker tried to avoid being detained by orders from President Donald Trump.
"The vessel tried to defy the detention order, hoping to escape," the Pentagon said in a statement posted on X. It went on to say that U.S. forces followed the tanker as it moved through several maritime zones before intercepting it and stopping it in the Indian Ocean.
For years, the U.S. has put sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector. Allegedly, Venezuela has used a network of ships with fake flags, known as a "shadow fleet," to move crude oil into international markets.
In December, President Trump ordered the detention of sanctioned tankers to put more pressure on Nicolás Maduro, who was then President. Maduro was later arrested in January during a U.S. military operation.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) says that the Veronica 3, which flies the Panamanian flag, is subject to U.S. sanctions because of Iran.
The Pentagon has released video of American soldiers getting on the tanker. But defense officials didn't say for sure if the ship has been formally taken or put under U.S. control. The Pentagon told the Associated Press in a follow-up email that it had no more information than what was already in its public statement.
The interception is part of a larger plan by the U.S. to stop the flow of oil that is not allowed and make enforcement stricter in international waters.

Income Declarations in Leva, Payments in Euros: Bulgaria’s 2026 Tax Season Begins

Bulgaria has officially launched the 2026 tax campaign for income earned in 2025, and early results show strong public engagement. In the first few days, between January 10 and 12, over 40,000 citizens submitted their tax returns. The major change this year is the adoption of the euro: while taxpayers report income and claim deductions in leva, the actual payments are calculated and made in euros.
The National Revenue Agency’s (NRA) e-services portal remains the preferred method for filing, with more than half of users opting for the digital route. This includes submitting Appendix No. 10 to the annual return for claiming tax reliefs.
For most individuals, the campaign is already open, but traders, sole proprietors, and farmers using the simplified taxation regime have a submission window from March 1 to June 30. Refunds for tax reliefs are typically issued within a month, though in many cases they arrive within just a week. Tax reliefs are only recognized if the taxpayer has no outstanding obligations to the state. Experts recommend checking accounts through the Personal Identification Number (PIK) to avoid rejections due to unpaid taxes or fines.
Despite the transition to euros, the scope of tax reliefs remains unchanged, now recalculated for the new currency. Families can reduce taxes by up to 306.78 euros (600 BGN) for one child, 613.55 euros (1,200 BGN) for two, and 920.33 euros (1,800 BGN) for three or more. Children with disabilities allow a deduction of up to 613.55 euros (1,200 BGN). Young families with at least one spouse under 35 can deduct mortgage interest on the first 51,129.19 euros (100,000 BGN) of the loan principal. Home renovation labor costs are deductible up to 1,022.58 euros (2,000 BGN). Individuals with reduced work capacity of 50% or more can lower their annual taxable income by 4,049.43 euros (7,920 BGN).
Long-term financial planning continues to be encouraged. Personal contributions to voluntary pension, health insurance, and life insurance policies reduce the tax base by up to 10% per category. Donations to hospitals, social institutions, the Bulgarian Red Cross, and cultural organizations allow reductions of up to 65% of the tax base. Additionally, citizens who primarily operate cashless, using at least 80% of their income through card or bank transfers, qualify for a specific tax bonus.

DOJ memo with list of names further muddies water in Epstein case

A Justice Department letter explaining redactions in newly released files tied to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has put a spotlight on an extensive list of public figures named in the documents, intensifying criticism from lawmakers who say the approach obscures rather than clarifies accountability.
The six-page letter, first reported by Politico and later detailed by The Hill, was sent to the leaders of the Senate and House Judiciary committees as required by law.
It outlines the categories of redactions applied to the Epstein files and includes a compilation of “government officials and politically exposed persons” referenced anywhere in the materials.
According to the Justice Department, the list encompasses individuals mentioned in a wide range of contexts, from direct communications with Epstein or his longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell to indirect references such as media clippings or third-party reporting.
The letter does not specify how or why each name appears, nor does it distinguish between substantive involvement and incidental mention.
That lack of context has fueled bipartisan frustration. Lawmakers argue that placing well-known figures on a single list – without explanation – risks conflating people connected to criminal conduct with those named only tangentially.
The list includes numerous high-profile names, including President Donald Trump, despite no accompanying details about the nature of their appearance in the files.
Rep. Ro Khanna said the department was “purposefully muddying the waters on who was a predator and who was mentioned in an email,” criticizing the decision to group unrelated figures together without clarification. He urged the department to release the full records while redacting only survivors’ identities.
"To have Janis Joplin, who died when Epstein was 17, in the same list as Larry Nassar, who went to prison for the sexual abuse of hundreds of young women and child pornography, with no clarification of how either was mentioned in the files, is absurd," he added.
He urged officials to "Release the full files. Stop protecting predators. Redact only the survivor's names."
The controversy follows complaints from members of Congress who reviewed unredacted materials at a Justice Department facility this week and said large portions were masked unnecessarily.
Department officials have defended the redactions as necessary to protect victims and sensitive information, while acknowledging that the list was intended to provide transparency about who is referenced in the files.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche criticized lawmakers who publicly disclosed some previously concealed names, arguing that doing so “forced the unmasking of completely random people” with no meaningful connection to Epstein or Maxwell. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon echoed that view, accusing critics of elevating political considerations over due process.
Separately, Rep. Nancy Mace challenged the department’s legal justification for withholding additional details, questioning whether claims of work product privilege would withstand judicial scrutiny.

Over 10,000 One-Day Vignettes Sold in Bulgaria’s First Week

Bulgaria has seen strong initial interest in its newly introduced one-day vignette, with over 10,000 sold in the first week of availability. According to the Road Infrastructure Agency (API), from the official launch at midnight on February 3, 2026, a total of 10,018 short-term vignettes were purchased. Sales peaked over the weekend, with 4,054 vignettes sold in two days, slightly higher on Sunday at 2,096 compared to Saturday’s 1,958.
The one-day vignette, priced at 8 leva (approximately 4.09 euros), grants access to the republican road network for a 24-hour period starting from the exact time of activation. For example, a vignette bought at 10:00:00 is valid until 09:59:59 the following day. Like other electronic vignettes, it can also be purchased in advance, up to 30 days before the intended journey.
This short-term vignette is designed for passenger vehicles up to 3.5 tons, as well as caravans, camping cars of category M1, and trailers. Drivers should note that a separate vignette for a trailer or caravan is only required if the combined weight of the vehicle and trailer exceeds 3.5 tons. In such cases, users can select different durations for the two vignettes according to their needs.
The introduction of the one-day vignette follows amendments to the Roads Act approved last summer. Prices for all vignettes in 2026 remain unchanged from the previous year. For convenience, payment amounts are displayed in both leva and euros, with conversions handled automatically at the official fixed rate, requiring no additional action from motorists.

US plans to stay in NATO, Rubio says
According to Ukrinform, he said this at a press conference with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.
"As for NATO, I don't understand – the United States has thousands and thousands of troops deployed to the NATO mission. And we've made very clear, I think it was made very clear at the summit just a few days ago or at the meeting of the defense minister level. We are not leaving NATO. We are not leaving," Rubio said.
He noted that the redeployment of troops from one country to another has always taken place.
Rubio added that there is no more important duty for any state than the ability to defend its people and its country.
Rubio said that that was why they talked about the importance of NATO partners having the appropriate capabilities. He added that the stronger their allies are, the stronger they all are together.
As previously reported, Volodymyr Zelensky and Marco Rubio discussed strengthening Ukraine's air defense and the next steps in negotiations in a trilateral format during talks in Munich.

The findings from five European governments that Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was killed with poison are “troubling,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday.
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday that Russia poisoned Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, leading to his death in a penal colony two years ago. Moscow dismissed the accusation.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” news agency Reuters quoted Rubio as telling reporters at a press conference in Slovakia on Sunday.

Türkiye sends drillship to Somalia for first overseas mission
Energy minister calls deployment historic step in offshore push
MERSIN, Türkiye
Türkiye on Sunday dispatched its deep-sea drillship Cagri Bey to Somalia for its first mission abroad, a move Energy and Natural Resources Minister Alparslan Bayraktar called a historic step in the country’s offshore energy drive.
Speaking at a ceremony at Tasucu Port in Mersin, Bayraktar said the vessel is expected to reach Mogadishu in about 45 days and begin drilling in April at the Curad-1 well.
Türkiye and Somalia signed agreements in 2024 covering onshore and offshore oil and gas exploration. The seismic vessel Oruc Reis previously completed surveys in three offshore blocks.
With the addition of Cagri Bey and Yildirim, the number of drillships in Türkiye’s fleet has risen to six, Bayraktar said. Together with the seismic vessels Oruc Reis and Barbaros Hayrettin Pasa, Türkiye now has the world’s fourth-largest offshore exploration fleet, he said.
Since the beginning of the year, Türkiye has signed strategic agreements with US-based ExxonMobil and Chevron and UK-based BP in oil and gas exploration, Bayraktar said. Another overseas offshore partnership agreement with an international company is planned for next week, he added.
Bayraktar said Türkiye aims for its national oil company to reach production of around 500,000 barrels of oil and gas per day by 2028, with a longer-term goal of increasing capacity to 1 million barrels per day.
“I firmly believe that Cagri Bey, which we are assigning to search for oil outside our territorial waters for the first time, will elevate Türkiye-Somalia relations to a higher level,” Bayraktar said, wishing the crew a safe and successful mission.

"The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine —hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
No further details were provided.
On February 9, the Pentagon reported the interception of the Aquila II tanker in the Indian Ocean that was allegedly operating in violation of Washington's sanctions.

The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Pentagon used Anthropic’s AI model, Claude, as part of its operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
The newspaper cites people familiar with the matter, saying the Department of War leveraged Claude in last month's raid as part of a technology suite provided by Palantir, another American technology company used extensively by the United States government.
Both the Wall Street Journal and Axios report that someone at Anthropic asked someone at Palantir how exactly Claude was used in the operation.
Technology correspondent Peter O'Brien breaks down what it means for the company that positions itself as a champion of AI safety.

Syria heading in 'positive direction,' trajectory must be maintained: US Secretary of State Rubio
'No one here has ever disputed that the challenge of Syria were going to be a very significant one,' says Marco Rubio
ISTANBUL
Syria is moving in a positive direction despite significant challenges, and the current trajectory must be maintained, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday, defending the Trump administration's decision to work with the new administration.
"No one here has ever disputed that the challenge of Syria were going to be a very significant one," Rubio told reporters alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia. He was addressing Republican congressional concerns about Syrian leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, who took charge after the 2024 ouster of Bashar al-Assad, potentially moving "backwards."
US Special Envoy for Syria Tom Barrack briefed congressional committees last week with transparency about the difficulties involved, Rubio said, adding: "But we think it's headed in a positive direction, even though it's been tested."
"Is it going to be easy? No. Is it going to be difficult? Absolutely. Is it going to have ups and downs and good days and bad days? No doubt about it," he said, noting there have been some difficult days. "We like the trajectory. We have to keep it on that trajectory."
Rubio outlined two options the US administration faced regarding Syria: allowing the country to fragment into chaos with mass migration, terrorism and Iranian influence, or working with Syrian authorities.
"Guess what? We chose number two," he said, arguing the current outcome "is far better than a Syria that would have been broken up ... with all kinds of fighting going on."
He detailed actions taken to prevent ISIS (Daesh) prisoners from escaping, crediting US President Donald Trump's personal engagement with his Syrian counterpart.
Rubio said Trump urged a halt to fighting to enable transfer of thousands of ISIS prisoners who "could have broken out and created havoc and chaos."
"Al-Sharaa did it. He's kept his word up to this point," Rubio said, noting prisoners have been moved to Iraq, preventing them "running crazy all over the place and threatening us in the future."
ISIS detainees had been released by the YPG/SDF terror group from the al-Shaddadi prison in northeastern Hasakah province in January, according to the Syrian Interior Ministry, which held the terror organization responsible. The Syrian government recaptured all prisoners.

Lindsey Vonn is preparing to fly back to the US with more surgeries to come, team official tells AP
The chief of the U.S. Ski Team says Lindsey Vonn is preparing to fly back to her home country a week after her terrifying head-over-heels crash in the Olympic downhill

Lindsey Vonn was preparing to fly back to her home country on Sunday after her terrifying head-over-heels crash in the Olympic downhill, the U.S. Ski Team's chief told The Associated Press.
Sophie Goldschmidt, president and CEO of the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association, told the AP the team’s medical staff has been coordinating Vonn’s recovery since the crash and subsequent helicopter evacuation at the Milan Cortina Games and would try to accompany her home. Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
“We’re working through all of that at the moment,” Goldschmidt said. “We’ve got a great team around helping her and she’ll go back to the U.S. for further surgeries.”
Spectators tuning in to see Vonn attempt to win a medal at age 41 with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were thrown into shock when the American standout got hooked on a gate 13 seconds into her run – resulting in a spinning, air-born crash that sent her careening down the Dolomite mountain.
“The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury,” said Goldschmidt, who was in attendance for the fall. “There’s a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.
“I mean putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes actually on the broadcast it’s really hard to get that across,” Goldschmidt added. “Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won’t have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports.”
Vonn herself has no regrets.
“When I think back on my crash, I didn’t stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences,” Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. “I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.
“But just because I was ready, that didn’t guarantee me anything. Nothing in life is guaranteed. That’s the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don’t try you’ll never know,” Vonn added.
Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, “She’s not in pain. She’s in a stable condition.
“She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way,” Goldschmidt said. “But what she’s done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they’re winning.”

The findings from five European governments that Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was killed with poison are “troubling,” U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Sunday.
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday that Russia poisoned Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, leading to his death in a penal colony two years ago. Moscow dismissed the accusation.
“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” news agency Reuters quoted Rubio as telling reporters at a press conference in Slovakia on Sunday.

Hiam Abbass says 'cinema is a political act' after Berlin row

Palestinian actress Hiam Abbass says 'cinema is a political act' after Berlin festival row
The start of this year's Berlin Film Festival was marked by a row over how far film should venture into politics but for prominent French-Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass, "everything we do is a political act".
Abbass is starring in two films being presented at this year's Berlinale festival and in an AFP interview she emphasised the importance of a politically engaged approach to cinema.
At Thursday's opening press conference jury president Wim Wenders sparked controversy by saying "we cannot really enter the field of politics", in response to a question about Germany's support for Gaza.
"I don't agree," Abbass told AFP.
"There's a lack of courage among people in the film world - among some, not all," said Abbass, who gained global attention for her role as Marcia Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.
She recognised that Wenders's remarks were "taken out of context", as he did talk about cinema's capacity to "change the world", albeit in a different way from party politics.
Nevertheless, Abbass said she was glad to see filmmakers at this year's festival "commit to amplifying stories and voices of minorities, oppressed people, people experiencing bombardment, genocides".
"Today more than ever, if we don't tackle these subjects, we're making art for art's sake, and that's something that doesn't interest me."
'Act of resistance'
Abbass, who was born in Nazareth, l but has been living in France for 37 years, stars in two films at the festival with striking political messages.
"In a Whisper" by Tunisian director Leyla Bouzid addresses the issue of LGBTQ life in Tunisia, where same-sex relationships are illegal.
"In some Arab countries, it's really a very sensitive subject and we need to talk about it," says Abbass, while noting that homophobia is by no means confined to that part of the world.
In "Only Rebels Win" by Lebanese filmmaker Danielle Arbid, Abbass plays a Christian Palestinian living in Beirut who faces a backlash from those around her because of her relationship with a South Sudanese Muslim migrant 40 years her junior.
Israeli bombardments between September and November 2024 forced the production to relocate from Beirut to a studio near Paris, where the team deployed creative solutions to recreate the Lebanese capital.
Abbass said the circumstances turned the film into "an act of resistance".
When the bombardment of Beirut began, "I told Danielle: 'Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll follow you, because this film has to get made'."
Academy's 'open-mindedness'
Before starting on "Only Rebels Win", Abbass had just finished working on "Palestine 36" by Annemarie Jacir, a depiction of the Palestinian uprising against the British Mandate in 1936.
That film almost did not happen because of the war in Gaza, which has killed over 72,000 Palestinians according to the health ministry in the enclave. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has been labelled as genocidal by the UN, experts and several world leaders.
Abbass said that the "the film waited eight months so that it could be shot," with production forced to move to Jordan instead of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Abbass said that the team decided that "at a certain point, we couldn't keep being subject to" the decisions of the Israeli government.
She also welcomed the Academy's decision to include three films highlighting the Palestinian experience in its shortlist for best international feature film: "Palestine 36", Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab" and Cherien Dabis's "All That's Left of You".
Only Kaouther Ben Hania's film ultimately made the final list of five nominees.
But Abbass praised the "open-mindedness" of the Academy to bring these films "almost to the final stages of the Oscars" after Israel's miliary onslaught in Gaza.

Iran’s top general warns Trump new war would be 'lesson'

Iran’s top military commander warned Sunday that any US war against Tehran would serve as “a lesson” for President Donald Trump, as tensions continue to simmer in the region.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said that the US president should understand he would be entering “a lesson-giving battle.”
Trump said on Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen,” as tensions escalate amid the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
He announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, would soon head to the region in case ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran fail.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” he said. “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
Rising tensions
The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the Gulf region, having been dispatched last month amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Mousavi described Trump’s comments as “unworthy of a president” and “reckless.”
He said that if Trump intends to wage war, he should not speak of “negotiations,” referring to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy between the two sides that resumed earlier this month.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on February 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Diplomatic channels
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, according to Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who confirmed the meeting in an interview on Sunday.
He said Washington must demonstrate its commitment to reaching an agreement aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said. “If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”

Iran questions US intentions on war, "Promises the end of US hegemony"

ALBAWABA - The head of Iran's military has given U.S. President Donald Trump a stern warning, saying that any military action against Tehran would hurt Washington's position as the world's most powerful country. Iran is getting ready for another round of talks with the US about nuclear issues in Geneva.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, the head of Iran's armed forces, said that any fight with Iran would teach Trump what he called a "historic lesson." He said that a war would effectively end America's ability to control the world. Mousavi also asked why Trump talks about negotiations if he wants to start a fight.
Doubt About the Geneva Talks
Iranian officials, on the other hand, have lowered expectations for the talks that are coming up. Ebrahim Rezaei, who is on the Iranian Parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said that Tehran isn't too hopeful about how the talks in Geneva will go.
Rezaei says that the Iranian delegation has come up with a list of proposals for the talks. He did, however, stress that Iran will not agree to stop enriching uranium during this round or send its stockpile of enriched uranium to other countries. He went on to say that the United States has accepted these limits and made it clear that the talks in Geneva will not be about Iran's missile program or its policies in the region.
Continued Diplomatic Efforts
On Tuesday, Oman will lead talks in Geneva about Iran's nuclear program and other ways to lower tensions. Oman hosted indirect talks between the two sides earlier this month, on February 6. On the same day, President Trump said that more talks would happen "early next week," but he didn't say when or where.
Washington and Israel keep saying that Iran is trying to get nuclear weapons, but Tehran says that its nuclear activities are only for peaceful purposes, like making electricity.
Iran has said many times that it would respond strongly to any military action and that Western sanctions must be lifted in exchange for limits on its nuclear program.

US not planning to leave NATO — Rubio

BRATISLAVA, February 15. /TASS/. The United States is not going to withdraw from NATO, with thousands of American soldiers taking part in the alliance’s mission, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.
"We're not leaving NATO. We may move a couple thousand troops from one country to another, but this has always been the case," he told a news conference after talks with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in Bratislava, when asked to comment on the United States’ status within NATO amid reports on the reduction of US forces deployed to Europe.
According to Rubio, Washington does not view European countries’ bigger influence within NATO as a negative thing and wants to see Europe as a partner rather than its subordinate. "We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States. We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. We want to work with our allies. We want to work in cooperation with you," he said.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said earlier this week that it would take time to reduce the number of US troops stationed in Europe. In his words, Washington wants to "pivot more towards Asia."
In 2025, the Pentagon redeployed a brigade from the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army from Romania back to its home base in the state of Kentucky.
Late in 2025, the US Congress approved a defense budget that explicitly barred the Pentagon from reducing the number of American troops stationed in Europe below 76,000 for more than 45 days.

BRATISLAVA, February 15. /TASS/. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has spoken in favor of dialogue between the West and Russia.
"We must engage in dialogue with Russia. We must engage in dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin," he said at a joint news conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, as quoted by the TA-3 television channel.
According to Fico, a direct dialogue with the Russian leadership will promote the soonest settlement of the conflict in Ukraine. The crisis could have been ended three months after its outbreak but "some Western politicians" hampered this, he recalled.
He slammed the European Union’s decision to issue a 90-billion-euro loan to Ukraine, with 60 billion of this sum to be spent to purchase weapons. Sanctions, in his words, will not be able to stop the advance of Russian forces. He also said that the European Union is now in a profound crisis.

President Herzog to press for anti-gun legislation, meets with Arab victims of violent crime

President Isaac Herzog announced on Sunday that he will press for anti-gun legislation.
Contrary to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who advocates that security can be better assured if more civilians have gun permits, Herzog believes that the more guns there are in civilian hands, the greater the security risk.
The president made this point repeatedly on Sunday, when addressing a delegation of bereaved Arab parents, grandparents, siblings, and other relatives whose loved ones were murdered over the past two to three years.
Herzog said that every local authority should make the banning of guns and violence of any kind a top priority. It is a terrible thing, he said, when one human being shoots another for the purpose of killing them.
The delegation, comprising mostly women, included three men and was led by Qasem Awad, a former mayor of Tamra whose son, Dr. Abdullah Awad, was brutally murdered while treating patients at a health clinic in Kfar Yasif.
Awad previously met with Herzog when the president, alarmed by the escalation of violence in Arab society, visited Sakhnin on January 29.
“We Arabs love you because you tell the truth and we need people to listen to you and to listen to us,” Awad told Herzog when they met again on Sunday.
'We are all law-abiding citizens - help us'
Awad reiterated what other prominent Arab citizens have said: they cannot fight this battle alone.
“We need the help of the Jewish people,” the former mayor said, adding that many Jews are already supporting the struggle against violence in the Arab sector.
Speaking primarily of his own family, but also in reference to the families of the delegation, Awad said, “We are all law-abiding citizens. Help us. Tell us what to do.” The meeting as such was extremely emotional as each member of the delegation told the story of a close relative whose needless death had created an extreme void within the family.
One of the most touching of these stories was of a woman whose abusive husband kept telling her that he was going to throw her out. The woman reported him to the police, who took no action. Two days later, she was dead, leaving behind three children aged 15, seven, and nine months. This was one of the rare cases in which the police later apprehended the perpetrator, said the dead woman’s sister, “But now there are three orphans without a mother or a father.”
Herzog was visibly upset by this information, instructing his staff to obtain full details so the story could be widely published.
One of the delegates told Herzog that in Arab society, when a woman is killed, it is usually because she is perceived as having besmirched the family’s honor. Nevertheless, none of the murdered females related to members of that specific delegation were victims of honor killings; none had done anything that could have invited malice or embarrassed their families.
Herzog was asked throughout the morning to help do away with violence. Members of the delegation refused to accept that his position is merely ceremonial and not executive, telling him he has the influence to effect change.
Almost every speaker reported police inaction, saying law enforcement showed little if any interest in any case involving Arab victims, and failed to provide information.
Due to the frequency of violent killings, children panic in fear whenever they hear gunfire, said one of the delegates.
There was also an inference to racism. More than one delegate noted that “Arab blood is no less important than Jewish blood.”
Herzog said that the violence and killing in Arab society are a stain on both the government and the nation. The president pledged to do his utmost to make legislators aware that what has evolved is not just an Arab problem, but a national issue that affects all sectors of Israeli society.

Turkey opens three mosques in Gaza as Ankara expands religious influence

Turkey’s Diyanet Foundation has opened three mosques in Gaza, according to Turkish state-run broadcaster TRT. A video online showed members of the Turkish charity in blue vests assisting in refurbishing and reopening the mosques.
The report said that the work is designed to enable suitable places for worship during Ramadan. This is part of Ankara’s efforts to increase its influence in Gaza.
According to the report, the organization opened the Abdullah Azzam Mosque in the Sabra neighborhood of Gaza, the Huda Mosque in Jabalya’s refugee camp, and the al-Isra Mosque in the Sheikh Radwan neighborhood. These areas were heavily damaged during the Israel-Hamas War.
Regarding the name given to the first mosque listed, Abdullah Yusuf Azzam was an Islamist jihadist of Palestinian and Jordanian background. Although this was not made clear in the broadcast, it appears that the mosque was indeed named after him.
According to a paper by the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, “While al-Qaeda and Hamas have become household terms, far less familiar is the man behind the idea of al-Qaeda, the Palestinian Sheikh Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, who also did much to support the establishment and entrenchment of Hamas.”
A mosque with a similar name is also located in Nuseirat in central Gaza.
The mosques serve as a foundation of 'brotherhood'
The Diyanet Foundation states on its website that it has conducted work on nine mosques in “Palestine,” but does not mention the three most recent ones. The organization said that it works to build mosques that serve as a foundation of “brotherhood.”
It also noted that “today, mosques are rising with the efforts of the Presidency of Religious Affairs and our foundation to deliver the Adhans [the mosque’s calls to prayer] to every corner of our country and every continent of the earth with the donations made by our beloved nation.”
The work is clearly government-backed and part of Ankara’s mission to engage with Islamic communities worldwide.
To this end, Turkey is working to grow its influence in Gaza. One way it does this is via religious charities. The organization noted that the “Diyanet Foundation, which was established to support the activities of the Presidency of Religious Affairs, delivering religious services to a wider audience and raising the next generation who will take part in religious services, has become a significant civil society movement in our country today.”
The foundation has “1,003 branches and a wide range of activities and international aid activities in 149 countries around the world, from education to culture, social and charitable services to supporting religious services.”
Fidan met with Ali Shaath
In another sign of Ankara’s growing involvement, Turkey’s Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan also met with Ali Shaath of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG). This is the technocratic Palestinian organization that the Board of Peace backs to transition governance in Gaza away from Hamas.
In the past, Ankara has hosted Hamas leaders for meetings and backed Hamas. It is unclear whether this meeting represents a change.
Citing diplomatic sources, Turkey’s state-run media reported that Fidan received Shaath in the Turkish capital.
TRT went on to say, “The NCAG, formed after the October ceasefire in Gaza, is a Palestinian governance body under recent peace efforts to oversee Gaza’s civil administration and reconstruction, with Turkey offering diplomatic backing and humanitarian support to help stabilize and rebuild the besieged enclave.”
Further, “The NCAG said on Saturday that preparations for handing over the institutions of the sector pave the way for its management during the transitional phase.”
Per that same report, “Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the removal of obstacles” to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, and the NCAG “considered that the statements issued from within the sector regarding the readiness to hand over all public institutions pave the way for enabling the committee to fully assume its responsibilities in managing the transitional phase.”
The meeting with Shaath and the support for mosques in Gaza are part of the multi-pronged efforts by Ankara to increase its influence and also maintain its current level of control in Gaza.

IDF links Hamas command activity to Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza

The Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza, which Doctors Without Borders has left, is not just a weapons storage spot for terror, but a full-fledged Hamas headquarters, the IDF said on Sunday.
"For over two years, the IDF and the defense establishment have warned about the cynical use by terrorist organizations in Gaza of hospitals and humanitarian shelters as human shields to conceal terrorist activity," stated the military.
Following the statement made by Doctors Without Borders, "regarding the reduction of its operations due to the presence of armed individuals, the IDF indeed possesses intelligence indicating that Nasser Hospital is being used as a headquarters and military post for senior Hamas commanders and operatives in southern Gaza."
"This is an important decision, but one that comes too late. This is further proof that reinforces the necessity for the disarmament of the Hamas terror organization," concluded the IDF.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Saturday announced the suspension of all noncritical medical operations in Nasser Hospital after reports emerged of armed men using the facility to move weapons and interrogate patients.
“In recent months, in Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital,” the nonprofit organization said in a statement published on its website.
It also specified that these situations occurred in parts of the medical compound where the MSF is not conducting activities.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts – including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” MSF said, adding that “these incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
The organization said that “MSF formally expressed our strong concern to the relevant authorities, and emphasized the incompatibility of such violations with MSF’s medical mission. Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity, to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care.”
According to a Reuters report, this directive was also applied to several other hospitals in southern Gaza where armed men were spotted.
The Post visits Shifa Hospital
In November 2023, The Jerusalem Post visited Shifa Hospital in northern Gaza up close and saw the extensive, heavy, and regular weapons Hamas had been hiding there.
The stash included rocket-propelled grenades, large offensive drones capable of dropping grenades on soldiers, heavy rifles, and other weapons.
In addition, the Post entered the tunnel network Hamas had been using under Shifa Hospital, which included extensive rooms for various functions and branched in multiple directions to connect the area to other parts of northern Gaza and southern Gaza.

Rubio says US does not dispute Navalny poisoning assessment by Europeans

United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio called "troubling" a report by five European allies blaming Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs, adding that Washington had no reason to question it on Sunday.
"We obviously are aware of the report. It's a troubling report. We're aware of that case of Mr. Navalny and certainly... we don't have any reason to question it," Rubio told reporters at a news conference in Brastislava during a visit to Slovakia.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands on Saturday said analyses of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
Russia decries 'Western propaganda hoax'
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to Russia's state news agency TASS.
When asked why the United States did not join the statement, Rubio said this was an endeavor by them.
"Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. We chose - Doesn't mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn't our endeavor. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing with based on the intelligence they've gathered." Rubio said.
"We're not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there," he added.
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.

MSC: With Iran in crisis, is Europe just a spectator?

MSC: With Iran in crisis, is Europe just a spectator?
February 15, 2026Ongoing tensions in Iran featured prominently at this year's Munich Security Conference (MSC), coming after the Islamist regime's deadly crackdown on protesters, and with US President Donald Trump continuing to put pressure on Tehran to end its nuclear program.
As Iran's hardline rulers hang on to power after the largest anti-regime protests in decades, Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late Iranian king and a political activist-in-exile, was active at the conference, pleading his case for regime change in Iran.
At a panel about Iran's future on Friday, as well as at a press conference on Saturday, Pahlavi called out the Iranian regime's suppression of human rights, especially the brutal crackdown on citizens during the anti-regime protests in January, which rights groups say killed thousands of people.
Pahlavi, who many Iranians think can unite the nation against 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's government, even presented a roadmap at the MSC for Iran's political future and a "transitional government."
After a call to action from Pahlavi, some 250,000 people took part in a demonstration in Munich on Saturday against the Iranian regime and in support of a Pahlavi-led opposition.
"I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future," he said in a speech during the rally.
"I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box."
But the creation of any transitional government depends on the collapse of the current regime.
Despite the current unprecedented challenges to its power, the regime is carrying on and has also reportedly intensified its domestic oppression.
Still, there were extensive discussions at the MSC about the possibility of regime change in Iran.
Will the US strike Iran?
The Iranian opposition-in-exile has signaled that it expects the United States to launch strikes that would eventually result in the dismantling of the fundamentalist regime.
During the anti-regime protests, US President Donald Trump famously claimed that help was coming for Iranians.
Now the Trump administration is engaged in negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program, something which analysts say is unlikely to yield a clear result.
"I think a lot of Iranians inside and outside hope that an intervention that will neutralize the regime's instrument of repression will finally give us an opportunity for a final solution," Pahlavi said at an MSC panel, arguing that he was asking for a "humanitarian intervention" to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process.
After Trump stepped back from threats of military intervention over protest deaths, he returned to threats of force if the Iranian regime did not negotiate a new "deal" with the US on its nuclear program.
Last week, the US sent a second aircraft carrier strike group to the Arabian Sea, with Trump warning on Friday that it would be a "very bad day" for Iran if the regime does not make a deal.
Pahlavi admitted that the US president needs to give diplomacy a chance before opting for a military solution. He maintains that President Trump knows the Iranian people still believe in the president's promise made during the height of the demonstrations in January.
However, Karim Sadjadpour, a policy analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said regime change is easier said than done.
"Everybody in Washington, including President Trump, thinks that if they could push a button and get rid of the Iranian regime, they absolutely would," he told an MSC panel, adding that the Trump administration is possibly concerned about fallout such as that seen after US military intervention in Iraq and Libya.
However, Sadjadpour didn't rule out the possibility of a US strike on Iran.
"In 2018, Trump left the [2015] nuclear deal. In 2020, he assassinated Qassem Soleimani [military leader and Khamenei's close aide]. Last summer, he dropped 14 bunker-busters on Iran's nuclear facilities," Sadjadpour said, adding he believes that the chances of Trump striking Iran are higher than the two sides reaching a nuclear deal.
Europe prefers diplomacy to force
As the US continues to put pressure on the Iranian regime with the threat of force, the EU has urged deescalation, and has shown preference towards using sanctions and offering support for civil society within Iran.
In January, when the Trump administration seemed close to striking Iran, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told a press conference alongside EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas that the Iranian people "don't want regime change forced by external powers" and warned of unforeseen consequences.
Kallas said history is "full of examples" where regimes have been toppled, "but the question is what comes after."
"You need the alternatives, really from inside, to have a functioning state."
For Iran's exiled crown prince Pahlavi, the Europeans holding off on endorsing US military action against the regime could be seen as equivalent to doing nothing to help force the regime out.
Although Europe plays a major role in sanctioning Iran over its nuclear program, should the US strike the regime, statements at the MSC offered no clarity on what stance Europe would take, as officials have continued to emphasize diplomacy over use of force.
In 2015, major European powers helped broker a landmark agreement aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear program, particularly uranium enrichment, in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.
The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) was signed in July 2015 between Iran and the P5+1 countries (US, UK, France, China, Russia, plus Germany).
It was dubbed as "horrible" and "one sided" by Trump, who pulled the US out of the deal in 2018 during his first term as president, much to the consternation of Washington's European partners.
As Trump pushes for a new nuclear deal with Iran, with a military option on the table, the Europeans may be forced to wait and see.
"The starting point must be the Iranian people demanding freedom, and Europe must align its actions with that reality," said European Parliament President Roberta Metsola at the MSC.
She argued that the EU's decision to designate Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization marks a turning point, adding that the time for "routine diplomacy" was over.
"Europe must send a clear signal to those risking their lives in protest: We stand with you," she stressed.
No more business as usual with Iran?
Last year, Europe also reimposed UN sanctions on Iran, citing Tehran's violations of the 2015 JCPOA nuclear agreement, piling more financial pressure on the regime. The protests in January were partly driven by economic grievances including high unemployment and inflation.
Rafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), has admitted that business as usual with Iran might not be possible anymore. After the US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in July 2025, Tehran stopped cooperating with the IAEA.
"This cannot go on forever. There is a political situation here … on our part, we have been making some progress, but these [nuclear] facilities are there, nuclear material is there — notably highly enriched uranium, which we must continue to monitor. So everything goes in parallel," Grossi underlined.
Another round of nuclear talks between US and Iranian representatives is due in Geneva next week with Oman again serving as mediator.

Jess Phillips calls for Epstein files to be catalyst for long-term legislative change

Institutions can be persuaded to take action on violence against women and girls only when some sort of “calamity” or “political scandal” hits the headlines, Jess Phillips has said.
Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said she wanted to use the momentum from the Jeffrey Epstein files to push for long-term legislative change and greater support for survivors, rather than quick-fix reactive policy announcements.
Writing for the Guardian, the Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley said: “If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims, we will have failed. Change is all that will suffice.
“The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term. I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the [violence against women and girls] strategy with investment and system change at its heart, but we mustn’t let even that stand still, it must stretch when ambitions are met and it must never only be pulled out and waved around or cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.”
She said she felt “weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress”, and criticised an attitude of “bleed first and act second”.
Phillips said Epstein’s victims deserved for the government ensure that “those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again”. She called for investment in prevention so there was “less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today”.
“I have worked on this issue under many governments, it always felt a bit one-tone, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment to halve violence against women and children,” she wrote.
There needed to be more than a “commitment” and instead an aim that was “actually achievable and practically measurable” in order to hold the government to account and create a sense of focus, she added.
To achieve this, Phillips suggested that the NHS should prioritise abuse in the same way as diabetes; schools should be given tools to deal with how abuses affect their pupils to prevent them growing up as perpetrators of abuse or survivors; and addressing the £13bn lost annually in economic output to domestic abuse should be considered as a key component of improving economic growth and productivity.
On the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, said halving violence against women and girls over the next 10 years was “a priority and a mission” for Labour and across government departments.
“The real focus should be on Epstein’s victims, and also the work that this Labour government has been doing to tackle violence against women and girls,” Cooper said. “So that has to be about listening to women. It also has to be listening to survivors of violence.”

It always takes a calamity – a dreadful murder that reaches every front page, a mass paedophile ring being uncovered, or a political scandal unfolding – to make institutions sit up and act on violence against women and children. These windows of potential energy are never wasted by women’s rights activists. Historically, they have used them to build the #MeToo movement, to fight for legislation change and to push for greater resources for victims.
I’ve done it, many times – “never waste a crisis” is my mantra. In the past few weeks, while the nation’s attention has been on the political fallout from the Epstein files, I have seen the opportunity to push for more, for better. To move beyond the throwaway line about the victims being the most important thing – and to actually make them just that. Deeds not words are what matter. If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims, we will have failed; change is all that will suffice.
That said, I am weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress. I wish that systems and institutions didn’t need us to bleed first and act second. Women ask for this at times of calm, we shouldn’t have to scream.
When we were writing Labour’s violence against women and girls strategy, this was always at the forefront of my mind. The fact that we couldn’t once again just have some nice prepackaged policy that we could pull off a shelf when the going got tough. It had to be long-term, systemic change in our police, in our courts, in our health services, our armed forces, our housing, our schools. We had to start really focusing on preventing the terrible harm from happening in the first place, not just trying to make nicer plasters to cover up the cuts and bruises. We had to get other government departments to realise that the safety, security and wellbeing of half the population wasn’t just a Home Office issue.
I have worked on this issue under many governments – it always felt a bit one note, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment to halve violence against women and children. Of course, I want to end all violence against women and girls, just like I want world peace, but committing to that would be nothing more than a throwaway line, an aspiration, a pipe dream. Our aim had to be actually achievable and practically measurable.
No UK government has ever dared or cared to put a number on the problem before, because this issue has always been seen as too big to deal with or too likely to fail. Our target of halving violence against women and girls within a decade matters to me – it holds us to account, it focuses the minds of those with levers of power and demands that they pull them. Long-term, persistent, consistent, backaching and heartbreaking work is the only thing that is even going to remotely shift the dial on this issue.
The NHS has to take responsibility for the consequences of this abuse just as it would with diabetes. Schools must be given the tools to deal with how these incidents affect their pupils. If children grow up to be perpetrators of abuse or end up as victims, that will ruin their life chances and ability to function in the workplace more completely than not being good at maths. It’s no good having an engineering degree if you end up on the sex offender register – and the growing number of young people becoming perpetrators of these crimes should frighten us all.
Want to tackle growth and productivity? Well, the annual socioeconomic cost for domestic abuse alone is estimated to be £89bn, without even including, rape, sexual harassment, stalking and other abuses. I could go on and cover every area of policy in every government department that would fail if it didn’t stop and think about how this issue will undermine its progress. This is what this government is seeking to do, to really change this thing once and for all – to change the system, not just react.
Epstein’s victims don’t just need me to make sure no UK airport could ever be used to traffic them again. That loophole has been closed, and we will, of course, close any others we need to – but that isn’t enough. They need me to make sure that those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again. They need me to make it so there is less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today; they need me to make sure legislation stops abusers who use naked images and online hideaways to groom them in the first place. They need me to make sure that when they say that they have suffered, not only do they have recourse in the law – but also that their mental health is cared for with therapeutic and social support so that they can recover and live prosperous lives.
I will use the momentum of the current political attention on this subject to get more; I always do and always will. It’s how I have been trained to operate over decades, like the scrappy kid at the dinner table of a large family that I am. But I am damned if I will let these pinch-point moments be the only time those calls are heard. The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term.
I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the strategy with investment and system change at its heart; but even that we must stretch to meet our ambitions, and it must never only be cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.

‘I was so scared’: US trial witnesses allege Alexander brothers worked together to rape women

In their time as real estate brokers, the Israeli-American Alexander brothers – twins Alon and Oren and older brother Tal – were known as “closers”, the salesmen who could a get a sale over finish line, often to wealthy hedge funders who were then making hay in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.
Their technique, one real estate expert explained outside the 26th floor of the federal court house in lower Manhattan last week, was based on the sense that the property salesmen “were just like their clients” – young, eager and successful. Kim Kardashian and then-husband Kanye West, Jared and Ivanka Trump were clients.
And like many, they were party animals. Nightclubs in Manhattan, the Hamptons, Miami, Aspen, Tulum and Ibiza were seasonal stops. Tal and Oren, 38, were profiled in the New York Times on “How Two Luxury Real Estate Agents Spend Their Sundays”. The Wall Street Journal followed on the family’s $31m sale of their Miami beach home. US Vogue featured Oren’s wedding to a Brazilian model.
But a far nastier picture of their high life has been on display in court for the past few weeks, where the three brothers are on trial for sex trafficking. Prosecutors have accused each of the three brothers of violent, forcible rape of at least 10 women each and in some cases of threatening them if they spoke of their experiences.
The accomplished real estate “closers”, according to prosecutors, took no chances when it came to their pursuit of sex, and worked together in a conspiracy to lure, incapacitate and attack women.
The three brothers have pleaded not guilty and deny the allegations.
The civil case against Oren and his twin began in March 2024 when they were sued by Kate Whiteman, a woman who said she had met at a Manhattan nightclub in 2012. She claimed they had forced her into an SUV as she was leaving and drove her to the Hamptons, where she was assaulted at a party mansion called Sir Ivan’s Castle. A flood of similar allegations followed.
But Whiteman is not in court to testify. It was reported last month that she was found dead near Sydney late last year. Authorities in New South Wales have said the circumstances of Whiteman’s death “were found to be non-suspicious”.
As the trial entered its third week, the court heard from Abusshan Bodjnoud, a woman who testified that she witnessed an unidentified woman being raped by Tal, 39, and one of the twins in the Hamptons in May 2009. Bodjnoud told jurors she was in the house when a party of men returned and she saw Tal “dragging” a woman who “was not walking on her own” to the pool.
“Then the next thing I heard was a woman screaming and just asking people to stop,” she testified. She said she witnessed Tal and the twin “moaning” as they raped the woman in the hot tub.
Bodjnoud, who said she was “terrified” to intervene, said she had written “rapist” and “you need to apologize” on the brothers’ door before she left the house but acknowledged she had not called 911 and was warned that the Alexander brothers “were very powerful”.
A day earlier, jurors were shown text exchanges the government says showed that the brothers coordinated to secure drugs – including ketamine, Xanax, Ambien and GHB – they allegedly used to incapacitate women lured with the promise of luxury travel and exclusive experiences.
In one exchange from September 2011, Alon texted about an upcoming party, telling the recipient to “throw some panty dropper pills in the dishes sent to our table”. Attorneys for the defendants have described some of the references as “crude jokes.”
Maylen Gehret, who is suing Alon and Oren for sexual assault, told the court that Alon raped her in Aspen, Colorado, in 2017 when she was 17. She said she was at a club with two friends when Alon gave her a vodka cranberry. After a second drink, her head began to feel “really heavy” and she could “barely hold it up”.
The twin then allegedly took the girls to an empty hotel room and raped her in the bathroom. “It really hurt, and I was so scared,” Gehret testified.
During the prosecution phase of the case, other accounts have followed a similar path. But when the defense takes its turn, attorneys are set to argue that both the civil lawsuits and criminal allegations against the brothers are an intertwined conspiracy led by women seeking to extort them.
Outside court last week, their father Shlomi Alexander, who emigrated from Israel to the US to start a successful security company before branching into Miami real estate, claimed the cases had begun with a $35m effort to extort him.
Under cross-examination, defense attorneys have pressed witnesses on changes to their testimony, timelines, and claimed that prior statements don’t align with what the jury heard. Juda Engelmayer, a crisis PR consultant for the defendants, said the challenges to witnesses rarely make the headlines.
“The coverage often highlights the most sensational passages from direct, or the one line on cross where a witness confidently insists they ‘remember’ the single detail anchoring the allegation, while leaving out the broader credibility challenges unfolding in real time”, Engelmayer said.
In opening arguments last month, defense attorney Teny Geragos said the brothers were successful, arrogant young men “who liked and pursued women”, adding “that’s not trafficking. That’s dating. That’s hooking up.”
But she acknowledged the jury may frown upon their lifestyle and vulgar communications. “Two things can be true at once – you can disapprove of their lifestyle and still find them not guilty”, Geragos said before a courtroom packed with family and supporters of the brothers.

Progressive Texas organizers hail shock win as far-right Republicans left reeling

Chris Tackett started tracking extremism in Texas politics about a decade ago, whenever his schedule as a Little League coach and school board member would allow. At the time, he lived in Granbury, 40 minutes west of Fort Worth. He’d noticed that a local member of the state legislature, Mike Lang, had become a vocal advocate for using public money for private schools – despite the fact that Lang campaigned as a supporter of public education.
With a little research, Tackett found that Lang had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from the Wilks brothers and Tim Dunn, billionaire megadonors whose deep pockets and Christian nationalist views have consumed the Texas GOP. Tackett published his findings on social media, and soon enough, people started asking him to create pie charts of their representatives’ campaign funds. These charts evolved into the organisation See It. Name It. Fight It.
“There’s so many people out there that are so busy with their daily lives, they’re walking past and not even seeing some of these bad things going on,” he says. “So that’s the first step: you have to see this thing.”
Tackett and his wife Mendi, the organisation’s sole members, now live in Fort Worth, where they’re part of a scrappy community of progressives and anti-extremist organizers who are building momentum amid their town’s deeply embedded Christian nationalism. Tarrant county, in which Fort Worth is the largest city, provided a chilling preview of Texas’s gerrymandering efforts, and the county is widely regarded as a hotbed for far-right actors. But most recently, the county was the site of a Democratic victory that sent the Texas Republican party reeling.
Taylor Rehmet, a Democrat and local union leader, won a runoff for a state Senate seat that’s been held by Republicans since 1992. What’s more, he bested Republican Leigh Wambsganss despite having one-tenth as much money. Much of Wambsganss’s funding came from Dunn and the Wilks brothers.
Republicans blamed low turnout for Rehmet’s victory, while pundits opined that the Trump administration’s unpopularity was to blame. But people in Fort Worth say local organizing was central to the upset – and it will be key to any future victories in Texas, too.
Alexander Montalvo, a longtime grassroots organizer in Tarrant county, points to several examples where local advocates have successfully rallied for causes they believe. There was the pushback against a proposal to split a local school district. Then there were the school board elections last May, where every candidate endorsed by the Christian nationalist cellphone carrier Patriot Mobile lost their election. Patriot Mobile – where Wambsganss works as an executive – had previously racked up several wins across Tarrant county, effectively taking over multiple boards.
Now, after those May losses and Rehmet’s win, the company’s political influence is in doubt.
“There is something very local here in Tarrant county that is happening and that has been happening,” he says. “There is a collective groundswell that’s been building.”
Tackett says he’s in close contact with organizers like Montalvo and other Tarrant County residents who meet up for what’s called the “817 Gather”: a monthly meeting of people activated by the extremism that’s run rampant in their area.
“It’s a bunch of folks that are Black, brown, white, mostly progressive, but we’ve got a few folks that play into that former Republican space, as well,” he says. “It’s not about Republican versus Democrat. It’s really all about what we stand for, because we can agree that public education is foundational to the success of our democracy. We can agree that a person should have rights over their own body, and it should be easier to vote, not harder to vote.”
People have found their roles within this community, and in one way or another, their efforts always lead back to voting. Montalvo and fellow organizer EJ Carrion, one of the hosts of the local podcast the 817 Pod, frequently inspire large crowds for local city council and county commissioner meetings. The Tacketts publish social media videos spotlighting their concerned neighbors – often as they speak at those local meetings – and putting local extremists on display.
Before Rehmet’s victory, their organisation shared a video of Wambsganss appearing on the podcast of former Trump consigliere Steve Bannon. After the election, the Tacketts published a video breaking down how local Republicans reacted to the Rehmet victory at a meeting held the day after Rehmet’s win.
In the video, a candidate for Texas agriculture commissioner claimed Texas was at risk of falling under Sharia law. Others framed politics as a spiritual battle that will determine whether the US remains a Christian nation. That meeting was hosted by For Liberty & Justice, a local political organisation affiliated with a Fort Worth church called Mercy Culture which is seeking actively encourage conservative Christians to run for office and break down barriers between church and state in the US.
When it comes to Christian nationalism in Tarrant County, multiple people interviewed for this story say no institution looms larger than Mercy Culture.
“Mercy Culture is not just a church,” says Wesley Kirk, a lifelong Fort Worthian and one of the hosts of the 817 Pod. “It’s a political machine. They are organizing people. They are endorsing candidates.”
Chanin Scanlon, a former Fort Worth resident who recently moved to San Antonio, puts it bluntly.
“This is Christian nationalism,” she says. “It’s not subtle. They are very clear about what they want. They want to take over institutions.”
The Tacketts have used their popular social media presence to chronicle Mercy Culture’s rising influence. But Chris Tackett is also still making pie charts. After the Rehmet victory, he dove deep into the data to see if the narrative about low turnout was true. Turnout was down across the board, he found, which undermined the local GOP’s narrative that Republicans who stayed home were the ones to blame.
Using a voter score analysis, Tackett also found that 57% of runoff voters fell into one of two groups: true independents, or “Democratic-leaning voters who regularly vote in Republican primaries because, in ‘deep-red’ Texas, the GOP primary is the only election that matters in most cycles.” (Fifty-seven percent is the total percentage of the electorate that Rehmet won.)
“What we saw wasn’t massive Republican crossover,” he wrote. “It was Democrats – many of whom have been forced to play in GOP primaries for years – finally getting a meaningful choice and showing up.”
Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor, agrees with the idea that Democrats had a strong candidate to back in the runoff.
“I think they figured out the secret sauce to candidate recruitment,” he says of the Democratic party. “Being an authentic person goes a long way for voters these days.”
Montalvo, meanwhile, finds himself motivated by Tackett’s pie chart.
“There’s actually a big enough and a diverse enough base amongst Democratic voters in Tarrant county that if we actually invest in those communities, we have the votes to be able to win,” he says.

Even amid rising economic uncertainty, now is not the time to hug your job

After all the employee protests over the past few years – the “great resignations”, the “quiet quittings”, the “bare-minimum Mondays” and “coffee badgings” – we have finally arrived at “job hugging”.
Amid all the economic uncertainty and the rising costs of everything, people aren’t feeling as confident as they once were. Instead of slacking off while you hunt for something better, everyone’s scared about losing their jobs. With all the news about big corporate layoffs and the ominous and still-undefined threat of AI, it’s understandable that people are hugging their jobs.
A recent report from job search site Monster.com found that nearly half of employed workers say they’re currently staying in their roles longer than they otherwise might, for comfort, security or stability, with three-quarters expecting to remain in the same job for at least two more years.
“Workers are holding on tighter than ever, but not because they’re complacent,” said Vicki Salemi, a career expert at Monster. “It’s because they’re cautious. Job security and stability have become emotional safety nets. The new loyalty is about survival, not necessarily satisfaction.”
If you’re one of these job huggers, then take it from me: you’re killing your future.
I’m not saying you should leave your current job. If you really like the company you’re working at and the work that you’re doing and the people you’re working with, then good for you. But don’t just hug your job. Because – unless what you do doesn’t involve a computer – your job isn’t going to be the same in a very short period of time. It may not even exist at all. Tech companies are rolling out AI-based agents, bots and software that will – in the not-too-distant future – do everything from write press releases, answer customer questions, place orders and reconcile bank accounts. Hugging your existing job is like hugging your sick dog who’s about to be put down. There is no miracle that’s going to save either.
The good news is that your employer is just as confused as you. I’d love to make time stand still. But I see big changes coming for my business too, and I don’t have all the answers. My business depends on my people. I want them to come to me with solutions. I want them to have my back just as much they want me to have theirs. Hugging their existing job may prove their loyalty. But it’s not helping my business. I know that my business will have to adapt to the technology wave that’s fast coming. I’ll be loyal to any worker who is willing to step up and adapt along with me.
Which is why a job hugger hurts employers like me. People are so concerned about losing their job that they only think about what they can do for themselves and not my company. They make decisions to protect what they do. They don’t take risks. They avoid additional work. They are averse to taking chances. They’ll shun responsibility. This can only last for so long.
Business owners like myself are never “hugging” our jobs. We’re constantly looking for new ways to make money. Or cut costs. Or run more efficiently. Job hugging is a form of suicide. If we stay still, we die. It’s no different if you’re an employee.
If you’re not a big fan of the company, don’t just sit there. Look for something else while you still have your existing job. You’re much more marketable (and have a stronger negotiating position) when you’re still employed.
It may seem that clinging to stability is the safe way to go. But it’s a perilous long-term strategy. You’re not learning new skills. You’re not adapting. You’re not taking strategic risks. Job hugging is a losing strategy. Now is not the time to stand still.

Mexico’s Cuba Obsession Puts Its President in a Bind With Trump

Who truly benefits from the delay with Iran?

The standoff with the Islamic Republic of Iran has entered its sixth consecutive week of escalating rhetoric, mutual threats and visible shows of force. The US has continued what officials describe as an unprecedented military buildup in the region, led by the deployment of the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford. The move is expected to last at least three weeks.
Iran, for its part, has pressed ahead with propaganda videos and public displays of its military capabilities. At the same time, indirect negotiations are ostensarily underway, with a second round set to take place in Switzerland in midweek. Once again, there is a vast gap between the combative public declarations and rigid opening positions on both sides and the very fact of their meeting.
A key question is whether these talks are merely a tactic to buy time. Each side has its own interest in delay. For Washington, additional time allows for further force accumulation and the completion of operational planning. Tehran, meanwhile, appears to be betting that the longer the crisis drags on, the weaker the international legitimacy for a US strike will become. From the regime's perspective, the further events recede from the recent wave of domestic protests, the greater its chances of survival.
In my assessment, the American explanation appears more realistic, especially given the slim prospects of reaching even a minimal agreement on Iran's nuclear program. Such a baseline deal would require "zero enrichment" and the transfer of enriched material to a third country, let alone the far more complex issue of restricting and enforcing limits on Iran's ballistic missile arsenal.
Countdown to a decision
Public discourse in recent weeks has focused largely on one question: When will the US strike? As time passes and developments unfold, the possibility of defusing tensions without some form of military action, whether limited or extensive, seems to be fading.
Recent signals suggest that a countdown has begun toward the moment Trump decides to authorize that operation. While such a decision would not come as a surprise, its timing carries strategic significance. In June 2025, an Israeli strike carried out in full coordination with Washington took place just one day before scheduled talks between Iran and the US in Vienna, beyond the two-month ultimatum Trump had previously set.
Will history repeat itself, with another round of talks collapsing at the last minute due to military action? An answer may come as early as this week, possibly before the weekend, a time when Trump has often chosen to greenlight military operations over the past year.
Meanwhile, Iran continues to conduct itself as though the recent "12-day war" and the latest wave of protests never occurred, seemingly unaware that its current situation is the most precarious it has faced since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Whatever the timing of a potential strike, it will immediately shift attention to the "day after" and to a range of pressing short-term and long-term questions. In the immediate aftermath, how will Iran respond, and how broad will the confrontation become as a result? What targets will be hit, and how will those choices affect the duration of the conflict?
Over the longer term, equally weighty issues loom. Could military action trigger a renewed wave of protests leading to regime change, or to some other form of political transformation? Might the confrontation significantly alter the balance of power in the Middle East? From Israel's national security perspective, would the immediate threat posed by thousands of ballistic missiles, alongside the potential nuclear threat, truly be removed from the table?
Those who believed the central question was merely when the Americans would strike may soon find themselves disappointed. The day after a decision on military action, whenever it comes, will usher in a series of profound questions that are likely to linger for weeks to come.

National Museum of History of Ukraine calls on UNESCO to cancel Mendeleev Prize funded by Russia
According to Ukrinform, the corresponding statement was published on the museum's website.
"Ukrainian social media was stirred by a call for nominations for the UNESCO award, which carries the loud name 'The UNESCO-Russia Mendeleev International Prize in the Basic Sciences.' However, the announcement was published on the institution's website on January 7, 2026," the statement says.
The prize was initiated and is financed by the Russian government. It consists of a monetary award of $250,000 for each of the two winners. Each laureate also receives a gold medal and a diploma.
The decision to establish the prize was adopted by UNESCO in 2019.
So far, it has been awarded only twice, in 2021 and 2023, although it is presented as an annual prize.
Each time, one of the two awardees was a Russian scientist.
The international jury includes scientists from Spain, Germany, Russia, Mexico, India, Kenya, and Morocco.
According to the official information about the prize, "it also commemorates the remarkable scientific heritage of D. I. Mendeleev, father of the Periodic Table, whose work played a fundamental role in the future of chemistry, physics, biology, astronomy and geochemistry – but also in what is now termed sustainable development."
Particularly cynical in the eyes of Ukrainians is the following sentence from the prize's official page: "The prize was created to raise awareness of their role in creating peaceful and prosperous societies."
The National Museum of the History of Ukraine, as an institution that studies the methods Russia has used for centuries to promote narratives of its greatness, calls on UNESCO to cancel the prize and not contribute to the spread of Russian narratives.
Under the cover of the slogan "science beyond politics" and the name of a scientist who lived more than a century ago, Russia is now attempting to whitewash its crimes against humanity and numerous war crimes.
"While Ukrainian scientists are dying from shelling in Ukrainian cities, in Russian captivity, or defending Ukraine from Russian soldiers, one of the world's most influential organisations is awarding scientists with money from the bloody Russian government," the museum emphasized.
As previously reported, due to Russian aggression, 1,685 cultural heritage sites and 2,483 cultural infrastructure facilities have been destroyed or damaged in Ukraine.

UK far right lines up behind Rupert Lowe in challenge to Reform

On a cold night in a dilapidated theatre tucked away at the end of Great Yarmouth’s Britannia Pier, Rupert Lowe was launching a far-right revolution. “Millions will have to go,” the MP said as he pledged a policy of mass deportations to rapturous applause and foot stamping from the hundreds of people gathered for what had been billed as the launch of a local “Great Yarmouth First” party.
But after introducing five councillors who will stand at the next Norfolk county council elections under that banner, the former Reform UK figure went further by announcing that his Restore Britain movement would become a national party.
In an electoral battlefield littered with failed startups, Lowe’s new party is, for now, little more than a pebble in the shoe of Nigel Farage’s Reform, from which he parted ways last year after a bitter falling out.
However, over the weekend other parties and figures to the right of Reform quickly rallied behind the new party. Advance UK, led by the former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by the far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson, said it would consider a merger.
Such a force could cost Reform a number of seats – and potentially even power, in a wafer-thin general election result – by splitting support among those drawn to hard-right anti-immigration populism.
One seasoned Tory strategist said: “We’ve had a general election with a big Labour win but where a lot of their MPs had margins of around 1,000 votes, so you could see small challengers on the right disrupting Reform’s attempts to follow that.” In 2024, 46 seats were won with a margin of less than 2%.
While Reform has placed great store in social media, Habib and, in particular, Lowe have significant presences on X, where each have been amplified by Elon Musk, who funded Robinson’s legal bills last year.
Musk, who has taken a dislike to Farage in favour of Lowe, retweeted the latter on Saturday, saying: “Join Rupert Lowe in Restore Britain, because he is the only one who will actually do it!”
A cohort of young rightwing would-be influencers pushing a more exclusive, ethnically nationalistic view of British identity have flocked to Lowe, who had attained a cult appeal among many Reform members.
Among those at his event in Great Yarmouth was Lucy White, an activist and sometime GB News contributor accused of racist tweets. Steve Laws, a prominent activist and “ethnonationalist” influencer, tweeted: “Rupert Lowe is our leader. GET IN LINE.”
Other figures such as the millionaire businessman Duncan Bannatyne and the actor John Cleese have also given approving signals.
Advance UK, meanwhile, has cultivated street protest. Large numbers of its flags – in some cases handed out to people unaware of the group – were prominent among the thousands of people who marched through the town of Crowborough last month against the use of a former military base to house asylum seekers.
“Reform are vacating the part of the political spectrum on which it was founded. We’re the old Reform, and Reform is becoming the Tories 2.0,” Habib said before the launch of Advance’s first policies at the Emmanuel Centre, a Westminster venue let out by an evangelical church. The former Brexit party MEP says he has put £100,000 into the party and it has raised £600,000 from other sources.
“We have people joining us because they’re fed up with the way Reform is run, or because they have an ideological conviction and see Farage changing the message,” he said. “Our original Reform manifesto had rejected the World Economic Forum and yet there was Farage taking an Iranian billionaire’s money to go to Davos.”
An early indication will come this month in the Gorton and Denton byelection where Advance is standing Nick Buckley, who received an MBE for his charity work but who has since become known for his extreme language on race and Islam.
Lowe’s party, meanwhile, has adopted a decentralised structure that is likely to show up the top-down approach of Farage’s party. The Great Yarmouth First party is aiming to win all of the nine seats in the borough whenever postponed county council elections take place. This will be a pilot for Restore Britain, which will act as an umbrella for others.
Separated from Reform, Lowe has proven himself able to attract attention. A self-styled “inquiry” that he set up into the grooming gangs scandal attracted the involvement of Tory MPs including Nick Timothy, Esther McVey and Gavin Williamson.
In Great Yarmouth, one of the English coastal towns with high levels of deprivation, which Reform used as a springboard for its 2024 breakthrough, a clash between Lowe and his old party looms at the next general election. “We won it last time and we will win again,” Reform sources said.
But Lowe remains a rallying point for others. Rightwing activists and former Reform supporters had travelled from as far away as Scotland to attend the event. They included Maria Bowtell, an East Riding of Yorkshire councillor and single mother who was once regarded as a Reform rising star and who had driven down with her young son.
“Reform used to stand for something hopeful but it’s clear they won’t really change anything, plus people like me just weren’t supported,” Bowtell said. “I went on Woman’s Hour and was hung out to dry. I’m attracted now to the idea of independents getting together.”

Kalamata: The mural with Maria Callas that was declared the best in the world

The Greek city of Kalamata is increasingly drawing attention to itself because of a giant mural of Maria Callas recognised as 'best in the world'. For the artist, the soprano's dress symbolises the blossoming, abundance and blessed land of the region.
The Greek city of Kalamata has an important new landmark - a giant mural of opera singer Maria Callas, that was voted best in the world by followers of Street Art Cities.
The 2025 work is both a tribute to the soprano whose father was originally from Messinia, and an allegorical depiction of the city.
Artist Cleomenis Kostopoulos says he chose Maria Callas to embody Kalamata, preferring a more human and natural representation: "Maria Callas, whose father, of course, had distant roots in Messinia, gave me great impetus to portray her, but as an incarnation of Kalamata. In other words, the mural is not called 'Maria Callas' but 'Kalamata' and my intention was to paint Kalamata (the city) allegorically."
Creating the mural was not easy as bad weather dramatically slowed down progress. Brushes, sprays and a crane were used to cover all parts of the huge wall.
Callas' dress symbolises the region's blossoming, abundance, and blessed land, while the composition incorporates elements such as tree branches, birds, and farm produce that connect people to the land.
The Deputy Mayor of Strategic Planning and Climate Neutrality, Vassilis Papaevstathiou, says the project is extremely important to the city: "We see it as a new landmark for the city. It has become an attraction. People come and take pictures. They make plans to see it during their trip. They promote it through social media. The hashtag Kalamata and Maria Callas is being promoted and spread more. We believe this mural has helped us significantly in many ways, including enhancing the promotion of the city as a tourist destination."
The project is also linked to Kalamata's goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2030, while offering a visual bridge between tradition, art, and the region's contemporary cultural identity.

Slovak prime minister says Ukraine war has ‘no military solution,’ urges dialogue with Russia
'Only result will be hundreds of thousands of deaths and a stronger position of Russian Federation,' says Robert Fico
ISTANBUL
Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Sunday that the war in Ukraine “has no military solution,” calling for dialogue with Russia to end the armed conflict continuing since 2022.
In a press conference with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Bratislava, Fico said Slovakia faces pressure whenever it pursues policies others dislike. “When someone doesn't like this sovereign independent behavior of Slovakia, they are always automatically trying to create obstacles to this sovereign, independent behavior.”
He reiterated his position that continued fighting will not resolve the conflict.
“The conflict in Ukraine has no military solution. It has no military solution,” he said, warning that if hostilities persist, “the only result will be hundreds of thousands of deaths and a stronger position of Russian Federation.”
Fico questioned the effectiveness of sanctions on Moscow, saying the “20th sanctioned packages are getting ready, how many of them do we need so that we could stop the progress of Russian Army?”
He added that European countries should prioritize diplomacy instead. “We should have come up with 20 peace initiatives.”
On energy disputes, he said Slovakia lost significant income after gas transit changes and accused Kyiv of politicizing supplies.
“We made 500 million euros per year just on transit fees,” he said, adding that “supplies of gas, of oil from Ukrainian side towards Hungary and Slovakia have become an instrument of political, political blackmail and pressure on Slovakia and Hungary.”
Fico also voiced criticism of the EU’s economic direction, saying: “The EU is economically in a deep crisis,” and warned that “if we will not admit that we passed senseless, ideological, climatic goals, we will not get out of this crisis.”
Despite his criticism, he said Slovakia supports Ukraine’s EU aspirations if conditions are met.
"We say that Ukraine can join the EU under the assumption they will meet all the necessary criteria,” he said, adding that Western Balkan candidates were “100 times better prepared for accession than Ukraine.”
Calling for engagement with Moscow, Fico stressed the importance of communication even with adversaries. “We have to lead discussion with Russian Federation. We have to lead dialog. We have to have a dialogue with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin,” he said.

Welsh charity buys more than 405 hectares for rewilding

A Welsh charity has bought more than 480 hectares (1,195 acres) in Ceredigion to establish Cymru’s “flagship” rewilding project, helping the country catch up with large-scale nature recovery projects under way elsewhere in the UK.
Tir Natur (Nature’s Land), founded in 2022, announced it had acquired the site at Cwm Doethie in Elenydd, or the Cambrian mountains, after a fundraising drive launched last year raised 50% of the £2.2m purchase price. A philanthropic bridging loan enabled the sale.
Fundraising efforts to begin early restoration work and community activities on the rewilding site – Wales’s largest – are ongoing.
The naturalist and broadcaster Iolo Williams, an ambassador for the charity, said: “I am hugely excited by their efforts to purchase land and showcase the benefits of rewilding, not only to wildlife and the physical environment but to farming, Welsh communities and culture. Nature needs this.”
Tash Reilly, Tir Natur’s chair, said: “This site will demonstrate what’s possible when we allow nature to take the lead and work for people again. It’s a hopeful, practical vision anyone can contribute to.”
Tir Natur says the project will restore Cwm Doethie’s natural landscape, which includes rivers, peat bogs and ancient woodland, acting as a carbon sink and reducing the risk of flooding downstream. It aims to encourage the return of red squirrels, pine martens, polecats, curlews and hen harriers, and to create new nature corridors and habitats for beavers and butterflies.
The charity plans to use a wild grazing system involving traditional cattle, pony and pig breeds to act as “ecosystem architects” that kickstart natural regeneration by turning over soil.
The site had previously been considered poor for grazing and unsuitable for commercial forestry owing to its location in a site of special scientific interest (SSSI).
Ian Rickman, the president of the Farmers’ Union of Wales (FUW), told Cambrian News the union had concerns over “the scale and transparency of this project”.
He said: “While it is positive that the role of livestock has been acknowledged, questions remain over how such a large area of land will be managed and funded in practice.” He said the FUW would seek to work with the charity “to ensure the voices of local farmers and rural communities are properly heard and considered”.
Reilly said Tir Natur was seeking a long-term approach and was “keen to engage with farmers and their representatives as the project moves forward”.
“We respect that there are different views about rewilding,” she said. “The recent Natural Resources Wales and Welsh government reports show nature in Wales is continuing to decline, which is our motivation … We will improve this site’s ecological health while ensuring it is a working rural landscape.”
The valley in the Cambrian mountains is set to become Wales’s largest rewilding site by far: some of the biggest in the UK are Cairngorms Connect at 60,000 hectares, Rewilding Affric Highlands, currently 80,000 hectares, and the Lake District’s Wild Ennerdale (4,400 hectares).
The UK ranks 229th out of 240 nations, with an average score of 50%, in the Natural History Museum’s biodiversity intactness index.
In 2017, another major rewilding project in Wales, Summit to Sea, aimed to establish a protection area stretching from the Pumlumon massif in Elenydd to Cardigan Bay, encompassing 10,000 hectares of land and a 28,000-hectare marine zone, but it faced criticism from the local community.
It was re-established as Tir Canol (Middle Ground) in 2020 and is now focused on a smaller area of mountainous Elenydd.

US forces intercept sanctioned oil tanker tied to Venezuela in Indian Ocean
‘Vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine,’ says Pentagon as military forces boarded the Veronica III overnight
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
US military forces have boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean, having tracked the vessel from the Caribbean Sea in an operation targeting illicit oil linked to Venezuela, the Pentagon announced on Sunday.
Venezuela has been subject to US oil sanctions for several years, leading to its reliance on a 'shadow fleet' of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to exert pressure on then-President Nicolás Maduro, who was later apprehended in January during an American military operation.
The Defense Department confirmed via a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III overnight, executing "a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding."
The Pentagon stated: "The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."
The Veronica III, a Panamanian-flagged vessel, is listed under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control website. Video released by the Pentagon depicted US troops boarding the tanker.
The Trump administration has been seizing tankers as part of its wider efforts to take control of Venezuela's oil. However, the Pentagon's post did not specify whether the Veronica III had been formally seized and placed under US control.
This incident follows another boarding last week, when the US military intercepted the Aquila II, a different tanker, also in the Indian Ocean. That vessel is currently being held while its ultimate fate is determined by the United States, a defence official stated last week on condition of anonymity.
The Aquila II was one of at least 16 tankers that departed the Venezuelan coast last month after US forces captured President Nicolás Maduro, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com. He said his organization used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship's movements.
The Aquila II is a Panamanian-flagged tanker under US sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil. Owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship tracking data shows it has spent much of the last year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location.

Amid snags, EU mission tries to help frustrated Gazans traverse Rafah’s tortuous crossing

Amid snags, EU mission tries to help frustrated Gazans traverse Rafah’s tortuous crossing
EUBAM head Nataliya Apostolova acknowledges complaints but says operations at reopened terminal are steadily improving, in close coordination with authorities in Jerusalem and Cairo
For nearly two decades, a European Union mission meant to train and assist Palestinian border agents at the Rafah Crossing between Gaza and Egypt was little more than a shell, downsized after two years of operation to a skeleton staff after the violent 2007 Hamas takeover of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority.
Today, the European Union Border Assistance Mission, or EUBAM, is active again at the crossing, the Strip’s sole conduit to the outside world and a key bellwether for the type of fragile cooperation between various actors that will characterize Gaza’s postwar recovery period.
Tasked with overseeing Palestinian Authority border and customs agents to ensure their proper management of the crossing, the EU mission has been able to watch, but not act, as hopes around the crossing’s reopening this month have been dampened by procedural issues limiting the number of Palestinians entering or leaving Gaza to even fewer than the small number agreed to by Israel and Egypt.
“The technical details, at the end of the day, can delay the whole process,” EUBAM Rafah head Nataliya Apostolova told The Times of Israel recently from her Ramat Gan office.
The crossing is seen by Israel as a strategic concern, as lax oversight could allow Hamas to smuggle weapons into Gaza, as the terror group did before the war that broke out with the October 7, 2023, Hamas invasion of southern Israel. For Gazans, its a lifeline to the outside world.
On February 2, the crossing opened for two-way pedestrian traffic for the first time since the Hamas attacks, but it has been a rocky start.
According to the agreement between Egypt and Israel on the reopening of the crossing, 50 Gazans are allowed to enter and exit Gaza each day. The 50 civilians heading into Egypt for medical care are also each allowed to take two family members to accompany them.
But in the nine days that the crossing was open from February 2 through Friday, 316 Gazans left and 312 have come in, for an average of around 35 in each direction every day, according to EUBAM and Israel Defense Forces statistics.
The outgoing traffic consisted of 125 medical patients and 191 family members, according to EUBAM.
But Palestinians who have made the journey through the crossing have complained of a feeling of imprisonment, long wait times and intrusive inspections. In at least one instance, passengers were forced to camp at the crossing overnight, with no suitable facilities, due to technical or practical holdups.
There have also been allegations of harsh treatment by Israelis forces and by an Israel-aligned armed militia during the passage between the crossing and the Hamas-controlled part of the Strip.
After 18 years away, EU border experts began ramping the Rafah mission back up during the temporary January 2025 ceasefire. Today, with the crossing reopened, the crew consists of 31 staff members, including a team to provide security for the crew of experts.
“Our task and obligation is to monitor how this operation is implemented by the Palestinian team,” Apostolova said.
Under rules governing the crossing’s reopening this month, Israel has no physical presence at the crossing, but is able to monitor who is passing through and controls the gates remotely.
Those coming into Gaza enter the part of the Strip currently controlled by Israeli troops, though contact with civilians is generally done through armed Israel-aligned militias that also operate in that part of the enclave. Most civilians only pass through the Israel-controlled area on their way to the 47 percent of the Strip where most Gazans live.
Lugging luggage and keeping a balance
The Rafah terminal, housed in a warren of shipping containers after Israel destroyed the original buildings in 2024, is only open for six hours a day, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., in order to ensure that the European staff is able to leave Gaza before dark, though in practice they stayed longer during the first few days to facilitate the crossings.
Even with the extended opening, a slew of unforeseen snags have slowed the work, meaning only a few Gazans get through the crossing daily.
Gazans coming back from Egypt are allowed to bring one piece of luggage, but there is no size limit on the suitcases. After years of being away, many returning Gazans bring massive suitcases that don’t fit into the scanning machines.
“The luggage doesn’t go in, so everything is taken out,” explained Apostolova, a Bulgarian diplomat who formerly headed the EU mission to train Palestinian policemen. “It is put into buckets, and it goes through the scanner one by one.”
Some suitcases are too large to be carried by hand through the various checks, so the Palestinian border agents wind up doing double duty as porters. Or they commandeer golf carts meant for moving handicapped civilians through the crossing to transport the suitcases. All of this holds up the process.
Another factor keeping numbers down is an agreement between Israel and Egypt that the number of Palestinians going into and leaving Gaza be equal every day.
They work carefully to maintain that balance, though there have been four more Gazans who have left during the first two weeks.
If 12 injured Gazans are slated to exit to Egypt, they have to wait until an equal number have been processed and let in, explained Apostolova: “You have to wait until 12 people complete the procedure in the reverse traffic.”
Because only 12 Gazans were allowed in, the rest had to camp on the Egyptian side of the border overnight, according to the Associated Press.
The agreement limits what Gazans can bring into the Strip, with electronics, cigarettes, liquids and electronics banned, save for a single cellphone.
Gazans entering the Strip can only bring NIS 2,000 ($647) in cash, and those leaving are only allowed to take NIS 1,000 ($323).
The need to check for restricted goods and confiscate them slows the process.
Apostolova said the technical delays and the confiscation of forbidden items were the main source of the complaints.
The travelers “stayed many hours before they crossed the border, yes,” she conceded, “because at the moment, what we need is a bit more organization, even around the transportation of this luggage.”
“That’s why you have articles about people who are mistreated, and who stayed for hours before they crossed the border,” she insisted.
Some of the complaints are being addressed, Apostolova said. She noted Israel is building portable toilets and shade in the waiting areas.
The IDF’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, which facilitates the movement of Palestinian civilians, told The Times of Israel that crossings were contingent on submission of approved manifests from Egypt and the World Health Organization, as well as “the crossing’s capacity.”
The crossing is open only for the passage of Gazan Palestinian pedestrians. Foreigners, including aid workers, who seek to enter Gaza can only do so via Israel’s crossings with the Strip. Goods and aid continue to go through the Israeli crossings. Israel is also still refusing to allow the unsupervised entry of foreign journalists into Gaza.
‘Absolutely perfect’ coordination
EUBAM is a “third party, a neutral party,” stressed Apostolova.“Our role as a mentor and adviser in this border operation is through our expertise… [on] how to make this process smoother, respectful, respecting the dignity of people, and fast. This is what we want.”
The mission’s mandate comes from the Agreement for Movements and Access signed by Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 2005, and initially consisted of 188 staffers.
In keeping with the EU’s no-contact policy with terrorist groups, the Rafah Crossing mission left Gaza and moved to Ramat Gan when Hamas seized power in Gaza in 2007, downsizing to just a few staffers.
EUBAM returned in January last year, as the crossing opened to outgoing pedestrian traffic into Egypt. Most of those leaving were medical evacuations, with a limit of 150 crossings out of Gaza a day.
That mission lasted 47 days, with around 4,000 crossings, before the ceasefire fell apart, said Apostolova.
EUBAM returned in October, as part of the ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump.
Every morning, its staffers head from Ashkelon to the Israel-Gaza border near the south of the Strip, where they meet an IDF convoy that accompanies them into Gaza and on to the crossing.
Coordination with the IDF has been “absolutely perfect” thus far, said Apostolova.
The United Nations World Health Organization is a central player in the complex effort. Most of those leaving Gaza are doing so for medical reasons, and the WHO sets the lists for who gets to leave using its own selection process. “The moment they have the names, they put them in a vetting procedure, which is Israel and Egypt,” explained Apostolova. “When the list is approved, it comes to us.”
The WHO is also the only organization ferrying injured Gazans in ambulances from the Hamas-controlled part of the Strip to the Rafah Crossing, which requires extensive coordination.
The WHO convoys can’t cross the Yellow Line into Israel-controlled territory on their own, so the organization has to coordinate with COGAT’s Coordination and Liaison Administration, or CLA, for Gaza.
The CLA then informs EUBAM that a convoy is moving and when it will reach the crossing point each morning.
EUBAM has lists of who will be crossing 24 hours in advance, with names and passport numbers.
The WHO transfers the patients from their ambulances to “sterile ambulances” that never leave the Rafah crossing compound.
Those crossing into Egypt without passports are given a document with their name and the date that they crossed, and then they have to go to the Palestinian embassy in Cairo within 48 hours to get a passport.
Controversially for Israel, the border agents have been stamping documents with the Palestinian Authority logo, even though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged that the PA would have no part in the running of Gaza.
Gazans coming from Egypt present their documents to the Palestinian Authority border agents when they reach the crossing, then are IDed by a facial recognition camera operation by the CLA. Once they are positively identified, a door opens and they enter to crossing itself.
Once through, they move to the shipping container to have their documents processed, then head to a customs check where machines scan their belongings.
Once that is done, they move to a waiting area, then head to a parking lot inside the Gaza Strip where buses are supposed to take them through IDF-controlled territory to Khan Younis, on the other side of the Yellow Line.
The buses are operated by the Abu Shabab militia, an armed anti-Hamas group that has worked with Israel inside the Strip, according to Gazans who have spoken to Israeli and international media.
The Gazans are then brought to an IDF checkpoint some five kilometers (1.8 miles) from Rafah, where they undergo an additional security screening. Only afterward are they permitted to continue toward the Hamas-controlled areas of Gaza.
Citing unnamed sources, the Qatari Al-Araby network said those who successfully returned to Gaza were interrogated several times during their journey, including by masked gunmen who stopped them at a checkpoint some 500 meters from the Rafah Crossing.
The sources said that the armed individuals handed the returnees over to IDF troops, whereupon they were interrogated and their belongings were confiscated.
Apostolova declined to comment on those reports. “We want to keep to the limits of our mandate, and we do not want to step in something that is already the responsibility of someone else,” she insisted.
“Our mandate does not allow us to go beyond the perimeter of the compound,” she said.
‘All sides are trying’
The process at the crossing is steadily improving, said Apostolova, and she and her team are holding regular “technical meetings” with Egypt and Israel. Some of the meetings take place in the Civil-Military Coordination Center in Kiryat Gat with American involvement, while others occur in the EUBAM or COGAT offices.
Egypt and Israel “have their own considerations, and they have their own challenges in this process,” she said, hinting at the political sensitivity of the operation.
She said the mission had not been in touch with the new National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, the nascent body set up by US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace to run postwar Gaza, nor had it been in contact with the Board of Peace Executive Committee heading up the transition.
EUBAM does have a permanent representative at the CMCC, however, which oversees many of the aid convoys moving in and out of Gaza.
“Israel will continue working closely with its partners to facilitate the entry and exit of Gazans through the Rafah Crossing, in line with the agreed framework,” COGAT promised.
“All sides are trying, I must say,” Apostolova maintained. “We have very good cooperation with Israel and with the Egyptian side as well. We try to solve it, but it does not happen in a week.”
If so, we have a request.

French 'ultra-left' behind killing of right-wing youth, says justice minister Darmanin
France

The "ultra-left" in France was behind the deadly beating of a French youth aligned with the far right whose death has inflamed political tensions in the country, the justice minister said on Sunday, February 15. Gérald Darmanin also accused hard-left politicians, including from the La France Insoumise (LFI) party, the largest left-wing faction in parliament, of fueling violence with their language.
The victim, identified only as Quentin, aged 23, had been hospitalized and placed into a coma on Thursday after being attacked in Lyon. Supporters said he was providing security at a protest against an appearance by Rima Hassan, an LFI member of the European Parliament, at Sciences Po Lyon university when he was assaulted by a gang of rival activists.
The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it has said, adding Sunday that "significant" testimony had already been gathered and investigators were working on identifying the perpetrators.
"It was clearly the ultra-left that killed him," Darmanin told RTL radio. "There are indeed speeches, particularly from La France Insoumise and the ultra-left, which unfortunately lead to unbridled violence on social networks and then in the physical world," he said. "Words can kill," Darmanin added, accusing Hassan and LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon of "not having a word to say for the family of the young man."
Calls for calm
According to the Némésis collective, which is close to the far right, Quentin was providing security for its protesters and was assaulted by "anti-fascist" activists. The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organized and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked."
The incident has further fueled tensions between France's far right and radical left ahead of municipal elections nationwide in March and the 2027 presidential election. Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.
Demonstrations called by the far right in memory of Quentin took place in the southern city of Montpellier and Paris, where protesters unfurled a banner reading "antifa murderers, justice for Quentin."
The far right has pointed the finger at La Jeune Garde ("Young Guard"), an anti-fascist youth offshoot of LFI. But its founder, Raphaël Arnault, an LFI lawmaker, has expressed his "horror" at the fatal beating.
LFI lawmaker Eric Coquerel, speaking to Franceinfo, condemned "all political violence" but said the activists responsible for Hassan's security "were in no way involved in what happened." He pointed instead to a particular "context" in the southeastern city marked by violence from "far-right groups."
President Emmanuel Macron has called for "calm" and "restraint."
Lyon's Green mayor, Grégory Doucet, who is standing for re-election next month, said what happened was "a tragedy" and added that "such an outburst of violence in the heart of the city is unacceptable."
At Saint George's Church in Lyon, which the young man attended and where he volunteered for charities, priest Laurent Spriet called on Sunday for prayers "for the peace of Quentin's soul." "Everything in its own time. Now is for compassion, for respect, for prayer, for letting the police and the justice system do their work," he said.

Polish President Karol Nawrocki thinks his country should start developing nuclear defenses, given the threat from Moscow.
In an interview with Polsat television on Sunday, Nawrocki described himself as "a great supporter of Poland joining the nuclear project" and argued that the country should develop its security strategy "based on nuclear potential."
He added: "This path, with respect for all international regulations, is the path we should take. ... We must work towards this goal so that we can begin the work. We are a country right on the border of an armed conflict. The aggressive, imperial attitude of Russia toward Poland is well known."

Russia Switches to T-72A Modernization as T-72B Stocks Dwindle

New footage from Uralvagonzavod shows that Russia has begun modernizing the T-72A, likely due to the depletion of newer T-72B stocks.
Armored vehicle researcher Andriy Tarasenko published the video of the equipment on his Telegram channel.
According to the researcher, the footage from the tank plant captures a T-72A fitted with Relikt explosive reactive armor on the turret. In addition, the track-side fenders have been fitted with protection modules instead of the standard auxiliary fuel tanks.
“If UVZ can continue through 2026 and 2027 using the ‘obsolete’ T-72A, then Omsk will exhaust its stocks of Soviet-era T-80B (BV) tanks as early as 2026. Can the Russian Federation now organize mass production of new tanks?” the researcher wrote.
According to analysts at Frontelligence Insight, as of autumn 2025, Russia planned to repair and upgrade more than 800 T-72 tanks to the T-72B3M standard over a 10-year period. This figure corresponds to the estimated number of remaining T-72s in storage and at armored repair plants.
The analysts reviewed internal documentation from Uralvagonzavod and, based on the volume of ordered components, reconstructed projected output for the repair and modernization of T-72 tanks.
The data indicates that Russia plans to overhaul and upgrade 828 vehicles to the T-72B3M configuration by 2036, with peak activity expected around 2028. Between 2027 and 2029, 498 T-72B3M tanks are projected to be repaired or upgraded.
OSINT researcher Jompy, who analyzes satellite imagery to estimate remaining Russian equipment stocks, said the figure closely matches the number of T-72 tanks still in storage.
At the same time, roughly two-thirds of these stocks consist of older T-72A tanks, which entered service in 1979 and were produced until 1985. Some have already been transferred to Uralvagonzavod.
A full modernization of T-72A tanks to the T-72B3M standard would be technically complex, requiring the replacement of electronic systems, modifications to the chassis and autoloader, and upgrades to the hull and turret armor packages.
However, restored but not fully modernized T-72A tanks, fitted with reactive armor to a T-72B3-type standard, were observed in Russian service in 2024.
In addition to the T-72 program, Russia plans to manufacture, modernize, or overhaul 1,118 T-90M and T-90M2 tanks between 2027 and 2029.

Did Hong Kong souvenir shop tread on IP rights with viral ‘MTR station’ wall?
Wall featured signs nearly identical to ones found in rail stations before workers took down lettering
A souvenir shop in Hong Kong has taken down lettering from its viral wall featuring designs nearly identical to MTR station signage amid concerns over possible trademark and copyright infringement.
The MTR Corporation on Sunday declined to say whether the move by the Causeway Bay store was done at its request.
The company “attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property, which is safeguarded under the law of Hong Kong, and we shall act accordingly in the event of suspected infringement,” a spokesman for the rail operator told the South China Morning Post.
Earlier this month, the wall next to the storefront belonging to Hong Kong Souvenir on Kai Chiu Road in Causeway Bay was transformed into a “check-in” spot that soon attracted photo-snapping crowds.

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’

Palestine warns Israeli plan to register West Bank land as ‘state property’ amounts to ‘de facto annexation’
Palestinian Authority says Israel's move constitutes ‘termination of signed agreements,’ urges UN Security Council and US to intervene
ISTANBUL
The Palestinian Authority on Sunday warned that an Israeli government decision to register large areas of the West Bank as “state property” amounts to a “de facto annexation” of the occupied territory and a violation of international law.
In a statement carried by the official news agency Wafa, the Authority said the Israeli move constitutes “a blatant violation of international law and international legitimacy resolutions” and poses a threat to security and stability.
It described the measure as a “de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian land” and an official launch of annexation plans aimed at consolidating the occupation through illegal settlement expansion.
It also constitutes “a termination of the signed agreements and clearly contradicts the resolutions of the UN Security Council, especially Resolution 2334, which considers all settlement activity in the entire occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, to be illegal.”
The Authority stressed that unilateral Israeli actions “would not confer legitimacy over Palestinian land and would not change the legal and historical status of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as occupied territory under international law.”
It called on the international community, particularly the UN Security Council and the US administration, to intervene immediately to halt the Israeli measures and compel Tel Aviv to comply with international law to prevent further escalation.
The Palestinian group Hamas decried the Israeli decision as “void” and issued by “an illegitimate occupation authority.”
This decision “is an attempt to impose Judaizing settlement facts by force, in a flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions,” it said in a statement.
The group vowed “to continue to confront all attempts by the occupation to impose annexation, Judaization and displacement plans.”
The Palestinian people “will not allow these colonial projects to pass, and the will of our people and their adherence to their land and their established national rights will remain the impenetrable barrier in the face of the occupation’s policies and expansionist plans.”
It called on the UN and international parties to take urgent action “to stop the occupation’s aggression and its ongoing violations against our Palestinian people, foremost among which is their right to their land, to self-determination, and to establish their independent Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.”
Earlier Sunday, the Israeli government approved a proposal to register vast areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property,” the first such measure since Israel occupied the territory in 1967.
Israel’s public broadcaster KAN reported that the proposal was submitted by far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defense Minister Israel Katz.
“The initial goal is the gradual settlement of 15% of Area C by 2030,” the Israel Hayom newspaper commented ahead of the government decision.
Under the Oslo II Accord signed in 1995, Area A is under full Palestinian control, Area B is under Palestinian civil control and Israeli security control, while Area C, accounting for about 61% of the West Bank, remains under full Israeli control.
The Accord limits land registration by the Palestinian Authority to Areas A and B, while prohibiting it in Area C.
The move was part of a series of measures approved by Israel’s Security Cabinet last week aimed at expanding illegal settlement building and increasing Tel Aviv’s control of the occupied West Bank.
According to Israeli media, the measures include repealing a law that barred the sale of land in the West Bank to illegal Israeli settlers, unsealing land ownership records, and shifting authority for building permits in a settlement bloc near Hebron from a Palestinian municipality to Israel’s civil administration.
Israel has intensified operations in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since launching its military campaign in Gaza on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation -- including killings, arrests, displacement and settlement expansion -- as a step toward formal annexation of the territory.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Gisèle Pelicot speaks

Gisèle Pelicot speaks
WARNING: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse.
For 50 years, Gisèle Pelicot lived with her husband, Dominique Pelicot, whom she described as "a kind man, a devoted family man. It was a beautiful love story, until the day I found myself facing the horror of the facts."
Those facts shattered Gisèle's seemingly normal life, and put her at the center of a mass rape trial – an unthinkable crime that gripped France and received worldwide attention. But it was her response that would be defining.
She sat down with "CBS Sunday Morning," for what she said was her first-ever interview: "Yes, it's a first," she said through an interpreter. "I'm not used to speaking in front of cameras. I used to be a very discreet woman."
It all unravelled in 2020, inside a supermarket in Mazan, France, when what seemed like a small crime uncovered a far greater one. Dominique Pelicot was caught taking video up women's skirts. His arrest led to the discovery of disturbing footage taken inside their home of Gisèle Pelicot unconscious.
"My world collapsed"
At a local police station, an investigator told Gisèle what they found: "He said, 'Mrs. Pelicot, do you recognize yourself in these photos?'" she recalled. "And I said, 'No, it's not me.' Then he said, 'This is your bedroom.' And I see a woman I don't recognize at all, completely asleep with a man beside her. I don't know this man. And then he says, 'I'm going to tell you something shocking: You were raped by 53 individuals.' My world collapsed."
She described the woman in the video as looking like a rag doll. That woman was her. "Yes, it was me, but this woman was lifeless," she said. "She looked dead."
Her response? "I could not speak. I was in such a state of shock. All I wanted was to go home, to get my life back as it was before."
But that life was gone. The man she knew as a loving father to their three children, and a doting grandfather, had been drugging her with sleeping pills and muscle relaxants, then inviting men he met online to abuse her.
Her lawyer, Stéphane Babonneau, said it represented hundreds of rapes over at least 10 years. He and Gisèle started to grasp the scale of the crimes as they prepared for trial – "In the range of hundreds, if not thousands" of photos, he said. "And for videos, definitely hundreds."
Among the evidence: messages Dominque Pelicot posted online ("I'm looking for a pervert accomplice to abuse my sleeping wife..."), and text messages ("I'm about to dose her... We have to wait at least one hour to abuse").
"It's been a real journey into the darkness," said Babonneau. He described the images as "scenes of torture. There is no other word for that. … On this video we see a human being, being treated as an object. We see men who desecrate a human body, who desecrates someone, Gisèle, who is in profound distress, because her life was at risk at every moment where she was drugged and abused."
Victims of sexual abuse can remain anonymous in France. So up until the trial in 2024, Gisèle Pelicot's name was not known. But then she made a bold decision: to demand an open trial, allowing the public and the press into the courtroom.
Revealing her identity to the world, she said, was difficult: "It was very hard. I didn't want anybody to discover and know about this woman who had experienced all this violence. Because, in truth, victims always feel shame about what happened to them. I told myself that if I opened the closed-door proceedings, the shame would change sides."
The words "Shame Has to Change Sides" are the subtitle of her intimate account of the ordeal, "A Hymn to Life" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).
Babonneau said he was worried when he heard that she wanted to have an open trial: "Because we knew that there would be a tremendous pressure on her," he said.
"Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy"
At trial, the accused hid their faces as they filed into court. They ranged in age from 26 to 74. Among them: a firefighter, a soldier, and a nurse. In court, many claimed Gisèle Pelicot must have known, must have been complicit.
But Dominique Pelicot admitted everything, testifying, "It was always against her knowledge," adding he drugged her two to three times a week. "I had an addiction," he said.
Looking back, Gisèle said, there were warning signs: "I only knew I had blackouts, and I had health problems," she said. There were also periods where her memory was affected. "I couldn't remember that I'd been to the hairdresser; it was only the next day that I realized I had," she said. "And when I called my children, it was the same – I didn't remember our conversations.
"I thought I was seriously ill. I consulted neurologists, I had a CT scan – nothing was found," she said.
Even recounting her horrifying ordeal to "Sunday Morning," Gisèle Pelicot maintained her poise. "I've always been this way," she said. "Anger and hatred build nothing; they destroy. And I didn't want to go down that path."
The trial made headlines worldwide, and drew huge crowds of supporters, who praised Gisèle Pelicot for her bravery, holding her up as a feminist hero. Seeing those supporters, she said, made her feel that she was not alone: "It was an incredible source of strength for me."
All of the 51 men eventually put on trial were convicted. Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to the maximum of 20 years.
He has asked for his (now ex-)wife's forgiveness. But Gisèle Pelicot says, "No. Forgiveness is extremely difficult. But I don't want to live in hatred. I do need to speak with him – and it will also be to say goodbye."
But she does want to see him again. "Yes," she said. "I need answers. I may never get them. But that's also part of my journey."
During our interview, just off camera, was Gisèle's new partner, Jean-Loup, who was also by her side during the trial, along with her children.
"I never thought I'd fall in love, or even want to," she said. "It's a beautiful story. As for the rest, it belongs to us, and I keep that to myself."
But you're in love? "Indeed. You can fall in love at any age. Everything is possible. That, too, is a message of hope, to tell yourself that nothing is lost in life."
Despite the details of her ordeal, by the end of the book, her story is, miraculously, uplifting. "I was always wondering what my mission on Earth was, why I had been born," she said. "Some are painters, some are poets, others are writers. I think my mission was to give others hope, that even after hardship, you can rise again and choose happiness. I think that was my mission."

Iran says energy, mining and aircraft deals on table in talks as US prepares for next round

Iran is pursuing a nuclear agreement with the U.S. that would deliver economic benefits for both sides, an Iranian diplomat was reported as saying Sunday, days before a second round of talks between Tehran and Washington.
Iran and the U.S. resumed negotiations earlier this month aimed at resolving their decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear program and averting a new military confrontation. The U.S. has dispatched a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for the possibility of a sustained military campaign if the talks fail, U.S. officials told Reuters.
“For the sake of an agreement’s durability, it is essential that the U.S. also benefits in areas with high and quick economic returns,” Foreign Ministry Deputy Director for Economic Diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.
Iran has threatened retaliation against any U.S. attack but struck a conciliatory tone Sunday.
“Common interests in oil and gas fields, joint fields, mining investments and even aircraft purchases are included in the negotiations,” Ghanbari said, arguing that the 2015 nuclear pact with world powers did not secure U.S. economic interests.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, speaking at a news conference in Bratislava, said President Donald Trump had made clear he prefers diplomacy and a negotiated settlement.
“No one’s ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran but we’re going to try,” Rubio said.
In 2018, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the pact, which had eased sanctions on Iran in exchange for limits on its nuclear program, and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on Tehran.
On Friday, a source told Reuters that a U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner would meet Iranian officials in Geneva on Tuesday. A senior Iranian official confirmed the meeting Sunday.
“Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will be traveling, I think they are traveling right now, to have important meetings and we’ll see how that turns out,” Rubio said, without elaborating.
While the talks that led to the 2015 agreement were multilateral, the current negotiations are limited to Iran and the U.S., with Oman serving as mediator.
Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi signaled Iran’s readiness to compromise on its nuclear program in return for sanctions relief, telling the BBC on Sunday that the ball was “in America’s court to prove that they want to do a deal.”
He cited a statement earlier this week by Iran’s atomic chief that Tehran could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for sanctions relief as evidence of flexibility.
However, he reiterated that Iran would not accept zero uranium enrichment, a key sticking point in previous negotiations. Washington views enrichment inside Iran as a potential pathway to nuclear weapons, an allegation Tehran denies.
In June, the U.S. joined Israel in a series of airstrikes targeting Iranian nuclear sites.
The U.S. is also increasing economic pressure on Tehran. At a White House meeting earlier this week, Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed that the U.S. would work to reduce Iran’s oil exports to China, Axios reported Saturday.
China accounts for more than 80% of Iran’s oil exports, meaning any reduction in that trade would significantly cut Tehran’s oil revenue.

Mikaela Shiffrin finishes 11th in giant slalom, continuing Olympic drought

Mikaela Shiffrin fails to make the podium in women's giant slalom as Olympic drought continues
Mikaela Shiffrin's Olympic drought continues after she missed the podium of the Milano Cortina Games women's giant slalom on Sunday, finishing in 11th place.
The U.S. standout had a combined time of 2:14.42. Her runs were clean but just not quick enough to challenge for a podium spot. She didn't show any outward signs of disappointment after her second run, blowing out her cheeks and waving to the fans in the grandstand with both hands.
The 30-year-old, who is the winningest athlete on the World Cup circuit, has now failed to win a medal in eight straight Olympic events since the 2018 Winter Games in PyeongChang.
Italy's Federica Brignone took home the top prize, her second gold medal of these Games and her fifth medal overall. Remarkably, it was a split silver medal after Sweden's Sara Hector and Norway's Thea Stjernesund posted the same time in both the first and second runs.
After Brignone crossed the line to loud cheers from the home crowd, Hector and Stjernesund ran into the finish area and bowed down to the champion to a backdrop of chants of "Fede" from fans.
"That was, like, the greatest show of GS skiing that we've had in a really long time," Shiffrin said. "And to do it, you know, at the Olympics where people actually have eyes on the sport. Federica skied incredible. That was so cool to watch."
Redemption for Shiffrin, who came in fourth place with teammate Breezy Johnston in the women's team combined event on Thursday, could come at her best event — the slalom — on Wednesday.

ROME – Two off-piste skiers were killed on Feb 15 and another was in serious condition after an avalanche struck a slope near Courmayeur, Italy’s alpine rescue said.
Italy’s central alpine rescue service (CNSAS) said the two victims and injured person were a woman and two men, and were “probably” French.
The avalanche hit a stretch of the Canale dei Vesses, known for steep passages popular with off-piste skiers, west of Courmayeur in the Val Veny area at the foot of the Mont Blanc.
Fifteen rescuers participated in the search, along with search-and-rescue dogs and two helicopters, the CNSAS said.
One person died on site and the other after being transported to the emergency room, rescuers said. The injured person was in hospital in Turin. AFP

War update: 129 attacks since morning, Pokrovsk sector remains most active
The General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine stated this on Facebook, publishing operational information as of 16:00 on Sunday, February 15, Ukrinform reports.
The enemy continues attempts to advance deeper into Ukrainian territory. The Defense Forces are holding them back, inflicting significant losses along various sections of the front line and exhausting them along the entire line of contact and in the rear.
Today, Russian forces once again shelled Ukraine's border areas. Rogizne, Ryzhivka, Prohres, Bachivsk, Iskryskivshchyna, Budky, Kucherivka, Kruzhok, and Novovasylivka in the Sumy region, as well as Mykhalchyna Sloboda, Buchky, Lyskivshchyna, Plokhiv, and Yasna Poliana in the Chernihiv region, came under enemy fire.
In the Northern Slobozhanshchyna and Kursk sectors, the invaders shelled populated areas and Defense Forces' positions 78 times, including twice with multiple launch rocket systems.

Iran’s top general warns new war will be ‘lesson’ for Trump ahead of next round of talks
Next round of US-Iran nuclear talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva
By Syed Zafar Mehdi
TEHRAN, Iran (AA) - Iran’s top military commander warned Sunday that any US war against Tehran would serve as “a lesson” for President Donald Trump, as tensions continue to simmer in the region.
Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi, Chief of Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, said that the US president should understand he would be entering “a lesson-giving battle.”
Trump said on Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen,” as tensions escalate amid the deployment of a second US aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
He announced that the USS Gerald R. Ford, described as the world’s largest aircraft carrier, would soon head to the region in case ongoing talks between Washington and Tehran fail.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” he said. “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
The USS Abraham Lincoln and a fleet of destroyers are already stationed in the Persian Gulf region, having been dispatched last month amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Mousavi described Trump’s comments as “unworthy of a president” and “reckless.”
He said that if Trump intends to wage war, he should not speak of “negotiations,” referring to the ongoing nuclear diplomacy between the two sides that resumed earlier this month.
The latest round of nuclear talks was held in Oman on Feb. 6, more than eight months after the Iran-Israel war put the diplomacy on the backburner.
Türkiye and other regional states recently intervened to help ease tensions and revive the diplomatic channels, particularly after Trump threatened to use military action against Iran.
The next round of talks is scheduled for Tuesday in Geneva, according to Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who confirmed the meeting in an interview on Sunday.
He said Washington must demonstrate its commitment to reaching an agreement aimed at resolving the nuclear issue.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said. “If they are sincere, I’m sure we will be on the road to an agreement.”

Woman who filmed Snapchat videos while speeding jailed after killing two
A woman jailed after overtaking on the wrong side of the road and causing a fatal collision had repeatedly posted videos of herself speeding while using her mobile phone to social media.
Taxi driver Octavian Codreanu was killed at the scene on the B4425 near Aldsworth in December 2022, and his passenger, schoolteacher Moyra Whelan, later died from her injuries.
Liberty Michell, 21, pleaded guilty to two counts of causing death by dangerous driving, three counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and two counts of causing death by driving whilst uninsured.
Mitchell had passed her driving test just three weeks before the crash.
Gloucestershire Police said footage from Mitchell’s Snapchat account showed her driving on narrow roads at speeds of up to 100mph.
Mitchell, 21, of Chipping Norton, was sentenced to six years and eight months at Gloucester Crown Court on Friday (13 February) and banned from driving for more than eight years.

As Sudanese city returns to life after two-year siege, drone threat lingers
Markets reopen in Dilling, South Kordofan’s second largest city. Yet residents face critical medical shortages and persistent aerial attacks.
Life is cautiously returning to the streets of Dilling, the second largest city in South Kordofan state, after the Sudanese army broke a suffocating siege that had isolated the area for more than two years.
For months, the city had been encircled by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N), cutting off vital supply lines and trapping civilians in a severe humanitarian crisis.

While the lifting of the blockade has allowed goods to flow again, local authorities and residents said the city remains under the threat of drone attacks.
Al Jazeera Arabic’s Hisham Uweit, reporting from Dilling, described a city “recovering slowly” from the economic strangulation.
“For over two years, heavy siege conditions were imposed on the city. Movement disappeared, goods vanished and livelihoods narrowed,” Uweit said.
“Now the eyes of buyers pick through the few available goods … as if the market itself is announcing its recovery at a leisurely pace, drawing determination from the patience of its residents.”
Markets return to life
The immediate impact of the army’s advance is visible in the local markets, which were largely shuttered during the blockade. Fresh produce, absent for months, has begun to reappear in stalls.
“The market and vegetables have all returned,” a local trader told Al Jazeera. “Before, the market didn’t exist. Now we have okra, potatoes, sweet potatoes, chillies and lemons. Everything is with us, and the market has returned to normal.”
However, the resumption of trade masks deep scars left by the isolation. The blockade devastated the local economy, stripping residents of their savings and leaving infrastructure in disrepair.
‘The price of isolation’
While food supplies are improving, Dilling’s health sector remains in critical condition. The city’s main hospital is struggling with a severe lack of equipment and essential medicines, a shortage that has had life-altering consequences for the most vulnerable.
Abdelrahman, a local resident suffering from diabetes, paid a heavy price for the siege. During the months of encirclement, insulin supplies ran dry. His condition deteriorated rapidly, ultimately leading to the amputation of both his legs.
“He had a medical appointment after a month, but the month closed off his check-ups,” a relative of Abdelrahman said. “He is suffering severely. He is missing his insulin. There is a shortage of food, and he is tired. His health has declined sharply.”
‘Chased like locusts’
Despite the Sudanese army asserting control over access routes, the security situation in Dilling remains precarious. Authorities said the city is subjected to almost daily drone strikes launched by the RSF and SPLM-N, targeting infrastructure and residential areas.
For Maryam, a mother displaced multiple times by the conflict, the breaking of the siege has not brought peace. She described the terror of the unmanned aerial vehicles that hover over their homes.
“Now the drones bombard and chase us. They chase us like locusts,” Maryam said. “When they come, we just run to hide. When they hover over us, they burn the thatch [roofs], start fires and force you to leave your home.”
She added that the constant threat of aerial bombardment makes normal life impossible: “If you are having a meal, like porridge, … the moment you see them, you leave it.”
Uweit said that while the lifting of the siege is a “glimmer of hope” and a first step towards recovery, the dual challenge of rebuilding a shattered health system and fending off persistent military attacks means Dilling’s ordeal is far from over.

After Munich Speech, Rubio Visits Trump’s Allies in Slovakia and Hungary

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio arrived in Slovakia on Sunday, continuing his European tour with visits to countries led by right-wing allies of President Donald Trump, with the next stop Hungary.
The visits come a day after Rubio called on Europeans to defend “Western civilisation” in a speech at the Munich Security Conference, urging them to rally behind the US president’s vision of a “renewal” of the world order.

During a visit of several hours in Bratislava, Rubio is scheduled to meet Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, a nationalist leader who has positioned himself as an ally to Trump.
During a recent visit to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Fico reportedly expressed concern about the US president’s mental state, according to Politico, citing anonymous European diplomats.
Both Washington and Bratislava have vehemently denied this.
The Slovak leader said after the Mar-a-Lago meeting that he and Trump had had “extremely important” discussions on nuclear energy.
The US Secretary of State will then travel to Budapest for meetings on Monday with Hungarian officials, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Trump makes no secret of his support for the right-wing Hungarian nationalist leader, whom he describes as a “strong and powerful man,” ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April 12.
Orban faces the toughest challenge to his grip on power since returning to office in 2010, as his Fidesz party trails opposition leader Peter Magyar’s TISZA party in the polls before the election.

- Friend of MAGA movement -
In a speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to continue his fight against “bought pseudo-civil organisations, journalists, judges and politicians”.
Orban’s rhetoric and politics often echo those of Trump, and he has cast himself as a European friend of Trump’s MAGA movement.
Many American conservatives admire Orban for his hardline anti-immigration stance, resistance to LGBTQ rights and war against “gender ideology”.
Orban has also announced plans to travel to Washington next week to attend the inaugural meeting of Trump’s “Board of Peace”.
Orban also managed to secure Hungary an exemption from US sanctions on importing Russian oil and gas during a visit to the White House last year.
Former Democratic president Joe Biden had a much more hostile relationship with Orban, whom he accused of “looking for a dictatorship” in Hungary, including by muzzling independent media.
Energy is expected to be a major topic of discussion for Rubio in both Bratislava and Budapest, US officials indicated ahead of the trip.
These two nations are landlocked Central European countries that have sought to keep warm ties to the Kremlin despite the 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Both also depend heavily on Russian fossil fuels, and both countries have found themselves locked in a standoff with the European Union over the decision to end imports of Russian gas.
US officials said Washington intends to strengthen energy ties with its two right-wing European allies.

The Smoke-and-Mirrors Rhetoric Shielding Georgia’s Outcast Autocracy

This week, US Vice President JD Vance paid visit to two capitals in the South Caucasus while snubbing a third. Nikol Pashinyan and Ilham Aliyev, the respective leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan, welcomed Vance amid a thaw in relations between their countries. For both states, this marks the highest-level visit of a US official to date.
“You know what the context of Georgian-American relations is. This context is very difficult,” admitted the prime minister of neighboring Georgia, Irakli Kobakhidze, during a press conference following the announcement of Vance’s visit.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Two decades ago, Georgia’s capital Tbilisi hosted then President George W. Bush with great ceremony, but as of late the only procession seen on its main thoroughfare, Rustaveli avenue, has been that of the anti-government protests that have continued for over a year.
The Trump administration, of course, is not averse to making overtures to autocrats, as Baku’s presence on Vance’s tour attests. But Georgia’s authoritarian course has seen the country become particularly isolated on the world stage.
“It’s not only the US, it’s the whole West,” says Giga Bokeria, co-leader of the Federalists opposition party. In another political life, Bokeria had a prominent role in Georgia’s previous pro-Western government – the same that hosted Bush – and so feels keenly the country’s current ostracization under the ruling Georgian Dream party.

“What does it mean for us that they are isolated fundamentally from the UK, from the EU, from the US, all the important allies...? It’s a very dangerous thing – to be left alone vis-à-vis Russia in this region,” he told Kyiv Post.
Georgia’s government has been routinely accused of courting Russia, which invaded the country in 2008 and continues to occupy approximately 20 percent of its internationally recognized territory, during its drift away from the West.
But this alignment cannot be trumpeted. While the Kremlin has made some quietly complimentary gestures in Georgia’s direction – Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova praised its avoidance of a “Ukrainian or Moldovan scenario” in March – Georgian Dream must still pay lip service to a largely pro-European, anti-Russia population in order to survive politically.
The government continually relies on an arsenal of warped foreign policy talking points to shrug off their lost friendships, conceal their appeasement of their northern neighbor, and to maintain their grip on power.
“Immense gaslighting” over Europe
Despite doing everything it can to tarnish its relationship with the EU, Georgian Dream rarely pillory the bloc directly, opting instead for what George Melashvili, a Georgian civic activist and political sciences scholar, calls “rhetorical shenanigans.”
“One of the major pillars of Georgian Dream’s ability to control the country is immense gaslighting,” he told Kyiv Post. This includes an insistence that Georgia can still join the EU at the end of the decade, “a notion that simply does not stand against any critique.”
The period following the government’s suspension of EU accession talks in November 2024 – ostensibly a temporary measure – has seen violent crackdowns on protests, government critics imprisoned, and major opposition parties threatened with bans.
In recent months, Kobakhidze has given a series of interviews to pro-government media where he has claimed openness to cooperation with Europe while expressing concern, of all things, for the state of its democracy – a tactic that Melashvili calls “mirroring.”
“We sometimes joke that whatever Georgian Dream actually is itself, they’re trying to project on others,” he adds.
For an insight into Georgian Dream’s unfiltered feelings about Europe, Melashvili considers its satellite parties an “excellent place” to look. Last week one of these, United Neutral Georgia, called for pro-government broadcasters to host debates on the “harmful process of EU integration.”
Russia’s “natural ally”
Following Russia’s 2008 invasion of Georgia and subsequent recognition of its two breakaway regions – Abkhazia and South Ossetia – as independent states, Georgia severed and has not renewed diplomatic relations with its neighbor. Critics argue, however, that an under-the-table relationship has taken root under Georgian Dream.
Much of the blame for this is directed at one man: while Kobakhidze heads the government officially, billionaire oligarch and Georgian Dream founder Bidzina Ivanishvili is widely regarded as Georgia’s de-facto ruler. He made his fortune in Russia in the years after the Soviet Union’s collapse.
Melashvili is convinced that Ivanishvili’s Russia alignment, if not projected openly, is clear in substance: “I cannot say whether or not Ivanishvili or Kobakhidze are receiving folders with orders from the Kremlin or the [FSB headquarters] Lubyanka, but what we can do is evaluate the results... Georgia’s economic dependency on Russia has increased. Georgia’s political dependency on Russia has also increased.”
Bokeria agrees that the presence or absence of direct Russian orders is beside the point: “The nature of [Ivanishvili’s] rule, his regime, the instincts he plays on... make him a natural ally of Russia.”
“He’s a guy from the 90s in Moscow,” he told Kyiv Post, “that’s where his mentality was shaped and formed.”
The rhetoric this produces, again, is indirect. “The main purpose of GD [Georgian Dream] propaganda is not to portray Russia as the good guys. They know it is impossible,” says Melashvili, instead they “gaslight the Georgian public into believing that the European Union is equally [as bad] or even worse than Russia.”
Russia’s war on Ukraine, Bokeria notes, has gifted Georgian Dream further rhetorical cover for its Kremlin appeasement. “Fear of change is connected with the fear of war in the propaganda of GD,” he explains.
Last year Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry condemned a Georgian Dream campaign ad that placed images of Russia’s war alongside the slogan “Choose peace!”
A bad balancing act
For all its multifarious duplicity, this foreign policy rhetoric is less a masterplan than a desperate gambit.
“All that they care about... it’s not Georgia’s long-term interest or strategy, it’s to sustain the absolute power that they have right now,” Melashvili affirms.
This tunnel vision seems to blind the government to its mounting ostracization. Before Vance landed in Armenia, there were no invites for Georgia to the WEF meeting in Davos, nor to Trump’s recently conceived “Board of Peace.”
Moreover, the president’s “Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,” set to commercially reconcile Armenia and Azerbaijan, threatens to harm Georgia’s strategic importance in the so-called “Middle Corridor.”
“Georgian Dream would absolutely love to be participating in all those meetings and events,” says Melashvili, but “if the cost is to give away even small parts of their power, they will never concede such actions.”
Georgian Dream’s appeals to the Trump administration, both in professed ideological kinship and in calls to lift Biden-era sanctions on government officials, have gone unanswered.
While Georgia’s president Mikheil Kavelashvili claimed Vance expressed a desire for renewed relations when they met at the Winter Olympics in Milan last week, any significant practical steps in this regard are yet to be taken.
If Trump provides a model for playing both sides of the divide between Europe and Russia, then Georgian Dream has been thus far incapable of emulating it. “If we’re talking about a balancing act, then Georgian Dream is doing a horrible job,” says Melashvili. “[They have] not been able to balance Russia with the West or with China or with the United States. They have simply been putting more and more coins on the scales of Russia.”
But the Georgian people have proved more difficult to back into a corner than their government. “We’re not yet in the situation of Belarus, even though we’re getting very close to it,” Melashvili says. “The Georgian public continues to fight.”
Georgian Dream’s press officer did not respond to a request for comment.

Ukrainian freestyle skier Kateryna Kotsar had a Valentine’s Day to remember, clinching a spot in the Winter Olympics big air medals contest and receiving a marriage proposal on the slopes.
Kotsar landed two strong jumps in Monday’s qualifying round, securing 11th place – just above the cutoff of 12 skiers advancing to the final.

Minutes after her final run, her boyfriend, Bohdan Fashtryha, surprised her by getting down on one knee at the side of the Alpine slope. She said yes.
“I think he was nervous. It was so cute, to be honest,” the 25-year-old Kotsar told reporters.
Fashtryha told Suspilne Sport that he had been planning the proposal for two years. When their relationship began, Kotsar had been considering whether to continue her sports career.
With support from her parents, Fashtryha convinced her to stay in the sport.
“She was really thinking about whether to continue her athletic career. I, along with her parents, encouraged her to go on, because the chance to go to the Olympics is unique and can’t be missed. I imagined this moment even back then – two years ago. Since then, so many things have happened, and now Katya is at the Olympics. The brave find happiness. It just so happened that I could be here,” he said.
Earlier in the day, Kotsar had a hard crash on her third run, sending both skis and goggles flying – but her strong first two jumps secured her place in the final. After the proposal, she removed her ski glove to show off her engagement ring.
Kotsar also revealed a message on her glove that read “Freedom of memory”, a gesture of solidarity with skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych, who was disqualified by the IOC for wearing a “memory helmet” honoring fallen Ukrainian defenders and athletes.
“I still am excited and can’t understand what happened tonight because it’s two really huge things for me,” Kotsar said.
Her final Olympic performance is scheduled for Monday, Feb. 16, at 8:30 p.m. Kyiv time.

IDF strikes continue as key meetings loom over Hezbollah disarmament in Lebanon

The IDF continued overnight Sunday to strike sites in Lebanon used for storing weapons and operating launchers belonging to Hezbollah, as daily attacks target what officials describe as the terrorist organization’s efforts to rebuild its capabilities.
Strikes have been carried out by fighter jets, drones targeting vehicles carrying Hezbollah terrorists, as well as artillery and machine gun fire. Despite the sustained military activity, there has been no significant diplomatic breakthrough, and the situation along the northern front appears to be in a holding pattern pending broader regional developments, particularly involving Iran.
Three upcoming meetings are expected to clarify or potentially advance developments.
The first is a Lebanese government session scheduled for Monday. Lebanese Army Commander Rodolphe Haykal provides monthly updates to the cabinet on progress in implementing a plan to consolidate weapons under state control. According to recent reports, he is expected to present the second phase of that plan, covering areas north of the Litani River.
Hezbollah has refused to relinquish its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to the area south of the Litani. The terrorist organization maintains that instead of pressuring it, the Lebanese government should focus on securing the withdrawal of remaining forces from southern Lebanon.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem is also expected to deliver a speech Monday at a memorial event for leaders of the terrorist organization, and is anticipated to address developments in Lebanon and the wider region.
Another key meeting, set for the 25th of the month, involves the ceasefire monitoring mechanism committee, which has convened 13 times in 2025. The body was initially limited to military representatives but was later expanded to include Simon Karam, a former Lebanese ambassador to the United States, as the civilian head of the Lebanese delegation.
Senior Hezbollah officials opposed Karam’s inclusion, describing it as a “second mistake,” following what they called the first error — the plan to consolidate weapons — undertaken “under continued occupation of Lebanese territory and daily attacks.”
From Hezbollah’s perspective, any discussion of its weapons must take place solely within the framework of a domestic Lebanese national defense strategy, free of external pressure and only after several conditions are met: a halt to attacks, the return of Lebanese prisoners and a full withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
The terrorist organization views the ceasefire monitoring committee as having a strictly technical mandate limited to implementing commitments under the agreement, which it says applies only to areas south of the Litani River. Hezbollah lawmaker Ibrahim Mousawi reiterated that position earlier this month.
Al-Akhbar, a Lebanese newspaper affiliated with Hezbollah, published an article Friday titled: “What if the state dared to withdraw from the mechanism?” The piece argued that as long as attacks, destruction and killings continue following the 2024 ceasefire declaration, and as international promises remain unfulfilled, reconsidering cooperation with the mechanism becomes a legitimate question.
The article outlined potential advantages and disadvantages of suspending cooperation, concluding that such a move would restore Lebanon’s national dignity and its right to defend itself “by all means,” asserting that the world respects only those who respect themselves.
A further significant date for Lebanon is March 5, when a conference in France is scheduled to support the Lebanese Army and security forces. A preparatory meeting is expected beforehand. Earlier this month, Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called on Arab states to participate in the conference, saying, “We need your help.”
Lebanese leadership, including President Joseph Aoun, Salam and Haykal, has emphasized in meetings abroad that the army requires substantial assistance to carry out its missions. Haykal recently returned from a visit to the United States, where he met with political and military officials to discuss ways to enhance military cooperation and support the army’s capabilities.
In a statement, the Lebanese Army said American officials praised its performance and operations south of the Litani River.

Details: Sobyanin reported around 15:00 Kyiv time that a drone flying towards Moscow had been shot down. He later said Russian air defences had destroyed 13 UAVs by 16:25. Emergency services are working at the locations where debris from the drones fell, the mayor added.
RIA Novosti says Domodedovo airport temporarily restricted aircraft arrivals and departures, but the measures were later lifted.
Bogomaz claimed that Bryansk Oblast has been under large-scale UAV attack since early morning and that 120 drones have been destroyed so far.
The Russian Defence Ministry claimed earlier that between 09:00 and 13:00 Moscow time (08:00-12:00 Kyiv time), Russian air defence had destroyed 102 Ukrainian fixed-wing drones over the territories of Bryansk, Kaluga and Tula oblasts as well as over the Moscow area, including three flying towards the Russian capital.

Lions lived in Japan thousands of years ago: Study
Study says lions reached Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago when lower sea levels connected it to Eurasia
ISTANBUL
Lions once roamed much of Japan tens of thousands of years ago, researchers said, after fossils long thought to be tiger remains were identified as belonging to an extinct species of lion.
A study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, found that DNA and protein analysis of fossils previously attributed to tigers showed they were from cave lions, Kyodo News reported Sunday.
Scientists collected organic material from 26 subfossils across Japan. By comparing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA and proteins from five samples with global data, they determined that all belonged to cave lions.
“Our findings challenge the long-held view that tigers once took refuge in Japan, showing instead that cave lions were widespread in northeast Asia during this period,” researchers from institutions including the Graduate University for Advanced Studies and Peking University said.
Lions left Africa about 1 million years ago and spread across Eurasia, reaching Japan between 73,000 and 38,000 years ago, when lower sea levels connected the archipelago to the continent.
Fossil evidence from Yamaguchi prefecture suggests they reached western Japan. Humans arrived around 40,000 to 35,000 years ago, and cave lions likely went extinct about 10,000 years ago.
“The findings are significant in terms of studying interaction between lions and tigers and their influence on ecosystems,” said Takumi Tsutaya, an assistant professor at the Graduate University for Advanced Studies.
Large feline fossils have been discovered across Japan, from Aomori Prefecture to Oita Prefecture, and were long assumed to be tiger remains because of the country’s warm, humid climate.

Iran seeks to get out of FATF blacklist amid domestic political divisions
North Korea and Myanmar are the other two countries on the global financial blacklist as Tehran promises to continue efforts to get out of it.
Tehran, Iran – Iran says it will continue efforts to get out of a blacklist of a prominent global watchdog on money laundering and “terrorism” financing despite “20 years of obstruction” from domestic opponents.
The statement by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Iran’s Ministry of Economic Affairs on Sunday came two days after the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) renewed its years-long blacklisting of Iran, according to a report by the official IRNA news agency.

- Refuse to establish representative offices of Iranian financial institutions and VASPs or consider the noncompliance risks involved.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing offices in Iran.
- On a risk basis, limit business relationships or financial transactions, including virtual asset transactions, with Iran or people inside the country.
- Prohibit financial institutions and VASPs from establishing new correspondent banking relationships and require them to undertake a risk-based review of existing ties.
Even the flow of funds involving humanitarian assistance, food and health supplies as well as diplomatic operating costs and personal remittances are recommended to be handled “on a risk basis considering the “terrorist” financing or proliferation financing risks emanating from Iran”.
What does the FATF move mean?
Iran has been blacklisted by the FATF for years and is currently on the list in the company of just two other countries: North Korea and Myanmar.
Since October 2019, Iran has had “heightened measures” like supervisory examination and external audit requirements recommended against it and has been subject to “effective countermeasures” since February 2020.
This contributed to making access to international transactions increasingly difficult or impossible for Iranian banks and nationals and made the country more dependent on costlier shadowy third-party intermediaries for transactions.
The new countermeasures emphasise existing frameworks but also specifically cite virtual assets, signalling an increased focus.
The fact that the FATF also urges countries and global institutions to remain wary of risks of having any dealings with Iran may mean even more limited transaction opportunities for Iranian entities and nationals.
Small banks maintaining old correspondent relations with Iranian counterparts may also reconsider after being recommended to re-evaluate existing links.
The isolation has hobbled state-run or private income streams and contributed to the continuous depreciation of the Iranian rial over the years.
Links with Iran’s nuclear dilemmas
The FATF, formerly known by its French name, was established by the Group of Seven (G7) countries in 1989 to combat money laundering but later had its mandate expanded to countering financing of “terrorism” and weapons of mass destruction.
It has been formally raising concerns about Iran since the late 2000s, which is also when it started calling for countermeasures as international tensions grew over Iran’s nuclear programme and the country was sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.
But a year after Iran signed a landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers that lifted the sanctions, the FATF also acknowledged a “high-level political commitment” from Iran and agreed to an action plan for the country to address its compliance requirements.
The centrist government of President Hassan Rouhani, who had clinched the deals, pressed ahead with ratifying several laws needed to fulfil the action plan despite opposition from hardliners who were firmly against the increased financial transparency and international supervision.
But United States President Donald Trump unilaterally reneged on the nuclear deal in 2018, imposing a “maximum pressure” campaign that has remained in effect until today. The move empowered the argument from the hardliners in Tehran, who succeeded in blocking the ratification of the rest of the FATF-linked legislation, leaving the issue dormant for years.
Washington has retained the sanctions over the years with some of the latest – including the blacklisting in January of two United Kingdom-based cryptocurrency exchanges – allegedly connected to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
The UN Security Council sanctions were also reinstated against Iran in September when Western powers triggered the “snapback” mechanism of the nuclear accord. They include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel bans as well as nuclear, missile and banking sanctions that are binding for all UN member states.
Support for ‘axis of resistance’
The Iranian hardliners railing against any progress on FATF-related legislation have presented two main concerns.
They assert that fully adhering to the watchdog’s guidelines would curb Tehran’s ability to back its “axis of resistance” of aligned armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and Palestine. The axis lost its base in Syria with the fall of President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.
Hardliners have also suggested that Iran’s ability to circumvent US sanctions may be significantly compromised by disclosing all the information required by the FATF.
Iran has been selling most of its oil to China at hefty discounts, using a shadow fleet of ships that turn their transponders off to avoid detection in international waters. The country has also for years been forced to rely on a capillary network of currency exchanges and intermediaries, some of them based in neighbouring countries, such as Türkiye and the United Arab Emirates.
To assuage some of the domestic concerns, two FATF-related laws ratified by Iran in 2025 were passed with special “conditions” and reservations infused in the text.
One of the main conditions was that the ratified regulations must not “prejudice the legitimate right of peoples or groups under colonial domination and/or foreign occupation to fight against aggression and occupation and to exercise their right to self-determination” and “shall not be construed in any manner as recognition of the Zionist occupying regime”, a reference to Israel.
Iran also said it would not accept any referral to the International Court of Justice and asserted that its own Supreme National Security Council would determine which groups qualify as “terrorist” outfits.
Those conditions were rejected by the FATF, leading to the increased countermeasures.
The watchdog also said it expects Iran to identify and freeze “terrorist assets” in line with relevant UN Security Council resolutions. Some of Iran’s nuclear and military authorities are among individuals sanctioned by those resolutions.

Berlinale chief urges ‘cool heads’ amid backlash over Wim Wenders’ no-politics comment
Some guests pull out of event after famed German filmmaker said Berlin Film Festival has ‘to stay out of politics’; festival director says artists are free to express opinions
BERLIN, Germany — The head of the Berlin Film Festival has sought to draw a line under a row over whether filmmakers should take political stances that has marked the opening days of the event.
In a statement released late Saturday, festival director Tricia Tuttle reacted to the controversy sparked by comments made by jury president Wim Wenders at a press conference on Thursday when he was asked about the German government’s support for Israel.
“We have to stay out of politics,” Wenders said, stressing that filmmakers had to “do the work of people, not the work of politicians.”
That prompted a backlash, including the decision by award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy to withdraw from the festival, where she had been due to present a restored version of a 1989 film she wrote, “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones.”
“It is hard to see the Berlinale and so many hundreds of filmmakers and people who work on this festival distilled into something we do not always recognize in the online and media discourse,” Tuttle said in her statement.
Some have defended Wenders, saying his remarks were taken out of context.
In the press conference he also spoke of how “movies can change the world” and of the power of films to “change the idea that people have of how they should live.”
In her statement Tuttle thanked the filmmakers, juries and others working at the festival for their “cool heads in hot times.”
She emphasized that artists “are free to exercise their right of free speech in whatever way they choose” and should not “be expected to speak on every political issue raised to them unless they want to.”
The festival has a reputation for socially conscious programming and Tuttle pointed out that this year’s offering includes “films about genocide, about sexual violence in war, about corruption, about patriarchal violence, about colonialism or abusive state power,” some of them from filmmakers who themselves have experienced persecution.
“We do not believe there is a filmmaker screening in this festival who is indifferent to what is happening in this world, who does not take the rights, the lives and the immense suffering of people in Gaza and the West Bank, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in Sudan, in Iran, in Ukraine, in Minneapolis, and in a terrifying number of places, seriously,” Tuttle said.

Basic Goods in Bulgaria Now Cost More Than in Germany and France

Recent data indicate that the cost of basic foods in Bulgaria has surpassed that of several Western European countries despite the country’s formal entry into the Eurozone. Analysis by the Confederation of Bulgarian Trade Unions and Industry of the “small consumer basket” highlights that five staple items - flour, rice, milk, oil, and banichka - are now priced higher in Bulgaria than in Germany, France, the Netherlands, and even in neighboring Romania and Croatia.
Experts stress that this surge in prices is not directly linked to the adoption of the euro but stems from structural issues within the Bulgarian economy, particularly weak competition in domestic markets. Seasonal goods have seen especially dramatic hikes: cucumbers are up 61.9 percent compared to June last year, while January alone brought price increases of 15.2 percent for tomatoes, 6.5 percent for potatoes, and 5.5 percent for cucumbers. Prices for chicken, yogurt, and eggs are also rising gradually but consistently, adding to household pressure.
Comparing purchasing power across Europe underscores the challenge for Bulgarian families. A “small consumer basket” containing 21 essential items costs 58.80 euros in Bulgaria, and a person earning the minimum wage can afford it only 10 times per month - the lowest ratio in the European Union. In Romania, the same basket costs 47.99 euros and can be bought 16 times with the local minimum wage, while in Croatia, the basket at 52.85 euros can be purchased 19 times. In Germany, despite a higher basket cost of 75.02 euros, a minimum wage of 2,409 euros allows for 32 full purchases, highlighting the disparity in real purchasing power.
The switch to the euro has also affected service prices. Monitoring in January extended to services such as taxis, hairdressing, and parking, revealing price jumps of nearly 6 percent for coffee and 5.6 percent for mineral water in small retail outlets. Analysts attribute much of this increase to psychological effects of rounding during the currency conversion rather than real market forces or fluctuations in international commodity markets.

Hiam Abbass: Silence is not neutral

The start of this year's Berlin Film Festival was marked by a row over how far film should venture into politics but for prominent French-Palestinian actor Hiam Abbass, "everything we do is a political act".
Abbass is starring in two films being presented at this year's Berlinale festival and in an AFP interview she emphasised the importance of a politically engaged approach to cinema.
At Thursday's opening press conference jury president Wim Wenders sparked controversy by saying "we cannot really enter the field of politics", in response to a question about Germany's support for Gaza.
"I don't agree," Abbass told AFP.
"There's a lack of courage among people in the film world -- among some, not all," said Abbass, who gained global attention for her role as Marcia Roy in the hit HBO series Succession.
She recognised that Wenders's remarks were "taken out of context", as he did talk about cinema's capacity to "change the world", albeit in a different way from party politics.
Nevertheless, Abbass said she was glad to see filmmakers at this year's festival "commit to amplifying stories and voices of minorities, oppressed people, people experiencing bombardment, genocides".
"Today more than ever, if we don't tackle these subjects, we're making art for art's sake, and that's something that doesn't interest me."
'Act of resistance'
In "Only Rebels Win" by Lebanese filmmaker Danielle Arbid, Abbass plays a Christian Palestinian living in Beirut who faces a backlash from those around her because of her relationship with a South Sudanese Muslim migrant 40 years her junior.
Israeli bombardments between September and November 2024 forced the production to relocate from Beirut to a studio near Paris, where the team deployed creative solutions to recreate the Lebanese capital.
Abbass said the circumstances turned the film into "an act of resistance".
When the bombardment of Beirut began, "I told Danielle: 'Whatever you do, wherever you go, I'll follow you, because this film has to get made'."
Academy's 'open-mindedness'
Before starting on "Only Rebels Win", Abbass had just finished working on "Palestine 36" by Annemarie Jacir, a depiction of the Palestinian uprising against the British Mandate in 1936.
Abbass said that the "the film waited eight months so that it could be shot," with production forced to move to Jordan instead of the occupied West Bank.
Abbass said that the team decided that "at a certain point, we couldn't keep being subject to" the decisions of the Israeli government.
She also welcomed the Academy's decision to include three films highlighting the Palestinian experience in its shortlist for best international feature film: "Palestine 36", Kaouther Ben Hania's "The Voice of Hind Rajab" and Cherien Dabis's "All That's Left of You".
Only Kaouther Ben Hania's film ultimately made the final list of five nominees.
But Abbass praised the "open-mindedness" of the Academy to bring these films "almost to the final stages of the Oscars" after what she said Israel's genocide in Gaza.

Increased US military presence in Middle East aims to defend forces: Rubio
Secretary of state emphasizes diplomacy with Iran as Witkoff, Kushner travel for negotiations
ISTANBUL
The US’ increased military presence in the Middle East is intended to defend American forces from potential threats rather than signal an imminent attack on Iran, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday.
"We are postured in the region for one simple reason, and that is that we understand that there could be threats to our forces in the region," Rubio told reporters alongside Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Washington wants to ensure "sufficient capacity to defend them, if, God forbid, that were to happen," he added.
Asked whether the Trump administration would consult and inform Congress before attacking Iran or removing Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Rubio said US President Donald Trump "prefers diplomacy and an outcome of negotiated settlement."
"We're dealing with people who make political, geopolitical decisions on the basis of pure theology, and it's a complicated thing," Rubio said, adding "No one's ever been able to do a successful deal with Iran, but we're going to try."
The US attacks on Iran last June were carried out without congressional approval or notification of top Democratic leaders in Congress. Some lawmakers objected, saying the attacks took place despite there being no imminent threat to the United States.
Rubio also said special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who have been active in the Middle East, are currently traveling for "important meetings," adding: "We'll see how that turns out."
The secretary of state pledged to "always comply with the applicable laws of the United States in terms of involving Congress" in any decisions, adding: "But right now, we're not talking about any of that. We're talking about negotiations."
"The president made that clear: If that changes, it'll be obvious to everyone, and obviously whatever the law requires us to do, we'll do," Rubio said.
The US has significantly increased its military presence in the region, deploying the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group with reports of plans to send the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier amid heightened tensions with Tehran.

Wealth Concentration Grows: Bulgaria Sees Sharp Rise in High-Value Deposits

The latest data from the Bulgarian National Bank reveal a striking growth in large household deposits by the end of December 2025. Deposits exceeding 1 million leva surged by 32.9 percent over the year, bringing the total number of such accounts to 2,447 - an increase of 606 compared to the same period in 2024. The funds accumulated in these high-value accounts reached 6.222 billion leva, up 1.613 billion leva or 35 percent year-on-year. Much of this increase occurred in the final quarter, when 386 new million-leva deposits were added and balances rose by more than 1.3 billion leva.
A similar pattern is evident among deposits between 500,000 and 1 million leva. These accounts grew by over 1,300 during 2025, reaching a total of 5,318, with the funds deposited totaling 3.613 billion leva. Overall, household savings in Bulgaria remain robust, amounting to 107.07 billion leva, which marks an annual rise of nearly 20 percent. The total number of deposits nationwide exceeds 9.18 million, reflecting a clear stratification in saving behavior.
While large deposits continue to expand rapidly, smaller savers are moving in the opposite direction. Accounts holding up to 1,000 leva, which make up almost half of all deposits, declined both in number and total funds. By the end of December, these small accounts fell 5.4 percent year-on-year, with balances dropping to 729.9 million leva. The data underscore a widening gap between high-value depositors, whose wealth is consolidating quickly, and small savers, who are increasingly drawing on their funds or managing expenses more cautiously.

Iran’s Araghchi slams European powers for ‘irrelevance’ in nuclear talks
Foreign minister says regional powers have been ‘far more effective’ than European countries.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has derided the Munich Security Conference as a “circus”, accusing European powers of “paralysis and irrelevance” in efforts to revive nuclear negotiations with the United States.
Iranian officials were not invited to the annual security meeting in the German city.

“Sad to see the usually serious Munich Security Conference turned into the ‘Munich Circus’ when it comes to Iran,” Araghchi wrote on X on Sunday.
“The paralysis and irrelevance of the EU/E3 is displayed in the dynamics surrounding the current talks over Iran’s nuclear program. … Once a key interlocutor, Europe is now nowhere to be seen. Instead, our friends in the region [the Gulf] are far more effective and helpful than an empty-handed and peripheral E3.”
The E3 – which included France, the United Kingdom and Germany – were key players in the previous round of nuclear negotiations between world powers and Iran. That process culminated in 2015 with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, a landmark agreement aimed at limiting the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief.
The US under the first administration of President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and ramped up sanctions on Iran. Since then, the process has largely stalled. Still, the E3 maintained a role as a go-between with Tehran and Washington.
But since negotiations resumed last year, Gulf countries, such as Oman and Qatar, have taken the lead in facilitating talks between the US and Iran.
Araghchi made the remarks before leaving Tehran to lead a diplomatic and technical delegation to Geneva for a new round of nuclear talks with the US. The talks follow last week’s indirect negotiations in Oman, which is mediating the process, Iran’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
During his visit, Araghchi is expected to meet his Swiss and Omani counterparts, as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials.
Abas Aslani, a senior research fellow at the Center for Middle East Strategic Studies, said Araghchi’s comments “indicate a policy shift from the Iranian side that the E3 mechanism … is no longer a valid channel for resolution”.
“This nuclear mediation has moved from Europe to the region, and now the heavy lifting in diplomacy is done by regional players,” he said.
On Tuesday, Oman is to host talks between the US and Iran in Geneva after previous indirect negotiations in Muscat on February 6. Those talks were attended by US envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner.
US and Iranian officials previously held several rounds of talks in the Omani capital to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme last year. But that process was halted as Israel launched a 12-day war with Iran in June, which the US briefly joined by bombing three Iranian nuclear facilities.
The new rounds of negotiations come as tensions in the region remain high, with Trump moving more US military assets to the Middle East. On Friday, the US president said he was sending a second aircraft carrier to the region while openly talking about a change in Iran’s government.
Despite the new push for diplomacy, the two sides have maintained their positions. Iran has shown flexibility in discussing its nuclear programme, but the US wants to widen the talks to include Iran’s ballistic missiles and its support for regional armed groups – two issues that Tehran says are nonnegotiable.

Despite Qatar’s moderate image, its textbooks are filled with antisemitism, study finds
Schools in country continue to teach Jew-hatred, portray Christians as infidels and idolators, and legitimize violent jihad, IMPACT-se says
Zev Stub is the Times of Israel's Diaspora Affairs correspondent.
School textbooks in Qatar teach antisemitic content, portray Christians and other non-Muslims as infidels and idolators, and legitimize the call for violent jihad, according to a report released last week by the Institute for Monitoring Peace and Cultural Tolerance in School Education (IMPACT-se).
The study, part of IMPACT-se’s research program, examined primary and secondary school textbooks across multiple subjects, measuring them against UNESCO-based standards for peace and tolerance in education.
Despite Qatar’s efforts to present itself as a modern state working for peace in the Middle East, problematic content remained unchanged for the fourth straight year, showing that reforms have effectively “plateaued,” IMPACT-se said. This is despite public condemnation of the curriculum by the US State Department in 2024, it added.
Researchers examined 52 textbooks across subjects including Islamic education, social studies, history, and Arabic literature, and found that they continue to reproduce narratives that contradict Qatar’s international image as a moderate diplomatic hub.
Textbooks portray Jews as “materialistic, arrogant, deceitful, and hostile to Islam.” Jews are associated with traits such as lying, scheming, and breaching agreements.
In history education, the portrayal of the 20th century remains highly problematic. A 12th grade history textbook covering World War II fails to mention the Holocaust, Nazi policies against Jews in Germany and elsewhere, or the antisemitic components of Hitler’s ideology. Instead, the text vaguely alludes to Hitler’s “racist ideas” without identifying the victims of his policies.
The curriculum also often denies Jewish historical ties to the region. The 1917 Balfour Declaration is presented not as a recognition of Jewish national claims, but as a cynical British move to curry favor with “Jewish influence” in the United States and Russia.
Violent interpretations of jihad and the glorification of martyrdom are “prominent features” of the curriculum. Islamic education lessons praise the upbringing of children “to love jihad” and teach that God rewards those who die fighting for Islam with entry into paradise.
Non-Muslims, including Christians, are frequently treated with disrespect, referred to as “infidels” (kufr) and “polytheists.” The curriculum characterizes these faiths as being in a state of “ignorance” and “polytheism” from which the Prophet Muhammad came to rescue humanity.
Textbooks warn students that non-belief in Islam results in eternal punishment in “hellfire.” Objective information about other faiths is rare, and non-Islamic nations, particularly Western countries, are occasionally treated with suspicion.
The curriculum also maintains a consistently anti-Israel stance that often legitimizes violence. Israel is framed exclusively as an “occupation,” and its existence is erased from maps, which label the entire territory as Palestine.
Attacks by Hamas and other terror groups are euphemistically described as “military operations.” Students are encouraged through poetry and prose to “draw swords” and sacrifice their lives in the fight against “the Zionist enemy.”
The curriculum rejects the UN Partition Plan and the two-state solution, asserting that Muslims must not concede “any part” of Palestine.
All of this is at stark odds with the “educational vision grounded in moderation, dialogue, and rejection of hatred” put forward by Qatari officials, the report said.
“Education policy offers a revealing window into how a state understands itself, its values, and its relationship to other nations,” the report said. “Following the Hamas terror organization’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, developments within Qatar’s education ecosystem have underscored the persistent gap between official rhetoric and institutional practice.”
Previous investigations by IMPACT-se have found worrying trends in school curricula in European countries like Ireland and Poland. Recent reports on schools in Gaza and Syria have shown continued promotion of antisemitism, violence, and martyrdom within their educational systems.

Poll: Around 62% of Czechs want Prague-led ammunition initiative for Ukraine to keep going
Around 62% of Czech citizens support the continuation of a Prague-led initiative to purchase ammunition for Ukraine.
Source: České noviny, a Czech news outlet, as reported by European Pravda
Details: A poll conducted in January found that 62% of Czechs back the continuation of the Czech-led initiative, while 36% are against it.
Another 3% of respondents were undecided.
Pavel Ranocha, an analyst at Kantar CZ, the Czech branch of the global market research firm Kantar, says almost 100% of opposition party voters back the continuation of the initiative to supply ammunition to Ukraine.
Among supporters of ruling parties, two-thirds of Motorists voters would approve such a decision. Half of ANO supporters and one-fifth of SDP supporters gave the same response.
Background:
- Before taking office as Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš promised to scrap the Czech-led initiative that helps supply Ukraine with artillery ammunition.
- After a meeting of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris, Babiš said the initiative on ammunition for Ukraine can continue if it is financed by other states.
- A senior NATO official recently said the Czech-led initiative has found significantly more shells than expected.

German Chips Widely Used in Russian UAVs Despite Sanctions

Despite sanctions, German components continue to be found in Russian drones used in attacks on Ukraine. According to journalists, their number may reach hundreds of thousands.
DW reported on this.
Electronic components made by German manufacturers have been identified in Russian UAVs targeting Ukrainian cities. German media again highlighted the issue in January 2026 after analyzing the new Geran-5 jet drone.
In late January 2025, after experts from Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence (DIU) examined the wreckage of a new Russian jet drone, they reported finding transistors produced by Germany’s Infineon Technologies among other foreign components.
According to the DIU, most foreign components in Russian military equipment originate from the United States and China, while 137 items of German origin were documented. More than half were found in drones, with the rest identified in missiles, radar systems, military vehicles, and helicopters.
The most common German components are transistors, accounting for around 50 items. Other parts include pumps, inductors, generators, capacitors, transformers, and batteries. Most of the German transistors were found in UAVs.
The Bavarian company Infineon Technologies accounts for 58 of the 137 identified German components, most of them transistors used in drones. EPCOS AG manufactured seven electronic components found in drones. Nine parts were produced by Würth Elektronik, five of them identified in UAVs. Three pumps made by Pierburg, a subsidiary of Rheinmetall, were found in the Geran-2 UAV.
In an interview with DW, a DIU representative stressed that Russia has recently sought to reduce its dependence on Western components in UAV production. While in 2023, U.S.-made components accounted for up to 80% of parts in some versions of the Shahed-136 family, Chinese components now make up as much as 60%. At the same time, the use of German transistors remains widespread despite sanctions.
According to the DIU, Russian manufacturers have been reluctant to replace German parts with lower-quality Chinese alternatives due to their availability and reliability.
“Infineon transistors are used in a large number of household appliances and general-purpose goods, so there are no significant obstacles to purchasing them in the required quantities,” he said.
DW contacted the German companies whose products were identified in Russian weapons. The manufacturers claimed that they comply with sanctions but acknowledged that controlling the resale of civilian products is extremely difficult. Infineon stated that all deliveries to Russia have been halted since 2022, but added that “it is difficult to control the resale of products throughout their entire life cycle, as Infineon produces about 30 billion chips per year.”
According to DW’s estimates, Russia could require nearly 500,000 German transistors in 2025 for the production of Geran-2 strike drones alone.
The DIU believes that, in many cases, German-made transistors are purchased for Russia directly in Germany via intermediaries to conceal the supply chain. The components are then routed to Russia via third countries considered friendly to the Kremlin or through smuggling channels.
German law professor Viktor Winkler, an expert on sanctions policy, told DW that since 2022, deliveries of components from Germany to Russia have become increasingly likely to be routed directly through German shell companies rather than via third countries.

12 said killed in IDF Gaza strikes, including senior Islamic Jihad commander
Military says it targeted terror operatives after ‘blatant’ ceasefire violation; Nasser Hospital warns MSF of consequences if it doesn’t retract claim of gunmen in hospital
The Israel Defense Forces launched a wave of airstrikes in the Gaza Strip overnight and on Sunday morning, saying it targeted terror operatives in response to a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire a night prior.
At least 12 people were killed in the strikes, Hamas authorities said, with media reports saying that the dead included a senior Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander.
The IDF, in a statement, said it had targeted terror operatives in northern Gaza, Gaza City, and Khan Younis, after five Palestinian gunmen emerged from a tunnel and approached troops on the Israeli side of the ceasefire line on Saturday night.
The targeted terror operatives “had recently been working to restore the capabilities of the terror organizations in the Strip and were advancing terror attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel,” the military said.
Among those killed in the strikes was a Hamas terrorist — named as Ahmad Bayouk — who infiltrated the Re’im military base during the October 7, 2023, onslaught, according to the IDF.
“The IDF views any violation of the ceasefire agreement with utmost severity and will continue to operate against any attempt by terrorist organizations in the Gaza Strip to carry out attacks against IDF troops and the State of Israel,” the military added.
According to Palestinian media reports, an Israeli airstrike on western Gaza City’s Tel al-Hawa killed a senior commander in the al-Quds Brigades, Palestinian Islamic Jihad’s wing, and wounded several other people.
Media outlets, including the PIJ-affiliated Palestine Today channel, identified the commander as Sami al-Dahdouh, 56.
Dahdouh’s three brothers, including former Quds Brigades commander Khaled Dahdouh, were reportedly assassinated by Israel in separate attacks in Gaza some two decades ago. Other than Dahdouh, the identities of people reported killed were not immediately published in major Palestinian outlets.

The Gaza civil defense agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south.
Five people were killed and several injured when a separate airstrike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement.
“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who said his nephew was killed in the Jabalia strike. He said the people killed there were hit as they slept.
“We’ve been living under a truce for months, and they’ve still targeted us. Israel operates on this principle — saying one thing and doing another,” Abu Askar told AFP.
Five more people were killed and several injured in a separate early-morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the city’s Nasser Hospital announced. According to the hospital, all five were men in their 20s.
Rami Shaqra told the Associated Press that his son, al-Baraa, was among a group of gunmen who were “securing the area” when they were killed by an airstrike. AP footage from the morgue showed at least two of the men had headbands denoting membership in Hamas’s military wing.
The civil defense agency also said that one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia in northern Gaza. The reports did not differentiate between civilians and terror operatives.
Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, accused Israel of committing a new “massacre” against displaced Palestinians. A military official called Sunday’s strikes “precise” and in line with international law.
In a separate incident on Sunday, the military said several Palestinians who were carrying out “suspicious activity on the ground” and approaching troops in the northern Gaza Strip were targeted in an airstrike.
According to the IDF, troops of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade identified the terror operatives on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line. The army said that in addition to “carrying out suspicious activity on the ground,” the operatives approached the soldiers “in a manner that posed an immediate threat.”
After they were identified, the Israeli Air Force struck and “eliminated two of the terrorists to remove the threat,” the IDF said. It did not specify what happened to the others.
Meanwhile, the IDF also announced that a strike on Monday, in response to an attack by gunmen on troops in southern Gaza’s Rafah a day prior, killed a Palestinian Islamic Jihad commander.
Azem Abu Huli, who headed Islamic Jihad’s elite forces in the Strip’s center, was responsible for supplying weapons to other terror operatives, as well as advancing attacks against troops, the army said.
Abu Huli also commanded Islamic Jihad terrorists who invaded Israel on October 7, and throughout the war, also trained operatives “to practice scenarios involving the abduction of IDF soldiers,” the IDF added.
Nasser Hospital warns MSF over suspending work due to ‘armed men’
Meanwhile, after Doctors Without Borders announced it was suspending nonessential activities at Nasser Hospital due to the presence of gunmen, the hospital on Sunday accused the aid group, known by its French acronym MSF, of “aiding in manufacturing consent” for potential attacks on the southern Gaza medical center.
The Khan Younis hospital said there will be “foreseeable and grave consequences” if MSF does not retract the statement.
In the English-language press release via the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry, the hospital claimed the presence of armed men “is aimed at securing safety for the staff and patients.”
According to the hospital, the armed men seen on site are not military personnel but rather police carrying out “protective, civilian and lawful” action against “uncontrolled individuals and groups” that have attacked the hospital.
“Despite full transparency and repeated clarification, MSF issued statements that misrepresent facts and mirror narratives historically used to justify attacks on hospitals,” Nasser Hospital said. “MSF is aiding in manufacturing consent for attacks against the hospital.”
The hospital issued a “formal notice” to MSF to “immediately retract” its allegations.
“Failure to do so risks material contribution to the endangerment of a protected medical facility, with foreseeable and grave consequences,” said the hospital.
Last week, MSF said it was suspending its work at the facility due to “a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons.” The aid group also said that armed men had been arresting patients.
Israel has long offered evidence of medical facilities’ regular use by Palestinian terror groups as bases of operations due to their protected status. Hostages have also said they were held at Nasser Hospital.
Last year a doctor who also serves as a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital hinted that he had been threatened by Palestinian Islamic Jihad due to his refusal to let the terror group’s operatives enter and use the hospital.
Israel announced earlier this month that it was terminating all the organization’s activities in Gaza and the West Bank after it failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff. MSF slammed the move, which takes effect on March 1, as a “pretext” to obstruct aid. Israel has accused MSF of having at least two employees who held membership in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas terror groups.
MSF has been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza, particularly since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion and massacre in southern Israel triggered a two-year war in the enclave.

Some European policymakers welcome U.S. Secretary of State Rubio's warm words, others remain cautious

Many European policymakers appear to still be smarting from U.S. Vice President JD Vance's tough words about the region at last year's Munich Security Conference.
So, it's perhaps not too surprising that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's comments on Saturday at this year's event underscoring the U.S. and Europe's common heritage, goals and challenges have come as something of a relief in European capitals.
"[Rubio] delivered a speech which still assured us that we stand together in this partnership between Europe and the United States," German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told CNBC in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. "Of course, there are some questions which we will have to discuss, but in the end of the day, his message was clear that we were so successful in the past, and we should do the job once again with new threats, with new tests in the 21st century."
On Saturday, Rubio said the U.S. has no intention of abandoning its deep alliance with Europe and wants the region to succeed.
"We want Europe to be strong," he told the gathering of defense and security officials in the German city. "We believe that Europe must survive, because the two great wars of the last century serve, for us, as history's great reminder, that ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours."
Contrast that to Vance's message to the same crowd last year, when he spoke of the "retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America." He lambasted his audience about the health of their democracies, their migration policies and freedom of speech.
While Rubio's tone might have been more conciliatory than Vance's, the underlying issues remained the same, as some conference attendees acknowledged.
"Of course, there were some issues he raised. We would answer differently when it comes to the migration problem, when it comes, of course, to question how we organize our legal framework here in Europe with regard to the digital services. And of course, also with the question of freedom of speech and so," Wadephul said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has frequently criticized Europe for its open migration policies, for being too reliant on the U.S. for its security and has pushed NATO allies to boost defense spending. His pursuit of ownership of Greenland, a Danish territory, has also rattled European leaders in recent months.
"The message we heard (from Rubio) is that America and Europe are intertwined, they have been in the past and will be in the future," the EU's chief diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said at a panel discussion on Sunday. "I think this is important. It is also clear that we don't see eye-to-eye in all the issues and that this will remain the case. But I think we can work from there."
'Europe bashing'
A recurring theme at this year's event has been an earnest investigation into how Europe can stand on its own two feet, militarily and economically, in the face of challenges from Russia and China while the U.S. seeks to rework the global post-war order it created.
While European leaders acknowledge they must become less dependent on the U.S.'s security umbrella and markets, some bristle at the Trump administration's more confrontational approach compared to its predecessors.
"I think there were messages for us, and there were messages for the public in America, especially their constituents," Kallas said. "For me, every time I hear this European bashing, it's very in fashion right now, I'm thinking of what is the alternative?"
Others were even more critical of Rubio's comments.
"To be frank, I think the fact that we have, for Europeans, [been] asked to comment on the speech by the Americans, is already part of the problem," Benjamin Haddad, France's Minister Delegate for Europe, said at the same panel.
"We should not either be relieved or shocked by this or that speech. And I think the worst lesson we could draw from this weekend is to say 'I can cling to some love words I heard in part of his speech and push the snooze button.'"
He said Europe should "just focus on ourselves, focus on what we can control. Focus on our rearmaments, on the support for Ukraine, and the threat that Russia poses to all of our democracies. Focus on competitiveness."
Wadephul told CNBC that work to become more independent is underway.
"But this is what we are doing on our own, and Europe has also learned that, of course, if you ask for more European sovereignty, you will receive it," he said.
"And that also means that, of course, we are more independent than we were in the past. And of course, we are looking for new global partners in the world which are willing to work together with Europe, for instance, Japan, India, Brazil and so on. So this is, I would say, if you are looking to a new global order, this means we keep our alliances, but additionally, we have new global partners, and this is a good future for Europe."

Syria assumes control of another base from US forces, the second within days
Syrian Arab Army takes over Al-Shadadi in northeast of country, close to Jordan-Iraq border; site formerly housed prison where Kurdish forces held Islamic State members
DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria’s defense ministry said on Sunday it had taken over the Al-Shadadi base in the northeast from US forces, days after assuming control of a facility near the Jordan-Iraq borders.
“The forces of the Syrian Arab Army have taken over the Al-Shadadi military base in the Hasakeh countryside following coordination with the American side,” a ministry statement said.
US forces operating as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State group had been stationed at the base outside the town of the same name.
The town housed a prison where Kurdish forces detained members of the extremist jihadist organization, before government forces advanced into the area last month.
Sunday’s announcement follows US confirmation on Thursday that its forces had vacated Al-Tanf base near Syria’s borders with Jordan and Iraq.
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were a major partner of the US-led international coalition against ISIS, and were instrumental in the group’s territorial defeat in Syria in 2019.
But following the fall in December 2024 of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, the United States has drawn closer to the new government in Damascus, recently declaring that the need for its alliance with the Kurds had largely passed.
Despite ISIS’s territorial defeat, the group remains active, however.
On Saturday, the US Central Command said its forces had struck more than 30 ISIS targets in Syria this month.
A CENTCOM statement said the air strikes between February 3 and 12 hit ISIS “infrastructure and weapons storage targets.

France Considers Purchasing South Korean K239 Chunmoo Multiple Launch Rocket Systems

22:10:46 KST

The French Army is considering the purchase of South Korea’s K239 Chunmoo multiple launch rocket systems as a temporary solution to enhance its long-range strike capability.
According to Opex360, France’s artillery units currently operate only a small number of outdated LRU (M270) launchers. These systems require extensive maintenance and are no longer suited to the demands of modern high-intensity warfare.
France officially plans to develop its own long-range strike system, the FLP-T (Frappe Longue Portée – Terrestre), designed to provide a credible deep-strike capability. However, the system is not expected to enter service before 2030.
As a result, France has examined foreign alternatives, including the U.S.-made M142 HIMARS and Israel’s PULS system. Nevertheless, a recent study by the French think tank IFRI recommends the South Korean K239 Chunmoo, manufactured by Hanwha Aerospace, as the preferred option.
The expert analysis highlights that the K239 Chunmoo is a modern, multi-role, multiple-launch rocket system with a wide range of available munitions and relatively short delivery timelines.
It is already in service or on order in several European countries, including Norway and Estonia, as well as Poland, which is expanding ammunition production in Europe for this system.
Under the 2024–2030 Military Programming Law (LPM), France is focusing on a sovereign solution to replace its M270 LRU launchers as part of the Long Range Land Strike (FLP-T) program. Two teams are working in parallel on the project – Safran/MBDA and Thales/ArianeGroup – with the selection of the winner expected in 2026.
The target specifications for FLP-T include a range of over 150 km, with delivery to the armed forces by 2030, followed by a gradual increase in range to 500–1,000 km. These timelines have prompted France to consider India’s Pinaka multiple-launch rocket system as a temporary measure to bridge the capability gap until the national system enters serial production.
In April 2025, at the exhibition in Le Bourget, the French company unveiled the fully French-made Foudre multiple launch rocket system, positioned in the same category as the American HIMARS.
The developers present it as a “100% French-made” system capable of directly competing with HIMARS.
In October 2025, French defense companies MBDA and Safran developed the Thundart multiple-launch rocket system to compete for a new system of this type for the French Army.

22:01:35 KST

At the World Defense Show 2026 in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Chinese company SKYFEND presented an interceptor drone and a drone equipped with a radio-electronic reconnaissance (RER) system.
Militarnyi’s correspondent reported on this.
Founded in 2020 and headquartered in Shenzhen, SKYFEND Technology specializes in developing counter-UAV technologies targeting small unmanned aerial vehicles.
The company shared that the Skyfend Thunder interceptor drone uses artificial intelligence for autonomous navigation and interception of aerial threats, including fixed-wing drones.
Guided by ground-based sensors, Thunder can independently calculate interception routes and approach targets. The system incorporates visual recognition algorithms and is designed to autonomously lock onto and intercept targets.
“Key features include a central artificial intelligence core with intelligent data processing, cost-effective threat response, and machine learning algorithms capable of adapting to new types of threats,” the company said.
According to the manufacturer, the probability of successful interception is at least 90% against loitering targets moving at speeds of up to 150 km/h. The maximum takeoff weight is 4 kg, and the maximum interception speed reaches 230 km/h. The cruising speed is 100 km/h.
The tactical range is 5 km, and the service ceiling is 3 km. The drone weighs 3.5 kg. Its dimensions are 731 × 731 × 448 mm with propellers and 420 × 420 × 448 mm without propellers. Flight endurance is up to 7 minutes.
The Skyfend Tracer Air II is an electronic reconnaissance system designed to detect radiation sources across a frequency range of 0.4-6 GHz.
The company says the system provides high-precision three-dimensional direction finding, positioning, and AI-based visual recognition to detect communication channels of unmanned systems in complex electromagnetic environments.
The Tracer Air II can detect and localize UAV control channels in real time, including FPV links, electronic warfare systems, radar stations, and communication nodes.
The system supports autonomous mission management, real-time cloud connectivity, cloud-based operational planning, and AI-assisted targeting.
The carrier platform is the SOA200 UAV, with a total weight of 16.8 kg, including the battery, mounting system, radio detection module, and propellers. The video transmission range exceeds 8 km. Hover time is more than 30 minutes, and the maximum flight duration exceeds 32 minutes with the radio detection module installed.
The drone is equipped with a wide-angle camera with an 84-degree field of view and a STA200 radio detection module operating in the 0.4-6 GHz frequency range. The detection range is at least 3 km for DJI RC Pro controllers (FCC, 33 dBm at 2.4/5.8 GHz) and jamming sources, and at least 10 km for 1 W FPV controllers operating in the 0.4/0.9 GHz bands under line-of-sight conditions without electromagnetic interference.
The direction-finding error is less than 1.5–3.0 degrees, depending on the selected frequency band. The system can simultaneously track at least six targets.
Previously, the Ukrainian company SEE (System Electronic Export), together with NAUDI, presented the SEEDIS air target interception system at the World Defense Show.

The NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA) has placed an order with Rheinmetall for 120mm tank ammunition worth approximately €200 million.
Rheinmetall announced this in a press release.
This order is the first firm contract under the 2025 framework agreement for 120mm ammunition. The end customers will be various NATO countries.
The framework agreement signed with NSPA in July 2025 outlines the terms and conditions, as well as the technical specifications, for various types of 120mm tank ammunition. NATO countries and states with equivalent status can use this framework agreement to streamline the procurement of Rheinmetall ammunition.
They can order them directly through NSPA, which significantly simplifies the procurement process of 120mm tank ammunition within the Alliance.
Rheinmetall is actively increasing its ammunition production capacity in Europe. For instance, in the fall of 2025, it was announced that agreements had been made to build new ammunition factories in Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, and Bulgaria.
According to the plan, the company aims to produce at least 1.1 million 155mm artillery shells annually by 2027.

Bulgaria has announced its intention to acquire more than 100 Centauros anti-drone systems from Greece in multiple configurations, under the framework of the European SAFE regulation. The purchase aims to strengthen the country’s capabilities in countering unmanned aerial threats.
Reports from Kathimerini also indicate that Cyprus is evaluating the Centauros systems for safeguarding critical infrastructure and for potential integration with its recently procured Barak MX missile defense system.
The Centauros system, developed by the Hellenic Aerospace Industry (HAI), was initially designed as a ground-based counter-UAV solution but was later adapted for naval use following urgent operations in the Red Sea. Currently, two of Greece’s four MEKO-class frigates are equipped with the system, with plans to deploy it on four FDI-class frigates as well.
HAI is further developing an advanced version featuring an active radar with a 40-kilometer detection range and a “hard strike” capability that uses kinetic means as a last-resort defense when electronic countermeasures fail. This ongoing development underscores the system’s dual utility in both electronic and physical interdiction of aerial threats.

Bulgaria recorded its best-ever result in Olympic ski jumping after Vladimir Zografski placed tenth on the large hill at the Winter Olympic Games.
Competing at the Predazzo venue, the 32-year-old Bulgarian accumulated a total of 277.3 points. He delivered two identical jumps of 133.5 meters, which secured him a place among the top ten in one of the most competitive disciplines of the Winter Games.
Zografski was particularly strong in the opening round, held amid light snowfall, where he ranked sixth overall. His consistency in the final round allowed him to maintain a high position and achieve a landmark finish for Bulgaria in ski jumping.
The gold medal was claimed by reigning world champion Domen Prevc, who finished with 301.8 points. After sitting second following the first jump of 138.5 meters, Prevc sealed victory with the longest leap of the competition, soaring 141.5 meters in his final attempt.
Earlier in the Games, Zografski competed on the normal hill at Predazzo, where he placed 32nd and did not advance to the second round. His performance on the large hill, however, marked a historic breakthrough for Bulgarian ski jumping at the Olympic level.

A procession in memory of Gen. Hristo Lukov took place in Sofia on Saturday, after a court decision lifted the municipality’s ban on the event. The march began at the intersection of Knyaz Aleksandar Dondukov Boulevard and Krakra Street and continued to Trakia Street, where participants stopped in front of a building bearing a commemorative plaque dedicated to Lukov.
Police maintained a strong presence throughout the event, and traffic along part of Dondukov Boulevard was temporarily restricted, according to BTA. Those taking part chanted “General Hristo Lukov” and “Banned, but not forgotten,” lighting candles and torches in front of the house where Lukov once lived.
Municipal Ban and Court Decision
A day earlier, the Metropolitan Municipality announced it had received a notification from the Bulgarian National Union “Edelweiss” on June 10, 2025. The request sought permission to hold the Lukovmarsh on February 14, 2026, along a route starting from the pylons of the National Palace of Culture, passing through Vitosha Boulevard, Patriarch Evtimiy Boulevard, G.S. Rakovski Street, Knyaz Aleksandar Dondukov Boulevard, and ending at 1 Trakia Street.
City authorities said the event had not been approved. Following assessments by the relevant institutions, the mayor issued an order banning the procession. That decision was challenged in the Sofia City Administrative Court, which ultimately overturned the ban, allowing the march to proceed.
Official Opposition and Parallel Demonstration
Ahead of the event, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement strongly opposing the planned holding of the so-called Lukovmarsh and urged all responsible institutions to take every legal step to prevent it.
At the same time, a counter-demonstration was held in the city center. Participants gathered in front of the Courthouse and marched along Alabin Street, concluding at the Vasil Levski Monument. Protesters chanted slogans such as “Sofia is not a Nazi city” and displayed banners reading “No Nazis on our streets.” Police presence was also heightened during this march, and traffic disruptions were reported for a short period.
Both the Lukovmarsh procession and the anti-march unfolded under close security supervision, reflecting the continued public and institutional sensitivity surrounding the event.

Latvia will receive the first of the 84 ordered ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), known locally in the Latvian Armed Forces as Hunter, in spring 2026.
The Spanish outlet elEconomista reported on this.
According to the media, Santa Bárbara Sistemas, the manufacturer of the ASCOD IFV, has signed a contract with Piedrafita, a company specializing in suspension systems for defense vehicles, to supply the suspension system for the Hunter IFVs destined for Latvia.
The first suspension system units have already been delivered and are currently being integrated at the Santa Bárbara Sistemas plant in Trubia, where the Hunter IFVs are being assembled and prepared for delivery under the international contract.
The Hunter IFV, developed on the ASCOD platform in line with the requirements of Latvia’s Ministry of Defence, will be equipped with a suspension system manufactured by Piedrafita. Santa Bárbara Sistemas, a subsidiary of the U.S.-based General Dynamics, stated that this cooperation “strengthens the export of national technologies and the role of the Spanish defense industry within Europe.”
According to the media, the first IFVs are expected to arrive in Latvia this spring, one year after the Latvian Ministry of Defence signed the contract for the initial batch.
The procurement process started in early 2023 and included several stages, notably a comprehensive pre-selection of potential suppliers.
In the autumn of the same year, functional trials of various IFV types were conducted to assess their performance characteristics under real-world conditions.
After the trials were completed, the Latvian National Armed Forces conducted a detailed analysis that considered factors such as compliance with operational requirements, technical specifications, available equipment, total life-cycle cost, delivery timelines, and the level of local industrial participation.
As a result of the evaluation, the ASCOD platform was selected. The contract for the delivery of the first batch of ASCOD infantry fighting vehicles was signed on January 30, 2025. Its value amounted to €387 million. In June 2025, the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers approved the Ministry of Defence’s proposal to procure an additional 42 ASCOD IFVs at the same price. The first vehicles are planned to enter service by autumn 2026.
The procurement contract also covers partial localization of production. Assembly and maintenance of the ASCOD IFVs will take place at the Patria armored vehicle production facility of Defense Partnership Latvia (DPL) in Valmiera, which was opened in May 2024.
According to the Latvian Ministry of Defence, the ASCOD IFVs will be equipped with an automatic cannon, anti-tank guided missiles, a machine gun, and “other modern technologies” to enhance soldiers’ situational awareness on the battlefield.
The IFV crew consists of three servicemen. The vehicle can transport and deploy six fully equipped soldiers.
The ASCOD features Level 4 ballistic protection under the STANAG 4569 standard – capable of withstanding 14.5 mm armor-piercing rounds – as well as Level 4a/4b mine protection, corresponding to resistance against the detonation of 10 kg of explosives.

Bulgaria has taken another step toward upgrading its armed forces, as the government has launched the execution of a key modernization initiative for the Bulgarian Army. The development was confirmed by the press center of the Ministry of Defense.
The first phase of deliveries under the project is already underway. New Stryker combat and support vehicles intended for the Ground Forces are entering the country as part of international agreements signed by the Ministry of Defense within its core defense modernization programs.
On February 14, the initial shipment arrived at the Port of Burgas. It included five Stryker armored combat vehicles delivered from the United States and Canada. In line with the industrial cooperation provisions of the contract, the vehicles will be transported to the TEREM - Ivailo EOOD facility in Veliko Tarnovo, where final assembly will be completed before their transfer to operational units.
Following assembly, the vehicles are scheduled to be handed over to the 61st Mechanized Brigade, strengthening the combat capabilities of the formation based in Karlovo.
The same shipment also included logistical equipment and materials related to Bulgaria’s F-16 fighter aircraft contract. In addition, eight more Stryker armored combat vehicles were delivered under a separate arrangement. These vehicles are provided free of charge through a US-backed program and will be used specifically for training purposes by the 61st Mechanized Brigade.

Israeli man said arrested in UAE over killing of alleged crypto fraudster
Michael Greenberg, a private detective working in Thailand, reportedly found to have ties with group of Russians suspected of gruesome slaying of Roman and Anna Novak last year
An Israeli man was arrested about three months ago in Dubai in connection with the killings of an alleged crypto scam artist and his wife, Hebrew-language media reported Sunday.
Michael Greenberg (also known as Mike Green), a private investigator in Thailand, is not suspected of killing Russian national Roman Novak and his wife Anna in the United Arab Emirates last year, but is alleged to have had some kind of involvement, according to Channel 12, which cited a report last week from the Intelligence Online website.
Greenberg is suspected of having ties to eight suspects in the case who have been arrested. Russian investigators found information on the suspects’ phones that led to Greenberg being arrested in Dubai, according to the report.
There was no immediate comment from the Foreign Ministry.
In November, the New York Post and other outlets reported that Novak raised $500 million through the creation of a fraudulent cryptocurrency app, then went on the run with the money.
Novak and his wife Anna, who were living in the UAE, were apparently lured by criminals to a desert location where an extortion attempt took place.
According to the report, when the kidnappers found that Novak’s crypto wallet was empty, they apparently murdered the pair and dismembered them.
A December report from the Daily Mail, which cited Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, said the husband and wife were forced to watch each other being tortured and that their remains were encased in concrete, and then dumped in the desert where they were eventually found by investigators.

Delyan Dobrev Expected to Leave GERB Leadership and Parliament Amid Internal Tensions

On Monday, Delyan Dobrev, chair of the parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee, former minister and long-standing figure in GERB, is expected to submit a request to withdraw both from the party’s Executive Committee and from parliament. The information was circulated by several media outlets, though neither GERB nor Dobrev has officially confirmed it so far.
According to preliminary expectations, the National Assembly may consider his resignation as its first agenda item during the plenary sitting on Wednesday, February 18.
The information was confirmed to Bulgarian National Television by PR expert Diana Damyanova, who said she was informed by sources close to the matter. She commented that Dobrev has been under intense pressure recently, noting that while she personally respects him, she also holds him responsible for the work of the budget committee, which in her view crossed acceptable limits and influenced subsequent political developments. According to Damyanova, his withdrawal should be seen as a natural step rather than a dramatic break.
Sociologist Evelina Slavkova also downplayed the situation, arguing that Dobrev’s exit could open space for new figures within GERB to take on more prominent roles.
Political analyst Iliyan Vassilev described the possible departure as more than a personal decision, calling it a sign of serious internal erosion within GERB. He stressed that Dobrev has his own political weight and loyal support base, and that losing such a figure at a time of declining electoral backing would not strengthen the party.
Unofficially, Dobrev’s decision is being linked to tensions with party leader Boyko Borissov, although no clear explanation has been given. If confirmed, this would be the third time Dobrev has stepped away from GERB and active politics. His first resignation came in 2017 amid the so-called “Kumgate” scandal involving alleged nepotism in Haskovo. In 2019, he withdrew again during controversy over real estate deals involving relatives, before returning two years later as GERB’s lead candidate in Haskovo.
Dobrev served as Minister of Economy, Energy and Tourism in Borisov’s first cabinet between March 2012 and March 2013. In recent years, he and Borisov often appeared to play contrasting political roles, most notably during confrontations surrounding the attempted "assembly" with “We Continue the Change-Democratic Bulgaria” (WCC-DB). Dobrev became particularly visible as a sharp critic of “We Continue the Change” and for his strained personal relationship with former finance minister Asen Vassilev. At the end of last year, Vassilev won a defamation case against Dobrev over public corruption allegations.
GERB’s deputy chair of parliament and senior party figure Kostadin Angelov said the party had not been formally notified of any resignation. Speaking to Nova TV, he described Dobrev as one of GERB’s recognizable faces and stressed that any withdrawal would be a personal decision that should not trigger political speculation. Angelov emphasized that the party’s strength lies in collective work rather than individual figures.
Angelov also rejected claims of behind-the-scenes agreements over recent Electoral Code changes and said GERB’s position aligns with a 2013 Constitutional Court ruling and the need to protect citizens’ voting rights. He criticized the lack of transparency around the formation of the upcoming caretaker government and commented on the “Petrohan” case, urging restraint and respect for ethical standards, arguing that politicians should focus on prevention through legislation rather than engaging in investigative commentary.

BREST, 15 February (BelTA) – The 38th Independent Guards Air Assault Brigade is in the highest state of readiness for the duration of the ongoing snap inspection of Belarus’ Armed Forces. The units of the Special Forces Command in Brest under review are ready to carry out missions, BelTA learned from Sergei Kuprik, Advisor to the State Secretary of the Security Council.
In line with the Armed Forces’ combat readiness inspection plan upon the decision of the head of state the 38th brigade was brought to the highest state of readiness on 10 February. The paratroopers had to pass a tactical and special training exam during the first stage. An evaluation of their firearm qualifications and physical fitness qualifications began after that.
“They completed a series of tactical qualifications and tasks. They handled them successfully. They began conducting qualifications in firearms training and physical fitness. Yesterday they passed their physical fitness qualifications with flying colors. They did pull-ups in combat conditions in the open air. It should not be any other way for paratroopers. Today they are going through a 5km forced march with full gear. Tomorrow they will continue with qualifications in firearms training by shooting from armored personnel carriers and small arms during the day and at night. A realistic picture will be reported to the head of state as a result,” said Sergei Kuprik.
He assessed the combat readiness of the Brest paratroopers. “It can be said without a doubt that the units under review are ready to carry out their missions,” emphasized the advisor to the state secretary of the Security Council.
The days of the inspection were marked by unstable weather, which manifested itself in frost, snow, thaw, rain, fog, and ice. Sergei Kuprik emphasized that it should in no way affect the accomplishment of tasks by military personnel. “If the weather is bad, will we not defend our Motherland? Out of the question. We must carry out our tasks in any conditions,” noted the advisor to the state secretary of the Security Council.
BelTA reported earlier that the large-scale inspection of the Armed Forces began on 16 January upon instructions of the Belarus president. The primary goal is to see an objective picture, a real state of the troops, and evaluate actions of the military personnel.

Volfovich: Internationalist warriors defend national interests together with the entire Belarusian nation

MINSK, 15 February (BelTA) – Internationalist warriors defend national interests together with the entire Belarusian nation. State Secretary of the Security Council of Belarus Aleksandr Volfovich made the statement during a rally held on the Island of Courage and Sorrow in Minsk on 15 February. The rally was dedicated to the 37th anniversary of the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, BelTA has learned.
Aleksandr Volfovich said: “Internationalist warriors have made a significant contribution and today together with the entire Belarusian nation they defend national interests and continue doing their part by bringing up the younger generation. We thank them for what they did back then and we thank them for what they do today.”
The state secretary of the Security Council noted that participants of the rally traditionally gather on the Island of Courage and Sorrow to pay tribute to and honor the memory of internationalist soldiers, participants in the Afghan War, and participants in all local conflicts.
He noted that no one back then thought that this war would drag on for many years. During the Afghan War more than 620,000 Soviet military personnel fulfilled their duty, demonstrated courage, and remained true to their oath, helping the Afghan people defend their freedom and independence.
“In addition to combat operations the Soviet citizens carried out a noble mission: they built schools, hospitals, enterprises, and helped develop the national economy,” Aleksandr Volfovich added.
Today the world has not become simpler. The geopolitical situation is probably even more acute and complex than it was then, the state secretary of the Security Council continued. But the Belarusian nation knows and remembers its history. After all, those who ignore the lessons of history risk repeating its terrible pages. “More than 60 conflicts of varying intensity are taking place in the world. Perhaps the most striking conflict is near the borders of the Republic of Belarus, in the territory of Ukraine,” he said.
“The Belarusian nation does not want to repeat what happened more than 80 years ago when our grandfathers and great-grandfathers fought to defend and protect the world from Nazism and fascism,” Aleksandr Volfovich emphasized. “We respect our grandfathers and great-grandfathers, we respect the internationalist soldiers who carried out a noble mission. This is why matters of historical memory in our country are considered to be a national interest”.
In his comments to reporters the state secretary of the Security Council mentioned an important task: it is necessary to use such events as examples in order to educate the younger generation so that young people would know that peace and security are the most precious things. This is why today in Belarus all measures are being taken to preserve a peaceful and secure sky over the country’s territory.
“And Afghan War veterans certainly do a lot. They educate generations, they pass on their experience, they are examples of patriotic citizens of their country, and this is very important. This is why such events are held everywhere today. Our head of state attaches great importance to these events,” said Aleksandr Volfovich, adding that the annual address to internationalist soldiers, veterans of the war in Afghanistan, which was read out during the rally today, confirms it.

U.S. Air Force Denies Rumors About Missing Radars on New F-35A Jets

The U.S. Air Force has denied reports that new F-35A fighter jets are being delivered without onboard radars.
According to The War Zone, which cited an official U.S. military response, the Air Force confirmed that Lot 17 F-35A aircraft are currently being supplied with AN/APG-81 radar systems.
“Lot 17 F-35A aircraft are being delivered to the U.S. Air Force with AN/APG-81 radars,” a U.S. Air Force spokesperson told The War Zone.
Previously, Defense Daily claimed that beginning in June 2025, F-35A jets were being delivered without radars.
The journalist claimed that the reason was the lack of readiness of the new AN/APG-85 radar systems, which were planned for use in the latest production batches of the fighter.
According to the media, developers had not completed work on the AN/APG-85, and the older AN/APG-81 version allegedly could not be installed due to modified mounting points.
The publication’s sources claimed that, to maintain proper balance, weight ballast was being installed on the aircraft instead of radars.
Meanwhile, photos of an F-35A fighter fitted with metal disc-shaped weights started circulating online, presented as supposed evidence that the aircraft was being delivered without radars.
Photos of an F-35A fighter fitted with weight ballast instead of a radar, circulated online as “proof” of problems with the new aircraft, actually show a training airframe used by emergency response crews.
This aircraft is not part of the new production batches of the fighter jet.
The photo shows the first-of-its-kind Course for Damaged Disabled Aircraft Recovery (CDDAR), held at Hill Air Force Base in Utah.
A decommissioned F-35A airframe was used to train personnel.
This aircraft sustained significant damage in 2016 due to an engine fire while stationed at Mountain Home Air Force Base.
Because the cost of repairs was deemed excessive, the aircraft was written off and later converted into a training platform.
Specialists from the 388th Maintenance Group, together with the F-35 Joint Program Office, assembled the aircraft over three weeks using parts that had been stored in depots.
The training platform is used to practice scenarios that cannot be performed on operational aircraft due to the high risk of damage.
In particular, during the five-day course, 29 technicians from the United States and partner countries practiced:
It was precisely to simulate the aircraft’s actual weight and center of gravity during such operations that weight ballast was installed on this training airframe, which ultimately led to false reports.

Staffing Crunch Hits European Industry, but Bulgaria Sees High-Tech Vacancy Decline

Recent data from Eurostat highlight a growing labor challenge across the European Union, particularly in the manufacturing sector. Between 2019 and 2023, job vacancies in manufacturing jumped sharply, from 6.52% before the pandemic to 10.74% in 2023, marking the largest increase among all EU economic sectors. This trend points to a significant staffing deficit in an area critical for industrial output. Overall, the EU labor market also experienced a moderate rise in unmet demand, with vacancies across all sectors increasing from 2.28% to 2.78% over the same period.
In contrast, Bulgaria shows a different picture. While the European trend points to rising vacancies, Bulgaria’s total unfilled positions slightly decreased, from 0.88% to 0.79%. The most notable change occurred in the high-tech segment: unfilled positions for software and application developers and analysts fell by over two percentage points, dropping their share to 2.45% in 2023. Manufacturing in Bulgaria is largely stable, with vacancies even decreasing slightly to 0.63%. Instead, the greatest staffing pressure in the country comes from the sales sector, excluding managerial roles, where unfilled jobs rose to 2.27%.
Across Europe, labor shortages are most acute in roles such as sales and marketing managers, as well as in transport and warehousing. By contrast, the IT sector has seen fewer difficulties in recruitment despite high demand. Analysts note that a declining vacancy rate does not necessarily indicate weak demand. In software development, for example, vacancies have decreased, but total employment continues to grow. Even so, the share of unfilled positions for software specialists at 6.9% remains well above the EU average of 2.4%, showing the sector still faces structural staffing pressure.
Some areas, particularly transport and retail trade, reveal concerning dynamics. In these sectors, vacancies are rising while actual employment is falling, suggesting that workers are leaving or that structural challenges and working conditions are deterring potential candidates. The data signal both immediate staffing gaps and longer-term structural risks in key parts of the EU economy.

Iran willing to compromise on nuclear deal if sanctions relief on table, diplomat says

Iran willing to compromise on nuclear deal if sanctions relief on table, diplomat says
Deputy FM tells BBC ‘ball is in America’s court,’ says talks have been ‘positive’; Iran won’t give up missiles, senior diplomat says, calling them ‘defensive capabilities’
Iran is ready to consider compromises to reach a nuclear deal with the United States if Washington is willing to discuss lifting sanctions, Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC in an interview broadcast on Sunday.
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions, but has repeatedly ruled out linking the issue to other questions including its missile arsenal.
“The ball is in America’s court,” he said, “to prove that they want to do a deal.”
“Sanctions have to also be on the table,” Takht-Ravanchi said, referring to the crippling international sanctions that his country faces, which have contributed to the near-collapse of the Iranian economy.
Takht-Ravanchi confirmed that a second round of nuclear talks would take place on Tuesday in Geneva, after Tehran and Washington resumed discussions in Oman earlier this month.
“(Initial talks went) more or less in a positive direction, but it is too early to judge,” Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC.
Asked if his country was willing to transfer its stockpile of enriched uranium to a third country, the diplomat said “it was too early to say what will happen in the course of negotiations.”
Iran’s atomic chief said on Monday the country could agree to dilute its most highly enriched uranium in exchange for all financial sanctions being lifted. Takht-Ravanchi used this example in the BBC interview to highlight Iran’s flexibility, though he pushed back on the idea that Tehran would fully give up its ability to enrich. The “issue of zero enrichment is not an issue anymore and as far as Iran is concerned, it is not on the table anymore,” he said.
The diplomat also pushed back on the idea of giving up Iran’s ballistic missile arsenal, which Israel seeks to include in any deal between the Washington and Tehran.
“When we were attacked by Israelis and Americans, our missiles came to our rescue so how can we accept depriving ourselves of our defensive capabilities?” Takht-Ravanchi said, referring to last year’s 12-day war with Israel, during which Iran launched hundreds of missiles at Israel, which killed nearly three dozen Israeli civilians and wounded thousands.
“We are hearing that they are interested in negotiations,” the senior diplomat said, though he lamented the mixed messages from the US, noting that what Trump says publicly is different from the messages Iran receives in private. “They have said it publicly; they have said it in private conversations through Oman that they are interested to have these matters resolved peacefully.”
Trump has repeatedly threated to use military force against Iran if the talks fail, and said Friday that regime change “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.”
“We are not hearing that in the private messages,” Takht-Ravanchi said, adding: “If we feel this is an existential threat, we will respond accordingly.”
“It is not wise to even think about such a very dangerous scenario because the whole region will be in a mess,” he added.
“We see an almost unanimous agreement in the region against war,” he continued. “We are hopeful we can do this through diplomacy, although we can’t be 100 percent sure.”
“We will do our best but the other side also has to prove that they are also sincere,” Takht-Ravanchi said.
A US delegation, including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, a source had told Reuters on Friday, with Omani representatives mediating the US-Iran contacts.
Iran, whose leaders are sworn to destroy Israel, denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, but has enriched uranium to levels that have no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.
The Islamic Republic has refused to expand the scope of the negotiations to include its ballistic missile program and support for regional proxy forces, which Israel is demanding be included in any deal.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, returning from a meeting with Trump at the White House, on Thursday said any agreement with Iran must cover “not only the nuclear issue, but also ballistic missiles and Iran’s regional proxies.”
The premier expressed “general skepticism about the possibility of reaching any agreement with Iran,” but said Trump believes the Iranians could be forced into “a good deal.”

India to Order 31 Additional Rafale M Jets on Top of Previously Contracted 26

India plans to increase orders for French Rafale fighter jets.
According to La Tribune, in addition to the 114 aircraft planned under the MRFA program, India intends to purchase 31 carrier-based fighters for deployment on its aircraft carriers.
If the contract is finalized, the total number of Rafale jets ordered by India will increase to 145.
For Dassault Aviation and India, this would represent a strategic milestone.
In addition to the 36 aircraft contracted by India’s Ministry of Defence in 2016, the country ordered 26 new Rafale M fighters for the Navy in 2025.
In September 2016, the governments of India and France signed an intergovernmental agreement for the supply of 36 multirole fighter jets.
The value of that contract amounted to €7.87 billion. Dassault Aviation has already completed delivery of the entire batch, enabling the Indian Air Force to form two full squadrons.
The procurement is primarily a political choice by New Delhi. France’s Dassault Aviation, together with India’s defense industry, is implementing a production localization program.
The key Indian partner is the private company Reliance Defence, which is part of the joint venture Dassault Reliance Aerospace Limited (DRAL). The production facilities are located in Nagpur.
At the initial stage, the Indian side will focus on manufacturing fuselages and airframe components.
France is also involving the state-owned corporation Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in maintenance operations and the future integration of Indian weapons systems.
In addition, France is granting India exclusive rights to manufacture certain components and precision-guided weapons.
In particular, Indian enterprises will begin producing modular AASM Hammer (Armement Air-Sol Modulaire) aerial bombs.
Previously, these munitions were manufactured exclusively by the French company Safran Electronics & Defense.

Industry and Investment Drive Bulgaria into the EU’s Top Economic Performers

Bulgaria’s economy continued to show steady momentum throughout 2025, placing the country among the fastest-growing economies in the European Union, according to data presented by the Ministry of Economy and Industry. Outgoing Deputy Prime Minister Atanas Zafirov said the current trajectory reflects Bulgaria’s alignment with the broader EU objective of strengthening competitiveness, as outlined in the Mario Draghi report on the future of the European economy.
Economic developments over the past year were driven primarily by industry, with notable progress in the expansion of industrial zones and increased production in the defense sector. These trends coincided with record growth on the capital market and improved financing conditions for companies. Zafirov emphasized that state involvement played a key role, particularly through targeted support for energy-intensive industries, small and medium-sized businesses, and innovation-focused sectors.
Stronger economic integration is also beginning to deliver tangible results. Steps toward eurozone membership have boosted investor confidence, while efforts to simplify administrative procedures and accelerate digitalization are gradually improving labor productivity. At the same time, Zafirov acknowledged that structural challenges remain, especially the persistent foreign trade deficit and the need to shift more decisively toward an export-led growth model.
The domestic picture is unfolding against a volatile international backdrop. Global markets remain sensitive to geopolitical developments, with oil prices rising in Asian trading amid uncertainty over US-Iran relations, pushing Brent crude to nearly $ 70 per barrel. Meanwhile, solid employment figures in the United States strengthened the dollar, contributing to a modest weakening of the euro to around $ 1.186 in early trading in Frankfurt. These external dynamics continue to influence energy prices and purchasing power and are among the key factors assessed in the Deputy Prime Minister’s broader review of Bulgaria’s financial stability.

Revenue from overnight stays in Bulgaria continued to rise at a solid pace at the end of 2025, with hotel income in December increasing by 12.5 percent on an annual basis, according to data from the National Statistical Institute. Total revenues reached 112.7 million leva (57.6 million euros), with Bulgarian guests accounting for 75.6 million leva (38.6 million euros), while foreign visitors generated 37.1 million leva (18.9 million euros).
For comparison, hotel revenues in December 2024 amounted to 100.2 million leva (51.2 million euros), which itself represented an 11.6 percent rise compared to December 2023. The trend of strong growth had already been visible at the start of last year, when revenues from overnight stays totaled 112.9 million leva (57.7 million euros), marking a year-on-year increase of 24 percent at the time.
Occupancy levels also improved in December 2025. The average bed occupancy rate stood at 25.4 percent, up by 1.1 percentage points compared to the same month a year earlier. The highest utilization was recorded in higher-category hotels, with 4- and 5-star establishments reaching 33.4 percent occupancy. Three-star hotels followed with 24.4 percent, while 1- and 2-star accommodations reported a more modest rate of 15.3 percent.
The number of overnight stays reflected this upward momentum as well. A total of 1,083,500 nights were spent in accommodation facilities during the month, an increase of 8.2 percent year-on-year. Bulgarian citizens accounted for 765,500 overnight stays, while foreign tourists registered 318,000, confirming steady demand from both domestic and international guests.

Drones Strike Port of Taman, Fuel Tank Catches Fire

Strike drones attacked the main oil and gas facility in the village of Volna, Krasnodar Krai.
The regional operational headquarters reported the attack and its aftermath.
According to official information, one of the petroleum product storage tanks caught fire. Russian sources claim the blaze was caused by falling debris.
However, downplaying the causes and consequences remains a standard propaganda tactic of the Russian authorities.
Veniamin Kondratyev, Krasnodar Krai Governor, noted that, in addition to the storage tanks, a warehouse and terminal facilities were also damaged.
However, the official did not provide further details about the extent of the destruction.
The settlement of Volna hosts one of the key logistical facilities of Russia’s fuel and energy complex on the Black Sea.
This refers to the terminal of the company Tamanneftegaz (part of the OTÉKO Group), which operates at the Port of Taman near Cape Zhelezny Rog.
The facility plays an important role in supporting Russian oil exports and in the logistics of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, given its proximity to the Crimean Bridge and the occupied peninsula.
According to available information, the terminal’s capacity reaches about 19.9 million tons of oil and petroleum products per year.
The facility’s tank farm for storing petroleum products and liquefied gas has a total capacity of over 1 million cubic meters.
It is worth noting that this is not the first attack on the oil and gas facility. In particular, on January 21, 2026, the Ukrainian Defense Forces struck oil infrastructure at the Russian Port of Taman in Krasnodar Krai.
At that time, four petroleum product storage tanks caught fire on the terminal’s premises.
In addition, the previous attack on the Port of Taman took place two months earlier – on the night of December 21–22, 2025, when drones also targeted the facility.

The Super Bowl is ended last week, but plans for the 2026 NFL season are already in place.
In the days leading up to the game on Feb. 8, the NFL announced that Paris, Melbourne and Rio de Janeiro will host regular-season games for the first time as part of a record nine overseas games next season — two more than in 2025.
"Over the last three or four years, as we've started to expand the number of games that we've had the opportunity to play outside the U.S., the last three years we've really zeroed in, and 2025 was the year we marked," said Peter O'Reilly, the NFL's executive vice president for international and league events.
The NFL International Series
The NFL's International Series began in its current form in 2007 with the first London game at Wembley Stadium. For the next five years, only one game per season was played in London, with many owners skeptical about sacrificing revenue from home games in a market dominated by the Premier League.
Now, nearly 20 years later, there is talk of the league extending the season to allow for even more overseas games.
"The possibility of an 18-game schedule requires more work — it requires alignment and negotiation with the players union — but that opportunity to bring more regular-season football, and in turn the opportunity to play beyond this current number of international games, is something that we're certainly considering," O'Reilly said.
Every one of the NFL's 32 teams has played a regular-season game outside the United States and is signed up to the league's Global Markets Program.
Launched in January 2022, the program awards clubs international marketing rights to help them build brand awareness and explore partnerships and commercial opportunities.
Teams with geographical, cultural or historical ties to a country are often granted rights in those territories. For instance, the Arizona Cardinals have rights in neighboring Mexico; the Miami Dolphins, supported by a large Hispanic and Latino community, have rights in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Spain; and the Pittsburgh Steelers, whose owners have ancestral ties to Ireland, were awarded rights there in 2023.
Ireland, the Steelers and the Rooney connection
The Rooney family, the Steelers' majority owners, trace their roots to Ireland, where their ancestors emigrated from in the 1840s before eventually settling in Pittsburgh. Art Rooney founded the team in 1933, and those ties have remained strong through charity, cultural connections and politics — including Art's son, Dan Rooney, serving as U.S. ambassador to Ireland in 2009.
"The Rooneys and the Pittsburgh Steelers are coming home, literally, and that's a lovely thing," said Patrick O'Donovan, Ireland's minister for culture, tourism and sport.
"One of the first things I did after becoming minister for cultural, communications and sport was to agree to the government's involvement with bringing the NFL to Dublin for the first time. So it's a collaboration between the NFL and the Pittsburgh Steelers, the Gaelic Athletic Association and the government of Ireland," he said.
The Irish government sees the country's connection to the Rooney family and the Steelers as an opportunity worth capitalizing on. As part of the agreement to host the game, officials committed 10 million euros ($11.9 million) in public funding — half as a license fee paid to the NFL and the other half for transportation, security and venue arrangements.
But according to Fáilte Ireland, the country's tourism development authority, the event generated an estimated 64 million euros in additional economic activity.
A major TV win
The Dublin game was also a major success for television viewership. It ranked as the second most-watched NFL Network international game on record, drawing 7.9 million viewers in the U.S. — a 68% increase from the 2024 international-game average.
"It's really less about the financials around the game itself. Obviously, these games are profitable, but we see them as a pebble drop — you drop a pebble, it ripples out well beyond the game itself," O'Reilly said.
As the NFL's international ambitions grow, so do those of other major sports leagues. The NBA has played multiple regular-season games outside the United States, and several competitive soccer matches were played outside their local markets in 2025. If financial returns remain strong, more are likely to follow.

MINSK, 15 February (BelTA) – A tactical exercise involving a unit of an air defense missile regiment took place in a military training area of the Air Force and Air Defense Command on 14 February, representatives of the Belarusian Defense Ministry told BelTA.
The unit marched to the designated area and practiced switching the vehicles from a travelling configuration to the combat configuration, changing positions, and accomplishing air defense engagement tasks.
The training exercise proceeded in conditions resembling an actual combat as much as possible: the unit had to deal with sabotage and reconnaissance forces and drones, get across a polluted sector of terrain along barely passable routes while dealing with electronic countermeasures all the time. Weather conditions that were not characteristic of the region represented an additional complication.
