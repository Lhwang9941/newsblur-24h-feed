Alton Towers U-turns on controversial rule change after major backlash
- Merlin Entertainments has cancelled a planned trial to change eligibility for its theme park disability access passes following public outrage.
- The trial would have excluded individuals with autism and ADHD from using the Ride Access Pass (RAP) by altering criteria related to 'difficulty with crowds' at it’s attactions including Alton Towers.
- This proposed change stemmed from an update by Nimbus Disability, which verifies additional needs, separating 'difficulty standing' from 'difficulty with crowds'.
- The decision to cancel came after extensive feedback from the public and a petition signed by over 25,000 people.
- Merlin's Chief Operating Officer apologised for the impact of the announcement, confirming that existing RAP criteria, including the Access Card 'crowd' symbol, will remain in use.

Greenlanders 'not happy' about US pressure, Greenland PM tells DW
A lot of Greenland residents are "scared" by the transatlantic crisis triggered by US President Donald Trump's ambition to annex the Danish territory, Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen told DW.
"There live people in Greenland, and they're, of course, not happy with the situation," he said.
Talking to DW chief political correspondent Nina Haase at the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Nielsen emphasized that the dispute "still affects the Greenlandic people a lot, going through all the feelings you can imagine — if the biggest power in the world is talking about annexation and acquiring your country."
The prime minister also said he was due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio during the security conference.
"We have said from the beginning, if you want to do more on defense, on surveillance, on anything, we can talk about it. We already have a defense agreement," Nielsen said. "But we are ready to talk about anything when it's in mutual respect and in respect for international law and integrity."

Ukraine peace talks move to Geneva next week — Kremlin
While Western and Ukrainian leaders are attending the Munich Security Conference, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced that talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the United States on ending the war in Ukraine will move to Geneva next week.
According to Russian news agencies, Peskov said that the talks would take place on Tuesday and Wednesday and that Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky would lead the Russian delegation.
The talks in Geneva will follow two rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi. During those negotiations, Russia's team was led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of its military intelligence.
Medinsky's return, after leading the Russian team at earlier talks in Turkey in 2022 and again last year, could signal Russia's expectation that the focus will shift from security issues to the broader points of disagreement between the warring sides.
Meanwhile, Rustem Umerov, the head of Kyiv's delegation, said Ukraine hopes for "serious and responsible" talks with Russia backed by the US in Geneva on February 17-18.
The Ukrainian team remains the same and was "formed taking into account the military, political, and security components of
the process", Umerov wrote on the Telegram app.
NATO chief Rutte lauds 'staggering change' in Europe's defense approach
European members of the NATO military alliance have undergone a profound "shift in mindset" on defense and military spending, the NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on Friday.
Rutte was speaking on the opening day of the Munich Security Conference, a day after he met with NATO defense ministers in Brussels.
"I felt a shift in mindset in the room," he said. "We had years, decades, of complaints by the US about the fact that in Europe we were not spending enough on defense. That has changed," the former Dutch prime minister said.
While calls for European NATO members to spend more have sharpened since Donald Trump returned to the White House, they have been a refrain of US administrations, both Republican and Democratic, for decades.
"Europe [is] taking more of a leadership role within NATO. Europe [is] also taking more care of its own defence. And this is really a staggering change," Rutte said.
He made the remarks during an appearance at the Transatlantic Forum, an event hosted by the conservative Christian Social Union, the Bavarian sister party of the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which is helmed by Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul — both members of the CDU — also attended the event.
Wadephul told the forum that NATO's European members have the chance to step up and fill the void being created by Washington's increasingly isolationist approach to foreign policy.
"Now is Europe's moment," Wadephul said.
"We will only be able to weather the profound global upheavals we face if we preserve our alliances, if we stand by what has always made us strong and capable of defending ourselves," the German foreign minister said.
Old world order is gone and US-Europe ties face 'defining moment,' Rubio says
Ties between the US and Europe are facing a "defining moment," US Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned.
Rubio is the most senior US representative attending the Munich Security Conference, which began Friday.
"I think it's at a defining moment ... the world is changing very fast right in front of us," Rubio said Thursday, before leaving for Munich.
"The Old World is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
New era driven by Trump's 'wrecking-ball politics'
Many in Europe have argued that the US under Donald Trump has been the main driver of that changing world order. The head of the MSC, Wolfgang Ischinger, described Trump's approach as "wrecking-ball politics" that prioritises "sweeping destruction — rather than careful reforms and policy corrections."
At the MSC last year, US Vice President JD Vance strongly condemned Washington's European allies, signalling a major shift in the transatlantic relationship that has underpinned global security since World War II.
As part of the Trump administration's "America First" agenda, over the past year, the US has:
- withdrawn from international treaties and climate commitments
- slashed its contributions to global aid programs
- used punitive tariffs to disrupt global trade
- cast doubt over its long-term commitment to supporting Ukraine in its defense against Russia
Trump has also been pressing for Greenland — a semiautonomous, resource-rich Arctic territory that is part of Denmark — to become part of the US.
While he has since softened his stance following a "framework" agreement between the US and NATO over Greenland, the issue created a serious rift with US allies in Europe.
Washington's approach to diplomacy has forced its traditional European allies to pursue new, more independent policies that are less reliant on the US and its unpredictable leadership.
While acknowledging these changes, Rubio tried to strike a warmer tone than Trump or Vance have. The US top diplomat said his country remains "deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be. So we've just got to talk about what that future looks like."
European leaders are set to meet with Rubio during the conference, which runs until Sunday. Rubio will address the summit on Saturday morning.
The prime minister of Denmark, Mette Frederiksen, said "several meetings with American politicians, including the secretary of state" will be held, with Greenland also set to be discussed.
At the start of the Munich conference on Friday, Frederiksen reiterated her warning to Denmark's European allies.
"The Americans have been very honest — from Trump's inauguration speech to a new security strategy and a new defence strategy, the threats against Greenland — everything points in one direction, namely that the US, unfortunately, is moving away" from Europe, she said.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is also set to have a private meeting with Rubio, where he's expected to sound out the secretary of state on what kind of policies Europe can expect from the United States.
German and Ukrainian foreign ministers open Ukraine House at MSC
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul and his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrij Sybiha, opened the Ukraine House at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday morning.
DW correspondent Michaela Kuefner reported ministers also held a bilateral meeting, adding that both countries have the joint challenge of keeping US President Donald Trump committed to NATO and convincing the US to bring Europe back into the Ukraine talks.
Wadephul said after the meeting that Ukraine is fighting for freedom in Europe and that Russian leader Vladimir Putin shows no willingness to end this war.
"We're working on a strong 20th sanctions package and will keep up the pressure on Russia. You can count on us," he wrote on X.
Meanwhile, Sybiha thanked Germany for its leadership in supporting Ukraine and strengthening the security of Europe.
"This year, German defense support for Ukraine is at record €11.5 billion ($13.6), while its winter energy assistance packages totalled €75 million," he wrote on X.
The Ukrainian minister also mentioned that he and his German counterpart discussed ways to advance Ukraine’s EU accession as part of security guarantees for Ukraine and Europe.
Later, Sybiha said that, after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, he had invited his Chinese counterpart to visit Ukraine and added that Beijing could help end the four-year war with Russia.
Europe is wide awake and evaluating its options
There is a sense of post-Greenland-shock at the Munich Security Conference.
Earlier comments and analyses about a "wake-up call" for Europe are no longer being used in the corridors. Europe is wide awake and clearly signaling that it is now looking in all directions — not just to the United States.
This is also expected to be a key theme of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's speech before he meets US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later today.
EU trade agreements with both the Mercosur group and India are living proof of Europe's newfound self-confidence. But the European security and strategic dependence on the US remains. And so does the commitment of US Congress, which has sent one of the largest delegations in history to the annual conference in Munich.
Germany's foreign minister admits NATO 'irritation' at Trump administration
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has said the Munich Security Conference (MSC), which officially opens on Friday afternoon, represents a chance to reset transatlantic ties.
Relations between the United States and its NATO allies have been strained since US President Donald Trump returned to the White House last year.
Trump's insistence that the US "has to have" Greenland, a semiautonomous territory that is part of Denmark and will acquire it "one way or the other," has caused a serious diplomatic rift between Washington and most of its allies in Europe. Denmark and the US are both members of the NATO military alliance.
Trump and some of the top members of his administration have also been heavily critical of NATO's European members for what Washington says is their failure to spend enough on defense and for their perceived overreliance on the US military.
At the MSC last year, Trump's vice president, JD Vance, alarmed many in Europe when he used his keynote speech to highlight attempts by some countries in Europe to limit the rise of right-wing and far-right populism as proof of the weak state of European democracies and free speech. Vance also warned of the perceived perils of mass migration.
Wadephul acknowledged those tensions in remarks to German public broadcaster ARD on Friday morning in Munich, saying the "alliance is also under pressure."
"There is alienation, there is irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to talk about this here together. We want to define our common denominators and the meaning of NATO," Wadephul said.
Germany's Merz to meet Marco Rubio on Friday
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz plans to meet one-on-one with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and California Governor Gavin Newsom on Friday, said DW Chief Political Editor Michaela Kuefner.
WATCH - MSC chairman on transatlantic relations: 'Trust has been damaged'
This year's Munich Security Conference will kick off on Friday, February 13. DW’s chief political correspondent Nina Haase spoke with Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the MSC, about the state of transatlantic relations, whether US Vice President JD Vance will attend after his widely debated speech last year, why politicians from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) were invited, and the latest developments surrounding the Epstein files.
Ischinger also discussed potential Russian links to the unfolding scandal, Germany’s role on NATO’s eastern flank, and why he still believes Europe can find its voice.
MSC braces for more of Trump's 'wrecking-ball politics'
The organizers of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) did not hesitate to name one world leader who they think is behind the current "period of wrecking-ball politics."
"The most powerful of those who take the axe to existing rules and institutions is US President Donald Trump," they wrote in the Munich Security Report 2026,which was released Monday.
The report came as organizers announced US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will lead "a sizable delegation" of officials to the MSC this weekend.
MSC Chairman Wolfgang Ischinger tells DW the 2026 Munich Security Conference comes when "obviously, trust has been damaged" by Trump. But he also says US calls for a more "self-reliant" Europe are fair and overdue.

Trump admits staffer blamed for racist Obama video hasn’t been fired or disciplined
Donald Trump has tried to distance himself further from the offensive clip posted on his Truth Social account
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The staffer blamed by Donald Trump for posting a racist video about former President Obama has not been disciplined or fired, the president has admitted.
Trump has repeatedly tried to downplay criticism of the video, which was uploaded to his Truth Social account last Thursday and depicted Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama as apes.
Amid widespread backlash, the president previously shifted the blame to an as-yet unnamed staffer.
“Have you fired or disciplined that staffer who posted the video from your account that included the Obamas?” a reporter asked the president at a White House event Thursday.
“No, I haven't,” Trump replied. “That was a video on, as you know, voter fraud and...fairly long video...and they had a little piece and had to do with The Lion King.”
Previously, Trump insisted he did not see the whole video before giving it to the people who run his Truth Social account. He also insisted the clip was already “all over the place.”
But, when asked whether he personally would condemn the racist clip, Trump was blunt: “Of course I do.”
At no point has he apologized for the video, although the White House has conceded that it was posted “erroneously.”
Trump’s remarks were in stark contrast to the stance held by the rest of his administration. His vice president JD Vance defended the clip as recently as Wednesday.
“It’s not a real controversy,” Vance told reporters, before boarding Air Force Two. “We have much, much more real problems to focus on.”
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also defended the clip in a fiery response.
“Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,” she told journalists.
The video depicted other prominent Democrats as animals, including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The clip was accompanied by the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight.
Even members of Trump’s own party have condemned the video, with many slamming the president for allowing the clip to be posted and for failing to apologize.
“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,” Republican Senator Tim Scott wrote on social media. “The President should remove it.”
Days later, Scott endorsed Republican Senator Susan Collins for reelection in Maine, despite Collins being one of Trump’s nemeses in Congress.
Like Scott, she has slammed Trump for allowing the video to be posted to his Truth Social account.
Nebraska Senator Pete Ricketts, Utah Senator John Curtis, Representative Mike Lawler and Nebraska Representative Don Bacon were also amongst those calling for Trump to say sorry.

Arctic Floating University plans measuring waves, currents in polar seas

ARKHANGELSK, February 13. /TASS/. The Arctic Floating University's expedition in 2026 will measure for the first time waves and currents in polar seas in high resolution, the expedition's leader Alexander Saburov told TASS. During the voyage, scientists and students will be working in 13 scientific areas.
"As for the ocean studies, we have planned something new for the Arctic Floating University: Yury Yurovsky of the Marine Hydrophysics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Sevastopol will conduct research in remote and contact methods in measuring waves and currents from aboard the vessel. This research is of great fundamental importance, because despite the successes achieved through satellite measurements in recent years, there have not been too many high-resolution measurements in the Arctic seas, especially given the sea ice proximity," he said.
This study will add to data on the specifics of waves in the polar seas in the presence of sea ice. Over recent decades, scientists have made significant progress in measuring parameters of waves and currents thanks to satellite sensors. However, measurements with high spatial resolution are still a complicated or unsolved task. Specialists will measure waves using buoys; they will film them off UAVs, and will make stereo captures.
The Arctic Floating University expedition's participants will work in 13 scientific areas. "We are happy to work with Denis Zakharov, a specialist new to the Arctic Floating University, working at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, who is an expert in bottom communities of the Arctic seas," the expedition leader added.
The main objective of all the research is to study conditions of coastal ecosystems of the Barents and the Kara Seas in the climate change in the Arctic and in the increasing anthropogenic pressure. A big block of work will be devoted to distribution of warm Atlantic waters in the northeastern part of the Barents Sea, where scientists will collect data on specifics of the Atlantic water masses coming into the Arctic. The expeditions have been monitoring these waters at sections between Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land. "We hope to be able to repeat fully the amount of work we have been doing over recent three years," he continued. "It is most important that from year to year the expedition timing remains about the same - from late June to early August, which, of course, allows us to track better the natural systems' development dynamics."
Ground-based research
Missions ashore are planned on the Novaya Zemlya archipelago's north and on the Franz Josef Land archipelago. There, the expedition will study contamination with heavy metals, organic pollutants and radionuclides. The coast will be examined for the presence of marine debris, especially plastics. Microbiologists, ornithologists, and insect specialists will work on the islands.
"As for relatively new directions, we can single out the reiterated topic of studying biodiversity of diptera insects (commonly known as flies). Andrey Przyboro, a specialist at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, will take part in the voyage for the first time since 2018 to obtain new data on this topic. The team will collect insects in the field, and grow imago (adults) from collected larvae and pupae. Scientists will update data on diptera, obtained almost 10 years ago," the expedition's leader said.
The first departure from Murmansk
The expedition is scheduled for July 1st to 22nd in the Barents and the Kara Seas onboard the Professor Molchanov scientific research vessel. This year, the expedition for the first time will depart from Murmansk, not from Arkhangelsk, and then will return also to Murmansk.
"For us, this is a new departure and arrival location. The plan is the Professor Molchanov will depart from Murmansk. For the organizers, despite necessary planning of new logistics routes, there are certain advantages from this change. First of all, because the distance from the port of Murmansk is closer to the work area," he explained.
About the Arctic Floating University
The Arctic Floating University is a joint project of the Northern Arctic Federal University (NARFU) and the Northern Directorate for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring. The project's expeditions continue since 2012.

PARIS, February 13. /TASS/. European countries should be present at the negotiating table on the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict as they want to have a say in ensuring its post-conflict security, French Minister of the Armed Forces Catherine Vautrin said.
"It is important for European countries to be involved because with the Coalition of the Willing we will be there to ensure that once hostilities cease, a ceasefire is declared, or better still, a peace agreement is reached, we will be there to guarantee conditions of security," she told the Euronews television channel.
At the same time, she lauded the United States’ efforts toward continuing dialogue with Russia and Ukraine on a potential settlement of the conflict.
Earlier, Fyodor Lukyanov, presidium chairman of the Russian Foreign and Defense Policy Council and director for research of the Valdai International discussion club, said in an interview with the French newspaper La Tribune Dimanche that neither of the parties to the talks on Ukraine see any reason for involving Europe in the settlement efforts.
Russia vehemently objects to any NATO presence in Ukraine. Russian presidential press secretary told a briefing on December 17, 2025 that Moscow’s stance against deploying Western contingents to Ukraine is unshakable and well-known. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on August 21, 2025 that "foreign military intervention in any part of Ukrainian territory" as part of security guarantees to that country would be unacceptably for Russia.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The number of foreign tourists visiting the Arctic and the Russian North grew by 23.3% in 2025, the Center for Strategic Research reported referring to the national statistics agency, Rosstat.
"The Arctic and the Russian North are becoming more and more attractive for foreign travelers. Their number grew by 23.3% last year, outpacing the national average (+14.9%). Every 50th foreign tourist visiting Russia travels to the Arctic and the Russian North. A record increase in the interest of foreigners was recorded in the Chukotka Autonomous Region - plus 134% year-on-year. The Murmansk Region welcomed 54.5% more foreign visitors, and the Arkhangelsk Region - 44.6% more year-on-year," the report reads.
Last year, the number of tourists visiting Chukotka grew by 59.7%, as well as the Nenets Autonomous Region and the Murmansk Region. A decrease in the number of tourists was recorded in 2025 in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region - minus 28%, and in the Arkhangelsk region - minus 8.5%. The average duration of trips to the Arctic in 2025 made 2.9 nights. In Komi, tourists stayed the longest, average 3.6 nights.
In 2025, 2.7 million trips were made to the Arctic zone and the Russian North - 3% of all tourist trips in Russia. According to the Center for Strategic Research, expert estimates, based on preliminary data from Rosstat, say the number of tourists decreased slightly in 2025, but they expect that by April, after final data are summarized, the number will be reported as similar or even higher year-on-year.
Earlier, press service of the Ministry for Development of the Far East and Arctic forecasted the number of visitors to the Russian Federation's Arctic Zone in 2025 would make about 1.5 million people.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. A Russia-US working group is considering prospects for trade and economic cooperation, and the Kremlin hopes these discussions will continue, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at a briefing.
"A group on economic issues is working. On our side, it is headed by my colleague [RDIF head Kirill] Dmitriev. Indeed, issues of trade and economic cooperation - both potential and proposed - are on the agenda, and they are being discussed," he said answering a question about whether the US had responded to the proposal to expand economic cooperation.
"We hope these discussions will continue. At the moment, the de facto situation is such that, in practice, until, let's say, a Ukrainian settlement is reached, it is hardly possible to talk about anything concrete, and for now this is limited to discussions," he said.
"But as we move forward, and if we do make progress toward a peaceful settlement, then this could move into practical applications," Peskov concluded.
At the end of December last year, it was announced that work on a settlement around Ukraine would continue within the framework of two specially created groups: one on security and one on economic issues. In January, Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov announced that the bilateral Russian-American working group on economic issues would be headed by Russian Presidential Special Representative Kirill Dmitriev and US Presidential Special Envoy Steven Witkoff.

PARIS, February 13. /TASS/. Europe needs to prepare for a "high-intensity conflict," French Minister of the Armed Forces Catherine Vautrin said.
"From the moment a conflict broke out on the European continent, it became necessary for us to prepare for a high-intensity conflict," she told Euronews.
Vautrin believes that preparing for such a conflict "is the best way to avoid it." "This is what we are doing," the defense chief noted.
The minister emphasized that France "maintains its whole army in a state of full combat readiness." "Commanding respect requires inspiring fear," Vautrin added.
In November 2025, France's Chief of the Defense Staff General Fabien Mandon called on the country’s people to be prepared "to lose their children" in order to deter Russia. He claimed that Paris "has all the knowledge, economic and demographic power" to confront Moscow. Earlier, Mandon warned that the French army must be prepared to enter into a conflict with Russia in three to four years.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed European politicians’ "mantra" about a potential war with Russia as nonsense.
