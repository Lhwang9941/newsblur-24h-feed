Pentagon ‘close to cutting ties’ with AI firm Anthropic amid frustration over restrictions
Anthropic wants to safeguard its Claude AI tool from being used for mass surveillance or advanced weapons development, Axios news reported
The Pentagon is close to cutting ties with Anthropic and may label the artificial intelligence company a supply chain risk after becoming frustrated with restrictions on how it can use the technology, Axios news website reported.
Anthropic’s talks about extending a contract with the Pentagon are being held up over additional protections the artificial intelligence company wants to put on its Claude tool, a person familiar with the matter said.
Anthropic wants to put safeguards in place to stop Claude from being used for mass surveillance of Americans or to develop weapons that can be deployed without a human involved, the person said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are private.
The Pentagon wants to be able to use Claude as long as its deployment does not break the law. Axios reported on the disagreement earlier.
AI’s use cases for developing weapons and gathering personal data are a burgeoning risk for powerful models. Anthropic, which positions itself as a more responsible AI company that aims to avoid catastrophic harms from the technology, built Claude Gov specifically for the US national security apparatus and aims to serve government customers within its own ethical bounds.
Claude Gov has enhanced capabilities for handling and interpreting classified materials and intelligence and for understanding cybersecurity data.

'If this isn’t a massacre, what is?': Ex-hostage decries removal of 'massacre' from Oct. 7 bill

Former Gaza hostage Or Levy spoke out against an Israeli government decision to remove the term “massacre” from official legislation regarding Hamas’s October 7 terror acts during an interview with KAN Reshet Bet on Monday.
Levy was held in captivity by terrorists in Gaza for nearly 500 days before his release in February 2025, and his wife, Einav, was murdered by Hamas during the massacre.
He stated that when he saw headlines about the government's push to remove the word from a bill establishing a national day of commemoration for the attack, he thought it was a mistake.
“I heard ministers talking about how we shouldn’t portray ourselves as victims and that we weren’t massacred, so it’s important for me to say, I was there. They massacred me and my wife,” Levy stated.
“There is no other way to describe it. If this isn’t called a massacre, then what is? Soon they’ll say the Holocaust didn’t happen.”
Levy 'enraged' at government 'trying to change history'
Levy additionally commented on government attempts to block the establishment of a state commission of inquiry into the October 7 massacre and related national security failures.
He recounted visiting the bomb shelter from which he was kidnapped on October 7 with IDF investigators. “I sat with two incredible investigators, but they told me, ‘We don’t know,’ ‘There’s no information,’ ‘We assume.’ It’s the year 2026. We’re supposed to know everything, apparently, they don’t want to.”
The words of the investigators and the government's reluctance to greenlight a probe did not make Levy feel reassured that such an attack wouldn’t happen again, he said, adding, “feeling that they are disgracing my wife’s memory enrages me. Feeling that they are trying to change history enrages me.”

The IDF thwarted an attempt to smuggle hundreds of kilograms of tobacco disguised as canned food products into the Gaza Strip, the military confirmed on Monday.
The tobacco was concealed inside dozens of cans labelled as containing grape leaves, which smugglers attempted to transfer via the Kerem Shalom Border Crossing.
All of the truck's contents were seized and transferred for further handling by customs and other authorities.
In response to the incident, the newly promoted Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT), Chief Maj.-Gen. Yoram Halevi ordered the immediate suspension of the company's permit to bring aid into the Gaza Strip until further notice, the IDF confirmed.
Halevi's decision was made in light of "the severity of the case and in order to preserve the integrity of the aid entry mechanism, while preventing its exploitation for prohibited purposes," the military stated.
Shin Bet chief's brother indicted for aiding Hamas during wartime in Gaza smuggling case
Bezalel Zini, the brother of Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) David Zini, was indicted on February 5 along with two other men in a wide-ranging wartime security case in which prosecutors allege that a network of Israeli reservists and civilians smuggled prohibited goods - primarily cigarettes and tobacco - into the Gaza Strip during Israel’s war with Hamas.
According to an indictment filed at the Beersheba District Court, Zini was charged with aiding the enemy during wartime, prohibited dealings in property for terror purposes under the Counter-Terrorism Law, aggravated fraud, and accepting bribes while serving as a public official.
Prosecutors allege that the operation generated millions of shekels in revenue and materially benefited Hamas by strengthening its economic control inside the enclave.

President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced sanctions on ten Russian athletes whom Kyiv says have actively supported Russia’s aggression in Ukraine.
According to the President’s Office, the measures will apply to sports figures who visited occupied Ukrainian territories, publicly defended Russia’s invasion and occupation, raised funds for Russian forces, or organized events for Ukrainian children forcibly abducted by Russia.

“This Ukrainian sanctions package should be a signal to others around the world – a signal that one cannot simply turn a blind eye to support for aggression,” Zelensky said.
“When Ukrainians at the Olympics are forbidden to even mention the victims of Russian aggression, that is clearly a global rollback of justice. We will restore justice,” he added.
The sanctions list was created following a petition from Ukrainian skeleton racer and National Olympic Team member Vladyslav Heraskevych.
Ukrainian media reports identified the ten figures as: Arkady Dvorkovich, president of the International Chess Federation (FIDE); wrestler Yevgeny Baydusov; Wrestler Imam Ganishov; Taekwondo athlete Vladislav Larin; Taekwondo athlete Maksim Khramtsov; archer Svetlana Dashanimaeva; sabre fencer Yana Egoryan; Gymnast Angelina Melnikova; judoka Madina Taymazova; and boxer Fedor Chudinov.
The President’s Office did not detail the exact sanctions, though Ukrainian outlets suggest they may include asset freezes.

Praising the sanctions on X, Heraskevych said: “A very important step to significantly reduce the spread of Russian propaganda in international sports. Reducing the spread of Russian narratives = saving lives.”
Last week, Heraskevych was barred from competing in the Winter Olympics after refusing to remove a helmet honoring 24 Ukrainian athletes and children killed by Russia. He called the IOC ruling “purely discriminatory.”
Zelensky at the time also condemned the decision, saying: “Sport shouldn’t mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors.”
He also hit out at the inclusion of 19 Russian athletes in the games under a “neutral” banner.
“They compete under ‘neutral’ flags at the Games, while in real life publicly supporting Russian aggression against Ukraine and the occupation of our territories. And they are the ones who deserve disqualification,” he said.
Following the Olympic controversy, Heraskevych launched a fundraising initiative for families of Ukrainian athletes killed by Russia and submitted a petition urging the government to sanction Russian sports figures who support the invasion.
“The introduction of sanctions by Ukraine against Russian athletes will be the first step toward the introduction of sanctions against them by Ukraine’s partner countries,” he said at the time.
“This will make their performances on the international stage impossible, which they use to support the war against Ukraine.”
According to Andriy Sybiha, the foreign minister, over 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed and more than 800 sports facilities have been destroyed over the course of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

SpaceX, xAI compete for Pentagon contract to develop autonomous drone swarms — Bloomberg

NEW YORK, February 16. /TASS/. Elon Musk’s companies, SpaceX and xAI, have entered a closed Pentagon technology competition to develop a technology for controlling drone swarms using voice commands, Bloomberg reported citing sources.
The participation of two of Musk's companies in the development of AI-supported weapons marks a new and potentially controversial stage for the businessman, the agency writes. Musk’s companies are among a select few participants in the competition launched in January with a $100 million fund. The initiative aims to create a technology capable of translating voice commands into digital instructions for simultaneously controlling multiple drones in the air and at sea.
The development under this defense initiative will proceed in five phases ranging from software creation to field testing. The organizers are the Defense Innovation Unit and the Autonomous Battle Group, established under the second administration of Donald Trump.
Musk has previously advocated for a ban on the use of offensive autonomous weapons capable of independently selecting and engaging targets.

Cuba’s Havana piles with rubbish as US chokehold halts garbage trucks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
HAVANA - Garbage has begun to pile up on street corners in the Cuban capital of Havana, attracting hordes of flies and reeking of rotten food, in one of the most visible impacts of the US bid to prevent oil from reaching the Caribbean’s largest island
State-run news outlet Cubadebate reported in February that Havana only 44 of 106 of its rubbish trucks were able to keep operating due to fuel shortages, slowing garbage collection.
Cardboard boxes, used bags, plastic bottles and rags piled up on street corners across the seafront capital, as some residents sorted through the waste looking for scraps they could re-use, while motorists, pedestrians and bikers are forced to circumvent the imposing heaps.
“It’s all over the city,” said local resident Jose Ramon Cruz. “It’s been more than 10 days since a garbage truck came.”
In other towns on the island - home to around 11 million people - residents took to social media to warn of the risks to public health.
Cuba’s government has implemented rationing measures to protect essential services in the country that was already suffering from severe shortages of food, fuel and medicine.
The country’s oil supply has fallen off dramatically in two months.
Venezuela - once Cuba’s top supplier - effectively stopped sending shipments in mid-December. Mexico’s government also said it was halting shipments after Washington threatened tariffs against countries that send supplies to Cuba.
A Russian newspaper last week reported that Moscow was preparing to send crude and fuel cargoes to the Communist-run island in the near future, without giving a specific date.
The United States has maintained an embargo on Cuba since the 1960s, but in recent months the administration of President Donald Trump has hardened its stance, sanctioning vessels shipping oil to Cuba and threatening tariffs on suppliers.
It argues the measures will pressure a political change in Cuba. The United Nations has long voted for the US to end its embargo, and leaders from Mexico and Venezuela said blocking fuel could have serious humanitarian impacts. REUTERS

FBI refuses to share evidence about Alex Pretti’s killing at hands of fed agents with Minnesota investigators

FBI refuses to share evidence about Alex Pretti’s killing at hands of fed agents with Minnesota investigators
Officials warn against Justice Department’s ‘concerning and unprecedented’ refusal to support local authorities
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The FBI will not share information with Minnesota authorities investigating the killing of Alex Pretti, who was fatally shot by federal officers during Trump administration’s surge into Minneapolis last month.
The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Monday it formally received noticed notice from the bureau that it will not provide the state agency with “access to any information or evidence that it has collected” in connection with Pretti’s death.
“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,” Superintendent Drew Evans said in a statement.
“Our agency has committed to the FBI and Department of Justice that should its stance change we remain willing to share information that we have obtained with that agency and would welcome a joint investigation,” he added. “We will continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence.”
The FBI’s decision to withhold evidence from Minnesota authorities follows a similar decision in the case of Renee Good, another Minnesota resident who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer last month.
The Independent has requested comment from the FBI.
Hours after the Pretti’s killing, Minnesota law enforcement agencies sued to block Homeland Security officials from destroying or altering any evidence from the scene, and a federal judge appointed by Donald Trump granted the order later that night.
But earlier this month, the judge said inflammatory statements by top administration officials and a potentially compromised crime scene were not enough to block federal law enforcement agencies from handling evidence, for now.
Though the administration has repeatedly rebuffed attempts for local authorities to investigate the killings, the Justice Department has opened a civil rights investigation into Pretti’s death, and Homeland Security is separately reviewing the case.
Administration officials “decided the day Mr. Pretti was killed that the federal officers who shot him did nothing wrong,” District Judge Eric C. Tostrud, a Trump-appointee, wrote this month.
On X, White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller baselessly labeled Pretti a “domestic terrorist” who “tried to assassinate federal law enforcement.” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti “committed an act of domestic terrorism” and intended to “inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”
“These statements are troubling,” Tostrud wrote. “They reflect, not a genuine interest in learning the truth, but snap judgments informed by speculation and motivated by political partisanship.”
Miller later claimed that the statements were based on reports from Customs and Border Protection personnel “on the ground.”
Last week, Trump administration’s top immigration enforcement officials testified that such characterizations did not come from them or anyone who reports to them.
Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty has also demanded evidence in the killings of Pretti and Good from Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, and the state has launched a website to collect evidence from the public.
Pretti’s family, meanwhile, has urged the FBI and Minnesota authorities to jointly investigate the death of the 37-year-old intensive care unit nurse.
“Justice and accountability requires a thorough and impartial investigation to establish the facts,” the family said in a statement. “A truly joint state and federal investigation would be a welcome development.”
An initial investigation into Pretti’s killing was led by Homeland Security Investigations, the agency’s investigative arm, which is required to “preserve all evidence collected, including physical evidence collected by other federal entities, which are then properly transferred” to homeland custody, according to a sworn declaration in court documents from Mark Zito, the agency’s Special Agent in Charge for the St. Paul office.
All evidence was “collected and transported back to the FBI Minneapolis Field Office,” according to a sworn statement from an FBI official whose name is redacted in court filings.
That evidence includes body-worn camera footage, which has been “preserved,” according to Jeffrey Egerton, the executive director for the Investigative Operations Directorate within Customs and Border Protection’s Office of Professional Responsibility.
“There’s a lot of other video, there’s body-cam video that’s all being looked at, and until all that evidence is evaluated, I can’t jump to a conclusion” about the case, Customs and Border Protection commissioner Rodney Scott testified to the Senate Homeland Security committee last week.
“I would ask America to do the same thing, but I am committed to transparency, to making sure all the information we have is made public when it’s appropriate,” he said.
Border Patrol agents were filmed shooting 10 rounds at Pretti after tackling him to the ground January 24, two weeks after an ICE officer fatally shot Good.
Their deaths have fueled outrage against the Trump administration’s weeks-long surge of immigration officers into Minnesota, where agents have been accused of brutally targeting immigrants and citizens alike during protests and violent arrests.
White House border czar Tom Homan, who was deployed to the state in the wake of Pretti’s killing and the apparent removal of Border Patrol “commander-at-large” Greg Bovino, announced last week that “a small footprint of personnel” will remain in the state to supervise the transfer of “full command and control” of immigration enforcement back to the ICE field office in Minneapolis.

Wes Moore won’t call Trump racist over Obama apes post but doesn’t say he’s not: ‘I know his actions hit Black folks’

Wes Moore won’t call Trump racist over Obama apes post but doesn’t say he’s not: ‘I know his actions hit Black folks’
Democratic Maryland governor says president’s ‘actions’ speak for themselves, even amid Trump’s denials of racist intentions
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, the nation’s only current Black governor, addressed the now-deleted post from Donald Trump’s account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes at a town hall that aired Sunday.
Moore sat down with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell and declined to say directly whether he thought the president was a racist, calling it a question for Trump himself. But the governor did smile quickly, almost to himself, as O’Donnell described how Trump claimed he was the “least racist” president in history after an uproar over the post began.
“I think that’s a question for President Trump,” Moore said. “I can tell you I know how his actions hit Black folks, and how they hit people of color.”
He added: “I think his actions probably give the answer before he even has a chance to answer it himself."
Moore pointed to the video as well as the policy priorities of the Trump administration as evidence that the president may hold animus towards Black Americans.
Maryland is home to tens of thousands of federal workers, and was hit particularly hard by the White House’s wild cost-cutting spree led by Elon Musk’s DOGE initiative. Moore’s office claims that an estimated 24,900 Marylanders lost federal employment during the first year of Trump’s presidency, something the governor’s office has noted hit Black communities and women particularly hard.
During the CBS town hall, he referred to it as the “greatest assault on Black female employment that we’ve seen in our nation’s history”.
The video was posted from Trump’s Truth Social account and appeared to have been created originally by another user. It was deleted from Trump’s personal account hours later.
The video depicted the former president and his wife as apes in the jungle, imagery that aligned with historical racist depictions of Black people. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt initially defended the video and denied those connotations, but later the White House declared that it had been posted by a staffer by “mistake”.
Trump himself has refused to apologize directly for the video post being spread by his acount.
The president’s critics haven’t bought that explanation. Republican Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black senator in the GOP, called it the “most racist thing” he’d seen emerge from the second Trump administration, and the video was roundly condemned by lawmakers on both sides in Capitol Hill. Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, echoed the statement calling it a “mistake” and claimed that Trump himself had never seen it.
Obama responded to the video on a podcast with Brian Tyler Cohen that aired Sunday. The former president said that a majority of Americans find the White House’s conduct “troubling”, and added: “[T]here’s this sort of clown show happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost.”
“But the reason I point out that I don't think the majority of the American people approve of this is because, ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people,” he continued.
Fallout from the video comes at a time when the White House cannot afford to lose further political capital on the Hill. The Republican House caucus is facing its thinnest majority yet as it hurtles towards the 2026 midterm elections, while Trump also continues to face defections in the Senate from moderate GOP senators.
The Maryland governor has repeatedly expressed his disinterest in running for president and did so again in his town hall with CBS, telling O’Donnell: “I’m not running for president...I don’t see a reason. I love my job. I love what I’m doing.”
But his prominence within the Democratic Party and the fact that Moore, if re-elected this November in a race he is widely expected to win, would be halfway through his second and final term as governor in 2028 has continued to stoke speculation about his potential future in national politics.
Moore is heavily favored to win re-election in deep-blue Maryland, and in recent days former Gov. Larry Hogan announced that he would not challenge him for the seat. Hogan is seen as one of the few Republicans in Maryland with statewide appeal, partly due to his anti-Trump stance.

In Munich, Ukraine and Europe face collapse of post-Cold War order

The U.S.-Europe dynamic was more cordial at the Feb. 13-15 Munich Security Conference than last year, with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivering a conciliatory speech.
But the substance of the relationship remained unchanged, despite the softer rhetoric.
U.S. President Donald Trump's foreign policy upheavals, from Ukraine to Greenland, were fresh on everyone's mind – as well as the confrontational address by U.S. Vice President JD Vance during last year's conference.
European leaders made it clear: the post–Cold War global order is ending — or at least undergoing profound change — and Europe can no longer afford to remain in Washington’s shadow.
"If there had been a unipolar moment after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a unipolar moment in history, it has long passed," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in his speech, heralding the return of "power politics" and warning that the U.S. cannot "go it alone."
French President Emmanuel Macron, in turn, urged Europe to become a “geopolitical power,” while hinting at reforms to France’s nuclear doctrine as Paris weighs extending its nuclear umbrella over the continent.
With Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in attendance, Russia’s invasion was still on the agenda, though partly overshadowed by broader global turbulence and a transatlantic rupture.
The Munich Security Conference also painted a bleak picture of peace prospects for Ukraine, contradicting the recent optimism from U.S. officials. Furthermore, some officials and analysts cast doubt on whether the U.S. and Europe could provide Kyiv with NATO-style security guarantees.

The transatlantic wake-up call
Despite the bold calls for European autonomy, there was clear relief when Rubio, the most senior U.S. official present, delivered a speech markedly different in tone from Vance's.
"So in a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish – because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe," the U.S. diplomat said in a speech met with a standing ovation.
Nevertheless, some noted that Rubio was delivering a familiar Trumpian message, simply packaged in more diplomatic language.
"Secretary Rubio said exactly the same things (as Vance), just in a more polite way," Estonia's Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the Kyiv Independent on the sidelines of the event, referring to the American's calls for a stronger Europe.
The Estonian official acknowledged that some U.S. criticism is warranted — and even useful — and described Europe as a former athlete “getting fat” from inactivity.
"We just need to start training… We have more strength to act on defense, but also on an economic level," Tsahkna said. "And also Ukraine is part of our future — a huge opportunity."
In fact, few European officials have challenged Washington’s call for Europe to rearm, as reflected in last year’s pledge by NATO members to raise defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product (GDP).
But the U.S. message has been muddled by a simultaneous push for a weaker EU, Washington's support for far-right and populist parties, and a brief threat to impose U.S. tariffs on countries that opposed Trump's bid to annex Greenland.
Notably, after his appearance in Munich, Rubio traveled to Slovakia and Hungary — arguably the two most Kremlin-friendly EU member states, both heavily reliant on Russian energy.

No high hopes for Ukraine talks
Despite recent optimism from U.S. envoys, the Munich Security Conference cast a gloomy picture regarding progress toward peace in Ukraine.
As the conference took off, Trump called on Zelensky to "get moving" with peace talks ahead of trilateral negotiations in Geneva on Feb. 17-18, claiming that "Russia wants to make a deal."
But Moscow has dismissed key elements of a peace framework drafted by Ukrainian and Western officials, refusing to compromise on its territorial and political demands.
In Munich, Rubio's message was out of step with his boss's.
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war," the U.S. diplomat said, while Zelensky asked the attendees: "Can you imagine (Russian President Vladimir) Putin without war?"
"No one in Ukraine believes he will ever let our people go. But he will not let other European nations go either – because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," the Ukrainian leader said, warning that carving up Ukraine through territorial concessions would not bring a lasting peace.
In contrast with his scathing remarks about Europe in Davos, Zelensky thanked European allies for stepping up military support as the U.S. withdrew. He also said that it is a "big mistake" that Europe is absent from the negotiating table.
Many echoed this message. In an interview with Bloomberg in Munich, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski complained that Europe is being sidelined from negotiations even though it – not the U.S. – foots the bill for Ukraine's defense.
Last year, the U.S. halted nearly all new aid allocations, while European military support surged by 67%, including through purchases of American hardware for Ukraine. The Munich conference also followed U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey's announcement of $35 billion in fresh allied assistance this year.

Missing answers
Zelensky and Rubio met on the sidelines of the event to discuss air defenses, Russia's escalating attacks on Ukraine's energy grid, and the upcoming round of peace negotiations.
"We also touched on the sequence of steps. It's important to make progress on issues of security guarantees and economic recovery," Zelensky said after the meeting.
At the conference, the Ukrainian leader called for 20-year security guarantees to be signed before a potential peace agreement, a sequence that clashes with Washington's push for the fastest possible end to hostilities.
Although the West has previously signaled readiness to provide Ukraine with “Article 5-like” security guarantees, backed by a post-war European-led multinational force, officials who spoke with the Kyiv Independent were cautious.
"The primary security guarantee is strong Ukrainian armed forces," Latvian Defense Minister Andris Spruds told the Kyiv Independent in an interview.
The deployment of forces led by the Coalition of the Willing would additionally demonstrate Europe's engagement, the Latvian defense chief said. He declined to speculate on what would happen if a Russian missile struck the said troops.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys warned against offering "hollow" promises and "fake guarantees" to Kyiv. In an interview with the Kyiv Independent, he dismissed the concept of Article 5-like guarantees, calling them mere "rhetorical expressions."
"There can be nothing similar to Article 5… Because Article 5 means that if you are in trouble, I promise you that I will come and if it is needed, I will die for you," he added.
Instead, he underscored financial support for Ukraine's Armed Forces or Ukraine's future EU membership as more realistic guarantees.
The question remains: what security guarantees — short of direct Western military involvement — would deter Russia, given that extensive security aid and sanctions have failed to end the war?
U.S. political scientist Ian Bremmer said he does not consider the proposed security guarantees credible.
"Trump has shown that he is willing to throw Ukrainians under the bus, repeatedly," Bremmer told the Kyiv Independent.
He added that the U.S. president appears determined to end the war and claim political credit — without putting American lives at risk.
But even if Europe — backed by Washington — were to formally commit to military intervention, the expert said he "can't see the Russians accepting that today."
Bill Browder, an American-born British financier and sanctions advocate, expressed skepticism that Moscow would relent in 2026, despite mounting economic woes.
"I think if we just were to watch the pressure that they're under right now, going into 2026, I don't think that's enough to stop them in the war in Ukraine," he told the Kyiv Independent.
Comparing Putin to North Korea, Browder said: "He will always have enough money for his war, even if he has to starve his population. So, you need to make sure that he just doesn't have enough money for anything."

Zelensky on Russia's preparation for massive strike: Enemy attacks 'evolve'
In his traditional nightly video address, he emphasized that the Russians understand exactly what they are trying to destroy when they hit Ukraine, Ukrinform reports.
"Air defense must be configured properly. Russian attacks constantly – if you can put it that way – 'evolve.' Evil also develops. Unfortunately. These are combined strikes that require special protection and corresponding support from partners," Zelensky said.
He expressed confidence that any delay in missile response for air defense or any untimely supply "works for scaling up the damage from the strikes."
"Everything we discussed in Munich with our partners must be implemented fast. It is important that partners do not remain silent," he said.
Zelensky stressed that peace will be the reward for those who know how to wield strength.
"No one should have any illusions: if Russia is not held accountable for this aggression, it will not live in peace with you – with anyone in the world who expects cooperation with it. Russia must be held accountable for everything. Justice must prevail," he said.
Zelensky said that right now everyone was awaiting the continuation of trilateral meetings. "Our delegation is already in Geneva and preparing for the negotiations. Russia cannot resist the temptation of the last days of winter cold and wants to inflict painful blows on Ukrainians. The more of this evil comes from Russia, the harder it will be for everyone to reach any agreements with them. Partners must understand this. First and foremost, this concerns the United States," he said.
"Ukraine can become a truly important element of European and Euro-Atlantic security. It is important that our state's partners understand Ukraine's capabilities just as our common enemy does," Zelensky said.

Zelenskiy warns of new Russian strikes ahead of Geneva peace talks

Feb 16 - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that Ukrainian intelligence showed more Russian attacks on energy targets lay ahead and that such strikes made it more difficult to reach an agreement on ending the nearly four-year war.
"Intelligence reports show that Russia is preparing further massive strikes against energy infrastructure so it is necessary to ensure that all air defence systems are properly configured," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.
Ukrainian, Russian and American delegations are gathering in the Swiss city of Geneva for a third round of U.S.-brokered talks on Tuesday focused for the first time on the thorniest question of the war — the fate of Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia.
Zelenskiy said Russian attacks were "constantly evolving" and resorting to a combination of weapons, including drones and missiles, requiring "special defence and support from our partners".
"Russia cannot resist the temptation of the final days of winter cold and wants to strike Ukrainians painfully," he said. "Partners must understand this. First and foremost, this concerns the United States."
Reuters was not able to immediately reach Russian officials for comment.
The head of Ukraine's delegation, Rustem Umerov, said on Telegram that his team was already in Geneva looking forward "to constructive work and substantive meetings on security and humanitarian issues".
Moscow wants Ukraine to cede the entirety of the Donbas area. The Kremlin confirmed that Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to President Vladimir Putin, would lead the Russian delegation.
"This time, the idea is to discuss a broader range of issues, including, in fact, the main ones. The main issues concern both the territories and everything else related to the demands we have put forward," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Two earlier rounds of U.S.-backed talks in the United Arab Emirates led to a prisoner swap but no breakthrough toward a settlement. REUTERS

FBI won’t share Alex Pretti shooting evidence, Minnesota authorities say

Minnesota law enforcement authorities have said the FBI is refusing to share any evidence on its investigation into the death of Alex Pretti, the man killed by federal immigration authorities in late January.
Pretti was shot on 24 January by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials in Minneapolis during the Trump administration’s surge of immigration enforcement operations in the city. His killing came just two weeks after an immigration official shot and killed Renee Good and 10 days after the shooting of Julio C Sosa-Celis.
On Monday, Minnesota’s bureau of criminal apprehension (BCA), a state-level criminal investigative law enforcement agency, said the FBI had formally notified it that it would not share any information or evidence related to Pretti’s shooting.
The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, has demanded an “impartial” investigation into the shootings in Minneapolis.
“Trump’s left hand cannot investigate his right hand,” he said on Monday in response to the FBI’s refusal to share evidence. “The families of the deceased deserve better.”
The BCA’s superintendent also expressed frustration.
“While this lack of cooperation is concerning and unprecedented, the BCA is committed to thorough, independent and transparent investigations of these incidents, even if hampered by a lack of access to key information and evidence,” added Drew Evans.
He added that the agency remained committed to a joint investigation and said it would “continue to pursue all legal avenues to gain access to relevant information and evidence”.
The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The agency has also previously refused to share any information related to the shootings of Good or Sosa-Celis, a lack of cooperation that led the BCA to stop its investigation into Good’s killing.
“As we’ve previously said, full access to evidence, witnesses and information is necessary to meet the investigative standard that Minnesota law and the public demands; without it, we cannot do so,” the BCA said back in January, after the FBI boxed it out of the investigation.
The Trump administration in December deployed federal officials to the Minneapolis area for an aggressive roundup of immigrants dubbed “Operation Metro Surge” that has seen a series of violent incidents as masked officials arrest people they claim to suspect lack proper residency documentation.
Democrats and Republicans have both called on independent investigations into the Minneapolis shootings.
Pretti, a nurse at the Department of Veterans Affairs, was observing immigration enforcement operations in Minneapolis when he was killed. Good was similarly an observer in Minneapolis, who was shot in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer. Homeland security officials initially accused Good, 37, of “weaponizing” her vehicle, but local officials have disputed those claims.
Both Pretti and Good were US citizens and video footage of their shootings has circulated widely, leading to mass protests.
Sosa-Celis was shot by an ICE official in the leg last month. Trump administration officials initially claimed Sosa-Celis and two other men had “ambushed” the ICE officer who then “fired a defensive shot to defend his life”. But last week two ICE officials were placed on leave while they are investigated for allegedly lying under oath about the interaction.

‘The whole state is still a tinderbox’: Victoria braces for extreme fire conditions
Emergency services are warning people to have their bushfire plan ready and to postpone activities involving heavy machinery, as extreme fire danger once again bears down on Victoria.
The mercury is set to reach the mid-thirties in Melbourne, Horsham and Mildura on Tuesday, with wind gusts up to 60km/h and the risk of thunderstorms in central and western parts of the state.
A total fire ban has been declared for the central (including Melbourne, Geelong and Ballarat), north central, southwest, west and South Gippsland and Wimmera fire districts, meaning no fire can be lit in the open air or allowed to remain alight from 12:01am to 11:59pm on February 17.
Extreme fire danger is forecast in each of these areas, and also in Victoria’s northeast.
“Fires, if they do start, will be unpredictable, uncontrollable, and will be difficult for our firefighters on the ground,” said Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch in an update on Monday afternoon.”
“The concerns will very much be for the western parts of the state, in particular, down into western South Gippsland, where we still have a lot of grassland fire load in our landscape.
“The whole state is still a tinderbox in terms of the fuel types that are there, and so the concerns, particularly around the metropolitan area, would be in those northwestern suburbs, all the way through the grasslands down towards Geelong.”
“Please make sure you’ve downloaded the Vic emergency app. If you haven’t already, make sure you’ve set the watch zone for the area that you may be either living, working or holidaying during this period of time.”
Parts of Victoria have not had meaningful rain for weeks, leaving abundant dry fuel despite major blazes already this season.
The anticipated temperature spike has also prompted V-Line to implement extreme heat timetables on Tuesday.
On the Ararat, Ballarat, Geelong, Maryborough, Seymour, Shepparton and Warrnambool lines, trains that usually travel at up to 160km/h need to slow down to 90km/h or less because steel tracks expand in the heat.
“We’re seeing very dry fuels across large parts of the state, and when that’s paired with low humidity, fires can start easily and spread quickly,” said Country Fire Authority Chief Officer Jason Heffernan.
“Days like tomorrow are about prevention. The safest choice is to postpone activities involving machinery and keep up to date with changing conditions.”
The dangerous weather predicted follows a January during which fires burned more than 436,000 hectares of Victoria.
One person was killed and nearly 1600 structures were damaged or destroyed after fires began in the first week of the year, and were then aggravated by extreme heat peaking on Friday, January 9.
A major bushfire in the Otways flared up later in the same month, prompting further evacuations and causing further property losses.
On Monday, Wiebusch said the Otways fire would hopefully be contained next week, while two enormous fires in Longwood and Walwa were only contained last Friday, six weeks after they ignited.
A gusty south-westerly wind change with some rain is set to move through parts of Victoria later on Tuesday afternoon.

UK government drops plans to delay May council votes, adding to pressure over U-turns
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government on Feb 16 abandoned plans to delay 30 local council elections due in May after being advised it could lose a legal challenge, piling fresh pressure on him after a series of policy U-turns.
Mr Starmer survived a leadership crisis last week the rise of Mr Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK party
The government had permitted some councils to postpone their elections ahead of an upcoming reorganisation of local government, but political opponents had said that move was designed to minimise potential losses.
Days before the decision was due to be scrutinised in court, in a legal case brought by Reform UK, the government issued a statement abandoning its plans, citing legal advice.
Mr Steve Reed, the minister responsible for local government, said all elections would now go ahead as originally scheduled in May.
Around 4.5 million voters would have been affected by the postponements. Councils oversee services such as housing, social care and waste collection.
Starmer’s judgment in the spotlight
Since winning a landslide election victory in July 2024, Mr Starmer has struggled to implement his agenda and has had some important decisions challenged in court.
The government has reversed course on a number of big-ticket budget measures under pressure from voters, industry and from within Labour. Courts ruled last week that a decision to ban a pro-Palestinian group was unlawful.
Mr Starmer’s leadership came under threat last week over his decision to appoint Mr Peter Mandelson as US ambassador after new disclosures showed the depth of his ties to the late US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The May elections could prove the next flashpoint for Labour figures who believe Mr Starmer should be replaced.
Political opponents seized on the latest U-turn.
“We took this Labour government to court and won,” Mr Farage wrote on X on Feb 16, describing the decision as a “victory for democracy”. Court papers showed his party argued the postponements constituted an abuse of power.
The leader of the opposition Conservative Party, Kemi Badenoch, said the move was “predictable chaos from a useless government that cannot make basic decisions.” REUTERS

The patience and the poker face: Iran’s wily diplomat set to face the US in nuclear talks
Unknown

05:10:48 KST

If the US and Iran are to avoid a regional war, both sides need to start to make concessions at talks in Geneva on Tuesday, and also to accommodate one another’s very different bargaining styles.
The Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi, steeped in almost 15 years of Iranian nuclear talks, is a near lifelong diplomat who has written a book on the art of negotiations that reveals the secrets of the Iranian diplomatic trade – the feints, the patience, the poker faces.
He has a bachelor’s degree from Iran’s faculty of international relations, a master’s degree in political science from Islamic Azad University and a doctorate in political thought from the University of Kent in the UK.
Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff studied law at Hofstra, a university on Long Island near New York, before making his fortune in property development.
While Araghchi, much more a consensus figure inside Iranian politics than his famous predecessor Javad Zarif, will have gameplanned the parameters of what Iran can offer in endless consultations across the spectrum of government, including the supreme leader Ali Khamenei, Witkoff works to a shifting brief devised by one man.
Trump sees diplomacy as a branch of pro-wrestling. The Iranian foreign ministry regards it as a branch of chess, almost an art form.
Indeed, for those in the US who claim Iran loves to play for time and spin a negotiation out, Araghchi’s book, The Power of Negotiation, provides some support.
“The main principle of bargaining is practice: repetition, repetition, and repetition – combined with steadfastness and persistence. Insisting on positions and repeating demands is a necessity that must be done each time with different rhetoric and reasoning,” he writes.
Born into a family of merchants – his grandfather was a carpet trader – he argues Iranian diplomacy reflects the country’s bazaars.
“The Iranian negotiation style is generally known in the world as the ‘market style’, which means continuous and tireless bargaining. It requires a lot of time and energy, and he who gets tired and bored quickly will lose.”
More theoretically, he argues in the book – written when out of office in 2014 – that when a negotiator enters the room, their true power rests on the level of national cohesion back home and the country’s military strength.
If there is not at least a balance of power with your adversary, he argues it is best to decline talks until there is equilibrium, something Iran did after the bombing of its nuclear sites in June last year.
Nevertheless, the Iranian tendency to say “Yes, but” can go far. Famously, Araghchi reduced his US counterpart Wendy Sherman to tears of frustration – something he regrets.
Araghchi, who has already had six rounds of direct and indirect talks in two phases with Witkoff also discloses how vital it is to remain opaque.
“The face of a skilled diplomat is inscrutable, and it is impossible to catch any emotion from it. The ability to control the expression of emotions on the face is not easy and requires continuous work and practice.”
Providing your adversary with a graceful way out, he argues, is integral to diplomacy, describing this as providing “the Golden Bridge”, a term he has picked up from China (Araghchi spent four years as ambassador to Japan).
This suggests that if Trump ends up accepting a version of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal from which he walked out in 2018, Araghchi will not be triumphalist. “Diplomacy is not a game that you must necessarily win, but a process where you must necessarily understand the other side,” he writes.
Married twice, and with five children, Araghchi is a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war and maintains close relations with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC, unlike his predecessor, Zarif, who criticised the elite forces’ power.
“Araghchi is much more technocratic and careful in walking the tightrope necessary to survive,” said Ellie Geranmayeh from the European Council on Foreign Relations. “Zarif was more political and outspoken, and willing to test the boundaries of what was digestible for the regime.”
Indeed, some thought Araghchi was put in the nuclear talks with Washington by Iranian conservatives to act as a check and balance on Zarif.
Geranmayeh expects the US to make clear demands on diluting, or removing Iran’s stockpile of highly enriched uranium, but such an irreversible step by Iran would require parallel irreversible steps by the US, such as releasing many of Iran’s large assets frozen abroad.
The scope for a compromise on enrichment exists on the basis that the bombing of its nuclear sites makes it impossible to enrich for 3 to 5 years. But this would require the return of the UN nuclear inspectorate, the IAEA, to be able to visit the bombed sites, an issue that was probably at the centre of talks on Monday between Araghchi and Rafael Grossi, the IAEA director general.
Outside the nuclear aspects of the deal, Geranmayeh says: “In this Trumpian world, do not expect every agreement to be written down on paper. There could be a series of not verifiable understandings, including a non-aggression pact between Iran and the US and its allies.”
Ali Ansari, professor of modern history at the University of St Andrews, said Iran may offer concessions “to keep the discussions going, but Trump is in no rush at present anyway”.
Bringing in US oil companies – an economic concession that has been floated – would be a significant change in Iran’s anti-US revolutionary doctrine.
Either way, Araghchi knows that whatever the outcome, he faces domestic criticism.
Araghchi recalled once meeting with Zarif in the lift of Hassan Rouhani’s residence after the latter’s 2013 presidential election victory. At the time, Zarif had not yet accepted Rouhani’s offer to serve as his foreign minister. Araghchi asked him why. Zarif replied: ‘In the end, we’ll be found wanting, and we will be the victims.”

Man faces terrorism charges for plot against Taylor Swift’s Eras show
A 21-year-old man has been charged in Austria for allegedly planning an attack on a Taylor Swift concert scheduled for Vienna in 2024.
Prosecutors state the defendant declared allegiance to the Islamic State group, sharing propaganda and obtaining instructions to build a shrapnel bomb, of which he produced a small amount.
The man also reportedly made several attempts to illegally acquire and import weapons into Austria.
The suspect, identified by Austrian media as Beran A., was arrested in August 2024 and remains in custody.
Austrian authorities cancelled the planned concerts in August 2024 after the plot was foiled, with intelligence provided by the United States.

What we know about the IS-linked families who want to return to Australia
Unknown

The question of whether — and how — to help the Australian families of Islamic State fighters return home has been one that governments have grappled with for years.
Despite pressure from aid agencies and some politicians in Australia, successive governments have been reluctant to facilitate their return.
Citing safety issues in and around the camps, and security concerns back home, Australia has made limited progress in clearing a passage for the Australian women and their children.
Now, these families are attempting to make their own way to the Syrian capital, Damascus, to begin the long journey home.
Who are they?
This group is comprised of 34 Australians and local reports suggest there are 11 women and 23 children in the convoy.
Most — if not all — of the women were married to Islamic State group (IS) fighters, who were captured or killed when Kurdish forces, backed by the United States, helped to defeat IS in 2019.
Some of the Australian children who have been detained in Syrian camps were brought there, but others were born in Syria.
The women are not currently accused of any crimes in Syria, but the Australian government says they will face close scrutiny from police and intelligence agencies if they return.
Where have they been living?
Australian families of IS fighters are known to have lived in two camps in north-eastern Syria, Al-Hawl and Al-Roj.
The UN says most of the people in the larger Al-Hawl camp, which was captured by advancing Syrian forces, have now left and that Syria plans to relocate those who remain.
It's not clear if any Australians still live in Al-Hawl.
The women and children now trying to leave Syria have been living in Al-Roj camp, which is still controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF)
It is home to more than 2,000 people, from dozens of nationalities.
Amnesty International says the conditions in the camp are dangerous, with inadequate access to food, water and healthcare.
How many Australians have already left?
In 2019, the Morrison government — working with an aid agency — completed the repatriation of eight Australian orphans from Syrian camps, including the children of Islamic State fighter Khaled Sharrouf.
At the time, Mr Morrison said it was "despicable" that their parents had put them in harm's way.
"However, children should not be punished for the crimes of their parents," he said.
"Repatriating these children was not a decision the Australian government made lightly.
"As I have said repeatedly, my government would not allow any Australian to be put at risk."
In 2022, the Australian government repatriated four Australian women and their 13 children from a Syrian camp.
Then-home affairs minister Clare O'Neil said the government had sought intelligence advice prior to that operation.
"The decision to repatriate these women and their children was informed by individual assessments following detailed work by national security agencies," she said in 2022.
Last year, six women and children escaped Syria without Australian government assistance and made it to Beirut, where they were issued Australian passports.
They have since returned to Australia.
Will the government help this group home?
In the statement issued late on Monday, a government spokesperson said it "will not repatriate people from Syria".
"People in this cohort need to know that if they have committed a crime and if they return to Australia they will be met with the full force of the law."
That aligns with Foreign Minister Penny Wong's evidence to a Senate estimates hearing last week, when she said no repatriation operations were being planned.
However, she also anticipated some of the Australians in Syria would try to make their own way back, without the government helping coordinate logistics.
"Australians in these situations may seek to return, in what we've described as a self-managed return," she told a Senate estimates hearing.
When Liberal senator Sarah Henderson asked her to guarantee no "ISIS brides" would be granted passports, she said Australia had certain obligations.
"Australian citizens have various entitlements which are not discretionary under law and no government is able to make them discretionary," Senator Wong said.
However, she said the government had the option of applying temporary exclusion orders (TEOs) to people returning from Syria.
TEOs allow the government to block Australians aged 14 and above from entering Australia, without a permit, if they are deemed to be a national security threat.
The minister for home affairs can apply conditions to such permits, like requiring the subjects to notify authorities about their movements and communications.
"Our first priority is to keep the Australian community safe," Senator Wong said.
Who is helping the Australians try to leave?
It's not clear who is coordinating the extraction efforts on the ground, or who will fund their transport to Australia once they reach Damascus.
Save the Children has long campaigned for the Australian government to repatriate the families from Syria.
In 2023, it took the Albanese government to the Federal Court on behalf of 20 children and 11 women who wanted to come to Australia.
That case was unsuccessful and in 2024, the High Court refused the charity special leave to appeal.
Despite its long-term advocacy, Save the Children says it hasn't been involved in any operation to extract the Australians.
"Save the Children does not fund or conduct repatriations, nor do we ever intend to play such a role," CEO Matt Tinkler said.
"These reports, if true, underscore what national security experts have repeatedly said: that the unmanaged return of Australian citizens would inevitably happen in the absence of federal government action to repatriate them."
He said Australians should never be left without a safe or viable way home.
"These innocent children have already lost years of their childhood, and deserve the chance to rebuild their lives in safety at home, and to reintegrate into the Australian way of life."

Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning actor and star of The Godfather, dies aged 95
The legendary US actor was nominated for seven Oscars and won for his role as a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.
Oscar-winning actor Robert Duvall, best known for his work in The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, has died aged 95, his wife has announced in a Facebook post.
“For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented,” Luciana Duvall said in a statement on Monday.
Duvall was best known for playing forceful roles such as his depiction of Tom Hagen, consigliere to the Corleone Mafia family in The Godfather.
He also played Lieutenant Colonel Bull Meechum in The Great Santini and the title character in Stalin, as well as broken-down and fallen characters in Tender Mercies and The Apostle.
Duvall, the son of a US Navy admiral and an amateur actress, grew up in Annapolis, Maryland in the United States. After graduating from Principia College in Illinois and serving in the US Army, he moved to New York City, where he roomed with Dustin Hoffman and befriended Gene Hackman when the three were struggling acting students.
After working on a variety of television shows, Duvall made a strong impression in his first forays onto the big screen, such as his first movie part as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird.
Duvall got the part at the suggestion of the film’s screenwriter, Horton Foote, who had liked Duvall’s work in one of his plays. Foote later wrote Tender Mercies, a 1983 film for which Duvall won the Academy Award for best actor as a washed-up country singer.
Duvall was nominated for another six Oscars, including for his work in Frances Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam epic Apocalypse Now. Duvall played the off-kilter, surfing-obsessed Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore.
The character’s famous line, “I love the smell of napalm in the morning”, became legendary.
In all, Duvall appeared in almost 100 movies. And when he grew weary of Hollywood, he made his own films. He wrote, directed and won an Oscar acting nomination for The Apostle, the story of a conflicted preacher.
Duvall did the same with Assassination Tango, a movie that allowed him to exhibit his passion for the tango and Argentina, where he met his fourth wife, Luciana Pedraza.
In later life, Duvall split his time between Los Angeles, Argentina and a farm in Virginia, where he converted the barn into a tango dance hall.

TBILISI, February 16. /TASS/. Representatives of the Georgian government and opposition are holding the first-ever televised debates on the country’s potential membership in the European Union.
The debates, aired live by the Rustavi 2 television channel, were initiated by Vakhtang Shakarisjvili, leader of the United Neutral Georgia party, which claims that European integration presents a danger to the nation. The party insists that there will be no peace inside the country until it drops the idea of joining the European Union and NATO.
The ruling Georgian Dream - Democratic Georgia party is represented by leader of its parliamentary faction Irakli Kirtskhalia. The ruling party insists that the course toward European and Euro-Atlantic integration is committed to paper in the country’s constitution and cannot be revised.
Taking part in the debates are also Georgy Khaindrava, a film director and former minister of state for conflict settlement, German Sabo of the Girchi opposition party, Guram Macharashvili, a lawmaker with the opposition People’s Power party, and other politicians.
Georgia’s constitution of 2017 has a provision on the need for taking all necessary measures to ensure the country’s full-fledged integration into the European Union and NATO.

Barnaby Joyce open to recontesting his seat in lower house

When he left the Nationals late last year, Joyce said he wouldn't run for the seat of New England and would instead run for the Senate.
But speaking to Channel Nine this morning, Joyce said he might change his mind, now that he's with a different party.
"If it becomes apparent that [One Nation's] got a number of seats we're going to win in the lower house, then yes, of course, you're going to have to have someone with experience there to do the very best job we can," he said.
"But that is not a conversation we have now, that's a conversation for down the track".
Leaked migration proposal doesn't reflect actual policy: Sharma
Liberal MPs are continuing to distance themselves from a leaked proposal to ban people coming to Australia from terror-declared areas, such as Gaza and Somalia.
The migration policy was drafted within Sussan Ley's office but was not signed off by shadow cabinet prior to the leadership spill that installed Angus Taylor.
Speaking with Nine, Senator Dave Sharma said the leaked proposal did not reflect the party's policy.
"I cannot say that what I've seen in the newspapers today actually reflects our policy. It doesn't reflect what I know of our policy," he said.
"I mean, I'm not in the shadow cabinet, but as far as I'm aware, our policy is not going to single out any particular region or group of people."
Labor won't assist return of Australian families with links to IS fighters
Australian families with links to Islamic State fighters have been forced to turn around after leaving a camp in Syria to try to begin their journey home to Australia.
The ABC has been told that 11 families, with 34 women and children in total, left the Al-Roj camp in north-eastern Syria on Monday morning, local time.
Labor frontbencher Amanda Rishworth said the government would not be assisting the families in their return.
"They made a choice to go to Syria. We won't be repatriating them from Syria. Of course as Australian citizens under the law they are able to make their way back," she told Nine.
Australian authorities were monitoring the situation, she said. When asked if she was comfortable with not assisting the children in the group, she repeated Labor wouldn't be offering help.
Liberal senator Dave Sharma, who was also on the morning television panel, said he'd like to see assurances before the families returned to Australia.
"I think the Australian people deserve to know exactly what those assurances are, what monitoring is being put in place, what vetting is being done, what are our intelligence agencies doing about this?" he said.
Taylor distances himself from Ley immigration policy
Opposition Leader Angus Taylor has denied knowledge of an immigration policy that was looking to ban people coming to Australia from terror-declared areas.
The policy developed under former leader Sussan Ley was reported by some media to bar entry to people from parts of Gaza, Somalia and the Philippines.
Taylor denied any knowledge on 7.30 and said that after Ley lost the leadership in a Friday spill motion it was not valid anyway.
"That document, which I haven't actually seen, has no validity," Taylor said.
"It didn't go through shadow cabinet or the leadership and as I understand it, it wasn't seen by the relevant immigration shadows.
"Frankly, I don't know what the document is, I don't know where it's come from and I don't know what's in it."

US military airlifts a nuclear reactor across three states after Trump pushes for more of the energy source
The ‘next-generation’ reactor could potentially power up to 5,000 homes, the Pentagon announced

The U.S. military has successfully transported a small nuclear reactor by air, advancing the Trump administration’s plan to deploy the energy source across the nation.
The “next-generation” Valar Atomics Ward 250 nuclear reactor — comparable in size to a large truck — was loaded onto a C-17 transport plane at the March Air Reserve Base in California on Sunday.
It was then flown about 700 miles to the Hill Air Force Base in Utah. It will eventually be sent to an energy lab in the state for evaluation and testing, the Pentagon announced.
The compact, 5-megawatt reactor could potentially power up to 5,000 homes or ensure reliable and secure energy for a military base.
The reactor’s flight aligns with President Donald Trump's plan to modernize America's nuclear power infrastructure — a goal bolstered by a series of executive orders he signed in May.
“It is the policy of the United States to expedite and promote to the fullest possible extent the production and operation of nuclear energy to provide affordable, reliable, safe, and secure energy to the American people,” one of the orders states.
Michael Duffy, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, lauded the operation — which was jointly carried out by the Defense and Energy Departments.
“Powering next generation warfare will require us to move faster than our adversaries, to build a system that doesn't just equip our warfighters to fight, but equips them to win at extraordinary speed,” Duffey said. “Today is a monumental step toward building that system. By supporting the industrial base and its capacity to innovate, we accelerate the delivery of resilient power to where it's needed.”
Secretary of Energy Chris Wright added that the administration’s goal is to have a trio of small reactors online by July 4.
"The American nuclear renaissance is to get that ball moving again, fast, carefully, but with private capital, American innovation and determination," Wright said.
Currently, there are 94 operable nuclear reactors in the U.S., which generate about 20 percent of the country’s electricity, according to the World Nuclear Association.
Polls show that the American public is broadly on board with nuclear power in spite of several major accidents throughout the past decades.
According to a Gallup survey conducted last year, 61 percent of Americans favor using nuclear energy, marking a near-record high. Republicans were significantly more likely to support nuclear energy than Democrats.

Pro-Assad singer killed in shootout with Syrian security forces

Syrian singer Jamal Assaf, a staunch supporter of ousted president Bashar Assad who was known for praising his forces and was sometimes referred to as “Assad’s singer,” was killed over the weekend in an exchange of fire with security forces of Syria’s new government led by Ahmad al-Sharaa.
After reports of Assaf’s death circulated overnight between Saturday and Sunday, Syria’s Interior Ministry issued an official statement Sunday afternoon saying Assaf was part of a smuggling network targeted by government forces and was killed during the operation.
According to authorities in Damascus, internal security forces had been tracking the smuggling ring and launched a raid at a location in the al-Fardous neighborhood of Aleppo where one of its members was believed to be staying. That individual was later identified as Assaf.
The Interior Ministry said that during the raid, the wanted suspect opened fire on security forces, who returned fire at the source of the shooting and “neutralized” him. One member of the Syrian security forces was seriously wounded in the operation.
During Assad’s rule, Assaf gained prominence for inflammatory rhetoric against the former president’s opponents. He publicly called for the use of military force against cities where rebels were active and urged attacks on Idlib, a major rebel stronghold in northwestern Syria, including the use of so-called barrel bombs, improvised explosives dropped from aircraft that became a hallmark of the conflict.
According to SyriaTV, Assaf on several occasions boasted that he had taken part in fighting alongside Assad’s forces. The channel cited two of his songs, “Your Revolution Is a Revolution of Thugs” and “Idlib Will Pay the Price,” as examples of his pro-government messaging.
Some reports said that after Assad’s government fell, Assaf attempted to portray himself as having changed his position and claimed to support the uprising that led to Assad’s removal, though few appeared convinced by the shift.

India seizes three Iran-linked US-sanctioned tankers
India has seized three US-sanctioned oil tankers linked to Iran this month and stepped up surveillance in its maritime zone to curb illicit trade, Reuters news agency reported on Monday, confirming a post on X by Indian authorities earlier in February that had been deleted.
India aims to prevent its waters from being used for ship-to-ship transfers that obscure the origin of oil cargoes, Reuters reports, citing a source with direct knowledge of the matter.
The seizures and heightened surveillance follow an improvement in US-India relations. Washington earlier this month announced it will cut import tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50%, after New Delhi agreed to stop Russian oil imports.
The three sanctioned vessels - Stellar Ruby, Asphalt Star and Al Jafzia - frequently changed their identities to evade law enforcement by coastal states, the source said, adding that their owners were based overseas.
VESSELS SEIZED OFFSHORE MUMBAI
Iranian state media cited the National Iranian Oil Company as saying that the three tankers seized by India had no connection to the company. It said that neither the cargoes nor the vessels were linked to the company.
Indian authorities had said in a post on X on February 6 that they intercepted three vessels about 100 nautical miles west of Mumbai after detecting suspicious activity involving a tanker in India's exclusive economic zone.
The post was later deleted, but the source confirmed that the vessels had been escorted to Mumbai for further investigation.
The Indian Coast Guard has since deployed about 55 ships and between 10 and 12 aircraft for round-the-clock surveillance in its maritime zones, according to the source.
The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control said last year it had sanctioned three vessels, called Global Peace, Chil 1, and Glory Star 1, with IMO numbers identical to the ships lately captured by India.
Two of the three tankers are linked to Iran, with Al Jafzia having carried fuel oil from Iran to Djibouti in 2025 and Stellar Ruby flagged in Iran, according to LSEG data.
The Asphalt Star mostly operated on voyages around China, the data show.
Sanctioned oil and fuel are often sold at deep discounts due to the risks involved, with intermediaries moving cargo through complex ownership structures, false documentation and mid-sea transfers that complicate enforcement.

Remains of legendary ‘guerrilla priest’ identified decades later
The search unit used public and classified records to locate his remains
- Bookmark

The Colombian state entity tasked with finding and identifying more than 135,000 people who have disappeared during the country's six decades of civil conflict announced on Monday the identification of Camilo Torres' remains.
Torres was a Catholic priest famous for his membership in the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group and was killed in combat in the 1960s.
The Search Unit for Disappeared People (UBPD) was created by a 2016 peace deal between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group.
Its role is to take charge of archival and forensic efforts to find disappeared people, including those forcibly disappeared by right-wing paramilitaries, rebel groups and state security forces, those forced to join armed groups, soldiers missing in action and others.
The ELN, founded in 1964, remains active and is itself accused of forced disappearances.
It has held sporadic peace talks with various governments and said in December it was willing to resume negotiations.
Torres, son of a well-connected Bogota family, was an adherent of liberation theology, a Catholic, anti-imperialist social justice movement.
He joined the ELN some four months before his death and was killed in February 1966 in eastern Santander province in a skirmish with the army.
UBPD Director Luz Janeth Forero told journalists the search unit used public and classified records, including from the military justice system, to find where Torres' remains had been interred by the military after his death.
DNA samples from bones found in 2024 in the military section of a cemetery in Bucaramanga were compared with a sample taken from the remains of Torres' father Calisto, which were exhumed for testing from a cemetery in Bogota.
"After 60 years of disappearance, the search unit found, identified and completed a dignified handover of Father Camilo Torres," Forero said.
The unit, which began work in 2017, has found nearly 5,000 remains, identifying and handing over some 700 to loved ones so far, Forero added. It has also found 500 living people who were reported as disappeared.
Torres' remains were handed over to Javier Giraldo, a Catholic priest well-known for his activism on behalf of conflict victims, on Sunday, the 60th anniversary of Torres' death, Forero said.
Giraldo, who recognised the efforts of Torres' mother Isabel Restrepo to find her son while she was alive, said Torres will be buried at Bogota's National University, where he studied and worked as a chaplain.
Though the Catholic Church has historically rejected Torres' involvement with the ELN, there is now more openness to discussing his legacy as a chaplain, activist and social justice thinker, Giraldo added.

‘A European Moment:’ E.U. Leaders Push Back Against U.S. ‘Civilizational Erasure’ Claim
Unknown

E.U. leaders are pushing for increased European sovereignty in the midst of frayed relations with the United States.
“We want to cut through knots, we want to find solutions always with the goal of strengthening Europe's sovereignty and making Europe strong. This is a very European moment,” said German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil on Monday.
“I believe what happened at the beginning of the year with Greenland, woke up everyone who cares about Europe, and it is leading to the fact that we are not getting bogged down in national interests or hiding behind them, but ready to make compromises," he continued, referencing President Donald Trump’s push to acquire Greenland, which saw him briefly threaten to tariff European countries who opposed his efforts.
Klingbeil made the comments before a meeting of E.U. finance ministers in Brussels, according to Reuters.
His encouragement towards Europe’s self-reliance comes after Kaja Kallas, the European Commission's high representative for foreign affairs, hit back at remarks made by the U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the Munich Security Conference over the weekend.
In her own address on Sunday, Kallas told the audience: “Contrary to what some may say—woke, decadent Europe is not facing civilizational erasure.”
“In fact, people still want to join our club. And not just fellow Europeans. When I was in Canada last year I was told that over 40% of Canadians have an interest in joining the E.U.,” she claimed. “The waiting list is getting long. I just hope those who have been waiting for quite some time would not have to wait for longer.”
“Those who are already members want their union to take a stronger role in the world: To defend our values. To take care of our people. To push humanity forwards,” she said, later adding that “European bashing” is currently “very in fashion.”
Kallas’ remarks appeared to be in response to Rubio’s speech from the day before, during which he said the U.S. will always be “a child of Europe,” but also issued a warning about perceived incoming threats.
He claimed that “acting together” will “restore to us a clearer sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”
The notion of “civilizational erasure” in Europe was also put forward in a U.S. national security strategy report in November, which claimed that policy decisions, including those on migration, from E.U. nations was having a detrimental impact.
European policies are “creating strife, censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition, cratering birthrates, and loss of national identities and self-confidence,” the report claimed.
In Munich, although Rubio offered a more conciliatory tone in comparison to Vice President J.D. Vance’s speech from last year’s conference, he repeatedly warned of the dangers of “mass migration” and said “we must gain control of our national borders.”
“If at times we disagree, our disagreements come from our profound sense of concern about a Europe with which we are connected—not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally. We want Europe to be strong,” said Rubio, encouraging a united approach moving forward.
European leaders, meanwhile, expressed concern over transatlantic relations throughout the conference.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen expressed her belief that Trump’s interest in Greenland “is not over.”
“Unfortunately I think the desire is the same… I would also add that I think the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable. We are talking about threats, but the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone,” she said, maintaining that there are “red lines that will not be crossed,” with a solution still being discussed.
Prior to Rubio’s speech, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned of a “deep rift” between the U.S. and Europe.
Merz argued that the U.S. “will not be powerful enough to go it alone” in the future and urged everyone to “repair and revive transatlantic trust together.”
Referencing Vance’s address from last year’s conference, in which the Vice President targeted Europe’s idea of free speech, Merz told the Munich audience: “The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours… Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”

NHS ’clearly failing’ to ensure children get measles vaccine, experts warn

Children are at risk of measles because the NHS is “clearly failing” to ensure they get the MMR vaccine and its system needs an urgent overhaul, MPs and health experts have warned.
Calls are growing for major reform of how MMR jabs are delivered as it emerged that vaccination rates in some parts of England are now on a par with those in Afghanistan and Malawi.
More outbreaks of measles like the ongoing one in north London are inevitable, public health specialists believe, given that fewer than 60% of five-year-olds in some places have had both the recommended doses of MMR.
In Enfield, where 60 children have recently contracted measles, of whom 15 have been hospitalised, the MMR vaccination rate is only 64.3%. That is lower than the 69.3% rate in Malawi and just above Afghanistan’s 62% rate. The World Health Organization advises a 95% rate.
The outbreak in Enfield has reignited public and medical anxiety about unvaccinated children getting measles, which can damage the brain and lungs and in some cases lead to meningitis, blindness or even death. Five “catch-up clinics” have been set up in local community centres to vaccinate children who got either one or no doses of MMR when it was offered to their parents.
NHS England has been accused of displaying “complacency” for its failure to halt a relentless decline over the last decade in the number of five-year-old childrenwho are fully vaccinated, from 88.2% to 83.7%.
Ministers are under pressure to let pharmacies start administering MMR jabs to infants so that they can supplement the immunisation programmes that GP surgeries and schools already run.
In England, GP staff, mainly practice nurses, deliver the first and second doses of MMR to children when they are 12 and 18 months old. Schools also play a key role by hosting catch-up events at which unvaccinated and under-vaccinated pupils can get covered.
Ben Coleman, a Labour MP on the Commons health and social care select committee, said: “The long-term decline in uptake of MMR and growing number of very worrying measles outbreaks, like the one in Enfield just now, show that that system is clearly failing.
“That means that children are at risk of hospitalisation and even of dying from measles. Given that under-vaccination poses real risks to public health, it’s time for the NHS to accept that GPs and schools on their own appear not to be able to provide the 95% coverage the WHO rightly insists on. Pharmacies are somewhere families often visit and they’re being wasted as a resource. We can’t afford complacency.”
A child died of measles last summer in Alder Hey children’s hospital in Liverpool amid an increase in cases in the city.
The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, which represents specialist children’s doctors, said pharmacies should be handed a role in vaccination rollout. Prof Steve Turner, its president, said the change would help “make it faster and easier for parents and guardians to get their children vaccinated”.
He said: “With appropriate training and support, enabling pharmacists to deliver MMR vaccines could be particularly helpful for families who have missed routine appointments or need to catch up on their children’s vaccinations.”
The National Pharmacy Association also backed the call. “The decade-long reduction in uptake of MMR vaccinations among children is a sign that the current system is simply not working and needs urgent reviewing by the NHS,” said Olivier Picard, the trade body’s chair. “We need to work across the whole health service to perform this vital public health role, not leave it to one small part of it.”
Helen Bedford, a vaccination expert and professor of child health at University College London, said pharmacies could help supplement existing NHS efforts to ensure better MMR uptake, especially as some schools – including some faith schools – do not take part in catch-up campaigns.
“That may be because of disruption to studies or that they don’t see it as a priority. Or it may be about [their] views about vaccination generally,” she said.
Coleman said MPs on the health committee sensed “complacency” among NHS bosses over falling MMR take-up when they gave evidence last week about trends in vaccination.
At the hearing, Dr Mary Ramsay, the UK Health Security Agency’s director of public health programmes, admitted under questioning by Coleman that opposition among GPs to pharmacies being paid to perform a role currently undertaken by family doctors made that change difficult.
The MP asked: “GPs might be annoyed if pharmacies can do it?”. Ramsey replied: “That is an element.”
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) did not indicate if pharmacies might start delivering MMR jabs. Superdrug has said it would start providing MMR jabs if asked.
Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group at Oxford University, said of the Enfield outbreak there was “a real risk of further spread both locally and in other parts of London”, since the virus could easily spread in communities where less than 95% of people were vaccinated, as is the case in many parts of London.
“When ‘enough’ people have been infected, the outbreak will die down, only to return again later when more unvaccinated children are born and the number who are susceptible has re-accumulated; there will be another explosive outbreak,” he said.
A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “It is vital for anyone not yet vaccinated against MMR to do so as soon as possible. Not only does this ensure that you are protected, but also those around you.
“To improve uptake and provide earlier protection against measles, from January children can have their second dose of MMR sooner. We’ve also introduced chickenpox protection into the childhood programme with the MMRV vaccine.
“Low vaccination rates leave communities vulnerable, and we are taking urgent action with partners across London to boost MMR uptake and safeguard children’s health.”

Morocco, Albania, Greece expected to join International Stabilization Force in Gaza

Morocco and Albania will join the International Stabilization Force (ISF) in Gaza, which will handle aspects of peacekeeping in Gaza during the Trump administration's Phase II of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, The Jerusalem Post has learned.
In addition, KAN News reported on Monday night that Greece will also join the ISF.
The leaks and public announcements have been timed to coincide with Sunday's announcement that Indonesia will be the first country to join the ISF mission, and ahead of the Board of Peace summit, which is set to take place in the United States on Thursday.
On Sunday, the Associated Press additionally reported that Indonesia's contribution to the ISF will begin in April, with a primary deployment of Indonesian forces targeted for June.
The same report set the number of Indonesian soldiers to be deployed in April at 1,000 and the full June force at around 8,000, which is higher than some earlier figures the media had speculated about.
There is still no specific information on the timing of deployments for the three additional countries, but by mid-January, reports indicated that Morocco would join Indonesia as the two largest peacekeeping forces.
Morocco has maintained special defense relations with Israel since signing the Abraham Accords in 2020.
Indonesia selecting ISF soldiers
According to the AP report, aspects of Indonesia's process for selecting and clearing soldiers to join the force are underway.
However, Indonesia also said that if conditions in Gaza were not suitable for deployment when it comes to any possible conflict with Hamas, the force might postpone travel to Gaza.
In previous months, Indonesia was mentioned as a possible contributing country to the ISF, along with the United Arab Emirates, Morocco, Egypt, Italy, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, Qatar, Turkey, and others, but to date, no country has progressed past general promises to concrete readiness to send troops.
Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will be visiting Washington for Trump's Board of Peace summit on February 19.
Neither the ISF in general, nor Indonesia in particular, is expected to seek direct confrontation with Hamas or to proactively disarm them.
Rather, they are expected to supervise current ceasefire lines and possibly handle other border-related issues.

Pentagon faces backlash after using AI model Claude for offensive measures in Maduro capture - WSJ

The US Defense Department used AI company Anthropic's Claude model during the operation to capture former Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his wife in Caracas last month, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.
This led to disagreements between the Pentagon and Anthropic, as Claude is not meant to be used for offensive measures, per Anthropic's public usage policies.
These policies include prohibiting the model from facilitating violence, developing weapons, or conducting surveillance, per WSJ's report.
An Anthropic spokesperson said the company could not comment on whether Claude or any other model was used in any specific operation and that any development must comply with its usage policies.
Deployment of Claude occurred through Anthropic's partnership with data company Palantir Technologies, whose tools and models are used by the Pentagon.
The Pentagon then questioned its future relationship with Anthropic, with chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell saying that the Defense Department requires "our partners to be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight."
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said at an event in January announcing that the Pentagon would work with xAI that the department would not "employ AI models that won't allow you to fight wars."
WSJ also reported that tensions over Anthropic’s constraints on military use have prompted officials to consider canceling a contract worth up to $200 million. The contract was awarded last summer, the report said.
WSJ added that Anthropic was the first AI model developer to be used in classified Defense Department operations, and that other tools could have been used for unclassified tasks. AI models can support activities such as summarizing documents, generating reports, and assisting with research, while the most contentious debates center on autonomous lethal uses and surveillance.
Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has publicly called for stronger regulation and guardrails around advanced AI, the report said, putting the company at odds with officials who want fewer restrictions on wartime applications.
The Journal reported that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth previously said the Pentagon would not employ AI models that “won’t allow you to fight wars,” referencing discussions involving Anthropic.
How the US captured Nicolas Maduro
The operation to capture Maduro began with overnight US strikes across Venezuela, with multiple explosions reported in Caracas and a loss of power in parts of the capital’s southern districts, followed by a rapid assault that ended with Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, being taken into custody and flown out of the country.
Venezuelan authorities declared a national emergency and, in the immediate aftermath, senior officials said they did not know the couple’s whereabouts, while Washington said Maduro would be brought to the United States to face prosecution.
In the days that followed, the humanitarian and political fallout widened: Cuba announced that 32 of its citizens, described as members of its armed forces and intelligence services assigned to security duties, were killed during the raid and declared two days of national mourning, while Venezuelan officials later cited a death toll of roughly 100 and said both Maduro and Flores were injured during the operation, as competing accounts continued to emerge over casualties, damage, and the scope of the strikes.

Fertility patients win high court battle to save embryos after consent error

More than a dozen fertility patients have won a high court battle to save their embryos, eggs and sperm from destruction after errors meant they did not renew consent to store them within the 10-year window required by law.
Ruling that the material could be kept, the judge said they should not “have the possibility of parenthood … removed by the ticking of a clock”.
Lawyers for 15 groups affected by the errors – some of them former cancer patients – asked the court in London to declare it would be lawful for the embryos or cells to remain in storage, despite the consent expiring in June last year. In some cases this was because fertility clinics failed to notify those affected.
In an unusual situation, the move was unopposed, with no objections from the clinics, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority or the health secretary.
Mrs Justice Morgan ruled that it would be lawful in 14 of the 15 cases for the material to continue to be stored and used. She said laws around human fertilisation and embryology were “unbending” but “the rigidity of the scheme is not rigidity for its own sake”.
She continued: “It is surely consent that is important, not consent by an immutable date. I find it hard to conclude that parliament intended the possibility of parenthood should be removed by the ticking of a clock, not in the cliched phrase, the ticking of the biological clock, but by the ticking of the clock beyond midnight of the day when existing consent expires, whatever might be the circumstances.”
Under the law, fertility clinics need written consent from clients every decade to continue storing biological material. The rules are intended to prevent cells being kept or used without people’s knowledge or permission.
Owing to delays and issues accessing fertility treatment during the pandemic, the law allowed for a two-year extension, meaning people using the service on 1 July 2020 were granted extra time.
Confusion caused by the extension meant some clinic users were not notified when they needed to renew consent, so it lapsed.
In the one case where the judge ruled against, the circumstances were legally different. Morgan said the pair involved had not originally consented to an embryo being stored but one had been retained accidentally and they now wished to use it.
She said: “There was never, on their case, a consent to renew. To be permitted to take advantage of the storage of the embryo which they say ‘contradicted’ their express wishes because the clinic acted on the wrong consent form to change their mind is not in my judgment renewing consent. It is a change of consent.”

Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich does not want his daughter to serve in the IDF, he said Monday.
“I will educate my daughter not to enlist in the army,” the chairman of the Religious Zionist Party (RZP) said during his party’s press conference in the Knesset.
“I respect anyone who thinks differently from me. This is the ruling of my rabbis, and I hope the liberals will respect my position. Mixing men and women in tanks is, in my view, delusional.”
Smotrich also discussed efforts to lower the cost of living in Israel and combat monopolies to strengthen the economy.
The controversial haredi conscription bill
In recent months, the government has been fast-tracking a controversial haredi (ultra-Orthodox) conscription bill. A haredi protest in Bnei Brak on Sunday against serving in the IDF turned violent. Two female soldiers were attacked by a haredi mob before being rescued by police.
“We cannot continue like this,” Smotrich said. “We must, simply must, pass a draft law that will truly lead to the enlistment of our haredi brothers and their integration into bearing the burden of security and national existence.”
Critics of the draft bill say its current version fails to enforce haredi conscription and instead aims to appease the haredi parties in the Knesset.
The IDF has repeatedly said there is an urgent need for additional manpower, especially after more than two years of war.
Smotrich has not said whether he would support the bill in its current form. His indirect stance, however, has led to speculation that he might vote in favor.
Developments with the haredi draft bill have also become intertwined with the government’s passage of the 2026 state budget. The haredi parties have threatened to vote against the budget unless progress is made on the draft bill.
Smotrich said the draft bill and the state budget should not be linked.
Support from Religious Zionist Party MKs is considered crucial to whether the bill can pass its second and third readings in the Knesset plenum and become law.
Aliyah and Integration Minister Ofir Sofer (RZP), a growing number of coalition MKs, and opposition MKs have strongly criticized the current draft bill's outline.

US blogger calls London’s idea of allowing children to change gender identity madness

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. The British government'’s initiative to allow children as young as four to change their gender identity (propaganda of gender reassignment and the operation itself are banned in Russia) is insane and leads to the destruction of the country, Jozef Schutzman, an American blogger and IT specialist, told TASS in an interview.
"We should not be surprised in the slightest about the insane idea of the British government planning to allow children as young as four years old to change their gender identity. The British government hates their country anyways. And they have been trying to destroy it for decades, and they're doing a really fine job at it. This is why more and more families from Western countries are moving to Russia, where family values and children are protected by law and the government," he said.
On February 13, the Daily Mail newspaper reported that the UK Department for Education has released new guidelines for schools on working with "gender-questioning children" (propaganda for gender reassignment and the operation itself are banned in Russia), which allow for the possibility of "full social transition" for primary school students, including children as young as four. According to its information, under these guidelines, teachers and students will be able to refer to children using pronouns that do not correspond to their sex but rather reflect their gender. For example, a girl could be addressed as "he" and a boy as "she."
In the United States, Schutzman built a successful career in the IT sector, holding high positions at corporations such as Microsoft, Oracle and Red Hat. He and his wife are raising eight children and advocate for traditional values. When their state passed a law allowing minors to change gender without parental consent, the family decided to move to Russia. In 2023, they sold all their property in the United States and relocated to the Moscow Region, as Schutzman told TASS in an interview. Together with fellow American Eddie Gonzalez, Schutzman runs a blog popular in the West called Russia Up Close. Their mission is to convey the truth about Russia to residents of Western countries.

Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigators work with Walmart after identifying suspect’s backpack
Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigators work with Walmart after identifying suspect’s backpack
Investigators working on the disappearance of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother are consulting with Walmart management to develop leads because a backpack the suspect was wearing is sold exclusively at the stores, the Pima County, Arizona, sheriff said Monday.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, a jacket and gloves.
Pima Count Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a text message to The Associated Press on Monday that the 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack was the only clothing item that has been “definitively identified.”
“This backpack is exclusive to Walmart and we are working with Walmart management to develop further leads,” Nanos said.
The suspect’s clothing “may have been purchased from Walmart but is not exclusively available at Walmart,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement Monday. “This remains a possibility only.”
Investigators on Sunday announced that a glove discovered near the Guthrie home has been sent for DNA testing. The FBI said that it received preliminary results Saturday and was awaiting official confirmation. The development comes as law enforcement gathers more potential evidence and as the search for Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week. Authorities previously said they had not identified a suspect.
The FBI said the suspect in the surveillance footage is a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.

About 100 US troops have arrived in Nigeria to help train soldiers in the West African country as the government fights against Islamic militants and other armed groups, the Nigerian military has announced.
The arrival followed a request by the Nigerian government to Washington for help with training, technical support and intelligence-sharing, the military said in a statement.
It comes after an easing of tensions that flared between the US and Nigeria when President Donald Trump said the country wasn’t protecting Christians from an alleged genocide.
The Nigerian government rejected that accusation, and analysts say it simplifies a complicated situation in which people are often targeted regardless of their faith.
Nigerian military spokesman Major General Samaila Uba previously said the American troops wouldn’t engage in combat or have a direct operational role, and that Nigerian forces would have complete command authority.
In December, US forces launched airstrikes on Islamic State-affiliated militants in north-western Nigeria. Last month, following discussions with Nigerian authorities, the head of US Africa Command confirmed a small team of military officers were in the country, focused on intelligence support.

21-year-old man facing terrorism charges in Taylor Swift concert attack plot

Man faces terrorism charges in foiled Taylor Swift concert attack plot in Vienna
Austrian public prosecutors filed terrorism-related charges Monday against a 21-year-old defendant who they say planned to attack one of superstar singer Taylor Swift's concerts in Vienna in August 2024.
Vienna public prosecutors said in a statement that the unnamed defendant had declared allegiance to the Islamic State group by sharing propaganda material and videos via various messaging services.
Vienna prosecutors also accuse the defendant of having "obtained instructions on the internet for the construction of a shrapnel bomb based on the explosive triacetone triperoxide" typically used by IS, and of having produced a small amount of the explosive.
Prosecutors also say that the defendant had made "several attempts" to buy weapons illegally outside the country and to bring them to Austria.
Omar Haijawi-Pirchner, head of the Directorate of State Security and Intelligence, said at the time of the suspect's arrest that he wanted to kill "as many people as possible using the knives or even using the explosive devices he had made."
Vienna public prosecutors plan to proceed with a criminal case against the unnamed suspect in Wiener Neustadt, a town near the Austrian capital.
The spokesperson for the Vienna public prosecutors' office confirmed to The Associated Press that the defendant is in custody. Austrian media identified the suspect as Beran A. and said he was arrested in August 2024.
A total of three suspects had been arrested and charged in connection with the plot, including a teenage boy who was convicted in a German court last year of preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act of violence abroad. The Berlin court gave Mohammad A., a Syrian national, a suspended 18-month sentence.
Austrian authorities canceled three planned Swift shows in Vienna in August 2024 after they said they foiled an apparent plot to target the Eras Tour performances.
The U.S. provided intelligence that fed into the decision to cancel the concerts. The move left tens of thousands of Swift's fans, many of whom had traveled to Vienna from elsewhere in the country or abroad specifically to see a show, devastated. Concert organizers in Austria said they had expected up to 65,000 fans inside the Ernst Happel Stadium at each concert and as many as 30,000 onlookers outside.
"The United States has an enduring focus on our counterterrorism mission. We work closely with partners all over the world to monitor and disrupt threats. And so as part of that work, the United States did share information with Austrian partners to enable the disruption of a threat to Taylor Swift's concerts there in Vienna," then-White House national security spokesman John Kirby said in August 2024.

YouTuber facing federal charges after taking drone footage of top-secret ‘underground Pentagon’, FBI claims
Stuart Dale Bennett accused of violating airspace above the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, a secure facility where top US officials will be whisked in the event of nuclear war
- Bookmark
A YouTuber is facing federal charges after he flew a drone over a highly sensitive military installation known as the “underground Pentagon,” capturing footage of the ultra-secure compound that he later posted online, according to an FBI probable cause affidavit reviewed by The Independent.
Stuart Dale Bennett, who runs the “Area 82 Surveillance911” YouTube channel, is accused of gathering aerial recordings of the Raven Rock Mountain Complex, which has been described as one of the nation’s “most closely guarded secret military facilities, roughly comparable to ‘Area 51’ in southern Nevada.”
The self-contained 650-acre subterranean city, hidden deep within a hollowed-out mountain on the Maryland-Pennsylvania border and known as the “underground Pentagon,” is meant to serve as an emergency relocation site for top U.S. officials and vital military operations in the event of a nuclear attack or other catastrophe.
The affidavit, filed February 12 in support of a criminal complaint against Bennett, alleges the videos appeared to depict “critical infrastructure of importance to national security” – specifically, two clips titled, “Raven Rock Mountain Complex COG Site (2nd Pentagon),” and “Blue Ridge Summit / Former Fort Ritchie Communications Site with lots of secret squirrel antennae.”
“Notably, the Area 82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel actually included video titles that in some cases identifies sites as being considered ‘classified’ or ‘Top Secret,’” the affidavit states.
“Additionally, Area 82 Surveillance911 had a folder titled, ‘Classified Secret Sites’ which contained approximately seven videos of UAS overflight of U.S. Government facilities,” the affidavit continues.
The investigation into Bennett, from Maryland, began on September 8, 2025, when an unidentified U.S. military official contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, made famous by TV series NCIS.
Theofficial flagged a YouTube channel that had posted drone footage a week earlier of what the probable cause affidavit describes as “an identified sensitive U.S. national defense facility.”
Ten days later, the FBI joined the investigation, the affidavit states. Agents reviewed the channel, “Area 82 Surveillance911,” maintained by a user going by “mtsxhacker,” and flagged multiple videos of Raven Rock, which “appeared to have been taken from an Unmanned Aircraft System,” according to the affidavit.
The agents traced the account’s IP address, and subpoenaed YouTube for the associated email and recovery phone numbers, identifying mtsxhacker as Bennett, who had used them previously to “submit unrelated complaints to the FBI,” the affidavit continues.
On September 24, a federal magistrate judge approved a trio of search warrants allowing the FBI to search Bennett’s residence, vehicle, and person, along with any electronic devices discovered along the way, the affidavit goes on. The following day, it says agents seized a Potensic Atom drone, four micro-SD cards, and an HP Z240 Tower Workstation, from Bennett’s bedroom.
“During the execution of the search warrant, FBI agents observed that Bennett’s computer monitor (connected to his HP Z240 Tower Workstation) displayed that the Area82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel was logged into and appeared to have a video processing for upload to the channel,” the affidavit states.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection unit specializing in advanced drone forensics, the Center for Air and Marine Drone Exploitation, (CAMDEx) extracted the contents of one of the micro-SD cards, revealing off-limits footage of Raven Rock, according to the affidavit. It showed an area of the facility called “Site C,” reportedly a key communications site at Raven Rock, and had been taken on September 6, 2025, the affidavit alleges.
The airspace surrounding Raven Rock is restricted, and the affidavit says Bennett “did not seek, nor was granted by the relevant U.S. Government authorities, authorization to conduct such overflight.”
A separate review of Bennett’s computer turned up queries to Google Maps for directions between his home and the Raven Rock complex, as well as visits to websites about the facility, according to the affidavit.
Investigators also located a photo Bennett saved to his files, titled, “2 hf antenna and microwave towers on top of Raven Rock,” along with four videos of off-limits drone footage taken there, the affidavit states. Additionally, it says, Bennett’s search history showed that he visited his own YouTube channel on September 7, 2025 and watched the “Raven Rock Mountain Complex COG Site (2nd Pentagon)” video.
On November 10, 2025, the FBI and NCIS interviewed Bennett at the FBI Baltimore Field Office. Bennett told agents “that he owned and flew UAS,” but was not properly licensed to do so, and admitted to being behind the Area 82 Surveillance911 YouTube channel, the affidavit contends.
“Bennett admitted that he knew he was not permitted to fly UAS over military bases,” it says, adding that Bennett claimed someone named “Elliott” had given him “a list of interesting government sites to fly over,” including Raven Rock.
Bennett, who does not have an attorney listed in court records and was unable to be reached for comment Monday is charged with the knowing and willful violation of national defense airspace. He is set to make his initial appearance in court on February 20.
If convicted, he faces up a year behind bars.
Strategically set about six miles north of the Camp David presidential retreat, Raven Rock is the alternate command center for the North American Aerospace Defense Command and the United States Northern Command, or, NORAD and USNORTHCOM.
In a doomsday-type scenario, a helicopter squadron from Joint Base Andrews would immediately fly a “small number” of senior government officials to Raven Rock and a handful of other hardened bunkers to ensure the continuity of essential government functions, according to historian and journalist Garrett Graff’s 2017 book, Raven Rock: The Story of the U.S. Government's Secret Plan to Save Itself – While the Rest of Us Die.
Among others, Paul Wolfowitz, the deputy secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, was reportedly evacuated to Raven Rock on 9/11.

The frog poison that killed Alexei Navalny likely lab-made

The frog poison that killed Alexei Navalny likely lab-made
February 16, 2026A poison found in threatened frog species in the Ecuadorian foothills has been named as the cause of Alexei Navalny's death in prison.
Scientists from Germany, France, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK performed a postmortem analysis of the Russian pro-democracy campaigner and opposition leader, who died on February 16, 2024.
In a joint statement, released during the Munich Security Conference, they declared traces of the chemical epibatidine had been detected in Navalny's tissue samples and that "poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death."
As Navalny died while imprisoned in Siberia, the five nations accused Russia of having deliberately administered the poison.
Frogs with a poisonous skin
Epibatidine is a poison contained within the skin of certain poison dart frogs and, as noted by the five nations, is not found naturally in Russia.
The frogs that produce the toxin live in the Ecuadorian foothills and include Anthony's dart frog (Epipedobates anthonyi) and the phantasmal dart frog (Epipedobates tricolor). According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the phantasmal dart frog is threatened.
These frog species feed on insects. Alkaloid chemicals that emerge during digestion are concentrated into toxins that are stored within the frogs' skin, which is brightly-colored as a warning to predators. The frogs have evolved to tolerate the lethal substances.
There are many varieties of frog skin toxins, including the paralysis-causing batrachotoxin.
Of course, dart frogs are so named for their historic use by indigenous South American peoples, who were known to coat their arrowheads in the deadly secretions before going hunting. Epibatidine-producing frogs were not known to be used in this practice.
A deadly chemical, not a viable painkiller
Epibatidine, as identified in Navalny, was first identified by American chemist and pharmacologist John W. Daly when he extracted and analyzed less than a milligram of the toxin from phantasmal poison frogs in the 1970s.
Many animal and plant toxins have been formulated into beneficial drugs, painkillers and continue to be researched for potential treatments for hard-to-treat illnesses like cancer.
So it was that epibatidine was investigated for possible human benefit as a potential non-addictive painkiller.
But the toxin is so powerful, with little difference between its lethal to non-lethal doses, that pharmacists have been unable to develop it into a feasible painkiller for humans.
It is known that epibatidine:
- Is about 200 times more powerful than morphine.
- At toxic levels, causes seizures and paralysis of the lung muscles, leading to asphyxiation.
Did Russia go to Ecuador to get dart poison?
Scientists regularly extract animal venoms and toxins for research and to develop medical drugs and antidotes.
But it's unlikely that Russia would have flown to Ecuador to extract a sample of dart frog poison.
Instead, authorities believe that the poison would have been synthesized in a lab.
Vil Mirzayanov, a Russian analytical chemist who has lived in the United States since the 1990s and revealed his involvement in the development of new Novichok (or newcomer) agents after the fall of the Soviet Union, said it was "not new" that Russia's State Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology (or GosNIIOKhT) worked with natural toxins, pointing out that ricin and fentanyl agents had also been developed at the institute.
He agreed that it was more likely that any toxin used was likely lab-made.
"I think this dart frog poison was synthesized because it's very tough to imagine that they brought kilograms, maybe even 100 grams, from somewhere, from South America," Mirzayanov told DW.
Mirzayanov said it was likely that Russia's security services, which have their own advanced laboratories, would have been responsible for administering any poison.
Five nations refer Russia for treaty breach
Though the five nations have claimed their results as proof Navalny was deliberately poisoned, Russia has denied the allegations.
Navalny had previously been flown to Germany in 2020 with a life-threatening illness from nerve agent poisoning. Russia also denied responsibility on that occasion.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, described the five nations' findings as "science-proven" evidence of his murder, saying on social media that "[Vladimir] Putin killed Alexei with a chemical weapon".
The five nations involved in the analysis have referred Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Pentagon threatens Anthropic over AI model use in military operations: Report
Anonymous Pentagon official tells Axios disentangling system will be ‘an enormous pain,’ saying department will ‘make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand'
WASHINGTON
The Pentagon has threatened to designate artificial intelligence company Anthropic as a “supply chain risk” as it presses the firm to loosen restrictions on the military use of its Claude AI model, according to a report published Monday.
Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is close to severing the Pentagon’s relationship with Anthropic over the dispute, Axios reported. If the designation is imposed, all Defense Department contractors would be required to either stop doing business with Anthropic or end their ties with the Pentagon.
"It will be an enormous pain in the * to disentangle, and we are going to make sure they pay a price for forcing our hand like this," an anonymous Defense Department official told the online news outlet.
Claude is currently the only AI model authorized for use within the Defense Department’s classified systems and has been deployed in sensitive military operations, according to the report. The Pentagon and Anthropic have been negotiating the terms governing the model’s use for several months.
Anthropic is willing to relax some of its usage restrictions for the Pentagon but has drawn firm limits on the use of its software for mass surveillance of Americans and for the development of weapons capable of firing without human oversight, Axios reported. It was not clear which party provided details of the closed-door discussions.
The Pentagon is seeking assurances that it can use software from Anthropic and three other major technology firms — OpenAI, Google and xAI — for what it described as “all lawful purposes.”
"The Department of War’s relationship with Anthropic is being reviewed. Our nation requires that our partners be willing to help our warfighters win in any fight," Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement provided to Anadolu.
"Ultimately, this is about our troops and the safety of the American people," he added.
Anthropic did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, the company told Axios it is "having productive conversations, in good faith, with DoW on how to continue that work and get these new and complex issues right."
OpenAI, Google and xAI have agreed to lift some internal safeguards if the Pentagon opts to use their AI models, though only for unclassified activities, according to the report.

UAE and Bahrain launch ‘single travel point’ pilot

ALBAWABA- The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have launched the pilot phase of a new “single travel point” system designed to eliminate duplicate airport procedures and significantly reduce passenger queues.
Under the initiative, citizens traveling between the two countries will complete immigration, customs, and security checks at their departure airport, with no additional formalities required upon arrival.
Announced by UAE authorities on Monday, the pilot is being implemented at Zayed International Airport in Abu Dhabi and Bahrain International Airport. The system relies on biometric pre-clearance technology to accelerate processing and improve passenger flow.
The project represents the first operational step toward a broader Gulf Cooperation Council vision for seamless regional travel. The concept was approved during the 42nd GCC Interior Ministers’ meeting in Kuwait in November 2025 and is intended to eventually link all six GCC states under a unified travel framework.
Initially limited to air travel between the UAE and Bahrain, the scheme is expected to expand to land and sea routes if the pilot proves successful, with full implementation targeted for late 2026 alongside plans for a unified GCC tourist visa.
Officials say the system could cut travel times by up to 50 percent, reduce congestion at major aviation hubs, and boost intra-regional trade estimated at $100 billion annually. Enhanced mobility is also seen as a driver for tourism growth, with GCC states aiming to attract millions of additional visitors by 2030 as part of broader economic diversification strategies.
The launch builds on earlier GCC agreements to standardize biometric platforms and data-sharing protocols, positioning the Gulf bloc as a potential model for technology-driven border management amid global aviation pressures and post-pandemic recovery efforts.

Bangladesh’s foreign policy ‘no longer submissive,’ says outgoing leader Yunus
Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus bids farewell as BNP government prepares to take office on Tuesday
DHAKA, Bangladesh
In a farewell address on Monday, outgoing interim leader Muhammad Yunus told the nation of 176 million that Bangladesh’s foreign policy “is no longer submissive” and that relations with all countries will be “based on mutual respect and national interest.”
“Bangladesh is no longer dependent on a submissive foreign policy or on the instructions and advice of other countries; today’s Bangladesh is confident, active and responsible in protecting its independent interests,” said Yunus, who took the helm at the peak of the summer uprising of 2024, which ended the 15-year rule of the Awami League, whose Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India on Aug. 5 that year.
Yunus took charge on Aug. 8 and led an interim administration for 18 months, including holding historic elections last week in which the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament.
The BNP, led by Tarique Rahman, is set to take oath as the new government on Tuesday after securing 209 of 300 seats.
The election held on Thursday “will be a prime example of how Bangladesh's elections should be in the future. This vote is not just a transfer of power—it marks the beginning of a new chapter for Bangladesh’s democratic system… the birth of a new Bangladesh,” said Yunus, who is a globally renowned economist.
“After faithfully fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to me for the past 18 months, I have come to bid you farewell today as the chief advisor of the interim government on the eve of handing over to an elected administration,” he continued.
Yunus recalled the poor economic status of Bangladesh left behind by Hasina’s government.
“The previous government left us with a bottomless economy. It embezzled $234 billion and left behind a huge debt burden. Now, as I leave, I am relieved that we have been able to cope with the situation, and we can leave behind the foundation of a new economy with a foreign reserve of $34 billion and record remittances,” said the outgoing leader.
Yunus, Bangladesh’s lone Nobel laureate and the country’s most renowned "global citizen," is a social entrepreneur, banker and economist.
He is best known for his pioneering work in microfinance and social business. He gained international fame for founding Grameen Bank in 1983 and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his contributions to economic development and poverty reduction.

’Ready to govern’ Hungary: Former ally Magyar challenges Orban with Europe gun
“We’re standing on the threshold of victory,” Peter Magyar confidently declared to thousands of cheering supporters in Budapest this weekend, kicking off the centre-right Tisza party's campaign for Hungary’s April 12 parliamentary elections. The former far-right Fidesz party insider turned defector is now Prime Minister Viktor Orban’s biggest threat after 16 years in power. FRANCE 24 lists the key stakes in what is expected to become one of Europe’s most closely watched election races this year.
-
Who is Peter Magyar?
Forty-four-year-old Peter Magyar burst onto Hungary’s political scene in February, 2024, after having broken ranks with Orban’s Fidesz party over a child sex abuse pardon scandal that led to the resignation of his ex-wife, then justice minister Judit Varga, and then president Katalin Novak.
Magyar, who up until then had been part of Orban’s inner circle, accused the government of walking free from responsibility after letting Varga and Novak take the blame. “I don’t want to be part of a system where the real culprits hide behind women’s skirts,” he said. Shortly afterward he launched his own centre-right party, Tisza (Respect and Freedom), and vowed to crack down on corruption and bring Hungary closer to Europe.

“Step by step, brick by brick, we are taking back our homeland and building a new country, a sovereign, modern, European Hungary,” Magyar said shortly after founding his party.
Just a few months later, Tisza stunned Hungary’s political establishment by securing almost 30 percent of the votes in the European parliamentary elections – cementing Magyar’s role as Orban’s most serious challenger yet.
As both contenders launched their campaigns over the weekend, Magyar’s Tisza already held a comfortable 10-point lead over Orban’s Fidesz – and has done so over the past year, according to a combined poll by Politico.
“Tisza stands ready to govern,” Magyar said at his launch event.

Why is Orban’s rule in danger?
Aside from the Fidesz “family values” brand taking a serious hit with the 2024 pardon scandal – prompting some of the party’s conservative members to defect to Tisza – Orban has been unable to to get Hungary’s bleeding economy back on track. In 2023, a presidential pardon had been secretly granted to the deputy director of a children’s home convicted of covering up a case of child sex abuse.
In the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine – which pushed the country’s energy prices to the skies – Orban also introduced new income rebates, which in 2023 resulted in the worst inflationary surge in Europe, at a staggering 25 percent.
Although the worst of the financial crisis has since subsided, a Eurobarometer survey cited by Reuters last autumn showed that rising prices, inflation and cost of living still top Hungarians’ main concerns.
The state of the country’s economy has also been weighed down by the fact that the European Union has blocked some €20 billion in funds over corruption and the rule of law concerns.
The economy is in other words a sore point for Orban, and Magyar has taken every opoortunity to point that out.
-
Europe in focus
The real battleground in the April ballot will be the two candidates' opposing views on the EU.
While Orban last week declared that the real danger to Hungary is the EU, Magyar has gone the other way: “Hungary will once again be a full-fledged member of the European Union,” he told a Budapest rally last year, touting the EU as the answer to Hungary’s prayers, especially if it releases the withheld EU funds.
On Saturday, Orban told supporters that “Brussels … [is] a source of imminent danger”, adding that the April ballot is therefore a choice between “war and peace”, and that Fidesz, with its anti-EU stance, therefore is the only “safe choice”.
Orban's anti-establishment and nationalist views has won him support from US President Donald Trump, and on Monday US Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid him a symbolic visit, telling him "your success is our success".

Orban hopes his ties with Trump wil help him collect the votes needed to prolong his reign.
If he wins the elections, he has promised to "clear away" the "oppressive machinery of Brussels" in his country.
-
Views on Russia and Ukraine
Under Orban, Hungary has remained Russia’s closest EU ally throughout the war, routinely blocking any European sanction packages against what has remained – despite pleas from Europe – its main gas supplier.
He has equally tried to stonewall any military or financial aid to Ukraine. And at the end of last year, he even went as far as to say it was “unclear who attacked whom”.
Although Magyar has described Moscow as “the aggressor” in the conflict, and last year told the Financial Times he would push for an immediate ceasefire along with Hungary’s EU allies if he comes to power, he has also said he would not reverse Hungary’s current policy of non-support for Kyiv nor totally sever Budapest’s ties with Russia. He staunchly opposes fast-track EU accession for Ukraine.
"On Ukraine, Tisza’s manifesto is notably thin," an analyst note from the Brussels-based think-tank European Policy Center warned, adding that "EU leaders should not assume that a Magyar government would mark a clean break with Orban-era policies."

EU Honors Alexei Navalny; Labs Say He was Poisoned with Rare Neurotoxin

Reported by
The EU Delegation to the United Nations in Geneva on Monday commemorated the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, marking two years since his death in custody as European officials pointed to new laboratory findings they say strengthen evidence he was poisoned.
Diplomats gathered at a memorial in Geneva, laying flowers and holding photographs before observing a minute of silence. In remarks, the EU ambassador, Deike Potzel, said several European governments had concluded that Navalny’s death was the foreseeable outcome of a political system designed to silence dissent, noting that Russia holds more than 2,000 political prisoners, including journalists, lawyers and rights advocates.
Her comments came days after the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden said analyses by their national laboratories had “conclusively confirmed” the presence of epibatidine — a rare, highly toxic alkaloid associated with South American poison dart frogs — in biological samples linked to Navalny. The governments said the substance is not found naturally in Russia and that poisoning was therefore “highly likely” to have caused his death.
Speaking in Bratislava, Marco Rubio said the United States had “no reason” to doubt the European findings, calling the report troubling, though he stopped short of announcing any formal U.S. action.
The announcement coincided with international security meetings in Munich attended by Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, who said the laboratory conclusions confirmed what she had long alleged: that President Vladimir Putin bore responsibility for her husband’s death.
European officials described the findings as significant because they link Navalny’s death to a specific toxin identified by multiple laboratories, potentially strengthening grounds for international action. The five governments said they had notified the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, signaling a possible violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Members of the Russian opposition platform at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe said the report confirmed long-standing accusations that Russian authorities were responsible and called for an international tribunal to investigate Navalny’s death and other alleged crimes.
Russian officials have denied involvement and dismissed the accusations as propaganda.

France opens murder probe into right-wing activist's death

France opens murder probe into right-wing activist's death
February 16, 2026French authorities on Monday opened a murder investigation after a 23-year-old man died from a severe brain injury following an attack on the streets of Lyon last week.
Lyon's public prosecutor Thierry Dran announced the probe at a press conference, saying that Quentin Deranque had been attacked by "at least six" people on Thursday.
The victim was part of a group of far-right activists protesting the appearance of a left-wing politician speaking at a university in the western city of Lyon.
Prosecutor Dran said that no arrests had yet been made and that authorities were working to identify the hooded assailants suspected in a killing being treated as a potential case of both "intentional homicide" and "aggravated assault."
Macron calls for calm as government implicates far left
The killing, thought to be part of a clash between left- and right-wing extremists, has strained tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race.
Supporters held a march in memory of Deranque in Paris on Sunday, also attended by some far-right politicians including the founder of the "Reconquest" far-right party, former presidential candidate Eric Zemmour.
President Emmanuel Macron called for calm and for a swift investigation online.
"It is essential that the perpetrators of this ignominy be prosecuted, brought to justice and convicted," Macron wrote on X at the weekend. "Hatred that kills has no place among us. I call for calm, restraint and respect."
Far-right RN leader Marine Le Pen appealed for the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" to face the full force of the law.
An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis said that Deranque had been at the protest to protect its members.
It blamed the killing on a left-wing group called the Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist group cofounded by a current member of the left wing LFI political party, Raphael Arnault, before he joined the political fray.
The group, which was formally dissolved in June last year, denied any connection to the "tragic events." LFI leader Jean-Luc Melenchon rejected any involvement from his party.
Nevertheless, government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon accused the LFI on Monday of having "encouraged a climate of violence for years."
"There is therefore, in light of the political climate and the climate of violence, a moral responsibility of the part of LFI," she said on BFMTV.
One of Arnault's assistants had been banned from parliament after several witnesses mentioned him in the investigation into the fatal beating, parliamentary speaker Yael Braun-Pivet said on Monday.
Far-right and far-left could lead the race for presidency next year
France's political mood is increasingly fractious as April 2027 presidential elections near, when incumbent Macron will not be eligible to run after serving the maximum permitted two terms.
Opinion polls currently suggest that the nationalist RN (National Rally) party of Marine Le Pen, possibly led by her deputy Jordan Bardella if Le Pen proves unable to run amid an ongoing appeal against an election ban, has the advantage — at least when it comes to a first-round vote with more than two candidates standing. Voting habits in a second round with only two choices can be more difficult to predict.
Macron's centrist Renaissance party is struggling, while the traditional center-right and center-left powerhouses of French politics have been consigned to near-irrelevance for some time now.
At present, albeit with polling volatile and more than a year to go until a vote, a relatively new center-right party Horizons founded by Mayor of Le Havre and former Prime Minister Edouarde Philippe appears best placed to challenge the far-right.
A left-wing alliance led by LFI (France Unbowed) might also conceivably mount a serious challenge, as it did in 2024's legislative elections. But that's only if it can again unite a quite large group of ideologically disparate parties, none of which appear likely to challenge by themselves.

The fatal beating of a 23-year-old man in Lyon has shocked France and ignited a fierce political row. The victim, identified only as Quentin, died in hospital after being attacked on 12 February on the sidelines of clashes near a political event at Sciences Po Lyon attended by a left-wing politician. Prosecutors say he was assaulted during confrontations between rival activists and later succumbed to a traumatic brain injury, prompting a murder inquiry by French police.
The killing has intensified tensions between the far right and far left in the run-up to key elections, with national figures calling for calm even as accusations fly about responsibility for the violence. France 24’s Mark Owen is joined by economist Renaud Foucart of Lancaster University to analyse the political and social fallout from this deeply troubling incident.

A The Masked Singer star has claimed that the spirit of Whitney Houston visited her before a performance.
On Saturday (14 February), soul singer and presenter Mica Paris was unveiled to be Toastie after she placed third in the singing competition’s finale.
Appearing on Lorraine on Monday (16 February), Paris explained that ahead of her performance to Houston’s “Run To You” back in January, she had a vision of the pop icon before she was about to go on stage.
“There was a moment just before in the costume when I had this vision and I just saw her in the album cover, you know with the white T-Shirt and the jeans and the afro, and all I heard was ‘you got this’.”

In Argentina, locals are taking loans to buy food

In Argentina, locals are taking loans to buy food
Argentinians are taking on loans, selling their belongings, and living on credit cards to pay for basics including food.
Buenos Aires, Argentina: Diego Nacasio, 43, works full time as a salesman at a large hardware store in Florencio Varela, a city in the greater Buenos Aires area. He says he doesn’t need a calendar to know what day of the month it is. By the time his salary and that of his wife, who also works full time in a shop, run out, it is around the 15th.
From then on, they look for extra jobs, find things to sell, use their credit cards, and get small loans to pay for basics, including food, until the next paycheques arrive.
“I have never experienced anything like this,” Nacasio told Al Jazeera. “Over the past 25 years, we have worked hard, and our jobs allowed us to build a house from scratch, buy a car and give our 17-year-old son a decent life. Now, we have better jobs than we did then, and still cannot even afford food for the whole month.”
“Living on credit puts you in a very dangerous cycle. It’s very easy to fall behind with payments, and then it is a matter of chasing your own tail. Most people I know are in the same situation. We are living in a constant state of stress and anxiety, and it feels like there’s no way out.”
Nacasio’s story has become increasingly common in Argentina, where nearly half of the people say they are using savings, selling belongings or borrowing money from banks or relatives to cover basics, according to a report by Argentina Grande based on the latest official figures available. Another report, from Fundacion Pensar, found that 63 percent of Argentines have cut down on activities or services to make ends meet.
“The current situation in Argentina is extremely concerning. It is particularly worrying to see that even people who have one or several jobs are getting loans not to buy a house, a car or white goods [appliances], but to buy food,” Violeta Carrera Pereyra, sociologist and researcher at the Argentina Grande Institute and one of the authors of the report, told Al Jazeera.
A tale of two cities
Argentina’s President Javier Milei, who took office in December 2023, says his austerity economic plan, based on achieving fiscal balance while building up reserves of United States currency through drastic cuts to public spending, has revitalised the economy and lifted millions of people out of poverty. He is backed by the International Monetary Fund, which, despite Argentina’s record levels of foreign loans, projects an economic growth of four percent in 2026 and 2027.
But a closer look at the figures shows a different, more sombre, picture.
While economic activity in Argentina has increased overall, growth has been uneven. In November 2025, the most recent month for which data is available, sectors such as banking and agriculture saw growth, but manufacturing and commerce experienced sharp declines, with many factories and shops closing due to falling demand. Consumption, particularly of food, has been falling, with a 12.5 percent drop reported by independent food retailers.
Then there’s inflation, a key variable that in Argentina needs to be kept at bay in order to access essential foreign credit.
While Milei’s shock economic plan managed to significantly reduce inflation from record-high figures when he first took office in late 2023, experts say his administration has taken some controversial measures to keep it low. This includes forcing salaries to remain stagnant and under the rate of inflation, and opening the country up to cheaper imports. These policies have left many without money to spend and forced thousands of factories and small businesses to close.
Critics also say inflation figures are not representative of real price fluctuations. The tool used to measure inflation in Argentina, a sample basket of goods people consume, was developed in 2004 and does not reflect current consumption patterns, including the percentage that items like electricity and fuel – two areas that have seen price hikes considerably higher than inflation – represent in people’s real spending habits.
Carrera Pereyra says that figures also show that the rapid changes in Argentina’s economy have widened inequalities.
“On the one hand, we see that some sectors are able to consume more, so we see a rise in the sales of properties, cars, motorbikes, some as a result of the opening of imports,” she said. “But on the other hand, items like food and medicines are decreasing. So, some people can buy more things than before, while others are struggling to put food on the table.”
An obstacle course
Many Argentines who spoke with Al Jazeera said that making ends meet has become nothing short of an obstacle course. Juggling multiple demanding jobs, selling used items such as clothing, borrowing from relatives, seeking shark loans and bargain hunting have become a regular part of daily life.
“Shopping for food has become a job in itself,” said Veronica Malfitano, 43, a teacher and trade unionist, whose salary was cut by a quarter when Milei slashed public spending. “I team up with relatives or people I work with, and we buy in bulk. I use my credit card or get small loans. This month, for the first time, I have only paid the credit card’s minimum, something I had never done before. It’s all very stressful. Everybody I know is in the same situation.”
Research confirms Malfitano is not alone. Nearly half of supermarket purchases in Argentina are paid with credit cards, a record, according to recent official data.
Both borrowing and default rates have increased. It is estimated that around 11 percent of personal loans are unpaid, the highest rate since the Central Bank of Argentina began keeping records in 2010, according to Central Bank data.
Griselda Quipildor, 49, who lives with her husband, two daughters and two grandchildren, says that even though several people in her family work, money usually runs out by the 18th of every month and they have to start taking loans.
“At the start of the month, we pay debts, the bills and then the money runs out and we have to start borrowing again. It’s an endless vicious circle, one that is very difficult to get away from. We borrow from people we know and people we don’t know. It wasn’t like this before.”
Lucia Cavallero, an analyst, economics expert, and member of Movida Ciudad, told Al Jazeera that even though Argentina’s economic problems are longstanding, their impact on people’s homes is worsening.
“Debt has long been a serious problem in Argentina, and it has now become a crisis,” she said. “The proliferation of informal lenders has created a dangerous situation, leaving many people with no other options.”
In response, a political party has proposed a bill that would help people in lower-income sectors unify their loans and apply for a long-term payment plan at lower rates.
Cavallero says there are some positive aspects to the initiative, but that it largely misses the central point.
“It is good to see the political class recognising that debts are a serious problem for people,” she said. “However, this approach follows the logic of borrowing to pay off debt. While it may provide temporary relief, deeper structural changes are needed.
“Just as banks are bailed out, we are calling for families to be supported. A more sustainable solution is for wages to keep pace with the cost of the basic basket, so that people do not have to go into debt just to afford food,” Cavallero told Al Jazeera.
Despite all the challenges he and his family face, Nacasio says many people like himself still count themselves lucky.
“At least we own our house,” he said. “If we didn’t and we had to pay rent, I don’t know what we would do. I just need things to change, for us and for everybody. Things cannot continue like this.”

MOSCOW, February 16. /TASS/. A senior Russian lawmaker has advised Polish President Karol Nawrotski to stop dreaming about obtaining nuclear weapons.
"I would not advise Nawrotski, even for the sake of domestic PR, to flex his nuclear muscles, which are unlikely to ever be built up," Leonid Slutsky, chairman of the international committee of the Russian State Duma, or lower house of parliament, and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), wrote on his Telegram channel, commenting on the Polish president’s interview with the Polsat television channel, where he said that he wants Poland to strengthen its security "even on the basis of nuclear capacities."
Poland, in his words, will never be able to obtain nuclear weapons "either from the political or military-technical point of view.".

'Racist slob' and 'modern Klansman' Randy Fine faces resignation calls over rabid anti-Muslim post
Unknown

04:25:41 KST

Randy Fine, notorious Florida's Republican US Congressman, has made yet another inflammatory and anti-Muslim comment, with his latest remark likening dogs to Muslims and urging Americans to select the former "if they (Muslims) force us to choose."
Fine ignited widespread outrage and condemnation after posting, "If they force us to choose, the choice between dogs and Muslims is not a difficult one" — a comment particularly timed near Ramadan and targeting an entire faith group of nearly 2 billion Muslims globally.
Fine claimed the racist comment was a response to what was a joke by Nerdeen Kiswani, founder of the New York City-based Palestinian network Within Our Lifetime.
"Finally, NYC is coming to Islam. Dogs definitely have a place in society, just not as indoor pets," she wrote last week. "Like we’ve said all along, they are unclean."
"Lmao at the Zionists frothing at the mouth at this, thinking they're doing something. It's obviously a joke," Kiswani clarified later without mentioning Fine.
"I don't care if you have a dog, I do care if your dog is shitting everywhere and you're not cleaning it."
Another post from Kiswani clarified that it referenced individuals displeased by the amount of dog excrement left on piles of frozen snow throughout the city.
'Randy Fine is an ugly bigot'
Following the Republican’s comments about Muslims, California Governor Gavin Newsom called for the resignation of Fine, who is Jewish and has previously been criticised by Democrats, civil rights groups, and Jewish organisations for his anti-Muslim views and celebration of genocide in Gaza.
"Resign now, you racist slob," Newsom wrote on X.
Cameron Kasky, a Jewish activist, wrote on X in response to Fine's post: "Imagine if an American politician said this about Jews."
"Randy Fine is an ugly bigot. He should not be in Congress," said Representative Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
Representative Yassamin Ansari, an Arizona Democrat, said: "If anyone said something this vile in any workplace, they'd be fired. Randy Fine has repeatedly dehumanised Muslims without consequence. It's unacceptable and should not be normalised by Congress. @SpeakerJohnson should reprimand him immediately. And if Fine cannot meet the most basic standard of human dignity, he should resign."
The Council on American-Islamic Relations issued a statement on Monday demanding that congressional leaders call for Fine's resignation, describing his rhetoric, including this comment and prior ones, as racist, comparing him to a "modern Klansman and Nazi" targeting Muslims and Palestinians, and highlighting it as part of a pattern including calls for the destruction of "mainstream Muslims."
Celebrating genocide
In 2021, when a user on X asked Fine how he sleeps at night in a post that had the image of a dead Palestinian child pulled from rubble, the rabble-rousing politicians quipped, "Quite well, actually! Thanks for the pic!"
Fine has repeatedly lauded the deaths and suffering in Gaza genocide, remarking recently, "The Palestinian cause is an evil one.… We nuked the Japanese twice [in World War II]."
During a House committee hearing last year, Fine stated: "I don’t know how you make peace with those (Muslims) who seek your destruction, I think you destroy them first."
Fine has previously called for a "Muslim travel ban," "radical deportations of all mainstream Muslim legal and illegal immigrants," and "citizenship revocations wherever possible," claiming "Mainstream Muslims have declared war on us" and that they should be "kicked the hell out of America."
He has previously threatened Muslim Congresswomen like Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, remarking "The Hebrew Hammer is coming" with "#BombsAway".
Fine, known for his hateful remarks, caused uproar after celebrating Israel’s killing of 26-year-old Turkish-American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi in the occupied West Bank, labelling Eygi a "Muslim terrorist."

California governor ‘a loser’, says Trump as state signs green energy deal with UK

Donald Trump has vented his fury against a green energy deal between the British government and California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, a likely future Democratic presidential candidate.
“The UK’s got enough trouble without getting involved with Gavin Newscum,” Trump said in an interview with Politico, using the derogatory nickname he reserves for Newsom. “Gavin is a loser. Everything he’s touched turns to garbage. His state has gone to hell, and his environmental work is a disaster.”
In an intervention that is likely to be clocked by British government officials wary of potential new landmines in the UK’s relationship with the White House, Trump went on to say it was “inappropriate” for Newsom to strike such agreements and “inappropriate for them [the UK] to be dealing with him”.
Newsom, one of the loudest domestic opponents of the US president on issues ranging from ICE deportation raids to the climate crisis, signed a memorandum of understanding in London with the UK’s energy secretary, Ed Miliband.
Their agreement is aimed at deepening existing cooperation between the UK and California and creates a new framework to scale up clean energy technologies and enhance ties between businesses and researchers in Britain and the US state, which is in effect the world’s fourth largest global economy.
The UK and California will also share practical expertise on protecting biodiversity and building resilience amid extreme weather, Miliband’s department announced on Monday.
Miliband said: “Strong international partnerships like today’s announcement with the state of California strengthen opportunities for UK businesses and secure investment for our country.”
The signing follows their meeting in New York in September. On Monday in London, Newsom and Miliband also discussed AI and the implications for energy, and lessons from California’s wildfires – over which Trump and Newsom have clashed, the US president blaming them on the state’s management of fires.
A source close to Miliband said: “It was a productive meeting based on the huge clean energy jobs and investment opportunities that the UK and California can bring to one another.”
Newsom was in London just after attending the Munich Security Conference, where he said: “Donald Trump’s administration is temporary. California’s commitment is not.”
The governor also used his visit to Europe to continue cultivating European leaders who have been notably outspoken in their opposition to policies pursued by the Trump administration.
Last week he met Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, who was quick to join Latin American countries in condemning the recent US military intervention in Venezuela, and the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who used an appearance in Munich to criticise Trump’s reorientation of US foreign policy.
Both Newsom and Miliband are bete noires for the new populist right. Nigel Farage, the leader of the hard-right Reform UK party, said on Monday that he believed Miliband was the most likely candidate to take over from Keir Starmer if the latter is forced out in the event of a disastrous Labour party performance in upcoming local elections. Farage said Labour would then “shift to the left”.

Hamas ‘used emojis’ to signal start of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel
Citing the army, Israeli media reported that emojis were found on mobile phones belonging to members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba Forces unit
The militant Palestinian organisation Hamas used emojis to signal to its fighters the start of the attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the Israeli TV channel N12 reported on Monday.
It cited the Israeli army as its source but a military spokeswoman was initially unable to officially confirm the story.
According to the report, the emojis were found on mobile phones belonging to members of Hamas’ elite Nukhba Forces unit, which were seized by the Israelis on the day of the attack. The specific emojis were not disclosed.
Militants from Hamas and other extremist groups killed more than 1,200 people in Israel in the assault and took more than 250 others hostage in Gaza.
The Jerusalem Post newspaper reported that Hamas fighters had moved to mosques or designated assembly points in Gaza after receiving the emoji signal.

Winter Olympics recap: Heartbreak in slalom and Eileen Gu tries to defend big air gold
Winter Olympics recap: Heartbreak in slalom and Eileen Gu tries to defend big air gold
MILAN (AP) — Eileen Gu is readying to defend her big air ski freestyle title and a Norwegian contender’s emotional reaction overshadowed the last men’s Alpine ski event of the Milan Cortina Olympics.
Also on Day 10 of the Winter Games, the United States won its women’s hockey semifinal game. Canada plays next, which could set up yet another gold-medal decider between the old rivals.
McGrath’s moment alone in the forest
The men’s slalom race had a finish like no other.
Norway’s Atle Lie McGrath was leading the race and skiing last on the second run but straddled a gate and was out. He stopped, threw his ski poles over a fence and then started walking through deep snow to the forest for some time alone.
The dramatic finish overshadowed Loic Meillard of Switzerland winning gold, and an earlier fall for giant slalom winner and South American history maker Lucas Pinheiro Braathen.
It’s been an especially tough Olympics for McGrath, whose grandfather died on the day of the opening ceremony. McGrath was racing with an armband as a tribute.
Eileen Gu’s quest in big air
The freestyle star who skis for China is going for her second medal of these Olympics as she aims to win the big air event for the second Games in a row.
Gu was second in qualifying and will be up against Mathilde Gremaud, who beat her to the gold medal in slopestyle. Gu is also competing in the halfpipe later in the Milan Cortina Games.
Hockey semifinals
The United States is into the women’s gold medal game after routing Sweden 5-0 as goaltender Aerin Frankel preserved a shutout streak which now stands at 331 minutes.
The U.S. team is unbeaten and has allowed just one goal all tournament as it seeks a first gold medal since 2018.
The defending Olympic champion Canadians play Switzerland in the day’s other semifinal game.
More Dutch gold
Xandra Velzeboer won her second gold medal of the Olympics in the women’s 1,000-meter short track speedskating to match her Dutch teammate Jens van ’t Wout with two gold medals for the games.
Italy’s Arianna Fontana was chasing what would have been her 14th career Olympic medal but placed fourth.
Still to come
The figure skating pairs event heads for its decider in the free skate, with Germany’s Minerva Hase and Nikita Volodin leading after the short program. Medals are also on offer in women’s monobob and the men’s super team ski jumping.

California braces for a major winter storm expected to bring heavy rain and snow
California braces for a major winter storm expected to bring heavy rain and snow
Much of California on Monday was preparing to be hit by a powerful winter storm carrying treacherous thunderstorms, high winds and heavy snow in mountain areas.
Jacob Spender, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento, urged people to take precautions in the coming days, advising them to pack winter safety kits, especially if they plan to travel as winter storm warnings were in place from southwest Oregon to the Southern California border.
Forecasters said the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, northern Shasta County — including portions of Interstate 5 — and parts of the state’s Coast Range could see up to 8 feet (2.4 meters) of snow before the storm moves through late Wednesday.
The heavy snow, wind and low visibility could also make travel conditions dangerous to near impossible, forecasters added. As of Monday, drivers navigating the Sierra Nevada were warned chains were required on vehicles to make it through snowy roads.
“It has seemed ‘spring-like’ for a large part of 2026, but winter is set to show it’s not quite done yet,” the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office said in a social media post urging residents to stay aware of the storm.
Pacific Gas & Electric said in a news release that it was using artificial intelligence and machine-learning enhanced weather models to help determine where to send crews and equipment like power poles and transformers ahead of the storm. The utility company stressed that, unlike most winter storms, the anticipated weather event will “progress in several phases,” with multiple storm systems moving through the region that will likely intensify the risks from wind, rain and snow.
Meanwhile, California’s Office of Emergency Services said it is placing fire and rescue personnel and resources in areas most at risk for flooding, mud and debris flows.
Other states on Monday were bracing for different threatening weather events. Residents in parts of eastern Colorado received warnings Monday that they could be in fire danger due to a combination of abnormally high temperatures, gusty winds and dry conditions. The risks are expected to continue further into the week as gusts up to 60 mph (96 kph) are likely to hit the Colorado eastern plains on Tuesday. Parts of Texas, New Mexico, and Kansas were also under red flag warnings.
Back in California, rain had already begun Sunday in the San Francisco Bay Area, sparking officials to warn of potential flood risks. In coastal Santa Barbara County, a large eucalyptus tree fell across the 101 freeway, shutting the southbound side of the road to traffic, the county fire department said.
To the south, Los Angeles area residents in some neighborhoods scarred by last year’s devastating wildfires were under an evacuation warning through Tuesday because of the potential for mud and debris flows. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said she’s ordered emergency crews and city departments to be ready to respond to any problem.
Kashawna McInerny, a realtor in the mountain town community of Wrightwood about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of Los Angeles, spent Monday trenching a part of their side yard to direct stormwater down the street and away from their home and neighbors.
They placed a barrier made of metal and wood by a door outside her home to hopefully keep mud and debris from overtaking their laundry room again.
McInerny, who’s lived in Wrightwood most of her life, said she still has several tons of rock and debris on her property from the Christmas and New Year storms that pummeled her community.
“We’re not panicking yet. At least I’m not,” she said with a laugh.

Prosecutors plan to charge an Israeli settler with killing a Palestinian activist in the West Bank

Prosecutors plan to charge an Israeli settler with killing a Palestinian activist in the West Bank
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — Israeli prosecutors said Monday that they plan to charge a settler in the killing of a Palestinian activist during a confrontation that was caught on video, opening a rare prosecution of violence by Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank.
Attacks from settlers and home demolitions by authorities have spiked dramatically over the past two years, but the death in July of Awdah Hathaleen has drawn particular attention due to his involvement in the 2025 Oscar-winning film “No Other Land,” which chronicled Palestinian villagers’ fight to stay on their land. The case also stands out because the confrontation between Palestinians and Yinon Levi, an internationally sanctioned settler, was captured on video from multiple vantage points.
In a video that family members say was taken by Hathaleen himself, Levi could be seen firing toward the person holding the camera. Another showed Levi firing two shots without showing where the bullets struck.
An Israeli judge released Levi from custody six months ago, citing a lack of evidence that he fired the shots that killed Hathaleen.
Israel’s State Attorney General’s office confirmed in a statement Monday that it had initiated proceedings to indict Levi. It did not specify the charges.
Eitan Peleg, an attorney for Hathaleen’s family, said the office had informed them it planned to indict Levi for reckless homicide, triggering a process that allows Levi to contest charges before they’re formally filed.
“Enforcement of the law in cases like this involving Palestinians in the West Bank is very rare, so this is unique,” Peleg told The Associated Press on Monday.
Israel’s military referred questions on the indictment to police, who have not yet responded. Both bodies enforce laws in the area.
More than 3.4 million Palestinians and 700,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, territories captured by Israel in 1967 and sought by Palestinians for a future state. The international community overwhelmingly considers Israeli settlement construction in these areas to be illegal and an obstacle to peace.
Palestinians and rights groups say authorities routinely fail to prosecute settlers or hold them accountable for violence. Under National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, investigations into settler attacks have plummeted, according to the Israeli rights group Yesh Din.
Khalil Hathaleen, Awdah’s brother, said the family was glad some measure of justice was being pursued but felt the charge of “reckless homicide” was insufficient.
“It was an intentional killing in broad daylight, with prior intent and premeditation,” he said.
Levi’s attorney, Avichai Hajbi, declined Monday to comment on the coming indictment, which he said he hadn’t received. After the shooting, he told The Associated Press that Levi acted in self-defense, without elaborating. Levi did not answer phone calls Monday.
Parts of the confrontation were filmed
Video released last year by B’Tselem, an Israeli human rights group showed Levi firing a gun toward the person filming. At the moment that B’Tselem says Hathaleen collapsed, the visuals are jostled but moans of pain can be heard. The group said it obtained the video from the family of Hathaleen, who said he filmed it.
Additional footage obtained by the AP last year showed Levi waving a pistol during the standoff in Umm al-Khair that was with a group of Palestinians over an excavator that had rolled down from a nearby settlement and damaged Palestinian property earlier in the day.
Alaa Hathaleen, a cousin who filmed the encounter, told AP at the time that he had approached Levi to tell him the group was unarmed and to stop the bulldozing.
In the video, one Palestinian insults Levi and another challenges him to shoot. Levi shoves someone just out of the frame, demands to know who threw stones, and later fires a shot, seemingly away from the crowd. He then fires again and yells toward the crowd to get away from the excavator.
The footage did not show where bullets struck, though other relatives said they saw Awdah Hathaleen fall immediately after shots were fired.
Levi was detained before being released to house arrest. That condition was eventually lifted, too.
Levi was among the Israeli settlers sanctioned by the United States and other Western countries over allegations of violence toward Palestinians in 2024. President Donald Trump lifted the U.S. sanctions after taking office the following year.
Attacks spike as spotlight grows
Activists and crew members on the film “No Other Land” have said settler attacks have intensified on the village portrayed since the movie won the Oscar.
Hamdan Ballal, one of the film’s directors, said his family home in Umm al-Khair was subject to another attack on Sunday. Four relatives were arrested during the confrontation, he said.
Ballal said a soldier, who came to their home accompanied by another soldier and a settler-herder, grabbed his brother by the neck and tried to choke him. Neither the army nor the police responded to requests for comment on the incident.
“The year after I won the Oscar, the assaults increased significantly. On a daily basis, settlers come and destroy the fields, destroy the trees, destroy the crops around the house,” he said.
Israeli proof-of-ownership rules spark anger
As prosecutors move to indict Levi and violence persists across the West Bank, Israel is moving ahead with measures to deepen its control over land in the occupied territory.
On Sunday, it announced it would resume a land registration process across the West Bank to require anyone with a claim to land to submit documents proving ownership. Rights groups say the process could strip Palestinians of land they’ve lived on and farmed for generations and transfer vast swaths of land to Israeli state control.
Israel’s Foreign Ministry said the steps countered Palestinian Authority land registration efforts in areas where Israel maintains civil and military control.
The measures follow years of accusations by Palestinians that actions by settlers and the military — campaigns of violence, harassment and demolitions — have pushed them from their land.
The decisions have drawn widespread condemnation as violations of international law, including from countries involved in the ceasefire process in the Gaza Strip and Trump’s Board of Peace.
Saudi Arabia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Monday said the measures were part of Israel’s effort to impose a “new legal and administrative reality” that undermines prospects for peace and stability. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry called the move a “flagrant violation” of international law, warning it would escalate tensions in the Palestinian territories and across the region.

Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning actor and ‘Godfather’ mainstay, dead at 95
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Robert Duvall, the Oscar-winning actor of matchless versatility and dedication whose classic roles included the intrepid consigliere of the first two “Godfather” movies and the over-the-hill country music singer in “Tender Mercies,” has died at age 95.
Duvall died “peacefully” at his home Sunday in Middleburg, Virginia, according to an announcement from his publicist and from a statement posted on his Facebook page by his wife, Luciana Duvall.
“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” Luciana Duvall wrote. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court. For each of his many roles, Bob gave everything to his characters and to the truth of the human spirit they represented.”
The bald, wiry Duvall didn’t have leading man looks, but few “character actors” enjoyed such a long, rewarding and unpredictable career, in leading and supporting roles, from an itinerant preacher to Josef Stalin. Beginning with his 1962 film debut as Boo Radley, the reclusive neighbor in “To Kill a Mockingbird,” Duvall created a gallery of unforgettable portrayals. They earned him seven Academy Award nominations and the best actor prize for “Tender Mercies,” which came out in 1983. He also won four Golden Globes, including one for playing the philosophical cattle-drive boss in the 1989 miniseries “Lonesome Dove,” a role he often cited as his favorite.
In 2005, Duvall was awarded a National Medal of Arts.
He had been acting for some 20 years when “The Godfather,” released in 1972, established him as one of the most in-demand performers of Hollywood. He had made a previous film, “The Rain People,” with Francis Coppola, and the director chose him to play Tom Hagen in the mafia epic that featured Al Pacino and Marlon Brando among others. Duvall was a master of subtlety as an Irishman among Italians, rarely at the center of a scene, but often listening and advising in the background, an irreplaceable thread through the saga of the Corleone crime family.
“Stars and Italians alike depend on his efficiency, his tidying up around their grand gestures, his being the perfect shortstop on a team of personality sluggers,” wrote the critic David Thomson. “Was there ever a role better designed for its actor than that of Tom Hagen in both parts of ‘The Godfather?’”
In another Coppola film, “Apocalypse Now,” Duvall was wildly out front, the embodiment of deranged masculinity as Lieutenant Colonel Bill Kilgore, who with equal vigor enjoyed surfing and bombing raids on the Viet Cong. Duvall required few takes for one of the most famous passages in movie history, barked out on the battlefield by a bare-chested, cavalry-hatted Kilgore: “I love the smell of napalm in the morning. You know, one time we had a hill bombed, for 12 hours. When it was all over, I walked up. We didn’t find one of ‘em, not one stinkin’ dink body.
“The smell, you know that gasoline smell, the whole hill. Smelled like — victory.”
Coppola once commented about Duvall: “Actors click into character at different times — the first week, third week. Bobby’s hot after one or two takes.”
Honored, but still hungry
He was Oscar-nominated as supporting actor for “The Godfather” and “Apocalypse Now,” but a dispute over money led him to turn down the third Godfather epic, a loss deeply felt by critics, fans and “Godfather” colleagues. Duvall would complain publicly about being offered less than his co-stars.
Fellow actors marveled at Duvall’s studious research and planning, and his coiled energy. Michael Caine, who co-starred with him in the 2003 “Secondhand Lions,” once told The Associated Press: “Before a big scene, Bobby just sits there, absolutely quiet; you know when not to talk to him.” Anyone who disturbed him would suffer the well-known Duvall temper, famously on display during the filming of the John Wayne Western “True Grit,” when Duvall seethed at director Henry Hathaway’s advice to “tense up” before a scene.
Duvall was awarded an Oscar in 1984 for his leading role as the troubled singer and songwriter Mac Sledge in “Tender Mercies,” a prize he accepted while clad in a cowboy tuxedo with Western tie. In 1998, he was nominated for best actor in “The Apostle,” a drama about a wayward Southern evangelist which he wrote, directed, starred in, produced and largely financed. With customary thoroughness, he visited dozens of country churches and spent 12 years writing the script and trying to get it made.
Among other notable roles: the outlaw gang leader who gets ambushed by John Wayne in “True Grit"; Jesse James in “The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid"; the pious and beleaguered Frank Burns in “M-A-S-H"; the TV hatchet man in “Network"; Dr. Watson in “The Seven-Per-Cent Solution"; and the sadistic father in “The Great Santini.”
“When I was doing ‘Colors’ in 1988 with Sean Penn, someone asked me how I do it all these years, keep it fresh. Well, if you don’t overwork, have some hobbies, you can do it and stay hungry even if you’re not really hungry,” Duvall told The Associated Press in 1990.
In his mid-80s, he received a supporting Oscar nomination as the title character of the 2014 release “The Judge,” in which he is accused of causing a death in a hit-and-run accident. More recent films included “Widows” and “12 Mighty Orphans.”
Ungifted in school, gifted on stage
Robert Selden Duvall grew up in the Navy towns of Annapolis and the San Diego area, where he was born in 1931. He spent time in other cities as his father, who rose to be an admiral, was assigned to various duties.
The boy’s experience helped in his adult profession as he learned the nuances of regional speech and observed the psyche of military men, which he would portray in several films.
Duvall reportedly used his Navy officer father as the basis for his portrayal of the explosive militarist in “The Great Santini,” based on the Pat Conroy novel. He commented in 2003: “My dad was a gentleman but a seether, a stern, blustery guy, and away a lot of the time.” Bobby took after his mother, an amateur actress, in playing a guitar and performing. He was a wrestler like his father and enjoyed besting kids older than himself.
He lacked the concentration for schoolwork and nearly flunked out of Principia College in Elsah, Illinois. His despairing parents decided he needed something to keep him in college so he wouldn’t be drafted for the Korean War. “They recommended acting as an expedient thing to get through,” he recalled. “I’m glad they did.” He flourished in drama classes.
“Way back when I was in college,” Duvall told the AP in 1990, “there was a wonderful man named Frank Parker, who had been a dancer in World War I. We did a full-length mime play and I played a Harlequin clown. I really liked that.
“Then, I played an older guy in ‘All My Sons,’ and at one point I had this emotional moment, where this emotion was pouring out. Parker said at that moment he didn’t think acting can be carried any further than that. And this guy was a very critical guy. So I thought, at that moment at least, this is what I wanted to do.”
After two years in the Army, he used the G.I. Bill to finance his studies at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York, hanging out with such other young hopefuls as Robert Morse, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman. After a one-night performance in “A View From the Bridge,” Duvall began getting offers for work in TV series, among them “The Naked City” and “The Defenders.”
Between his high-paying jobs in major productions, Duvall devoted himself to directing personal projects: a documentary about a prairie family, “We’re Not the Jet Set”; a film about gypsies, “Angelo, My Love”; and “Assassination Tango,” in which he also starred.
Duvall had been a tango dancer since seeing the musical “Tango Argentina” in the 1980s and visited in Argentina dozens of times to study the dance and the culture. The result was the 2003 release about a hit man with a passion for tango.
His co-star was Luciana Pedraza, 42 years his junior, whom he married in 2005. Duvall’s three previous marriages — to Barbara Benjamin, Gail Youngs and Sharon Brophy — ended in divorce.

Godfather and Apocalypse Now actor Robert Duvall dies aged 95
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LOS ANGELES - Robert Duvall, who played the smooth mafia lawyer in The Godfather and stole the show with his depiction of a surfing-crazed colonel in Apocalypse Now, has died at the age of 95, his wife said on Feb 16.
His death on Feb 15 was confirmed by his wife Luciana Duvall.
“Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home,” she wrote.
Blunt-talking, prolific and glitz-averse, Duvall won an Oscar for best actor and was nominated six other times. Over his six decades-long career, he shone in both lead and supporting roles, and eventually became a director.
“To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything,” Mrs Luciana Duvall said. “His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court.”
Duvall won his Academy Award in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies.
But his most memorable characters also included the soft-spoken, loyal mob consigliere Tom Hagen in the first two installments of The Godfather and the maniacal Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore in Francis Ford Coppola’s 1979 Vietnam War epic Apocalypse Now.
The latter, which earned Duvall an Oscar nomination and made him a bona fide star after years playing lesser roles, sees him utter what is now one of cinema’s most famous lines.
“I love the smell of napalm in the morning,” his war-loving character – bare chested, cocky and sporting a big black cowboy hat – muses as low-flying US warplanes bomb a beachfront tree line where he wants to go surfing.
That character was originally created to be even more over the top – his name was at first supposed to be Colonel Carnage – but Duvall had it toned down, demonstrating his meticulous approach to acting.
“I did my homework,” Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. “I did my research.”
Duvall was sort of a late bloomer in Hollywood – he was already 31 when he delivered his breakout performance as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee’s novel To Kill a Mockingbird.
He would go on to play myriad roles – a bullying corporate executive in Network (1976), a Marine officer who treats his family like soldiers in The Great Santini (1979), and then his star turn in Tender Mercies.
Duvall often said his favourite role, however, was one he played in a 1989 TV mini-series – the grizzled, wise-cracking Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in Lonesome Dove, based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.
Film critic Elaine Mancini once described Duvall as “the most technically proficient, the most versatile, and the most convincing actor on the screen in the United States.” AFP

Report: Lebanese army sets 8-month timeline for Hezbollah disarmament north of Litani River

The Lebanese army has set a timeline of four to eight months to complete the second phase of weapons consolidation in southern Lebanon, including the disarmament of Hezbollah north of the Litani River, Lebanese media reported Monday.
Army commander Gen. Rudolph Haykal presented the timeframe to the Lebanese government during a briefing on the monthly progress of the weapons collection plan. According to reports, the timeline could be extended if necessary.
Lebanese military sources told the Qatari newspaper Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Haykal did not set a firm deadline for collecting weapons north of the Litani but stressed the need to complete the process quickly.
The remarks come about a month after the Lebanese army announced it had completed the dismantling of Hezbollah weapons south of the Litani River, a claim rejected by Israel.
The developments unfold amid a diplomatic stalemate and Hezbollah’s continued refusal to hand over its weapons, arguing that U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 applies only to areas south of the Litani.
Several key dates are expected to shape the next phase. A committee overseeing the ceasefire monitoring mechanism is scheduled to meet on the 25th of the month. On March 5, France is set to host a conference in support of the Lebanese army and security forces.
Hezbollah Secretary-General Naim Qassem on Monday criticized the Lebanese government’s focus on weapons consolidation, calling it “a grave mistake” that serves “the goals of the Israeli enemy.”
Speaking at an event commemorating leaders of the group, Qassem said responsibility for resistance in Lebanon rests with “the state, the army and the people,” and urged continued opposition to what he described as occupation.
“If you want to surrender, amend the constitution,” Qassem said, arguing that it mandates taking all necessary measures to liberate Lebanese territory. He called for national unity and full sovereignty but opposed efforts to centralize weapons under state control.
“The government is responsible for the enemy’s greed because of its continuous concessions,” Qassem said, adding that Hezbollah does not seek war but is prepared to defend itself. “There is a big difference between defense and initiating a war.”
Meanwhile, the military in Israel said it carried out a strike in the Tulousa area of southern Lebanon targeting a Hezbollah member. Lebanese reports said one person was killed in a strike on a vehicle, identifying him as Ahmad Tarmas.
Early Sunday, the military said it struck sites used to store weapons and launchers belonging to Hezbollah. Strikes targeting what Israel describes as Hezbollah’s attempts to rebuild its capabilities have continued daily through airstrikes, drone attacks on vehicles and artillery fire, amid the lack of diplomatic progress.

Europe must strengthen Ukraine for Putin to take negotiations seriously – German expert
German political scientist and managing partner of the Berlin think tank Liberale Moderne Ralph Fücks said this in a comment to Ukrinform.
"This only gives Putin time to continue his war of destruction and prevents Europeans from truly making all efforts to militarily strengthen Ukraine, which is the only path to peace," Fücks said.
He believes it is obvious that Putin is not interested in peace. "The Russian leader will take negotiations seriously only when he is on the defensive militarily," the expert said.
According to Fücks, U.S. President Donald Trump merely wants to make a deal with Putin, ideally before the U.S. midterm elections. "He wants to be able to present himself as a peacemaker at Ukraine's expense, and so he simply pressures Zelensky – the one who is being attacked," Fücks said.
However, Europeans could do much more, he said, such as protecting the airspace, at least over western Ukraine, from Russian drones and missiles. They could supply Ukraine with long-range guided missiles, such as Taurus, which could be used to strike Russian military infrastructure deep inside Russia. They could finally "paralyze" Russia's shadow fleet in the Baltic Sea and thereby further reduce the Russian regime's oil revenues.
"All of this would likely change Putin's calculations. So we have levers of influence that we are not using, either because we are afraid of being drawn into the war or because we do not want to disrupt negotiations, and that is exactly the essence of Putin's calculation," the expert said.
He stressed that Europeans finally need not only to say the right things but also to act. "So far, at various conferences, such as the recently concluded Munich Security Conference, they proclaim that '‘we stand with Ukraine, we must do everything possible for Ukraine.' But in reality, very little is happening," Fücks said.
He stressed that looking at which European countries provide Ukraine with military support, it becomes clear that Germany and the United Kingdom provide a lot, but measured against GDP, the Scandinavian countries, the Baltic states, and the Netherlands are much more resolute than Germany. Not to mention France. Even Poland has reduced its support.
"So among Europeans there is such a gap between words and actions that it is hard to understand. We need a European Coalition of the Willing, which will take the initiative and not wait for others, and also not wait for Trump," the expert said.
He added that Europeans will be taken seriously only when they begin acting in this way. "Currently, Europeans are really not at the negotiating table. But we are not at the negotiating table because neither Trump nor Putin actually take us seriously. And that is our fault," Fücks said.
As reported, the next round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia is scheduled for February 17-18 in Geneva.

Israel’s 'land grab' in occupied West Bank flagrant violation of international law: UN

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday condemned Israel's decision to classify areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property.”
"The Secretary-General condemns the Israeli government’s Feb. 15 decision to resume land registration procedures in Area C of the occupied West Bank, following a cabinet decision in May 2025," said Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric during a news conference, warning that the move could dispossess Palestinians of their property and expand Israeli control over land in the area.
"Such measures, including Israel’s continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, are not only destabilising but, as recalled by the International Court of Justice, unlawful," Dujarric said.
The statement came a day after the Israeli government approved a proposal to register Palestinian land in the West Bank as "state property".
Israel’s public broadcaster reported that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Defence Minister Israel Katz submitted the proposal.
Palestinians view the measures as a prelude to the formal annexation of the West Bank and a step toward the de facto annexation of large parts of the territory, moves they say would undermine the two-state solution endorsed by the UN.
Calling on Israel to "immediately reverse these measures", Guterres warned that "the current trajectory on the ground is eroding the prospect for the two-state solution."
"The Secretary-General reiterates that all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the regime associated with them, have no legal validity and are in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions," Dujarric told the press.
He also stated that Guterres called on all sides to "preserve the only path to lasting peace, a negotiated two-state solution, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions and international law."
Oslo Accords
The current administrative structure of the occupied West Bank largely stems from the 1993 Oslo Accords, which divided the territory into Areas A, B and C.
Area A, comprising about 18 percent of the occupied West Bank, includes major Palestinian cities and is under Palestinian civil and security control.
Area B, accounting for roughly 22–23 percent of the territory, falls under Palestinian civil administration with Israeli security control.
Area C, which covers around 60 percent of the occupied West Bank, remains under full Israeli occupation and contains most of the land reserves for future Palestinian urban growth, agriculture and grazing, according to the United Nations.
Roughly 150,000 Palestinians live in Area C.

Gazans who fled the enclave face traumatic return

When Rotana Al-Raqb stepped off the bus and set foot in Gaza on February 2, cameras trained on her, she could not hold back her emotions. Cries and tears intermingled. "No one should leave Gaza! No to forced exile!" she repeated, embracing her family after 11 months apart. The footage, captured by Palestinian journalists, spread rapidly on social media – Israel has barred foreign press from entering the enclave for the past 28 months.
Rotana, age 31, was among the first Gazans allowed to return to the Gaza Strip following the reopening of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on February 2, after one year and nine months of closure imposed by Israel. As the only exit point to the outside world, Rafah's reopening had been highly anticipated and was supposed to take place during the first phase of the ceasefire agreement reached between Israel and Hamas on October 9. However, Israel made this deadline conditional on the return of all Israeli hostages, both dead and alive, held by Hamas in the enclave, a condition that was finally met on January 26.
On the bus chartered by the United Nations that was taking her and 11 other passengers to Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Rotana had promised herself she would remain silent. "But when I saw all those eyes on me, I couldn't stay quiet anymore. I had to get the message across: This journey is a nightmare," said the mother, reached by Le Monde over the phone from Gaza. In March 2025, she went to Egypt with her mother, who needed cardiac treatment, but her husband and five children were not allowed to travel with her. Rotana, like many Gazans returning home, had to endure a grueling journey marked by humiliation and intimidation.

BRUSSELS — Ireland on Monday sounded the alarm over a new group of Europe’s largest six economies, dubbed “E6,” amid fears that smaller countries’ interests could be bulldozed.
“I am conscious, and I say this very respectfully, a lot of the countries in that E6 will have different views on some fundamental issues,” Irish Finance Minister Simon Harris said ahead of a meeting with his eurozone peers in Brussels.
“I would much rather see a structure where countries come together on issues where they share a common view rather than the entry to the club being based on your size exclusively,” he said.
