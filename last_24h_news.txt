Weatherwatch: The surprisingly complex science of ice skating
2026-02-13 06:00:38 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/news/2026/feb/13/weatherwatch-science-how-ice-skating-works

Pressure, frictional heating and a disordered layer of molecules on top of the ice make skating possible
Ice skating is counterintuitive: why should a narrow blade make it easier to slide over the ice? The science is surprisingly complex, but unscientific people worked out the practical application a long time ago.
William FitzStephen described how Londoners entertained themselves in freezing conditions in 1173: “Crowds of young men go out to play on the ice. Some of them fit shinbones of cattle on their feet, tying them round their ankles … and are carried along as fast as a flying bird.”

Benjamina Ebuehi’s recipe for almond frangipane crepes | The sweet spot
2026-02-13 06:00:36 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/food/2026/feb/13/almond-frangipane-crepes-recipe-benjamina-ebuehi

Is it breakfast? Is it dessert? It doesn’t really matter, because this gooey-centred crepe is the perfect Pancake Day treat, whatever the time of day
When it comes to pancake day, I don’t discriminate and fill the day with as many types of pancakes as possible – from a fluffy American-style stack in the morning to a savoury buckwheat pancake at lunch, and finishing off with classic crepes in the evening. This version was heavily inspired by an almond croissant, so although it does lean more towards dessert, I won’t judge if this is what you choose to start your day with. Bake them until the edges go crisp but the middle stays a little gooey.

If you want to know what Reform would be like in power, look at how it threatened Bangor University | Gaby Hinsliff

A debating society didn’t want to invite two figures connected to the party to speak. Cue an authoritarian response
It must have seemed the easiest offer in the world to refuse. Would students at Bangor University enjoy a question-and-answer session with Sarah Pochin

it “drives me mad” to see TV adverts full of black people – and
Jack Anderton
, the 25-year-old influencer who helped send Nigel Farage’s TikTok account viral among teenagers? No, the university’s debating society decided, it would not.
And had it filed the request in the bin, you wouldn’t be reading this. Until now, Anderton’s A New Dawn campus tour
– a homage to the “debate me bro” style of the American rightwing activist Charlie Kirk,
killed last year
, who was famed for inviting
liberal students to take on his arguments and live-streaming the results – hadn’t exactly set the heather alight.

What Bangladesh’s New Leader Tarique Rahman Means for South Asia and the World
2026-02-13 06:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7378368/bangladesh-election-result-bnp-tarique-rahman-interview-takeaways/

Tarique Rahman had spent 17 years in exile before returning to Bangladesh on Christmas Day. Just seven weeks later, he looks set to become the South Asian nation’s new Prime Minister.
Polling indicates that Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is set to win an outright majority of around 185 seats in the 300-member legislature in Thursday’s general election, which is the first since the
ouster
of autocratic former Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina
on Aug. 5, 2024.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
TIME sat down with Rahman in early January as he laid out his plans for rebooting South Asia’s second biggest economy and healing social divisions. Asked what his first priorities would be, Rahman replied: “ensuring rule of law. The second one is to bring back financial discipline. The third will be to try to unify the country. Whatever political programs we have, whatever policies we take, if we cannot unify the country, it won’t be possible to take the country forward.”
Here are five takeaways from TIME’s
exclusive interview
with Bangladesh’s new leader.
Healing the nation
Up to 1,400 people were killed in the
July 2024 revolution
that toppled Hasina in addition to some 3,500 extrajudicially disappeared during the last 15 years of her despotic reign. Those wounds remain very raw, and Rahman will have to rebuild trust in institutions that were totally politicized by Hasina’s Awami League party, including the military, courts, civil service, and security services.
Violence targeting the Awami League and religious minorities broke out swiftly after the BNP-led coalition last took power in 2001, and Rahman—who has preached a message of unity and forsworn retribution since returning to the nation of 175 million—will have to work tirelessly to keep the peace.
“Vengeance will not bring [anything] back,” he says. “Rather, if we can control it, if we can keep everyone united, keep the country united, that might get us something good.”
Fixing the economy
Bangladesh was the Asia-Pacific’s fastest growing economy during Hasina’s last stint in power, with GDP rising from $71 billion in 2006 to $460 billion in 2022. But soaring costs, inequality, and youth unemployment saw resentment grow against her Awami League, which was banned from taking part in Thursday’s election.
Bangladesh’s woes have not improved much since Hasina’s ouster, with high inflation and a weak taka currency combining to erode real incomes for ordinary households. Some 2 million young Bangladeshis enter the workforce each year, though youth unemployment already stands at 13.5%. Declining foreign reserves have led to import restrictions that undermine energy supplies and the vital manufacturing industry.
With over 40 million Bangladeshis living in extreme poverty, one of the BNP’s flagship policies was monthly cash to women and the unemployed via a “Family Card,” although questions remain about how it will be funded.
Rahman also wants to boost connectivity to unleash the potential of young entrepreneurs to embrace the digital economy, while liberalizing the banking sector to allow them better access to international markets. In addition, he wants to upskill the roughly 1 million Bangladeshi migrant workers currently toiling overseas to allow them to seek better-paid jobs. “We can train them with languages and the other things they need to know,” he says.
Resetting relations with India and the U.S.
Bangladesh’s reliance on exports means improving relations with both regional superpower India and the top purchaser of Bangladeshi goods, the U.S., will take precedence. Ties with New Delhi soured following the toppling of Hasina, who was very close to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. In a sign of how bitter relations have sunk, in January star Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman had his Indian Premier League contract abruptly canceled, prompting Dhaka to ban broadcasts of the league in retaliation.
Still, there are indications that India is pragmatically prepared to work with the BNP, with Rahman meeting with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar in late December. However, many points of contention remain, including over Teesta River, with the BNP campaigning on signing the 1997 U.N. Water Convention to “claim a fair share of water.”
Rahman says many of the treaties between India and Bangladesh under Hasina contain “imbalances” that must be rectified to properly reset bilateral relations. “Of course, we are neighbors,” says Rahman. “Bangladesh’s interest, guarding the interest of our people, comes first, then we will try to take relations further.”
The Trump Administration, meanwhile, has also been critical of the interim government, whose leader, Nobel laureate
Muhammad Yunus
, is known to be a close friend of Hillary Clinton. While Trump initially imposed “reciprocal” tariffs of 37% on Bangladesh, Dhaka managed to negotiate that down to 20%, and earlier this week down again to 19% in exchange for Bangladesh opening its markets to a wider range of American goods. In addition, certain clothing and textile goods produced with American cotton and man-made textiles can enter the U.S. tariff-free.
It’s progress ,but Rahman has eyes on reducing the nation’s trade deficit to negotiate a further tariff reprieve—potentially by purchasing Boeing airplanes and U.S. energy infrastructure. “We can help each other,” Rahman said of Trump.
Managing rising Islamism
Other than the BNP, the other main beneficiary of Thursday’s election is the Bangladesh’s main Islamist party, Jamaat e-Islami, which has had its Hasina-era ban rescinded and looks on course to win the second most seats.
While Jamaat has the goal of Shari‘a law in its party constitution, it moderated its more radical rhetoric, focusing on social welfare and rebranding itself as “anti-fascist.” However, critics say a leopard can’t change its spots and
misogynic comments
from the party’s leader, Shafiqur Rahman, including denying the existence of marital rape, has made rights activists very nervous.
The fact that the BNP—which previously had an electoral alliance with Jamaat—appears to have won an outright majority means the Islamists’ clout will be restricted. But Jamaat will remain a significant force in the country going forward, and Rahman says it’s incumbent on all parties to work together toward a common good.
“It’s not only responsible of the BNP, but all the political parties in the country who believe in democracy, who believe in the voting rights of the people,” says Rahman. “We need to work together and unite so that we do not go back to before Aug. 5. We must go forward so that people can have the political rights.”
What of the students?
The revolution that toppled Hasina began with student-led protests against employment quotas for regime loyalists, though soon metastasized into an all-out revolt against state repression. Students remained at the forefront of the movement and were a key constituent of the interim government. However, the fact that the National Citizen Party (NCP) formed by student leaders entered into an alliance with Jamaat alienated many female and minority members.
From the heady days post-revolution, the student movement splintered, and the electoral dominance of the traditional parties has left many young people disillusioned—not least since women stood at the vanguard of the July revolution yet were largely sidelined in the reform process.
“I do believe there is hope for a genuine political alternative in Bangladesh,” says Tasnim Jara, a former NCP leader who quit and stood,
unsuccessfully
, as an independent in the Dhaka-9 constituency. “But it will not emerge overnight. It will come from citizens with professional integrity entering politics, staying principled under pressure, and building trust slowly at the local level. If that succeeds even in one constituency, it shows that the old guard is not the only future available to us.”
Rahman, for his part, says he is determined to honor the memory of those who gave everything for democracy: “We have a very, very strong responsibility to those people who lost their lives.”

Fighting the forces of nature in Reynisfjara
2026-02-13 05:32:47 GMT
https://www.ruv.is/english/2026-02-13-fighting-the-forces-of-nature-in-reynisfjara-466841/

Landowners in Reynisfjara are fighting the forces of nature after considerable coastal erosion on the beach.
Ívar Guðnason, farmer and landowner, explains what they're attempting.
We are trying to protect the viewing platform that we put up here, and the signs, and we have moved stones from the beach and placed them here to see whether that does anything... But we do not know whether it will be enough.
The works are entirely at the expense of the landowners, who handle all maintenance.
A huge amount has been eroded away and it will just continue if nothing is done.
To strengthen the foundations they are transporting the rocks that the sea moved during the easterly winds that have prevailed recently. Ívar says the large boulders rolled in the surf like small pebbles. The crashing sounds could be heard all the way back to the farms in Reynishverfi.
As can be seen on this map, the shoreline in Reynisfjara has changed considerably recently.
The blue line shows how far the beach extended last year, on 3 March.
The green line shows where the shoreline was only a month ago, on 7 January, and the yellow line shows the situation on 20 January.
The red line shows how the shoreline had moved much higher than before on 7 February, especially closest to Reynisfjall.
Source: Ingibjörg Jónsdóttir, Háskóli Íslands (University of Iceland) / Sentinel 2 / Copernicus EU
Ívar says it is uncertain whether the beach will return to its previous state.
These are unusual conditions and hopefully they will change, but nobody knows except God and luck... [but] This could change in two days.
Sigurður Sigurðarson, coastal specialist at Vegagerðin (Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration), believes the beach will recover when the wind turns westerly. Unusually persistent easterly winds have created the conditions on the beach.
Usually the sand moves from west to east, but over the past winter it has been the opposite, there have been much stronger easterly winds.
In most places in the country that does not matter much.
Sand moves some years to the east and then back to the west, back and forth... [but] No sand moves west of Reynisfjall. So the beach in Reynisfjara, which is under pressure to move it westwards, receives no sand from the east.
The beach is not closed, but while the works are under way tape has been strung along the route used by construction vehicles. “We are trying to keep people a little away from the work area. It works with varying success."

Country diary: Here be monsters – less than a millimetre long | Phil Gates
2026-02-13 05:30:34 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2026/feb/13/country-diary-here-be-monsters-less-than-a-millimetre-long

Stanhope, Weardale:
One of the best gifts I’ve ever received is a microscope. Sixty years on, it’s still a wonder to watch a mini rainforest in action
It was hard to resist running my fingers over the velvet carpet of moss that smoothed the drystone wall’s jagged capstones. Six months ago, after four heatwaves and prolonged drought, these same mosses resembled brown, wizened threads of dried tobacco. Today they were an inch-tall emerald forest again, studded with
yellow moss bell toadstools
, saturated with overnight rain.
Wall-top mosses are resilient, and so is the microscopic life that thrives on them. I collected a few soggy green cushions to investigate later, for “here be monsters”, though most are less than a millimetre long.

Présidentielle : pourquoi Retailleau accélère
2026-02-13 05:30:00 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/presidentielle-pourquoi-retailleau-accelere/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

Des entretiens au 20 heures de TF1, à LCI et au Figaro Magazine, à qui il a même donné quelques photos de son enfance : Bruno Retailleau n’a pas fait les choses à moitié pour annoncer sa candidature à l’élection présidentielle de 2027.  S’il dit vouloir “renverser la table”, plus qu’une course de fond, c’est une course de vitesse que le président de LR, qui peine à exister depuis son départ du gouvernement il y a quatre mois, veut mener, pour tenter de se remettre en selle face à ses concurrents à droite et au centre droit.
Acteur très en vue en tant que ministre de l’Intérieur pendant un an, il est redevenu, depuis, le spectateur impuissant des divisions du parti qu’il a conquis. Plusieurs de ses collègues sont ainsi restés au gouvernement contre son avis. Les députés LR n’ont pas censuré Sébastien Lecornu sur le projet de loi de finances jugé “invotable” par Retailleau.
Alors que, du temps où il était ministre, Retailleau, élu à la tête de LR avec un score de maréchal au mois d’avril, apparaissait de plus en plus comme le candidat naturel de son parti — bien qu’il ait
répété
par le passé “ne pas avoir ce virus” — son nom s’impose désormais avec moins d’évidence. Le Vendéen avait toutefois fait savoir aux siens, à Noël, que sa décision était prise.
Saut d’obstacles
Et tant pis si les adhérents des Républicains sont censés voter après les municipales sur les modalités de désignation de leur futur candidat (un groupe de travail dirigé par Gérard Larcher planche sur la question). Quelle que soit l’issue de ce feuilleton-là, les retaillistes sont confiants. Sur
LCI
, jeudi soir, le sénateur a assuré qu’il “se plier[ait]” au choix des militants, ajoutant, sûr de lui : “Et je gagnerai, d’ailleurs, si jamais il y avait une primaire [interne à LR].”
Sur sa droite, en sus, l’ambitieux Laurent Wauquiez, remis de sa défaite cinglante à l’élection interne, milite ouvertement pour une primaire plus large, allant de Gérald Darmanin à Sarah Knafo — une hypothèse que Retailleau écarte sur ce périmètre-là.
Alors qu’
en janvier
, l’hypothèse d’une déclaration après les municipales de mars tenait la corde, le Vendéen a donc choisi de ne pas attendre. Le président de LR sait bien que les municipales viendront, pour son parti, avec leur lot de “psychodrames” (dixit son entourage) dans l’entre-deux-tours, le plus souvent dûs à la tentation de certains élus locaux comme d’une partie des militants des Républicains de faire alliance avec l’extrême droite. Alors autant enjamber l’obstacle.
Que le meilleur gagne
Car Bruno Retailleau a par ailleurs du retard à combler face à Edouard Philippe, toujours bien installé en tête des sondages parmi les candidats potentiels du “bloc central”. Si son entourage n’écarte pas l’hypothèse d’une alliance, à terme, avec le président d’Horizons — avec qui
il a dîné la semaine dernière
, à la table du ministre de la Justice Gérald Darmanin — le Vendéen entend jouer crânement sa chance en attendant. Pour peser plus au sein de cet éventuel futur attelage, ou pour, au mieux, en devenir l’homme fort.
“L’objectif c’est d’être le plus vite possible devant [Philippe] dans les sondages de premier tour”, détaille un soutien du premier cercle. Et d’imposer ainsi un rapport de force, voire, dans ses rêves les plus fous, le dépasser d’ici au mois de septembre. Le plan ? Que les scores “soient suffisamment serrés” pour que Bruno Retailleau soit testé dans les sondages de second tour, d’ici là. Avec un espoir secret : faire la démonstration que, dans un duel, le Vendéen pourrait battre Jordan Bardella, le président du RN.
Autre raison d’accélérer : obliger Edouard Philippe et Gérald Darmanin à clarifier leur positionnement. Les retaillistes en effet n’envisagent pas d’alliance ou d’éventuelle primaire qui irait jusqu’au secrétaire national de Renaissance, Gabriel Attal, trop à gauche à leur goût. Ils espèrent donc bien forcer les deux ex-LR à choisir leur camp. D’où sa prudence, à ce stade : “On verra, on verra, je trace ma route”, a balayé le président de LR lorsqu’il a été interrogé jeudi soir, sur TF1, sur le meilleur moyen de le “départager” de ses concurrents directs.

Kremlin’s repeated targeting of infrastructure has left thousands without heating, reliant on shelters and desperate home hacks
Natalya Pavlovna watched her two-year-old son, Danylo, play with Lego. “We are taking a break from the cold,” she said as children made drawings inside a warm tent. Adults sipped tea and chatted while their phones charged. The emergency facility is located in Kyiv’s Troieshchina district, on the left bank of the Dnipro River. Outside it was -18C. There was bright sunshine and snow.
“Russia is trying to break us. It’s deliberate genocide against the Ukrainian people. Putin wants us to capitulate so we give up the Donbas region,” Natalya said. “Kyiv didn’t use to feel like a frontline city. Now it does. People are dying of cold in their homes in the 21st century. The idea is to make us leave and to create a new refugee crisis for Europe.”

‘Invisible’ children born in the brothels of Bangladesh finally get birth certificates

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/feb/13/invisible-children-born-in-the-brothels-of-bangladesh-finally-get-birth-certificates

Destined to a perilous life with no right to an education or to vote, state recognition ‘gives them hope’, campaigners say
Through the decades that
the Daulatdia brothel
in Bangladesh has existed, children born there have been invisible, unable to be registered because their mothers were sex workers and their fathers unknown. Now, for the first time, all 400 of them in the brothel village have their own birth certificates.
That milestone was reached after a push by campaigners who have spent decades working with Bangladesh’s undocumented children born in brothels or on the street. It means they can finally access the rights afforded to other citizens: the ability to go to school, to be issued a passport or to vote.

Chinese scientists find path for long-distance quantum communications network

Die MSC geht jetzt in die Vollen. US-Außenminister Marco Rubio führt die amerikanische Delegation an. Er hat einen anderen Ton als Vizepräsident JD Vance, aber klar auf Trump-Linie ist er. Rixa Fürsen spricht mit POLITICO-Kollege Jonathan Martin darüber, welchen Kurs er verfolgt, wie realistisch ein Friedensplan für die Ukraine bis zum Sommer ist und welches Verhältnis Rubio zu Wolodymyr Selenskyj hat.
Im 200-Sekunden-Interview erklärt die Grünen-Fraktionsvize Agnieszka Brugger, warum sie einen beschleunigten EU-Beitritt der Ukraine unterstützt, welche Reformen dort notwendig bleiben und wie Europa auf Spannungen mit den USA reagieren sollte.
Danach geht es nach Israel. Bundestagspräsidentin Julia Klöckner hat als erste deutsche Spitzenpolitikerin seit dem 7. Oktober 2023 den Gazastreifen besucht. Rasmus Buchsteiner berichtet, wie es dazu kam, welche Kritik es gibt und was das für künftige Besuche deutscher Politiker bedeutet.

Born in Sweden, baby Emanuel to be deported to Iran
After a ruling by the Migration Agency, eight month old baby Emanuel, who was born in Sweden, is facing a deportation order to his family's homeland of Iran.
His mother, a rejected asylum seeker, was able to switch to a work permit under the previous track change system which, since it was abolished in April last year, means that relatives can no longer claim a residence permit.
Swedish Radio News has been speaking to the boy's mother, a legal expert and the Migration Agency.

Indonesia’s largest Islamic organisations appear to be recalibrating their stance on Palestine by softening earlier criticisms of President Prabowo Subianto’s decision to join US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”, in what analysts describe as a shift from prioritising Palestinian independence to broader security issues.
The adjustment, which followed a closed-door meeting at the presidential palace earlier this month, has fuelled a debate on whether major Muslim bodies are being nudged...

Goldman Sachs’ top lawyer Kathy Ruemmler to resign after emails show close ties to Jeffrey Epstein

2026-02-13T02:01:40Z
NEW YORK (AP) — Kathy Ruemmler, the top lawyer at storied investment bank Goldman Sachs and former White House counsel to President Barack Obama, announced her resignation Thursday, after
emails between her and Jeffrey Epstein
showed a close relationship where she described him as an “older brother” and downplayed his sex crimes.
Ruemmler said in a statement that she would “step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel of Goldman Sachs as of June 30, 2026.”
Up until her resignation, Ruemmler repeatedly tried to distance herself from the emails and other correspondence and had been defiant that she would not resign from Goldman’s top legal post, which she had held since 2020.
While Ruemmler has called
Epstein
a “monster” in recent statements, she had a much different relationship with Epstein before he was arrested a second time for sex crimes in 2019 and later
killed himself in a Manhattan jail
. Ruemmler called Epstein “Uncle Jeffrey” in emails and said she adored him.
In a statement before her resignation, a Goldman Sachs spokesperson said Ruemmler “regrets ever knowing him.”
In her statement Thursday, Ruemmler said: “Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm’s legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do. My responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs’ interests first.”
Goldman CEO David Solomonsaid in a separate statement: “As one of the most accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision.”
During her time in private practice after she left the White House in 2014, Ruemmler received several expensive gifts from Epstein, including luxury handbags and a fur coat. The gifts were given after Epstein had already been convicted of sex crimes in 2008 and was registered as a sex offender.
“So lovely and thoughtful! Thank you to Uncle Jeffrey!!!” Ruemmler wrote to Epstein in 2018.
Historically, Wall Street frowns on gift-giving between clients and bankers or Wall Street lawyers, particularly high-end gifts that could pose a conflict of interest. Goldman Sachs requires its employees to get preapproval before receiving or giving gifts from clients, according to the company’s code of conduct, partly in order to not run afoul of anti-bribery laws.
As late as December, Goldman CEO David Solomon described Ruemmler as an “excellent lawyer” and said she had his full faith and backing.

Top Goldman Sachs lawyer resigns after Epstein files release
2026-02-13 03:31:22 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/epstein-files-goldman-sachs-lawyer-kathryn-ruemmler-resigns

Goldman Sachs' top lawyer Kathryn Ruemmler resigned Thursday night after her name appeared in
Epstein
files documents the Department of Justice recently released.
The big picture:
The ex-White House counsel to former President Obama and
co-chair
of Goldman's reputational risk committee is the
latest high-profile figure
to resign or be ousted following the DOJ's Jan. 30 release of 3 million documents related to convicted sex offender
Jeffrey Epstein
.
State of play:
Her resignation announcement that's effective June 30 follows the release of files showing emails
spanning
several
years
from a "Kathy Ruemmler" who referred to the
disgraced late financier
as "uncle Jeffrey."
The Kathy Ruemmler in the files in a 2018
email
thanks him for a "lovely and thoughtful" gift and in a January 2019
email
says, "Am totally tricked out by Uncle Jeffrey today! Jeffrey boots, handbag, and w=tch!"
In an apparent reference to news
reports
on these emails, Ruemmler said in a Thursday interview with the
Financial Times
that first announced her departure from Goldman: "I made the determination that the media attention on me, relating to my prior work as a defence attorney, was becoming a distraction."
What they're saying:
Ruemmler said in an emailed statement Thursday night that her "responsibility is to put Goldman Sachs' interests first" and she had "regretfully" notified Goldman CEO David Solomon that she intended to "step down as Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel" of the Wall Street bank.
"Since I joined Goldman Sachs six years ago, it has been my privilege to help oversee the firm's legal, reputational, and regulatory matters; to enhance our strong risk management processes; and to ensure that we live by our core value of integrity in everything we do," she said.
Solomon praised
Ruemmler for being an "extraordinary general counsel" throughout her tenure at Goldman, per an emailed statement Thursday night.
Goldman is "grateful for her contributions and sound advice on a wide range of consequential legal matters for the firm," he added.
"As one of the most accomplished professionals in her field, Kathy has also been a mentor and friend to many of our people, and she will be missed. I accepted her resignation, and I respect her decision."
Zoom out:
Jennifer Connelly, a spokesperson for Ruemmler, told
CNN
after the emails were reported that the senior lawyer "has done nothing wrong," has "nothing to hide" and nothing in the record "suggests otherwise."
Ruemmler "has been clear and consistent from the outset: she knew him through her work as a criminal defense attorney, shared a client with him, received referrals from him, and was friendly in that professional context," Connelly added.

The IOC disqualified Ukraine’s skeleton captain for wearing a helmet honoring athletes killed by Russia. Zelensky says it proves the Olympics sides with the aggressor.
2026-02-13 03:19:10 GMT
https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/02/13/the-ioc-disqualified-ukraine-s-skeleton-captain-for-wearing-a-helmet-honoring-athletes-killed-by-russia-zelensky-says-it-proves-the-olympics-sides-with-the-aggressor

The International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) disqualified Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych before his opening heat at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, citing his refusal to follow International Olympic Committee (IOC) guidelines on athlete self-expression.
Heraskevych, who arrived in Italy as the captain of Ukraine’s skeleton team, had intended to compete wearing a helmet emblazoned with the portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia’s invasion. “It is an honor for me to wear their images and show the world the price Ukraine pays daily in this bloody war,” Heraskevych said in a social media post in which he unveiled the design. “We remember those whose lives Russia has taken.”

Oleksiy Loginov, hockey player. Killed in combat.
Mykyta Kozubenko, diver. Killed in combat.
Oleksii Khabarov, marksman. Killed in combat.
Heraskevych donned the helmet for an official training run ahead of the races, but the IOC later informed him he was barred from using what has become known as his “helmet of remembrance” during competition. Heraskevych posted about the ruling on social media on February 10. The post drew immediate support from President Volodymyr Zelensky, who emphasized that the helmet depicts Ukrainian athletes killed by Russia, adding, “This truth cannot be inconvenient, inappropriate, or labeled a political action at sports competitions.”
On February 12, the IBSF published a
jury decision
stating that both the organization and the IOC found the helmet “inconsistent with the Olympic Charter and Guidelines on Athlete Expression.” According to the ruling, what was described as a “conciliatory meeting” took place on February 11, during which Heraskevych affirmed his intention to wear the helmet in competition, even after being advised that doing so could result in his disqualification. As a result, he was removed from the start list.
In a
separate statement
, the IOC addressed the disqualification, stating that Heraskevych “did not consider any form of compromise,” despite “multiple exchanges and in-person meetings” with officials, including IOC President Kirsty Coventry. The committee emphasized that it had permitted Heraskevych to wear the special helmet during training runs and had proposed that he display it in the mixed zone immediately after the competition:
The IOC was very keen for Mr. Heraskevych to compete. This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The essence of this case is not about the message; it is about where he wanted to express it.
On the day of the race, Heraskevych issued a
statement
insisting that he “never wanted a scandal.” “The IOC created it with its interpretation of the rules, which many view as discriminatory,” he tweeted. Heraskevych also presented three terms for a resolution: that the IOC lift the ban on his helmet, apologize for the “pressure that has been put on [him] over the past few days,” and provide power generators for Ukrainian sports facilities “as a sign of solidarity.” “I very much hope for a response before the start of the skeleton competitions,” Heraskevych added.
Я пропоную завершити цей скандал.
I propose to end this scandal.
Я ніколи не хотів скандалу з МОК і я його не створював. МОК створив це своєю інтерпретацією правил, яку багато хто вважає дискримінаційною.
Хоча дії МОК дали змогу голосно говорити про українських спортсменів, які…

Following the IOC’s decision, Heraskevych said he had paid a “price for dignity” by “standing up for the interests of Ukraine and the memory of its athletes.” He
told
the television network Suspilne that he believes he broke no rules and should have been allowed to compete like others who he claims engaged in similar expressions.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha
stated
that the IOC had “banned not the Ukrainian athlete but its own reputation.” He called the move a “moment of shame” and condemned the committee for “systematically failing” to stand up to Russia, “the greatest violator of international sport and the Olympic Charter.”
The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine also expressed support for Heraskevych following the ruling. “Vladyslav did not start today, but he was not alone — all of Ukraine stands with him,” the organization said in a
press release
. “When an athlete stands up for truth, honor, and memory — that is already a victory.”
President Zelensky
wrote
on X that “sport shouldn’t mean amnesia”:
The Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors. Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise. This is certainly not about the principles of Olympism, which are founded on fairness and the support of peace.
He added that “it is Russia that constantly violates Olympic principles, using the period of the Olympic Games to wage war: in 2008, the war against Georgia; in 2014, the occupation of Crimea; in 2022, the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.” The president later issued a
decree
awarding Heraskevych the Order of Freedom “for selfless service to the Ukrainian people, civic courage, and patriotism in defending the ideals of freedom and democratic values.”

Westminster Power Couples — 2026 edition
The love matches wielding political power in SW1.
By
BETHANY DAWSON
in LONDON
Illustration by Natália Delgado/ POLITICO
Art by Natália Delgado and Ellen Boonen
It’s been another year of drama, gossip and heartbreak in British politics — but there’s still love in the air in Westminster.
POLITICO is yet again celebrating the annual festival of romance by bringing you SW1’s top political power couples. As usual, the 2026 list is absolutely not scientifically ranked.
Politics is unpredictable, and it’s all change at the top of our love list.
Last year’s top-ranked couple are out after Morgan McSweeney, once Keir Starmer’s all-powerful chief of staff, dramatically quit this past weekend after taking responsibility for recommending Peter Mandelson be U.S. ambassador to Washington. He took the 2025 power couples top spot with his wife Imogen Walker, still a Labour whip.
They are replaced at this perilous time for the prime minister by a couple whose ability to maintain and build relations with MPs and businesses could be crucial for the troubled Starmer administration.
That’s enough flirting … here’s the class of 2026. Happy Valentine’s Day!
1.
Johnny and Claire Reynolds
With power shifting out of No. 10 Downing Street and into the hands of rebellious backbench MPs over the last 12 months, the role of chief whip
will be vital to the PM’s survival (or otherwise).
That’s why Johnny Reynolds — who attends daily meetings with Starmer where he is tasked with telegraphing the concerns of Labour MPs, and thwarting the backbench revolts which have plagued the government over the past 12 months — takes top spot in the power rankings with his wife Claire Reynolds, a long-time Labour big-hitter in her own right.
While she has left her old job as No. 10 political director, Claire Reynolds is now Labour’s executive director of stakeholder relations, managing the party’s relationship with campaign groups, businesses, faith groups, charities and think tanks. Just like MPs, they have all become increasingly willing to make Starmer’s life difficult
when they believe government policy is heading in the wrong direction.
2.
Pat and Marianna McFadden
The McFaddens are a quiet presence at the epicenter of the SW1 political drama — but with the Blairite influence in Starmer’s administration on the wane, they take second place.
Pat McFadden, once political secretary to ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair, still remains one of Starmer’s most loyal Cabinet ministers — trusted with the morning media round on the trickiest of days.
He was handed the nightmare work and pensions brief at the last reshuffle in September after backbench MPs forced
Starmer into a humiliating climbdown on his plans for benefits reform. He has the unenviable task of designing new plans over the next year without angering Labour MPs. That could put Starmer’s future with his party in Pat McFadden’s hands … if the PM lasts that long.
Marianna McFadden, who once worked for Tony Blair’s think tank, is the ruling Labour Party’s deputy general secretary, and therefore plays an important role in keeping the party machine running. If there is a leadership contest, she will have to make sure it runs smoothly. Good luck, as they say, with that.
3.
Angela Rayner and Sam Tarry
Angela Rayner is out of high office after resigning when she became embroiled in a tax scandal —  but she is certainly not out of power.
When the former deputy prime minister speaks, Westminster listens.
Her intervention in a debate last week about the release of documents relating to former U.S. ambassador Peter Mandelson’s appointment was seen as pivotal in forcing a government climbdown on restricting material on national security and international relations grounds.
Rayner is popular with the soft-left of the party, and allies say she has leadership ambitions. With Starmer’s premiership teetering, Westminster is obsessed with what her next move might be.
Her partner is the former Labour MP Sam Tarry, who mixes his day job advising the Night Time Industry Association with networking on the left. Like many former MPs, he also has his own “insider” podcast called
Next Week in Westminster
.
4.
Amy Richards and Gregor Poynton
These two shoot right up the power rankings thanks to Amy Richards’ promotion to No. 10 political director last year.
Like Reynolds, she is trying to manage relationships with a nervous and rebellious parliamentary Labour Party, while also gaming how Labour can thwart the rise of Nigel Farage’s Reform UK.
With some MPs crediting her for an improvement in relations between the back benches and No. 10, she
is also being mooted as a potential contender for the next Downing Street chief of staff following the departure of Morgan McSweeney.
She is married to Gregor Poynton — a 2024 intake MP, who is now an assistant whip, helping Reynolds keep truculent Labour MPs in line.
5. Yvette Cooper and Ed Balls
Yvette Cooper is one of the most senior politicians in the country as foreign secretary. She spends her days navigating the rapidly changing world order, and that little ol’ threat of war.
Her podcaster husband, former Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, has forged a successful post-politics media career as a breakfast presenter on GMB.
But he has not fully cut his ties with SW1.
His “Political Currency” podcast, which he co-hosts with former Chancellor George Osborne, boasts some of the most senior members of the government as its listeners.
6.
Stuart Ingham and Jess Leigh
Stuart Ingham and Jess Leigh are a top-ranking government adviser couple.
Ingham is the PM’s longest-serving aide, dating back to his time as a parliamentary researcher in the Brexit years, and knows Starmer’s mind like few others in politics.
He was moved from his job as No. 10’s head of policy in Starmer’s September reset, and now holds the harder-to-define role of senior counsel to the prime minister and director of strategic interventions. The PM evidently still wanted him close by.
Leigh is Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper’s media special adviser, having also served as her aide in the Home Office. She navigates the daily surprises (thanks, Donald) of foreign policy and is well-known in media circles from her previous role as Labour Party broadcast officer, where she fought the election “air war” in 2024.
7. Henna Shah and Matt Pound
This is another top adviser pairing, both with roles in the heart of government.
Henna Shah is the prime minister’s foreign policy adviser. She helps Starmer navigate the ever-changing and ever-more-dangerous world, working closely with his National Security Adviser Jonathan Powell.
Her husband Matt Pound was a key ally of former chief of staff Morgan McSweeney and a powerful backroom fixer in opposition. He now spends his days thinking about the U.K. economy as political secretary to Chancellor Rachel Reeves.
8. Ellie Reeves and John Cryer
Solicitor General Ellie Reeves was given her legal-eagle job in September.
Her role “promoting the rule of law” is a tough gig with U.S. President Donald Trump constantly challenging that international rules-based order.
Her husband, the veteran Labour MP John Cryer, was made a peer after stepping down at the 2024 general election.
Not only is Ellie Reeves one half of a top political power couple, she is also Rachel Reeves’ sister.
9. Richard Tice and Isabel Oakeshott
Richard Tice is deputy leader of the poll-topping Reform UK — the political force giving No. 10 Downing Street nightmares.
Nigel Farage’s second-in-command
leads the party’s “DOGE” effort to cut waste in councils and has launched sprawling policy reviews including on City regulations. As Farage prepares to unveil a shadow cabinet, exactly which role Tice gets in the future will be watched closely.
His fiancée, Talk’s International Editor Isabel Oakeshott, is a political journalist, commentator and biographer who rocked Westminster in 2023 by publishing pandemic-era WhatsApps to and from former Health Secretary Matt Hancock.
The pair announced their engagement in January, and are now shopping for rings — but POLITICO hears lab-grown diamonds are off the table.
10. Wes Streeting and Joe Dancey
Health Secretary Wes Streeting is dominating chatter among MPs as allies push speculation that he could mount a Labour leadership challenge. (He denies any such thing, of course.)
While the path to the
actual
No. 10 is littered with hurdles, Streeting’s interventions on the direction of the government make him one of the most closely-watched figures in SW1.
Streeting’s fiancé Joe Dancey — who narrowly lost to the Tories as a 2024 election candidate — left his role as Labour’s director of policy and comms in September to travel and look after elderly parents. He is now back in London outside the party as a freelance communications consultant.
But he maintains his long-standing networks in the party, and promised at the time of his departure to continue “pounding the streets” as a foot soldier. Perhaps Westminster hasn’t seen the last of him yet.
11. Jenny Chapman and Nick Smith
Labour peer and Development Minister Jenny Chapman is another long-standing ally of the PM. She has been married to backbench Labour MP Nick Smith since 2014.
Starmer’s campaign to be leader of the Labour Party in 2020 was masterminded from their kitchen table.
With Starmer promising to fight any challenger to his leadership, Chapman’s organizational skills may be needed once again.
12. Jake Richards and Liz Bates
Labour MP and former barrister Jake Richards was promoted to justice minister last year. His department is often dealing with controversy — whether over plans to scale back jury trials, or explaining why prisoners have been released by mistake.
His wife, Liz Bates, has left Sky News and political journalism to become a media adviser to Housing Secretary Steve Reed.
These veterans of the POLITICO power couples list got married late last year — and their inclusion even got a mention in the wedding speeches.
Jake is also the sister of No. 4 ranked Amy Richards. Their dad is the veteran political journalist Steve Richards.
13. Josh MacAlister and Matt Hood
Josh MacAlister is one of the rising stars of the 2024 intake. Appointed as children and families minister last year, he has an important role in navigating the government’s management of children’s social care and local authority improvement. No easy gig.
His husband, Matt Hood, the former chief executive and co-founder of Oak National Academy,
is a senior adviser
to Health Secretary Wes Streeting.
14. Chris Elmore and Bridie Sedgebeer
Chris Elmore is the Foreign Office minister tasked with overseeing the U.K.’s diplomatic ties with Latin America and the Caribbean. Nice gig if you can get it.
He’s married to Bridie Sedgebeer, the deputy general secretary of Welsh Labour, who has the far less glamorous, but crucial, job of getting Labour through tricky 2026 Senedd elections in May.
15. Jo White and John Mann
Bassetlaw MP Jo White chairs the Labour Red Wall Group, representing northern and Midlands MPs. Many of her group took seats from the Tories at the last election, and some now face the threat of Reform UK.
She’s married to John Mann, who was previously MP in her Bassetlaw seat, and is now the independent adviser to the U.K. government on antisemitism. He also sits in the House of Lords as a Labour peer.
16. Isabel Abbs and Olly Longworth
This is another top adviser power couple, both advising ministers with some of the government’s biggest missions.
Isabel Abbs is a core part of the government’s health team as a special adviser in No. 10. She’s in a relationship with Olly Longworth, chief of staff to Housing Secretary Steve Reed.
Longworth was previously in the Labour HQ comms team.
17. Aggie Chambre and Will Prescott
Aggie Chambre, who was recently promoted to deputy political editor at LBC, is one of SW1’s top broadcast voices, helping listeners navigate the ever-confusing twists and turns of politics. Oh, and she was once here with us at POLITICO.
Her husband, Will Prescott, is Streeting’s media adviser.
18. Sophie Nazemi and James Schneider
Sophie Nazemi has the unenviable job of Downing Street press secretary, which means handling the Westminster press pack 24-7.
She currently has a few extra responsibilities after the surprise resignation of No. 10 comms chief Tim Allan on Monday. Nazemi, who was in the press office when Jeremy Corbyn was Labour leader, is among the runners and riders being tipped for the top job.
Nazemi is married to Momentum founder James Schneider, who worked on the formation of the left-wing Your Party outfit, and before that on Jeremy Corbyn’s (more) successful campaign to become Islington North’s independent MP.
19. Alex Norris and Emma Foody
Alex Norris is a minister at the Home Office, where he holds the crucial border security brief. His wife Emma Foody is a rising star of the 2024 intake. She is currently parliamentary private secretary to Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson.
The pair married just nine days after Norris was first elected in 2017, and in 2024 they swore their oaths of allegiance in the Commons one after the other.
20. Anu Prashar and Deirdre Costigan
Anu Prashar is a member of Labour’s National Executive Committee — the governing body of the ruling Labour Party, which sets the direction of the movement.
Her partner is 2024 intake MP Deirdre Costigan, who was made an assistant whip in the 2025 reshuffle.
21. Stephen Bush and Felicity Slater
Felicity Slater is chief of staff to Cabinet big-hitter and Chief Secretary to the
Prime Minister Darren Jones — a job which puts her at the heart of No. 10 Downing Street.
Her partner is Stephen Bush, associate editor and columnist at the Financial Times, and author of the newsletter Inside Politics.
22. Lou Haigh and Colum Eastwood
Former Transport Secretary Lou Haigh returned to the backbenches in 2025 — but still remains a powerful figure in Labour as leader of the influential soft-left Tribune Group. It will be an important caucus were there to be a leadership race.
Her partner is a big name in Northern Irish politics. He is the former SDLP Leader Colum Eastwood. He resigned as leader in 2024, but is still an MP.
23. Louise Sandher-Jones and Jeevun Sandher
A love story from the class of 2024 — and another power couples wedding since the last ranking.
Louise Sandher-Jones and Jeevun Sandher — both elected MPs in 2024 — got married last summer.
They met in January 2023, when Sandher-Jones was running to become a councilor in Loughborough, and Sandher was campaigning to be the MP.
They are slowly climbing up the power rankings. Sandher-Jones is now the veterans and people minister, and Sandher is a parliamentary private secretary in the business department.
24. Natalie Evans and James Wild
One of the very few Tory power pairings left in SW1.
James Wild, shadow exchequer secretary to the Treasury, is well connected in Westminster, having started his career as a Tory special adviser.
Natalie Evans, a former think tank wonk, is a senior Tory peer and former leader of the House of Lords.
25. Joe Morris and Hana Al-Izzi
Joe Morris is a parliamentary private secretary in the health and social care department, and chairs the Labour group of rural MPs — a caucus which is increasingly making its voice heard on issues like farming inheritance tax. He married Hana Al-Izzi, an adviser to Labour Party Chair Anna Turley, on New Year’s Eve 2025. Talk about fireworks!
26. Seb Dance and Spencer Livermore
Labour peer and Financial Secretary to the Treasury Spencer Livermore is a long-time Labour devotee, having served as chief strategist to Gordon Brown during his time as both prime minister and chancellor. His husband Seb Dance is a big deal at City Hall where he is deputy mayor of London for transport.
27. Steven and Sarah Swinford
The Times’ Political Editor Steven Swinford is an endless source of scoops and insight in Westminster. His wife, Sarah, is the Home Office crime director, making her a key player in the government’s crook crackdown.
28. Pippa Crerar and Tom Whitehead
Senior lobby hack Pippa Crerar continues to break exclusives at a rate of knots. As political editor of the left-leaning Guardian and co-presenter of ITV’s Peston, her influence is only set to grow. She is married to ex-Telegraph hack Tom Whitehead, who is now Foreign Office deputy director of communications.
29. Ruth Anderson and Gareth Snell
Former MP Ruth Anderson was made a Labour peer in 2022 and currently sits as a government whip in the upper chamber. Her partner is Labour MP Gareth Snell, who was MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central from 2017-2019, and made a Commons comeback in 2024.
They are yet another Westminster power couple that tied the knot last year.
30. Alison McGovern and Ashwin Kumar
Local Government and Homelessness Minister Alison McGovern is a long-serving frontbencher who spent several years on the DWP brief and was employment minister during the tense welfare rebellion. She’s married to Ashwin Kumar, the IPPR think tank’s director of research and policy. IPPR is one of the most influential wonkish voices with the Starmer government, regularly sending advice to ministers and government special advisers on questions of policy.
31. Jane Bonham Carter and Tim Razzall
An upper chamber power couple, Lib Dem peers Jane Bonham Carter and Tim Razzall have sat in the Lords since 2004 and 1997 respectively.
Bonham Carter is the Lib Dems’ culture spokesperson in the Lords.
32. Geraldine Scott and Ollie Cole
Geraldine Scott is assistant political editor of the revered Times lobby team. She’s engaged to Ollie Cole, political producer at Times Radio, and host of the Senedd Sources podcast.
33. James Stewart and Tamara Cohen
James Stewart is comms director at the Cabinet Office — the department which
really
runs the government. He’s married to Tamara Cohen, who has just joined the work and pensions department as a special adviser after a near decade-long stint as a Sky News political correspondent.
34. Sam Haq and Carl Dinnen
NHS England Director of Comms Samana Haq has her work cut out for her — especially navigating a media strategy for a body the government is shutting down. Her husband, ITV political correspondent Carl Dinnen, hasn’t got much quiet time either.
35. Craig Saunders and Louise Berwick
A top civil service power couple. Louise Berwick manages communications on foreign affairs and defense in Downing Street. Her husband, Craig Saunders, is midway through moving from a top Home Office comms job to be head of news and media at the Treasury.
36. Luke Tryl and Dharmesh Nayee
Luke Tryl has become one of Westminster’s most recognized commentators. His More in Common think tank — which pumps out polls and conducts regular focus groups — offers SW1 colorful insight into what the “normal people” actually care about. His partner is Dharmesh Nayee, a senior Treasury civil servant, who worked on the 2025 budget.
37.
Luke Murphy and Paul McNamee
Basingstoke MP Luke Murphy is a key Labour voice on net zero. Behind the scenes, so is his partner Paul McNamee, director of the green campaign group the Labour Climate and Environment Forum (LCEF). Murphy chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Climate and sits on the Treasury committee. Under McNamee, LCEF’s events have become diary dates for anyone who wants to know what Labour’s Milibandite climate caucus is thinking.
38. Hollie Ridley and Teddy Ryan
Labour General Secretary Hollie Ridley is the highest-ranked member of the party’s internal structure. Her husband Teddy Ryan is a big name in public affairs — he runs lobbying firm Anacta’s U.K. operation, once dubbed the “Starmerite lobbying firm.”
39. Zarah Sultana and Craig Lloyd
Independent MP Zarah Sultana is co-founder of the left-wing upstart Your Party — a hotbed of political drama since its launch last July. Her husband Craig Lloyd, a former policy officer for the Fire Brigades Union, was an adviser on her campaign to
lead the new political movement.
40. Suella and Rael Braverman
Former Conservative Home Secretary Suella Braverman is back in the headlines after dramatically defecting to Reform UK (following colleagues Robert Jenrick and Andrew Rosindell). Her husband, Rael, rejoined Nigel Farage’s party when his wife joined. He’s been a bit on-and-off with Reform UK, having joined in December ’24, then leaving in July ’25 after public attacks on Braverman. Love mends all.

Putin should worry about the Trump-Xi relationship
2026-02-13 03:02:00 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/vladimir-putin-donald-trump-xi-jinping-relationship/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

Mikhail Khodorkovsky is the founder of the New Eurasian Strategies Centre and co-founder of the Russian Antiwar Committee.
The Russia-China partnership has no limits — if you believe the two countries’ leaders, that is. Reality, however, isn’t quite so cozy.
An uncomfortable marriage of convenience, theirs is a relationship limited by opposing goals: President Vladimir Putin’s Russia wants to tear down what remains of the post-Cold War international order and refashion it in the Kremlin’s own image. Whereas China’s contrasting gradualist approach to
creating a Sino-centric global system
requires preserving stability, predictability and the semblance of a rules-based order.
Putin’s in a hurry because he has a limited window of opportunity to play to his strengths by exploiting the divisions among what he calls the “Collective West.” However, his weaknesses are clearly visible: U.S. intervention in Venezuela, the Kremlin’s reluctance to defend Iran and the Assad regime’s fall in Syria in late 2024  are all part of a pattern — that of an overstretched, weakened Russia that’s becoming less reliable and less trusted among its allies in the global south.
And while U.S. President Donald Trump sometimes frames Russia and China as a collective threat to the U.S. — when it comes to the rationale behind his Greenland policy, for example — Washington’s actually much more interested in shaping global dynamics with Beijing than with Moscow.
The 2025 meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Seoul made clear that the Trump administration now sees value in separating the “Russia question” from the “China question,” and in building a pragmatic relationship of economic cooperation and
Machtpolitik
with Beijing. And though many experts dismiss this possibility out of hand, the Kremlin is worried by it — for good reason.
For Russia, the implications of a U.S.-China rapprochement — even if based on convenience rather than conviction — are profound.
Such a shift would relegate Putin’s Russia to the status of a secondary player on the international stage and sharply weaken its leverage — not least in Ukraine. The Russian leader’s dependence on Chinese supplies for machinery, equipment and the transit of goods essential to sustain his war has reached unprecedented levels.
Without China, Putin’s war machine would have likely ground to a halt in 12 months or even less.
That’s why Moscow’s reaction to the Trump-Xi meeting was predictably bellicose, with Kremlin-friendly television channels trumpeting the fact that Russia’s new nuclear-capable missiles could plunge the world into ecological disaster or wipe out millions of people in a heartbeat — a sure sign Putin was rattled.
True, the China-Russia relationship has strengthened significantly since 2022, and China has done little to rein in Putin’s aggression so far. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also reportedly told EU High Representative Kaja Kallas that his country didn’t want to see Russia defeated in Ukraine, as the U.S. would then concentrate its attention on Beijing.
But the maintenance of the Moscow-Beijing partnership rests on the assumption that both countries have more to gain in challenging and resisting the U.S. together. And that’s now in question.
It was Washington’s miscalculation to initially believe it could peel Moscow away from Beijing by offering concessions and engage China from a position of strength. But that strategy has changed, with Trump c
haracterizing his most recent meeting with Xi
as a “12 out of 10,” and enthusiastically accepting an invitation to visit China in April.
The U.S. leader’s pragmatic approach is certainly closer to Xi’s style, which opens the door for Beijing to achieve its goals regarding trade and hegemony in its own immediate neighborhood. Moreover, neither is inclined to provoke military conflict with the other. Trump, for his part, has vowed to curtail America’s “endless wars” — even if he bombed Iran and threatened several neighboring countries. And while Xi has his eye on Taiwan, he has every reason to avoid war with the U.S. because of the risks to the Chinese economy.
This is in stark contrast to Putin, who is locked into the logic of war in order to preserve power.
His absolutist approach to diplomacy couldn’t be more different to Trump. Every time the U.S. pushed for a ceasefire in Ukraine to enable negotiations, the Kremlin reiterated its maximalist goals and stepped up its air attacks instead. At least Trump appears to have realized he can’t force Putin to the negotiating table with existing sanctions or limited military pressure. However many “constructive” phone calls they have, there’s no deal to be struck.
At the same time, talk of Trump walking away from Ukraine has mostly died down in Washington. The U.S. leader remains committed to achieving a peace settlement, and appears to understand that Beijing’s leverage over Moscow now offers the best prospect of achieving this.
The question is whether the “no limits” partnership with Putin still offers greater benefits for Beijing, or if China’s current interests lie in a pragmatic
détente
with Washington and Europe.
With Europe eyeing the U.S. administration warily, China now has an opportunity to cement a long-term accommodation with the old continent. And that gives Europe potential leverage to persuade China to distance itself from an unpredictable “ally” and curtail the Kremlin’s neo-imperial aggression. After all, Beijing has no interest in Putin’s continued destabilization of Europe.

Western countries see World War III coming
2026-02-13 03:02:00 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/world-war-iii-defense-spending-europe-poll/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

BRUSSELS — Western countries increasingly believe the world is heading toward a global war, according to results from
The POLITICO Poll
that detail mounting public alarm about the risk and cost of a new era of conflict.
Across all five countries polled — the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France and Germany — the vast majority of respondents think the world is becoming more dangerous. The outbreak of World War 3 is seen as more likely than not within the next five years by American, Canadian, French and British respondents.
The share of voters predicting a new global conflict has risen sharply since independent pollsters Public First asked the question in March 2025. “The changed attitudes of the Western
public in under a year reflect a dramatic move to a more insecure world, where war is seen as likely and
alliances are unstable
,” said Seb Wride, head of polling at Public First.
But The POLITICO Poll also revealed limited willingness among the Western public to make sacrifices to pay for more military spending. While there is widespread support for increasing defense budgets in principle across the U.K., France, Germany and Canada, that support fell sharply when people learned it might mean taking on more government debt, cutting other services or raising taxes.
“Our polling shows the growing concern about war does not give leaders license to spend heavily on defense,” said Wride. “If anything, voters are now less willing to make the trade-offs needed to improve military security. So European leaders are left in a bind — unable to rely on the U.S., unable to use that as a reason to invest domestically, and under higher pressure to urgently solve this for a world where conflict feels closer than before.”
The findings, based on surveys of more than 2,000 voters in each country between Feb. 6 and Feb. 9, lay bare the challenge facing NATO leaders as they try to strengthen security at a time when public finances are tight.
That struggle will shape discussions among politicians from across the world as they head to Germany for the annual Munich Security Conference starting Friday.
With no sign of an imminent end to Russia’s four-year all-out war against Ukraine, and the U.S. taking military action in Iran, Syria, Venezuela and Africa under President Donald Trump, many voters see a growing risk of global conflict.
The pattern is particularly stark in the United Kingdom, where 43 percent believe a new world war is “likely” or “very likely” to break out by 2031 — up from 30 percent in March 2025. Nearly half of Americans — 46 percent — think a new world war is “likely” or “very likely” by 2031 — up from 38 percent last year. Among the five countries, only people in Germany think on balance that a third global war is not likely in the next five years.

Crisis-hit Starmer seeks solace on the world stage

Crisis-hit Starmer seeks solace on the world stage
The British leader’s allies believe his clout on the world stage can shore him up — but his own side will take some convincing.
By
ESTHER WEBBER and
SASCHA O’SULLIVAN

POLITICO
After the week Keir Starmer’s had, talks about the teetering global order should be a welcome relief.
The British PM arrives in Bavaria Friday for the Munich Security Conference having seen two of his closest aides walk out, his top man in Scotland urge him to quit, and continued rage from Labour MPs over the decision to appoint Jeffrey Epstein associate Peter Mandelson as Britain’s ambassador to the U.S.
Having staved off his immediate ouster, Starmer is now making another outing on the international stage, where his allies argue he carries genuine clout. He has so far been keen to emphasize the links he’s built with foreign leaders, including his relationship with Donald Trump and his efforts at a “reset” with the EU, as a marker of the renewed British influence that would be at risk were he challenged.
But Labour’s restive troops will take some serious convincing of this argument — and doubts remain about some of the key overseas achievements touted by the embattled prime minister.
“Starmer would’ve been a really good diplomat … He isn’t such a political actor,” Olivia O’Sullivan of foreign policy think tank Chatham House told the latest episode of POLITICO’s Westminster Insider podcast.
Tug of war
All leaders face a tug of war between their lives as statesmen and their domestic agendas, but Starmer’s has proved especially strenuous.
He came to power promising to fix Britain’s failing public services and lower the cost of living, as
counseled by his then-top aide
Morgan McSweeney.
When Starmer entered Downing Street, however, he defied McSweeney’s wishes by telling advisers he wanted to divide his time 50/50 between foreign and domestic affairs, unable to resist a slew of foreign visits after taking the reins.
During his first 17 months, he visited 44 countries on 37 trips out of the U.K. That included a flurry of bilateral meetings and international summits in destinations including Washington D.C., Berlin, Brussels, Rio de Janeiro, New York, Samoa, Budapest, Canada and Azerbaijan.
He followed up with high-profile visits to India and China — seen by most in his team as successful. His allies have consistently defended this approach, stressing that representing Britain in the world is one of Starmer’s most important duties and that he has made a success of it. The prime minister has sought to project maturity by building a steady relationship with the unpredictable Trump at the same time as he seeks closer ties with Europe post-Brexit.
O’Sullivan, director of the U.K. in the World program at Chatham House, said Britain is now walking “a pretty difficult tightrope” of “flattering Trump, of offering concessions where we can, but figuring out how we defend particular economic interests, but also the interests of our allies, and particularly Ukraine.”
Peter Ricketts, former head of the U.K.’s diplomatic service, said the shift  towards “a hyper-personalized world” demands Starmer’s presence. “Unless you are in the room with Donald Trump, you’re not influencing him,” Ricketts added.
Connecting the dots
Eighteen months on from the Labour landslide of 2024, however, Starmer’s premiership has flown into more severe difficulties at home. And it’s forcing a rethink.
An especially embarrassing climbdown over proposals to cut disability benefits partly unfolded as Starmer flew to the Hague for last year’s NATO summit. the prime minister appeared to admit he had been distracted from the issue,
saying afterwards
: “I was heavily focused on what was happening with NATO and the Middle East all weekend.”
There has been an effort to redraw Starmer’s priorities since the start of the year, with one adviser saying he now wants to spend 20 percent of his time on international matters and 80 percent on domestic concerns.
The opening weeks of 2026 showed just how hard this will be to achieve. His plans to talk about cutting the cost of living were immediately upended by Trump’s intervention in Venezuela and threats to Greenland.
Unable to separate himself from global affairs, Starmer has instead attempted to send a message that his missions abroad will help improve Britain’s economy and quality of life. On recent trips to Brazil, South Africa and China he has been at pains to stress that “tackling the cost of living today also means engagement beyond our borders.”
Ricketts said: “I understand the frustrations on the domestic sphere where he’s not around enough. But, heavens — the world is in a more turbulent place than I can ever remember it, and I’m glad my prime minister’s out there batting for Britain.”
One Labour MP with a trade role, granted anonymity like others in this article to discuss internal party thinking, argued that the prime minister had delivered “lots of wins” which go down well among the party faithful. They cited Trump’s softening on NATO and carveout for the U.K. on tariffs.
Key British allies overseas also say Starmer’s support for Kyiv has made a genuine difference in advocating for peace in Ukraine.
With his premiership in crisis this week, his supporters have pushed harder on that argument. “We need his leadership not just at home but on the global stage, and we need to keep our focus where it matters, on keeping our country safe,” Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper posted
amid a threat to his leadership
this week.
In his first public appearance since Monday’s public challenge to him, Starmer trumpeted the need to “stand tall” on the international stage.
“Delivering for Britain means acting at home and abroad — not choosing between them,” a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement to POLITICO. “The record speaks for itself: world‑first trade deals, major migration agreements, and defense contracts supporting thousands of UK jobs – real results for the British people.”
Least-worst scenarios
For all the boosting of Starmer’s achievements, however, some of his supposed negotiating triumphs have diminished with time.
The U.K.’s deal with the U.S. on tariffs has been
hard to nail down
, and Starmer’s much-hyped trip to China was followed by Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner Jimmy Lai’s sentencing to 20 years in jail.
Substantive deals with the EU on youth mobility, food standards and even the low-hanging fruit of defense cooperation have also proved elusive.
As O’Sullivan put it, Starmer has “managed to land us in the least-worst scenario on some of these issues.”
A former No.10 official said: “I baulk at the idea that Britain is back on the international stage. All this becomes thin pretty soon — you can position well but the substance of it isn’t that different.”
There is a downside to Starmer’s foreign diplomacy when it comes to his standing with his own restive party and the country at large, too.
The PM has long faced
accusations that he is distant
, both literally and figuratively, when it comes to his colleagues. Labour figures warn that he simply does not have the political space to make an argument about the link between statesmanship and living standards to angry voters.
“Part of the reason he’s getting this criticism is because he’s doing so badly in polls… but the justification he’s using is not a good one,” says a second former adviser.
“It’s retrofitting, because he wanted to spend a lot of time abroad. People aren’t going to believe spending time with Trump will help the cost of living.”

The MAGA-friendly European think tanks Trump wants to fund
2026-02-13 03:00:00 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/maga-friendly-european-think-tanks-donald-trump-funding/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

BRUSSELS — The U.S. is reorienting its foreign funding program to export MAGA ideology to Europe — and a growing set of far-right and conservative think tanks and political groups are lining up to take Washington’s money.
U.S. State Department officials have held early talks about government funding with representatives of the new MAGA-supporting French think tank Western Arc and Britain’s Free Speech Union, an advocacy group.
Those approaches were informed by a list provided to U.S. officials by the Washington-based Heritage Foundation of groups the MAGA-aligned think tank described as “like-minded.” Other far-right and conservative groups in Italy and Brussels told POLITICO they would also be interested in support from a U.S. administration they see as an ally.
POLITICO spoke to representatives from 10 European think tanks and policy groups, all of them aligned in some way with far-right politics. They described a burgeoning ecosystem of ideologically-aligned organizations that had rapidly professionalized in recent years and were working to build cooperation with similar groups across the Atlantic.
With U.S. President Donald Trump’s second presidency giving European nationalists and hardline conservatives a champion at the head of the world’s largest economic and military power, groups on both sides of the Atlantic want to seize the moment. Their ambition is to repurpose the soft-power tools America once deployed to spread the gospel of liberalism, to expand their reach and power and ultimately rebuild the West in their image — a project both sides call a
“civilizational alliance.”
French connection
Nicolas Conquer, a former media director for Republicans Overseas France, launched Western Arc, a self-described
“MAGA-inspired”
think tank in Paris in December. Conquer, a French-American citizen, said he had discussed specific projects that could receive funding with several U.S. State Department officials.
Western Arc pledges to connect “ideas, people and projects” across the Atlantic to “organize western civilizational renewal.” Its mission statement aligns closely with language from the
U.S. National Security Strategy
, released earlier that month, as well as a prior essay from Samuel Samson, a senior adviser for the U.S. State Department.
Conquer said he had been in touch with
Samson and others in the U.S. State Department in the past few months and was exploring ideas for projects of mutual interest, such as stakeholder mapping or transatlantic trips for targeted groups, including around the 250th anniversary celebrations of U.S. independence this July.
“There is this logic, which I think is very healthy, of project-based funding,” Conquer said.
The U.S. State Department did not answer a detailed list of questions. But in response to a query about U.S. funding of European organizations, a spokesperson said: “This is a transparent, lawful use of resources to advance U.S. interests and values abroad.”
Samson made headlines last year for proposing
the use of American taxpayer funds
to support far-right leader Marine Le Pen. He
traveled to European capitals last May
to meet with NGOs and civil society groups.
U.S. State Department officials approached The Heritage Foundation in the second half of last year to ask which organizations in Europe would be viable targets for funding, said Heritage Foundation Senior Research Fellow Paul McCarthy.
“We’ve suggested some institutions, just a few names of organizations back in the late summer, early fall. And maybe that formed the basis of it,” he said.
The amount of money discussed at that time was “tiny.” That was before the U.S. National Security Strategy laid out a policy of “cultivating resistance” in Europe and boosting organizations that stood against left wing “censorship” and migration policies that it said were “transforming the continent and creating strife.”
“Once they got the imprimatur in the national strategy, it’s really taking off right now,” said McCarthy, while stressing he had no inside knowledge of the State Department’s latest plans.
Last week the
FT reported
that U.S. Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers was pushing a funding program for think tanks and institutes, with a focus on London, Brussels, Paris and Berlin. In December she met with Toby Young, a British social commentator and founder of the Free Speech Union.
“We’ve discussed the possibility of the State Department funding some of the FSU’s sister organisations in other parts of the world, but not the organisation I run,” Young said. He would not be drawn on which organizations he meant, but the British Free Speech Union is
affiliated
with similar bodies in Australia, Canada, South Africa and New Zealand, indicating the U.S. State Department’s plans may not be confined to Europe.
American tradition
U.S. government funding for European institutions is not a new phenomenon: Throughout the postwar era the U.S. has supported projects that promoted democratic ideals and American-style liberalism. Since the 1950s, Radio Free Europe floated the sounds of capitalist freedom into Eastern Europe, all on the U.S. taxpayer dime.
This, along with U.S. philanthropic funding, helped many think tanks and other organizations grounded in mainstream liberal values flourish in Europe. Many became highly-networked policy shops that acted as a pseudo civil service, crafting reports and laws that could be transposed into ministerial proclamations.
The right has taken note of that playbook.
“There was a time when the right were incredibly unprofessional, unconnected, and so concerned with their own national concerns that it’s very difficult for them to see beyond that,” said John O’Brien, head of communications at MCC Brussels, a think tank funded by a private educational institute in Hungary with close ties to the government of Trump ally Viktor Orbán.
That has rapidly changed, O’Brien said. Though unlike many networks of progressive institutions, the right has yet to set up a WhatsApp group for collaboration — “If there is, we’re not part of it,” said O’Brien — right-wing operatives and thinkers meet regularly at major events, like the CPAC and NatCon summit series.
They also invite one another to co-host meetings or attend events as panelists. From the U.S. side, The Heritage Foundation, which authored Trump’s Project 2025 blueprint for government, is a frequent guest of the European right.
On Tuesday, The Heritage Foundation’s McCarthy
appeared
on a panel in Rome co-hosted with the Fondazione Machiavelli. McCarthy said The Heritage Foundation was fostering ties with groups in Europe through joint summit hosting and research. Their aim is to push back against “European federalism” and the “green transition madness” while fostering a vision for families that excludes gay couples, trans rights and promotes higher birth rates.
Collaboration among such groups is “growing,” said Fondazione Machiavelli President Scalea. On its
website
, the center advertises formal partnerships or signed memoranda with a series of other right-wings groups: The Heritage Foundation, the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security, Hungary’s Oeconomus Economic Research Foundation, and the Center for Fundamental Rights, which organizes CPAC.
“But it’s most like a friendship,” he said. “Since we have common missions, we have shared values and shared views of the future … We’re not formally intertwined, we have no institutional bond and link, we are not exchanging money or resources … We are just working together because this is making it more effective for everyone else.”
Scalea added that his institute had a “lot of commonality with the Trump administration.”
So far he hasn’t heard directly from the U.S. government about funding being made available to organizations like his, but he said he would look at any funding proposal. “We will see. But for now, we do not have any concrete opportunity or thing to look at.”
‘European independence’
This year, Trump has poured accelerant on existing tensions between Europe and the U.S. by pressuring Denmark to cede control of Greenland, the world’s largest island. That left many right-wing groups walking a narrow line between standing up for European sovereignty and maintaining their ideological alliance with the White House.
But calls for
“European independence”
by leaders such as European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have presented right-wingers with an opportunity to frame themselves as the true defenders of the Western alliance.
“It’s quite important, especially in this moment, to maintain a unity inside the Western world,” said Francesco Giubilei, president of Nazione Futura, another Italian think tank that has partnered with The Heritage Foundation. “It’s not easy. We understand that sometimes the position of Trump is different from the position of Europe. But we think that if in this moment, we create a split between the United States and Europe, we are doing a favor for China, we are doing a favor for Russia.”
Some of the organizations POLITICO contacted said they weren’t interested in funding from a foreign government. But where European laws prevent direct foreign funding of political parties, some are finding other means of collaboration.
Gerald Otten, a lawmaker with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, traveled to Washington in January as part of a delegation from the German Bundestag. Prior to his visit he had been invited by the U.S. embassy to discuss possible joint work. AfD officials are planning to travel to the U.S. for an event in March billed as a “counter Davos” by Republican member of Congress Anna Paulina Luna.
Markus Frohnmaier, a leading AfD foreign policy lawmaker and trustee of co-chair Alice Weidel,
will meet Rogers
on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference this week.
Scalea, of the Fondazione Machiavelli, said having Trump in the White House gave groups in Europe a sense they were no longer on the fringes.
“We have an ally, a powerful voice,” he said. “It’s not just a conspiracy theory that we are saying mass migration is making us weaker as a nation, but it’s something that is said also by the leader of our alliance. This is obviously useful for us.”

The Traitors: EU version

https://www.politico.eu/article/the-traitors-eu-version/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

Welcome to Declassified, a weekly humor column
.
The premise of the TV show “The Traitors” (or “De Verraders” in the original Dutch version): lock a bunch of people in a castle and get them to perform a series of tasks in exchange for the chance to win a bunch of money. However, some of those present are designated as ‘traitors’ and must do their best to eliminate the competition without being found out.
The premise of the
EU leaders’ retreat at Alden Biesen castle
on Friday: basically the same, except with a couple of former Italian prime ministers banging on about how much better things were in their day.
Being asked to go to a retreat in the Belgian countryside in February to talk about red tape with grumpy Uncle Viktor was perhaps the least appealing invitation to a castle since Dracula held his monthly cheese and wine evenings — “if possible, bring a vulnerable friend. Starts at 9 p.m. sharp, and I do mean sharp.”
But it didn’t stop António Costa from booking the EU’s top politicians — well, some of them — in for a bonding session at a castle in between the wedding of Luc and Elisabeth and a corporate away day for employees of a mid-sized accounting firm from Hasselt (probably).
Not everyone was keen.
“I can’t do it … I’m dying, it’s too cold!” Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, not unreasonably, told reporters on her way into the retreat.
A member of one national delegation who, alas, would only speak to my colleagues if both their own name and the name of their country were withheld was not happy with the location or the lack of parking at the castle and called the entire thing “logistical bullshit”, which is also the EU’s motto (
nugae vehiculariae
).
Would the disgruntled leaders have been swayed by the food offering? Starter was ‘king oyster mushroom carpaccio with a pepper emulsion’ (isn’t that just raw mushroom?) and dessert was a ‘medley of fresh fruits with sorbet’ (which is either a fruit salad given a fancy name or is fruit playing little bits of its greatest hits).
There are, of course, ways to make team-building exercises (sorry, high-level meetings on the future of Europe) more interesting. How about
a hologram of Silvio Berlusconi
, the ghost of sex parties past? In 2023, a hologram of the ex-Italian PM was used in the small town of Paestum to celebrate “Berlusconi Day,” on what would have been his 87th birthday.
Or you could book Kid Rock for a performance. Rock (how on earth do you refer to Kid Rock on second reference?) is fresh off his MAGA Super Bowl halftime show for people who don’t like foreign languages and could perform hits such as “Don’t Tell Me How to Live”, a favorite of Viktor Orbán’s, and “U Don’t Know Me”, as sung by whoever is this week’s Romanian prime minister. Mr (?) Rock also once guested on a song called “Get Your Lips Off My Beer”, a searing indictment of the single market.

European leaders have spent the week talking about how to make the EU more competitive — first with industry heavyweights in Antwerp, then behind closed doors at a leaders’ retreat in Belgium.
On this episode of EU Confidential, host Sarah Wheaton digs into what’s really behind the latest push to revive Europe’s economy. Are calls for deregulation and lower energy costs a genuine course correction — or another round of diagnosis without delivery?
POLITICO’s Zia Weise, fresh from the industry summit in Antwerp, joins the discussion on how chemical giants and other industrial players are pressing for relief from climate and energy rules. Marianne Gros examines the backlash over Brussels’ simplification drive and growing concerns about transparency and democratic safeguards. And Carlo Martuscelli breaks down the political fault lines exposed at the Alden Biesen retreat — and why so much of Mario Draghi’s reform agenda remains stalled.
Plus, Aitor Hernández-Morales joins us with the latest on political developments in Portugal.

As Keir Starmer flies to Germany for the Munich Security Conference, Westminster Insider Host Sascha O’Sullivan finds out if the Prime Minister’s time abroad has damaged him here at home – and if it has, if it’s been worth it.
Sascha spoke to half a dozen current or former Labour advisors or government insiders about Starmer’s approach to foreign policy. With the help of POLITICO Foreign and Defense Correspondent Esther Webber, she pieces together Starmer’s legacy on the world stage.
Olivia O’Sullivan, director of UK in a Changing World at Chatham House, says the Prime Minister has managed to secure “the least worst option” with Donald Trump.
And Peter Ricketts, former head of the U.K.’s diplomatic service, said the shift towards “a hyper-personalized world” demands Starmer’s presence.
“Unless you are in the room with Donald Trump, you’re not influencing him,” Ricketts added.

How The Pitt’s AI Drama is Playing Out in Real Hospitals
2026-02-13 03:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7378075/the-pitt-season-2-ai-hospitals/

In Thursday’s episode of
The Pitt
, the long-simmering tensions over the
use of AI
at the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center boiled over.
In season two of the five-time Emmy winning
medical drama
, a new attending physician, Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi), is determined to improve efficiencies at the hospital. She tells her skeptical staff that new AI systems can cut down their time spent on charting by 80%, allowing them to spend more time both at the bedside and at home.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
But in episode six, doctors discover that the AI tool has made up false details about a patient and confused “urology” for “neurology.”
“AI’s two percent error rate is still better than dictation,” Al-Hashimi says, adding that it needs to be proofread for errors. But an irate Dr. Campbell (Monica Bhatnagar), who works in internal medicine, responds: “I don’t really give a sh-t whether or not you want to use robots down here. I need accurate information in the medical record.”
Like many of the show’s themes, this storyline mirrors real-life debates happening in hospitals across the country. Two-thirds of physicians say they use AI to some degree, according to a
2025 survey
by the American Medical Association. Some have found it invaluable in providing care and reducing burnout. But other healthcare workers say that it is being rolled out too fast and makes too many errors for such a high-stakes field.
AI as a medical sounding board
In
The Pitt
, AI is introduced first and foremost as a tool for charting: the process by which doctors document their encounters with patients. Charting is one of the biggest pain points for doctors, as they often have to stay hours late to finish. For several years now, hospitals have implemented ambient AI scribes, which listen to conversations with patients and then summarize them for doctors’ charts.
Murali Doraiswamy, a physician and professor at Duke University School of Medicine, says that current AI scribes let doctors focus on patients rather than typing notes during appointments. But he says that the tools only actually save one or two minutes per encounter, because doctors then have to spend time editing what the AI has created (as Al-Hashimi notes on
The Pitt
). “It does not significantly save what we call pajama time,” he says. “But overall, it’s an improvement, and the hope is it gets better and better.”
Some AI charting tools go even farther. Last year, Presbyterian Healthcare Services in New Mexico, piloted an AI assistant called GW RhythmX, which can provide doctors with a summary of their upcoming patients’ medical history, potentially saving the doctor from having to cull through months of charts and lab files before the appointments.
Lori Walker, Presbyterian’s Chief Medical Information Officer, says the RhythmX tool can also provide solutions to complex patient problems. For instance, she says that a patient was recently admitted for an infected wound—but was allergic to many antibiotics that might have treated the bacteria. Previously, a doctor would consult an infectious disease specialist—a process that can take between 24 and 48 hours. Instead, the doctor queried the chatbot, and received an effective prescription immediately.
Sudheesha Perera, a second-year resident at the Yale School of Medicine, says that he and his colleagues use OpenEvidence, a large language model chatbot trained on vetted medical literature, on a near-daily basis. “If there’s a patient with an infection, I might ask it, ‘I picked this medication for this reason. What are the alternatives?” Perera says, noting that it’s faster than using Google or a medical textbook.
Perera is helping Yale build out an AI curriculum advising residents on best practices when using the technology. And at Yale’s Cardiovascular Data Science Lab, he uses Claude Code and Gemini to help him write code for data analysis. “I can just kind of tell it in plain text: ‘This is what my data looks like, and this is what I want.’ That’s really game changing in terms of getting things done.”
Mistakes and risks
But many fears and risks loom. Just like in
The Pitt
,
AI tools have made plenty of mistakes in real medical settings. Michelle Gutierrez Vo, a resident nurse and a president of the California Nurses Association and National Nurses Organizing Committee, says that three years ago, her hospital tried to implement a new tool in order to replace the judgment calls of case managers. But when they tested the tool, it mishandled many cases, including suggesting that a cancer patient who was admitted for a month of chemo treatment be discharged within two to three days.
“We have proven time and time again that the implementation or the use of AI is actually worse, and more expensive for them,” she says. A
2024 poll found that
two-thirds of unionized RNs said AI undermined them and threatened patient safety.
Gutierrez Vo worries that AI is simply being used to cut costs and increase profits, forcing already-dwindling staff to work even harder. This concern is echoed by
The Pitt
’s protagonist Dr. Robby (Noah Wyle): “It’ll make us more efficient—but hospitals will expect us to treat more patients without extra pay,” he says.
Meanwhile, there is a major concern about de-skilling: that even if AI helps doctors now, it will harm their intrinsic knowledge and decisionmaking during times when it is most needed. This idea is explored at the end of this week’s episode of
The Pitt
: a cyberattack forces the hospital to go fully analog and rely solely on their skills and training.
This scenario resonates with Perera. “When the patient is crashing in front of your eyes, you need to have knowledge at the front of your mind. An AI tool is too slow,” Perera says. “It’s very true that at the end of the day, we need to practice without tools.”
Perera is especially concerned that if a new generation of doctors becomes too reliant on AI tools without learning skills first, the entire medical field could be severely harmed. “The same kid who never wrote a college essay and just used ChatGPT might turn into the doctor that never wrote a critical assessment and plan and just uses OpenEvidence,” Perera says. “Teaching medical residents how to be good stewards of these tools, at the right time in their training, will be important.”
Doraiswamy hopes that tools will be built in ways that are designed to support the judgment of doctors rather than supplant them. “The more we can make AI make doctors ask the right questions, rather than automatically just taking the answer, the better it is,” he says. “We want something that makes us think.”

Trump judge slams DHS for blocking detainees' access to lawyers
2026-02-13 02:47:08 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/trump-ice-immigration-detention-judge-court-orders

A
Trump
-appointed federal judge said immigration enforcement agencies "violated noncitizen detainees' constitutional" rights at a Minnesota facility in a scathing ruling on Thursday.
Why it matters:
U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel's ruling that "policies and practices" at the
Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building
"all but extinguish a detainee's access to counsel" marked the 45th time that a judge nominated by President Trump had ruled against his mass detention agenda, per a
Politico
review.
Driving the news:
Brasel in an emergency restraining order that will remain in effect through Feb. 26 ruled ICE must give detained immigrants access to attorneys as soon as they've been taken into custody.
The order is in response to a class-action
lawsuit
filed last month against defendants including Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Department of Homeland Security and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on behalf of immigrant detainees.
The suit alleges that people were being detained without access to lawyers and denied confidential communication — a claim DHS rejected in a Thursday evening email following the ruling.
Zoom in:
However, Brasel wrote in the ruling that the government had put in place "obstacles" at Whipple that marked "an unconstitutional infringement" of noncitizens' rights to access counsel.
"It appears that in planning for
Operation Metro Surge
, the government failed to plan for the constitutional rights of its civil detainees," Brasel wrote of the Trump administration's
immigration crackdown in Minnesota
that was officially declared over on Thursday.
"The government suggests — with minimal explanation and even less evidence — that doing so would result in 'chaos,'" added the judge, whom Trump appointed during his first term.
"The Constitution does not permit the government to arrest thousands of individuals and then disregard their constitutional rights because it would be too challenging to honor those rights."
Zoom out:
Politico's review that was published before Brasel's ruling found that 373 judges have ruled against
Trump's mass detention policy
since July last year, with judges the president appointed backing the administration in just 20 of these cases.
Meanwhile, Biden-appointed judges comprise the largest number of rulings against the administration in these cases (122), then Obama-nominated ones (112) and then those picked by George W. Bush (43).
Clinton-nominated judges ruled against the administration 43 times, while those appointed by George H.W. Bush and Reagan have each ruled against the administration on the policy seven times
Thought bubble,
via Axios' Russell Contreras: The rulings show that some of Trump's most aggressive immigration enforcement moves are clashing even with some conservatives.
They come as polls show
rapidly declining support
among the American public over the way
ICE raids
have been conducted in U.S. cities.
What they're saying:
When asked for comment on Brasel's ruling and those by other Trump-appointed judges that have gone against the administration, a DHS spokespersoncalled claims that there are subprime conditions or overcrowding at the Whipple building "FALSE."
The facility is for processing and not detention and that undocumented immigrants "are quickly processed and transferred and transferred to permanent housing at a detention facility," per the emailed statement.
The spokesperson maintained those at Whipple have access to phones they can use to contact their families and lawyers and that ICE gives all arrested undocumented immigrants a court-approved list of free or low-cost attorneys.
"No lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States," the spokesperson added. "ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens."

Ukraine war briefing: Rubio to meet Zelenskyy in Munich as Russian strikes leave thousands without power
2026-02-13 02:38:05 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/13/ukraine-war-briefing-marco-rubio-meet-volodymyr-zelenskyy-munich

US secretary of state says ahead of Munich Security Conference appearance that ‘we live in a new era of geopolitics’; Ukrainian cities pounded in latest attacks. What we know on day 1,451
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has said he will have a chance to meet Volodymyr Zelenskyy at this week’s
Munich Security Conference
. A year after the vice-president, JD Vance,
stunned assembled dignitaries
with a verbal assault on many of the US’s closest allies in Europe, Rubio plans to take a less contentious but philosophically similar approach when he addresses the annual gathering on Saturday, US officials say. Before boarding his flight on Thursday evening, Rubio used reassuring words as he described Europe as important for Americans. “We’re very tightly linked together with Europe,” he told reporters. But he also made clear it wouldn’t be business as usual, saying: “We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to reexamine what that looks like.”
The war in Ukraine is on the conference’s agenda
, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron – who is making the trip to Germany – has said he hopes for a resumption of talks with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Macron said on Thursday he did not expect to speak with Putin in the coming days, and that European nations first needed to agree what they wanted from Russia. “It’s not a matter of days, there are preparations involved,” he told reporters after EU leaders’ talks.
Russia pounded Ukraine with ballistic missiles and drones overnight on Thursday, further battering its energy system
and leaving tens of thousands in the capital, Kyiv, and the cities of Dnipro and Odesa without heat, power and water, officials said. In Kyiv alone, about 3,500 apartment buildings were without heating on Thursday after the latest winter attack on Ukraine’s power grid knocked out supplies to nearly 2,600 high-rises, on top of the 1,100 already affected by previous strikes, said mayor Vitali Klitschko. More than 100,000 families were without electricity, according to private energy firm DTEK.
Odesa was hit twice in less than 24 hours
. Late on Thursday, the regional governor said a second wave of drone strikes had damaged houses, industrial sites and energy infrastructure and disrupted electricity, heating and water supplies. The attack also sparked a fire that engulfed one of the city’s markets, injuring one person, said the military administration. In the industrial south-eastern city of Dnipro, a combined missile and drone strike wounded four people, including a baby boy and a four-year-old girl, the regional governor said. In the north-eastern Kharkiv region bordering Russia, two people were killed and six more wounded in an attack on the railway hub of Lozova, prosecutors said.
Vladyslav Heraskevych has accused the
International Olympic Committee
of doing Russia’s propaganda for them after he was barred from racing in the Winter Games
because he wanted to wear a “helmet of memory” in honour of Ukraine’s war dead,
reports Sean Ingle
. In one of the most controversial decisions in recent Olympic history, the 27-year-old Ukrainian skeleton racer was informed only minutes before he was due to compete that his accreditation had been rescinded. A wave of support for Heraskevych swept Ukraine over the ban, while Zelenskyy said the IOC’s decision played “into the hands of aggressors”.
Ukraine’s western allies have already pledged around $35bn in military aid to Kyiv this year
, the British defence minister, John Healey, said on Thursday. The figure included new commitments by individual countries but also previous promises made by Ukraine’s allies, including €11.5bn ($13.6bn) already announced by Germany, a diplomat at Nato said. “We will step up military assistance to Ukraine,” Healey said after a meeting of Ukraine’s allies. “We will step up pressure on Russia.”
More than 220,000 people in Russia’s Belgorod region were left without electricity
after a Ukrainian attack caused an accident at a substation, governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Thursday. “Emergency crews are working. Restoration will take at least 4 hours,” he wrote on Telegram.
Another group of Russian and Ukrainian children have been reunited with their families by the US first lady, Melania Trump
, the White House said on Thursday, without specifying how many children were reunited or when it took place. It was the third time the first lady had brokered such a repatriation, it said.

Axios Finish Line: Embrace your insecurity
2026-02-13 02:25:05 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/axios-jim-vandehei-chatgpt-learn-insecurity

Axios CEO Jim VandeHei is here with advice on how to use your insecurities to motivate you.
For a video version of this column (and to see what Jim looked like as a 20-year-old punk),
click here
.
I wasn't a fast,
early adopter
of AI beyond basic search on ChatGPT,
Jim writes
, for the same reason many of you have balked at these muscular new tools: I was insecure about my ability to use it with any sophistication.
My internal dialogue: I'm too old, too non-technical, too much of a words guy to make it work.
Classic imposter moment: Who am I to think I can do this?
Why it matters:
But I used my insecurity as a powerful motivator, much like I did in my early media career when I feared everyone in D.C. was better read, better educated, better connected than I was. (Spoiler: They were!)
I attacked it.
I started building things — apps, tools, prototypes — with an AI model as my collaborator. No computer science degree. No coding boot camp. Just curiosity and stubbornness.
And it worked. Not because I suddenly became technical, but because I refused to let the insecurity win.
The big picture:
I've always assumed my insecurities are actually superpowers if used right. I wrote a
Finish Line column
on this very topic in 2022.
Since then, the science seems to confirm it: Insecurity might be exactly what we need.
The new
science of imposter syndrome
is striking. MIT Sloan researcher
Basima Tewfik
ran a lab experiment and found that people experiencing imposter thoughts exerted
13% more effort
than their peers when the pressure was on. When they felt overwhelmed, the self-doubt didn't crush them. It fueled them.
A massive
global meta-analysis
published last year reviewed 30 studies covering nearly 12,000 people and found that
62% of high-achieving professionals
experience imposter syndrome. That's not a bug in the human operating system. That's a feature — if you know how to use it.
Think about that:
The majority of successful people around you feel like frauds. Most of us do. The question isn't whether you have imposter syndrome. It's whether you're using it in a healthy way.
Here's a 2026 version
of how to leverage your insecurity in an AI world:
Be honest
— then get curious. My
original advice
was to understand your weaknesses. I'd sharpen that point. The people thriving in this AI moment aren't the ones with the fanciest résumés — they're the ones willing to say "I don't know," then obsessively ask questions until they do.
Attack the weakness daily.
When AI hit, I could have done what a lot of people my age did: Delegate it to younger staffers, nod along in meetings, fake fluency. Instead, I spent nights and weekends building things — terrible at first, then less terrible, then actually useful. You'll be shocked by how quickly persistent effort erodes a limitation you assumed was permanent. The gap between "I can't do this" and "I just did this" is smaller than you think.
Weaponize the fury.
Michael Jordan
manufactured slights
to
fuel his competitive edge
. That still works. But in this era, the best target for your fury isn't a rival or a critic — it's complacency. The people falling behind right now aren't the ones who lack talent. They're the ones who've gotten too comfortable. Channel the chip on your shoulder into relentless learning, not just relentless competing.
Give yourself grace — but not an excuse.
I still can't sing. I still can't dance. I'll never be great at Trivial Pursuit. At some point, lamenting what you can't do is wasted energy. But — and this is the key update — don't confuse "I'm not naturally good at this" with "I can't learn this." Those are very different things. The first is self-awareness. The second is a cop-out.
The bottom line:
No sane person is as confident as they seem. That
global study
confirms it: Most high achievers walk around feeling like frauds. The successful people in my life simply accept that ... and channel it.

Lawmakers resign themselves to lengthy DHS shutdown
2026-02-13 01:46:52 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/congress-shutdown-dhs-ice-00779881

Lawmakers left Washington for a week-long recess Thursday, showing no urgency to avert a shutdown at the Department of Homeland Security that will take effect Saturday morning.
The overwhelming sense of resignation reflected the reality that neither Republicans nor Democrats saw an obvious path forward to resolving their differences over President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and whether to rein it in as part of legislation to fund DHS.
Though negotiations between the White House and Senate Democrats continue, the trajectory of talks suggest DHS funding will be lapsed for at least 10 days — meaning the soonest any resolution would be reached is in the political hothouse around Trump’s State of the Union address on Feb. 24. The lack of progress has even raised the prospect that Trump’s speech to Congress might be postponed, and some Democrats are mulling a boycott.
“
This ‘nyah nyah’ is going to go on for a while,” Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) said Thursday.
Even if a deal were struck, Kennedy added, “I’m not entirely convinced that anybody would vote for it. I can’t see the Dems voting for anything because they’re not going to get pounded for funding ICE. And the Republicans on my side are not going to get pounded for hurting ICE.”
Negotiations between Democrats and White House officials were ongoing as of Thursday evening. Democrats, who have floated a series of guardrails on immigration enforcement agencies in exchange for funding DHS, were expected to formally respond to the latest White House offer over the weekend after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries bashed it Thursday without disclosing specifics on what was contained within.
The absence of leaked bill text in the exchanges between Democrats and the White House was one subtle sign of encouragement for those watching the negotiations that both sides were taking the talks seriously.
As they prepared to leave Washington, Republicans continued to knock key demands from Democrats, including a proposal that immigration enforcement agents seek judicial warrants before entering private property.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune said that Republicans and Democrats were “not close.” A senior White House official granted anonymity during a call with reporters warned that the administration wouldn’t “accept concessions that meaningfully affect its ability to carry out its immigration enforcement agenda.”
Even if a compromise emerges, some Democrats worry that Republicans will insist on so many qualifications that any of their proposed guardrails would be rendered toothless.
“We can't pass reform that has exceptions and caveats — ‘you can't wear masks, except for seven different situations where you can. You can't bust into people's homes, except 20 different situations where you can,’” said Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the subcommittee overseeing DHS appropriations. “The offers we've gotten are just not serious.”
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) said it was paramount that both sides “sit down with each other face to face and talk about what you’re doing.” But there were no plans for an in-person meeting
.
It will likely take weeks for the public to start feeling pain from a lapse in DHS funding, meaning each side will feel limited political pressure to give in right away. TSA screeners are not set to miss paychecks until March, and FEMA coffers are likely full enough to respond to natural disasters for the near future.
After the Senate failed to pass DHS funding legislation Thursday, lawmakers in both chambers left Washington with guidance to be ready to come back in a matter of days if Democrats and the White House were able to strike a deal – something that members didn’t see as a realistic possibility before the end of next week.
“Both sides could dig in and just let this thing drag on,” Thune said. “I don’t think that’s in anybody’s best interest.”
Jennifer Scholtes, Mia McCarthy, Myah Ward contributed to this report.

Court rebukes Trump administration for denying immigration detainees access to lawyers
2026-02-13 01:33:22 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/court-trump-administration-denying-immigration-lawyers-00779762

A federal judge ruled Thursday that the Trump administration has been violating the rights of people detained by ICE in Minnesota, saying the agency had stashed them in an ill-equipped, overcrowded facility without access to attorneys.
U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel said it appeared the Trump administration had surged law enforcement into the Twin Cities without accounting for “the constitutional rights of its civil detainees" held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
“The government suggests—with minimal explanation and even less evidence—that doing so would result in ‘chaos,’” wrote Brasel, an appointee of President Donald Trump. “The Constitution does not permit the government to arrest thousands of individuals and then disregard their constitutional rights because it would be too challenging to honor those rights.”
The judge ordered the administration to dramatically revamp conditions in the Bishop Henry Whipple federal building, and provide routine and unmonitored phone access to detainees, including the chance to alert attorneys and family members at least one hour before being transferred out of state.
The ruling came just hours after
the White House announced an end to its recent immigration crackdown
, which saw as many as 3,000 federal agents flood the Minneapolis region to conduct mass deportation operations.
Brasel repeatedly noted that prior to launching Operation Metro Surge, immigration officials had allowed attorneys to meet in person with detainees at the Whipple Building, on the grounds of Fort Snelling, southeast of Minneapolis. Such visits were discontinued once the operation began, the judge said.
Brasel challenged the notion that the government has enough personnel to surge federal agents into the area but lacked the resources to let detainees consult with attorneys.
“Defendants allocated substantial resources to sending thousands of agents to Minnesota, detaining thousands of people, and housing them in their facilities. Defendants cannot suddenly lack resources when it comes to protecting detainees’ constitutional rights,” Brasel wrote.
“In similar fashion, Defendants’ eleventh-hour declaration claims that ‘[a]ny change to current operating procedures would require significant resources that Whipple does not have and is not required to have based on ICE Policy,’” the judge said. “But the United States Constitution—not Whipple’s operational capacity or internal ICE policies—is what sets the floor for reasonable access to counsel.”
It’s the latest and perhaps most pointed rebuke yet from Minnesota federal judges who have
called out the administration
for
violating court orders
by
illegally transferring detainees out of state
, ignoring release orders and
missing numerous legal deadlines.
In a related development Thursday, the Justice Department moved to drop the criminal cases against two men charged in connection with a Jan. 14 incident in Minneapolis that led to an ICE officer shooting a man in the leg.
Prosecutors asked a federal court to dismiss charges of assaulting or impeding a federal officer filed against Alfredo Aljorna and Julio Sosa Celis. An FBI agent previously told the court that the men took part in a melee in which ICE officers were struck with a shovel and broom handle, leading to one firing a shot that struck Sosa.
But, in
a one-page filing
Thursday evening, the government backed away from that story.
"Newly discovered evidence in this matter is materially inconsistent with the allegations in the Complaint Affidavit," prosecutors said, asking a federal judge to dismiss the charges with prejudice, meaning they could not be refiled.
The abrupt about-face followed an aggressive effort by prosecutors to keep the two men locked up — even after a federal judge ordered their release — as well as target other witnesses to the incident for deportation. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson, who ordered the release of Aljorna and Sosa from criminal detention, subsequently ordered ICE not to deport any witnesses before they could testify in the matter.
After ICE detained the two men — despite their release from criminal custody — Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz
ordered their release
once again.
And the 19-year-old partner of one of the two men was similarly ordered released from ICE custody — but not before she was abruptly transferred from Minnesota to El Paso to New Mexico. A judge there, Margaret Strickland, ordered the woman’s release on an emergency basis after learning that her one-year-old son had been severely burned and was slated for emergency surgery in Minnesota.
Aljorna's attorney, Frederick J. Goetz, noted in a statement that the judge made the rare move to dismiss the charges with prejudice, meaning that cannot be filed again. "I commend the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota for doing the right thing," he said. "It speaks to the continued professionalism and integrity of the lawyers in that office.

Derry Girls Creator Turns to Crime in Netflix’s Intriguing How to Get to Heaven From Belfast
2026-02-13 01:11:47 GMT
https://time.com/7378326/how-to-get-to-heaven-from-belfast-review/

When a storyteller has made their magnum opus—a work that brilliantly synthesizes their experience and voice and most profound insights, a tale only they could tell—what are they supposed to do next? Many of the past decade’s smartest TV creators have, in response to this impossible problem, turned to a life of crime.
Donald Glover
followed up the category-exploding
Atlanta
with serial-killer standom satire
Swarm
and a tragicomic take on
Mr. & Mrs. Smith
, about married assassins. After rendering a contemporary Native American community in specific, surreal, often hilarious detail in
Reservation Dogs
, Sterlin Harjo turned to noir with
The Lowdown
.
Phoebe Waller-Bridge
plumbed the darkly comic depths of sex-positive feminism in the first season of
Fleabag
, only returning to the project after creating the deliriously fun cat-and-mouse spy thriller
Killing Eve
.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Like those auteurs, Lisa McGee broke through with a sui generis comedy that mined aspects of her own experience to find authentic humor in a harrowing situation.
Derry Girls
, which followed teens in McGee’s native Derry in the years preceding 1998’s Good Friday Agreement, was a raucous, joke-dense show that juxtaposed mundane adolescent rites of passage with the daily horrors of life in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. Now McGee, too, is back with a crime drama—one bound to earn comparisons to Sharon Horgan’s post-
Catastrophe
murder romp,
Bad Sisters
. Combining the latter show’s core of complicated relationships between women (and its fondness for outfitting those women in enviable knitwear) with the sidesplittingly verbose, extremely Irish sensibility of
Derry Girls
, her new Netflix series
How to Get to Heaven From Belfast
lands as both an example of the pivot to crime drama and a commentary on it. The plot gets a bit woolly towards the end, the mix of tones doesn’t always work, and I sometimes wished I could watch its central girlfriends do anything
besides
play amateur detective. Still, even if you’re over whodunits, McGee’s cleverly meta spin on an overdone genre and her genius for comedy, dialogue, and character development make for an altogether good craic.
The premise is enough of a murder-show Mad Lib to suggest, correctly, that a creator of this caliber won’t be taking it at face value. Three childhood friends are summoned to the wake of the estranged fourth member of their high school clique, with whom they shared an awful secret. In a series of flashbacks, we’re gradually given context for the haunting image of four girls watching fire consume a cabin. Now pushing 40 and navigating various midlife crises, the women are ensnared in a tangle of new and old mysteries. Relevant clichés include:
You can’t go home again
.
Hurt people hurt people.
The past is never dead. It’s not even past.
This otherwise unpromising setup is made not just bearable, but a genuine pleasure by the central trio. Self-dramatizing Robyn (Sinéad Keenan from
Being Human
) has grown up to be a harried mum of three rambunctious boys, wasting her spark in a meh marriage. Dara (
Industry
and
A Thousand Blows
standout
Caoilfhionn Dunne) is a semi-closeted lesbian whose life has been circumscribed by her Catholic faith and familial caretaking duties; she’s a bit awkward, and you get the sense that loneliness has made her this way. To the extent that
Belfast
has a single protagonist, it’s Saoirse (Roisin Gallagher, recently seen in
Lazarus
and
The Dry
), the writer of—meta conceit incoming—a TV crime drama called
Murder Code
. Feuding with its star and squabbling through an engagement to a coworker, she’s having doubts about the path she’s chosen. “What even is it?” she demands, referring it
Murder Code
. “It’s just, ‘Look, someone’s got themselves murdered again.’ Is that what I do?” “You entertain a lot of people,” her flack protests. Saoirse: “So do f-ckin’ clowns.”
If you hadn’t already suspected that McGee had more in mind than
someone’s got themselves murdered again
, here’s your giant, flashing neon sign. Whether or not her profession makes Saoirse the creator’s surrogate, she’s certainly the character whose perspective gives the show its thematic framing. Funny, foulmouthed, Irish-slang-laden banter is McGee’s signature; who else would make space in a tense scene for someone to opine that Belle from Disney’s
Beauty and the Beast
“is a dick. The way she slags off her town like she’s the only person who’s ever read a book”? When they’re being serious, though, Robyn, Dara, and even Saoirse tend to have critical things to say about the habit writers like Saoirse have of manipulating not just the worlds they dream up, but also real people they treat as posable characters.
Belfast
is especially alert to how far from reality the supposedly true stories we tell ourselves and each other can be.
Accordingly, a series of mostly unpredictable twists reveals, bit by bit, that everything these women think they know about that fiery night 20 years ago—that is, everything they think they know about the ordeal that still defines each one in her own mind—is wrong. In that sense, every choice they’ve made as adults has been premised on a lie. It’s a fascinating head trip to send the characters on, at the same time as they’re motoring around the emerald countryside and beyond, scrambling to figure out what actually happened to their friend and, of course, stop their potentially ruinous secret from getting out.
I would’ve been content to watch this quieter inquiry into what it means to base your identity on bad information develop amid the investigation and the unparalleled repartee (“DNA doesn’t wash off. It’s like Catholicism”). But as the season goes on, and especially in its second half, the mystery gets too big. The cast of characters expands in directions that verge on fantasy—which does, at least, enable a virtuosically unhinged performance from
Derry Girls
star Saoirse-Monica Jackson, albeit in a role that could have been guest-written by Emerald Fennell. And the monolithic theme that is
trauma
threatens to overshadow McGee’s unique and specific exploration of how we cobble ourselves together out of simplistic, often spurious, narratives.
Belfast
is doing too many things, metamorphosing too many times, to succeed at everything it tries. But it works more often than it doesn’t, because it’s constructed around the same two pillars that made
Derry Girls
so solid: lovable, complicated characters and gallows humor that is both skillfully written and flawlessly delivered by an ideal cast. That doesn’t necessarily mean I’m convinced that McGee is just as well suited to crime drama (or meta crime drama) as she was to comedy. It would be a shame if, as popular as it is, crime became the only genre in this austere, murder-mad era of streaming that could support original stories from accomplished creators.
Belfast
is an enjoyable enough place to visit, but
Derry
still feels like home.

Pentagon to Restock Massive Ordinance Penetrator Bombs Dropped by B-2s on Iran
2026-02-13 01:00:02 GMT
https://www.airandspaceforces.com/pentagon-restock-massive-ordinance-penetrator-bombs-dropped-b-2s-iran/

The U.S. military is moving to restock its supply of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bunker-busting bombs it used against Iran’s underground nuclear facilities last June, according to Air Force documents.
The Air Force is finalizing a deal with Boeing worth over $100 million to replace the
bombs it used to pummel
Iran’s Fordow and Natanz nuclear sites.
In partially redacted documents released on a
government website
Feb. 12, the service said the acquisition is “critically needed to replenish the inventory of GBU-57s expended during Operation Midnight Hammer.”
The service is also continuing its competition for the next-generation weapons to take out deeply buried targets.
U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit stealth bombers dropped 14 weapons on the sites in the operation on June 22, 2025. Each of the B-2s carried two MOPs. Six of the bombs were dropped on Fordow, and two were dropped on Natanz. Operation Midnight Hammer was the first time the 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs were
used operationally
.
The redacted documents are intended to provide a justification for not awarding a fully competitive contract for the specially designed munition.
“This action is essential to restore operational readiness … and ensure Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) possesses the necessary assets to support strategic contingency war plans for all Combatant Commands (COCOMs),” according to the document.
The documents do not say how many MOPs the U.S. government is purchasing in the forthcoming deal, which is set to be the last lot of GBU-57s purchased by the U.S. military before moving on to its new Next-Generation Penetrator, or NGP.
Even before the release of the documents, there were signs that the Pentagon was repurposing funds so it could buy more of the bombs. A
reprogramming request
in August of last year for $123 million stated that funds were needed to replace the MOPs used in Operation Midnight Hammer.
The newly released documents indicate that the Air Force is seeking full MOP weapon systems. The document states that the weapon’s tailkits are projected to be delivered starting on Jan. 10, 2028, to “replace expended units.” Components for all-up rounds—the bombs themselves—are also being purchased.
The exact number of MOPs being purchased, along with other delivery dates appear to be part of the redacted portions of the document.
Operation Midnight Hammer involved 125 aircraft, including F-35s, F-22s, F-16s, refueling aircraft, and the bomb-dropping B-2s. The U.S. also struck a third facility at Isfahan with more than two dozen Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles.
The MOP has a hardened casing that can slice through layers of rock, concrete, and steel. Inside the bomb, sensors are designed to detect the area the bomb is passing through before detonating at a chosen depth.
“The weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded,” Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine told reporters after the strikes.
The weapons traveled down ventilation shafts at the facilities at over 1,000 feet per second, according to Caine.
“A bomb has three effects that causes damage: blast, fragmentation, and overpressure,” he said. “In this case, the primary kill mechanism in the mission space was a mix of overpressure and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware.”
It is unclear how many MOPs have been built in previous years and precisely how many remain.
The MOP was initially tested from a B-52. But it was always intended to be dropped by the B-2, since the heavily protected targets the bomb was designed to hit were expected to be defended by top-tier air defense systems that the stealth bomber could penetrate. The weapon achieved initial operational capability in 2011.
The Air Force performed test drops from B-2s from 2014 to 2016 followed by further tests in 2017 to validate enhancements. The most recent upgrade to the bomb is the Large Penetrator Smart Fuse modification, which was tested in 2020 against a tunnel target. Three more tests were conducted between 2021 and 2022. Two full-scale tests were performed in 2024 to verify its integration on the B-2.
The military appears set to move on to MOP’s successor after this new buy.
“The MOP program production is concluding after these procurement efforts conclude,” the document states.
Last September, the
Air Force issued a prototype contract
for NGP development. That followed a March 2024
request for information
from industry for the weapon, seeking concepts for “a prototype penetrator warhead design capable of defeating Hard and Deeply Buried Targets.”
The 2024 document said the design should not exceed 22,000 pounds, roughly two-thirds the size of the MOP.
The new B-21 Raider bomber is known to be smaller than the B-2, at roughly two-thirds the size, with less payload capacity. It is unclear if the MOP could fit in a B-21, which is expected to enter service within the next couple of years.
The Air Force document refers to the Next-Generation Penetrator as “a similar MOP-like capability” that will have “superior technology.”
The government appears to be pursuing a more competitive approach to the NGP than the GBU-57, as Boeing has control over much of the weapon’s intellectual property and software.
For NGP, the Pentagon is seeking contracts that allow “independent development, modification, and improvement of all hardware, software algorithms, and logical interfaces related to NGP and subsequent MOP weapon systems,” according to the recently released documents. “This approach will empower a diverse supplier base to compete on innovation, performance, and cost, driving technological advancements.”

Congress plunges into "no pressure" government shutdown
2026-02-13 00:40:34 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/13/government-shutdown-dhs-democrats-trump

Congress is sliding toward a
"no-pressure" shutdown
, with both parties content to claim political wins as a department backfilled with billions of dollars experiences a funding lapse.
Why it matters:
The lack of urgency to try to prevent the Department of Homeland Security shutdown at day's end Friday underscores how routine funding interruptions have become.
It also reveals the lowered political stakes both sides see in allowing the latest one to take hold.
Lawmakers left Washington on Thursday for international trips and a weeklong recess, despite circumstances that in a previous era would have precluded them from taking a break without fear of political consequences.
Now, each side
sees an upside to letting DHS shut down.
For Democrats, refusing to vote for DHS funding without significant GOP concessions on
ICE reforms
plays well to a base that is demanding its party to do more to oppose President Trump (especially with
polling showing
even independents have soured on ICE's tactics).
And Republicans have the comfort of knowing
ICE
and CBP are funded because the GOP gave the agencies $75 billion through the massive reconciliation package last year.
Driving the news:
Before lawmakers skipped town Thursday (with many headed to the Munich Security Conference in Germany), the sides were not anywhere close to a deal.
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's Democrats on Thursday rejected multiple attempts from GOP leaders to pass a short-term DHS funding measure. Before that, Democrats spent the morning meeting about the Trump administration's attempted indictments of multiple Democratic lawmakers, not
government funding.
Senate Democrats also reviewed the legislative text of a counteroffer from the White House on ICE reforms, sources told Axios. The proposal was panned as insufficient.
Congress isn't expected back in Washington until the week of Feb. 23. The shutdown would be 10 days deep by then.
The big picture
: It would be the third shutdown of President Trump's second term, with Democrats again seizing on government funding as one of their only points of leverage to confront the White House over its mass deportation program.
The standoff over funding for DHS intensified dramatically after a string of federal law enforcement shootings in U.S. cities this year, particularly the killing of
two American citizens
in Minneapolis in January.
Reality check:
There are still pressure points pushing Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D) toward a deal.
The DHS shutdown may impact
airport travel
, disaster response and cyber monitoring starting as soon as Friday,
Axios' Herb Scribner writes.
And as lawmakers found out during the record-breaking government shutdown last year, the longer a shutdown drags on, the more it affects essential government services — and the shorter the public's patience can become.

Chloe Kim Usually Crushes The Olympics. So Why Is She So Happy With Silver?
2026-02-13 00:34:13 GMT
https://time.com/7378341/chloe-kim-2026-winter-olympics-snowboarding-halfpipe-silver-medal/

You’d be forgiven for disbelieving the smile on
Chloe Kim’s
face Thursday night in Livigno, Italy, after she finished with a silver medal in the women’s Olympic halfpipe snowboarding finals. Kim’s victories at the Olympics are typically inevitable. And after she finished first in qualifying earlier in the week, it seemed she had shaken the effects of the dislocated left shoulder she suffered back in early January. Winners refuse to accept second place, right?
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
But upon further review, Kim’s jubilant reception of the silver medal at the
Milano Cortina Games
made all kinds of sense. In fact, this hardware may wind up meaning more to her than the golds she took home from PyeongChang in 2018 and Beijing four years ago.
“Absolutely,” says Kim. “I mean, a month ago, I wasn’t even sure if I would be here. I could get emotional thinking about it. I really worked hard to get here. So this medal means so much.”
Following the competition, she walked down a snowy hill at the Livigno Snow Park halfpipe venue, hand-in-hand with her boyfriend,
Myles Garrett
of the Cleveland Browns, the NFL’s reigning defensive player of the year, who stood with Kim’s family and friends at the bottom of the halfpipe, snapping photos of Kim in action. “Exciting but terrifying,” Garrett said, about watching Kim contort her body in the air on a snowboard.
She’s got reason to be happy, personally and professionally. The new Olympic gold medalist,
Goan Choi
of South Korea, is now the youngest Olympic snowboard gold medalist, at 17 years, 101 days. Kim, who was also 17 when she won Olympic gold in PyeongChang, has become a mentor for Choi. If Kim walks away from snowboarding—“I’m aware that I can’t do this forever,” she says—she’d leave the sport in good hands.
“She’s my baby. I’ve known her since she was so little, and I’m so proud of her,” says Kim. “It means so much to me to know that I’ve inspired a whole new generation.”

Chloe Kim on Going for Her Third Olympic Gold, Her Pet Snake, and Her NFL Boyfriend
The night began in typical Chloe Kim fashion. Seven of the 12 finalists fell in their first run in snowy conditions, which made landing tricks more of a challenge. But Kim made no such mistakes, and her run was visibly superior, even through the snowfall. Her score, at 88.00, led the competition.
Each Olympic halfpipe finalist gets three runs, with the highest score the only one that counts. Could anyone surpass Kim in the final two runs? It had never happened before in the Games.
Kim had even held back in her first run. “I’ll admit, I went pretty safe on it,” she says. “Didn’t go as big as I was in practice, mainly because I was watching all these girls take slams, and I was like, let’s just get to the bottom.”
Entering her second run, Kim still held the lead. She tried to stretch her limits. “I wanted to try something I’d never done before,” says Kim. “I wanted to make history.” She fell.
Choi had a scary-looking accident in her first run; she remained in the middle of the halfpipe for a few minutes while receiving medical attention, but was able to ride to the bottom of her own accord. Choi thought about dropping out of the event.
Instead, she stunned the Livigno Snow Park by scoring a 90.25 on her final run, upping the evening’s ante. For the first time at the Olympics, Kim trailed. So she’d have to come through in the evening’s final attempt. “My coach said, you know, you could do your first run better, or you can go for it,” says Kim. “I wanted to go for it. Because that’s what I do.”
She fell again, allowing Choi to claim the gold. “The snow really started to come down, the wall started to get a little sticky,” says Kim. “No excuses here. I should have made that mental note when I dropped in and felt it on my first hit. Yeah, I couldn’t come through. But all good.”
Kim made a beeline for Choi to congratulate her. “She took a heavy slam, got back up and won the damn thing,” says Kim. “That is badass.” Choi is not only the youngest Olympic snowboarding champion: she’s also the
youngest X-Games halfpipe titleist ever
, winning the event in 2023 and unseating Kim for that distinction as well.
Kim fell short in her bid to be the first snowboarder to win three straight Olympic golds. “I don’t know if there really was a weight on my shoulders,” she says. “I feel like every time I go into a competition, it’s always like, ‘Oh, she can make history here. She could do this. She could do that.’ I’m just here to snowboard and whatever medal I get in doing so, great.”
On Kim’s itinerary upon her U.S. reentry: shoulder surgery. “I’m excited for it to not be popping out all the time,” she says. Kim believes the injury cost her the key pre-Games training time needed to execute a flawless plan.
Not that she’s at all bummed about it.  “In my eyes, I’m a winner,” says Kim. “Because I was able to persevere and fight through.”

North Korea’s claim that Japan has breached a diplomatic “red line” by deepening security partnerships is less about Tokyo’s defence moves than about Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s decisive victory at the polls, analysts say, as a weaker mandate could have pushed her to negotiate with Pyongyang.
With a commanding majority secured in Sunday’s election, Takaichi now faces fewer domestic constraints as she signals plans to expand Japan’s defence cooperation with Western partners and potentially...

The One Democrat Who Voted for House Republicans’ Voter Identification Bill
2026-02-12 23:47:35 GMT
https://time.com/7378333/voter-id-requirements-house-bill-trump-democrat-cuellar/

House Republicans have passed an election reform bill backed by President Donald Trump that would introduce stricter voter identification requirements, joined by a single Democrat who broke party lines to support the legislation.
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility, or SAVE America, Act, which passed by an otherwise party-line vote of 218-213 on Wednesday, would require voters to provide proof of citizenship and photo identification to cast ballots in all 50 states, among other changes. It now heads to the Senate, where it faces slim odds of garnering the 60 votes it would need to overcome a potential filibuster.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
An earlier version of the legislation passed the House last year with the backing of four Democrats. But on Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas was the only member of the party to vote for the revised bill, which includes additional requirements pushed by Trump.
“I support the SAVE America Act because I believe in the fundamental principle: American citizens should decide American elections,” Cuellar said in a statement
posted
on X. He cited similarly strict identification standards for voters in his home state, which he said “has some of the strongest election security laws in the country.”
Cuellar also stated that already-registered voters’ registration status would not change under the bill, and that the legislation would require states to “accommodate name changes and accept multiple, commonly held forms of identification.”

Trump’s Push to ‘Nationalize’ Elections, Explained
Opponents of the bill have argued that its requirements would be challenging for many American citizens to meet. A 2023 Brennan Center for Justice
survey
showed that 9.1 percent of voting-age Americans––about 21.3 million people––do not have documents proving their citizenship readily available. Roughly half of U.S. citizens, meanwhile, do not have a passport. And as many as 69 million American women’s birth certificates do not reflect their legal names since changing their surnames following marriage.
Cuellar noted in his statement that the bill allows for citizens to show proof of identification through an affidavit, in lieu of traditional documents.
“At the end of the day, election security and voter access go together,” Cuellar concluded. “When Americans trust the system, our democracy grows stronger. That’s why I voted yes.”
The bill appears all-but doomed in the Senate, given Republicans’ slim majority and Democrats’ opposition to similar proposals in the past. And one Republican Senator has already openly opposed the legislation.
“When Democrats attempted to advance sweeping election reform legislation in 2021, Republicans were unanimous in opposition because it would have federalized elections, something we have long opposed,” Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
posted
on X on Wednesday. “Now, I’m seeing proposals such as the SAVE Act and MEGA that would effectively do just that. Once again, I do not support these efforts.”
Murkowski stressed that the Constitution provides “states the authority to regulate the ‘times, places, and manner’ of holding federal elections,” and added that “one-size-fits-all” mandates “seldom work in places like Alaska.”
“Election Day is fast approaching. Imposing new federal requirements now, when states are deep into their preparations, would negatively impact election integrity by forcing election officials to scramble to adhere to new policies likely without the necessary resources,” she continued. “Ensuring public trust in our elections is at the core of our democracy, but federal overreach is not how we achieve this.”
Trump and Republican supporters of the legislation have contended that it is a necessary measure to combat fraud in elections, though research indicates such fraud is
very rare
.
“That’s it. That’s all that the bill does. Proof of citizenship and photo ID to vote,” Speaker Mike Johnson said in
remarks
following the bill’s House passage. “This has become a bitter partisan fight and it’s madness to us … We’re hoping that some Democrats in the Senate will come to their senses and do the right thing for the people.”
In addition to the proof of citizenship and photo identification requirements, the bill would also mandate that states share voter information with the Department of Homeland Security.
Cuellar, a conservative Democrat who has been serving in the House since 2005, was charged along with his wife last year with bribery, money laundering, and conspiracy. Federal authorities
alleged
that the couple accepted around $600,000 in bribes from an oil and gas company in Azerbaijan and a bank in Mexico City between 2014 and 2021. Trump
pardoned
the couple in December.
“This pardon gives us a clean slate. The noise is gone. The work remains. And I intend to meet it head on,” Cuellar wrote in a
post
thanking the President.

House leaders say lawmakers can't attend Munich Security Conference as official delegation
2026-02-12 23:46:09 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/gop-munich-security-conference-shutdown-00779083

MUNICH — House Republican leaders are telling lawmakers traveling to the Munich Security Conference on their own dime that they will no longer be able to attend as part of an official House delegation.
The office of House Foreign Affairs Chair
Brian Mast
(R-Fla.) and the Marine Corps, which were handling logistics for the delegation to the high-profile gathering, contacted congressional offices to clarify that access to the conference was arranged through an official delegation that was dissolved, according to two people familiar with the guidance.
Speaker
Mike Johnson
’s office notified the lawmakers this week that all official travel, including their Munich visit,
would be canceled
during a likely Homeland Security Department shutdown. That leaves members who plan to travel privately needing to find other accreditation.
The possibility some lawmakers won’t attend the conference represents a major break with the yearslong precedent of bipartisan groupings joining a summit that offers unique perspective into high-level thinking in Washington and among allies. But House members are facing mounting pressure from Johnson’s orbit not to go to the weekend security event with the agency shutdown looming on Saturday.
The episode underscores how Washington’s funding impasse is spilling into transatlantic diplomacy. About two dozen members had been planning to attend the annual conference, which convenes global leaders, defense officials and lawmakers.
A Mast spokesperson declined to comment.
Rep.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
(D-NY.), who is set to speak at the event, was still traveling to Munich as scheduled, according to two people familiar with her plans. She was on her way Thursday evening and had not been notified of any issues with her credentials, one of the people said. They, like others interviewed, were granted anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
It’s not clear what, if any punishment, members will face who defied the order not to use their accreditation. The speaker’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Rep.
Yassamin Ansari
(D-Ariz.) plans to attend as well, regardless of the Homeland Security funding impasse. “Domestic immigration policy is foreign policy, and Trump’s cruel detention practices shape how the world reads our values,” Ansari said in a statement. “When the U.S. dehumanizes people in detention, we undermine our human rights credibility abroad, strengthen authoritarian narratives and fuel further displacement and desperation.”
Johnson
barred use of official funds for lawmaker travel
during an upcoming recess if the department’s funding lapses, keeping with House protocol. With the Senate failing to strike an agreement, and
Senate Democrats voting down
a short-term funding patch on Thursday, the Homeland Security shutdown is likely to occur early Saturday.
The White House and Democrats have made little progress in bridging the gap this week on potential reforms to immigration enforcement agencies. The House and Senate were already scheduled to be out next week, but leaders could call lawmakers back to Washington to quickly vote on the funding.
Rep.
Joe Wilson
(R-S.C.), a senior member of the House Foreign Affairs and Armed Services panels, called it "a shame" that lawmakers might miss the international confab. But he defended Johnson’s stance.
“It’s a very responsible position by the speaker which matches the irresponsibility of the Senate Democrats to shut down the government," Wilson said. "And so the responsible act is to be ever available to end the shutdown."
A military flight for the conference planned to depart Thursday afternoon, but only senators were expected to be on it.

Throughout the Putin era, the owners of Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport fought off every takeover attempt. Wartime nationalization proved their undoing.
2026-02-12 23:42:43 GMT
https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/02/13/throughout-the-putin-era-the-owners-of-moscow-s-domodedovo-airport-fought-off-every-takeover-attempt-wartime-nationalization-proved-their-undoing

Dmitry Kamenshchik, now the former owner of Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport, isn’t giving up. After losing every appeal in the nationalization of one of Russia’s largest airports — and after the country’s Supreme Court declined to review his complaint — he is once again
challenging
the state’s seizure of the asset and its transfer to entities linked to Vladimir Putin’s longtime associate Arkady Rotenberg. A hearing date has yet to be set. But another rejection, which seems all but certain, would likely mark the end of Kamenshchik’s long battle with the Kremlin — a fight that has stretched across much of Putin’s quarter-century in power. Meduza looks back at the history of that protracted struggle.
From shuttle hub to major airport
Moscow’s Domodedovo Airport didn’t begin as a sleek European aviation hub. In the early 1990s, it was a launchpad for shuttle traders — small-scale entrepreneurs ferrying cheap consumer goods from China to sell at Russia’s sprawling open-air markets.
At the center of this transformation was Dmitry Kamenshchik, a native of Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg). By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, he had already studied power engineering, served in the army, and worked in the Urals — and was back in school, studying philosophy at Moscow State University. But the upheaval of the 1990s proved more compelling than academia. With partners, he began building cargo operations out of Domodedovo, leasing several Soviet-designed Ilyushin aircraft. Business boomed in the era of shuttle trading.
By the end of the decade, Kamenshchik’s company, East Line, controlled not only cargo operations but the airport itself. In 1998, the firm secured a 75-year lease; a year later, it bought the facility at auction. Almost immediately after formalizing control, it faced its first serious clash with the state: in 2000, several East Line managers — though not Kamenshchik — were charged with smuggling.

Five years later, Russia’s Federal Property Management Agency (Rosimushchestvo) sought to reacquire Domodedovo, challenging both the airport complex’s privatization and the runway lease agreement. At the time, media reports suggested that then-Moscow Region Governor Boris Gromov and Vladimir Putin intervened on the owners’ behalf. According to the business newspaper Vedomosti, Putin endorsed Gromov’s letter on the matter, writing: “Laws must be observed, but the state’s actions must not lead to the destruction of a successfully functioning business.”
Both cases — the smuggling prosecution and the privatization dispute — concluded in 2008 with a qualified victory for Kamenshchik. The managers in the smuggling case received suspended sentences, and courts ultimately rejected the demand to nationalize the airport, though runway lease payments were significantly increased.
The next wave of pressure followed a deadly attack at the airport. On January 24, 2011, a suicide bomber detonated an improvised explosive device in Domodedovo’s arrivals hall, killing 37 people. Investigators charged several airport employees with failure to ensure adequate security. At the same time, authorities began scrutinizing the airport’s highly complex ownership structure: Domodedovo was managed by foreign companies registered in offshore jurisdictions. Ultimately, only rank-and-file staff were formally charged, and even those charges were later dropped.
But in the summer of 2015, investigators unexpectedly reopened the probe into the attack. Three Domodedovo managers were placed in pre-trial detention, and in early 2016, Kamenshchik himself was put under house arrest. Within months, however, the case was closed for “lack of evidence” of a crime; investigators concluded the managers hadn’t violated transport security requirements.
For nearly a decade, the Kremlin refrained from such overt assaults, but pressure on the owners never fully disappeared. Domodedovo increasingly required a third runway — the existing two were already operating at capacity. Yet in Russia, runway construction is the state’s prerogative, not that of private airport operators. Authorities repeatedly declined to proceed with the project, prioritizing the competing Moscow airport, Sheremetyevo. As a result, Domodedovo’s development began to stall.
Until then, despite recurring legal challenges, Kamenshchik’s business had flourished. The 2010s marked its peak: Kamenshchik built a modern terminal, overhauled processes, and Domodedovo consistently ranked among Europe’s largest and fastest-growing hubs.
But Sheremetyevo was rising in parallel. A modern hub was built there for Russia’s largest airline, Aeroflot, and major international airlines were steadily drawn in. In 2011, companies linked to billionaire and longtime Putin associate Arkady Rotenberg entered the business. By 2016, they had secured a controlling stake in Sheremetyevo.
Competition intensified both commercially — with aggressive offers to airlines — and politically, through lobbying. In the lobbying battle, Sheremetyevo clearly had the advantage. Meanwhile, Domodedovo faced mounting congestion along with constant regulatory scrutiny from the Prosecutor General’s Office, relevant ministries, the tax authorities, and the FSB.
Inspections dragged on — and then, in 2025, events accelerated. In January of that year, the Prosecutor General’s Office filed a lawsuit seeking to transfer the airport to state ownership, arguing that Domodedovo’s management structure violated laws governing strategic enterprises because its owners, in addition to Russian citizenship, held foreign passports. In February, a court temporarily transferred the asset to the state. In June, the Moscow Region Arbitration Court finalized the nationalization.
Then, at the start of 2026, two privatization auctions were held. On January 20, the airport was offered for 132 billion rubles ($1.7 billion); no buyers emerged. The price was then cut in half. On January 29, a Sheremetyevo-linked company acquired Domodedovo for 66.1 billion rubles ($855.9 million).

Dmitry Kamenshchik clearly wielded significant political influence over the years; otherwise, fending off repeated state attacks would have been impossible. The public face of that influence was billionaire Valery Kogan.
Kogan’s name first surfaced in connection with Domodedovo when the state demanded that the airport’s owners be identified. For years, Kamenshchik declined to disclose that information. Eventually, however, he acknowledged that the airport belonged to two people: himself and Kogan. The size of their respective stakes was never made public, but Kogan became chairman of the supervisory board. In an interview with Vedomosti, Kamenshchik said of him: “In our hierarchy, he is senior to me and is my boss.”
Once Kogan’s role became public, he began appearing in headlines — mostly foreign ones. Coverage focused on his lifestyle: building what was reported to be the most expensive mansion in Israel, buying up hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of property in New York and Connecticut, and hosting his granddaughter’s lavish wedding in London, where Elton John and Mariah Carey performed.
What kind of lobbying muscle Kogan actually provided remains unclear. There is little solid evidence of high-level connections. “There were once rumors that Kogan was linked to the then-head of the FSB, Nikolai Patrushev,” Andrei Yakovlev, an associate researcher at Harvard University’s Davis Center, told Meduza. “And that Domodedovo [allegedly] lost protection as a result of [Patrushev’s position] weakening” — a reference to May 2024, when Patrushev was demoted from the powerful post of Security Council secretary. Whether that tie really existed, Yakovlev argues, matters less than the broader pattern: “the transfer of assets into the hands of a narrowing circle of Putin’s associates, as a reward for loyalty amid the loss of foreign holdings.”
Even with passenger traffic down, acquiring a second major airport strengthens the Rotenbergs’ position. And it came cheaply. Alexander Ponomarenko — Arkady Rotenberg’s business partner in Sheremetyevo — told Forbes Russia that after the 2011 attack, he’d offered Kogan $3.8 billion for Domodedovo. This time, the purchase price was about $860 million.
Domodedovo does carry heavy debt — roughly 70 billion rubles ($906.5 million). During the period when the asset was being wrested from Kamenshchik, its finances deteriorated sharply: losses reached 6.8 billion rubles ($88 million) in 2023 and 10 billion rubles ($129.5 million) in 2025. Still, Rotenberg will likely find it easier to negotiate debt restructuring and repayment terms with the state.
Some of that debt may ultimately be repaid with funds the state seeks to recover from Kamenshchik and Kogan. Prosecutors allege they siphoned funds out of Russia under the guise of repaying foreign creditors and paying dividends. In October 2025, a Russian court ordered the former owners to pay more than 3 billion rubles ($38.8 million). Both men are likely able to cover the penalties; in recent years, they’ve sold off many of their prominent foreign assets.
“It’s a good acquisition for the Rotenbergs,” Yakovlev said. “First, buying Sheremetyevo’s direct competitor creates leverage over airlines. In a situation where there’s effectively nowhere else to go, fees can be raised. Second, traffic flows can be optimized more cheaply. Even now, despite reduced load, there are boarding queues at Sheremetyevo. Issues related to drone attacks can also be managed more efficiently.”
Companies linked to the Rotenbergs have emerged as major beneficiaries of the current wave of nationalizations. Now, Domodedovo has become another piece of their business empire.

Trump cannot end deportation protections for South Sudanese nationals, US judge rules
2026-02-12 23:23:21 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/trump-cannot-end-deportation-protections-south-sudanese-nationals-us-judge-rules

A federal judge on Thursday blocked U.S. President Donald
Trump's
administration from ending temporary protections from deportation that had allowed hundreds of South Sudanese nationals to live and work in the United States.
U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston concluded that U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had likely acted unlawfully by providing a "pretextual" reason for terminating South Sudan's Temporary Protected Status designation and not disclosing the real factor motivating her action.
That status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorisation and temporary protection from deportation.
Noem in November published a notice terminating TPS for conflict-ridden South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation, which was first issued in 2011.
Saris said that notice failed to acknowledge the "real reason" for Noem's action, which was that she had adopted a "preordained pattern and practice" of terminating TPS designations for all countries.
Saris, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, noted that since Noem took office, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has moved to end TPS designations for 11 other countries, including Haiti, Venezuela and Ethiopia.
"It is highly likely that no country will pass muster, no matter how dire its conditions," Saris said.
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.
The ruling came in a lawsuit by a group of South Sudanese nationals and the non-profit African Communities Together. Another judge earlier in the case had delayed the end of TPS for South Sudan to provide time for Saris to hear the case.
Conflict has ravaged South Sudan since it won independence from Sudan in 2011. Fighting has persisted in much of the country since a five-year-long civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people ended in 2018. The U.S. State Department advises citizens not to travel there.
About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications, according to the lawsuit.

A look at false claims made by the Trump administration as it revokes a key scientific finding

2026-02-12T22:56:44Z
President Donald Trump on Thursday
revoked
the 2009 endangerment finding, which has long been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change.
But in making the announcement, Trump and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin made false claims regarding the government declaration, climate change, and energy.
Here’s a closer look at the facts.
___
TRUMP: “Known as the endangerment finding, this determination had no basis in fact, had none whatsoever, and it had no basis in law.”
THE FACTS: This is false. The
endangerment finding
was adopted in 2009 by the EPA after the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled in 2007
that greenhouse gases are air pollutants that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act.
“The idea that the endangerment finding has no basis in law is ludicrous,” said Ann Carlson, a professor of environmental law at the University of California, Los Angeles. “The Supreme Court in Massachusetts v. EPA specifically directed the Environmental Protection Agency to determine whether greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. The endangerment finding is the result.”
Scientific evidence to support the endangerment finding was provided by the EPA at the time of its inception and is
still available
on the agency’s website today.
Multiple federal courts have upheld the endangerment finding since it was adopted 16 years ago. ___
TRUMP: “We’ve basically stopped all windmills in this country. It’s the most expensive energy you can get.”
THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce around $30 per megawatt hour, according to July estimates from the Energy Information Administration.
This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, the EIA said in July.
___ TRUMP, asked about the cost to health and the environment: “It has nothing to do with public health. This is all a scam, a giant scam. This was a rip off of the country by Obama and Biden, and let’s say Obama started it and got it rolling and a terrible rip off.”
THE FACTS: Thousands of peer-reviewed scientific studies connect health harms to climate change. They find increasing deaths from heat waves, extreme weather such as hurricanes and floods and air pollution from worsening wildfires. A
2021 study in Nature Climate Change
calculated that globally about 9,700 people die a year from heat-related deaths attributable to human-caused climate change, based on data from 732 cities, including more than 200 in the United States.
A separate study last year listed dozens of climate change health harms and concluded,
using the EPA’s own calculation
method, that the health costs are at least $10 billion a year, probably much more.
The science of climate change dates back nearly 170 years to studies done by
American Eunice Foote
showing that carbon dioxide heated cylinders with thermometers inside more than ambient air. The first national climate assessment, done in 2000, before Obama and Biden, “concluded that climate variability and change are likely to increase morbidity and mortality risks.”
___
ZELDIN: “The Obama and Biden administrations used the endangerment finding to steamroll into existence a left-wing wish, including electric vehicle mandates.”
THE FACTS: Trump has made this claim before. There was
no federal mandate
to force the purchase of EVs.
“If you looked at some of the tables that were in the Biden rules, you could see that there were a variety of different ways that companies could comply with the standards,” said Carrie Jenks, the executive director of Harvard Law School’s environmental and energy law program. “The endangerment finding nor the regulations mandated a shift from one type of vehicle to another.”
Former President Joe Biden did set up a non-binding goal that
EVs make up half of new cars sold
by 2030. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office revoking that goal.
Biden’s policies tightened restrictions on pollution from gas-powered cars and trucks in an effort to encourage Americans to buy EVs and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars. ___

FPV drones get all the attention. Ukraine’s reusable heavy bombers are doing the real killing
2026-02-12 23:20:41 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/13/bomber-drones/

Explosive first-person-view drones get a lot of the attention, but the most dangerous drones in the sky over Ukraine—especially for the Russians—are heavy bomber drones.
Where an FPV explodes on contact, making it single-use, a heavy bomber drone is reusable. It can strike repeatedly with a payload of several grenades and then return to base for more munitions.
The devastation bomber drones can inflict is evident in a video montage posted by the Ukrainian army's 42nd Mechanized Brigade, defending around the village of Novopavlivka in eastern Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
The montage depicts multiple lethal bombings of scattered Russian infantry, but the final shot in the montage is most telling. We see what the bomber drone sees as it hovers over a clutch of Russian vehicles disgorging an entire platoon of around 25 infantry under the cover of darkness.
The thermal-camera-equipped bomber strikes while the infantry are most vulnerable—when they're outside of their vehicles but still packed into tight groups. Dropping two grenades in quick succession, the bomber evidently kills several Russians.

"Night bombers are out hunting and turning enemy infantry into mincemeat!" the 42nd Mechanized Brigade
crowed
.
The video hints at another advantage of bomber drones over exploding FPVs. A drone operator sees what an FPV sees only until the moment the drone explodes. By contrast, a bomber drone can linger after striking, observing any damage it inflicted.
An operator might not immediately know if an FPV narrowly misses its targets. It would take follow-up reconnaissance by another drone to confirm damage or absence of damage. On the other hand, a bomber conducts its own battle damage assessment, helping a unit decide whether to send out more drones for further strikes.
Ukraine's persistent drone edge
As Russia's wider war on Ukraine grinds into its 48th month, the Russian military is erasing the Ukrainian military's unmanned edge in certain classes of technology. Russian FPVs are as numerous and deadly as Ukrainian FPVs are directly over the front line. And in the deep logistical zone as far as 200 km from the front, elite Russian drone units such as the Rubicon (also spelled Rubikon) Center, which operate medium-range FPVs, might actually have a slight edge over their rival Ukrainian drone units.
But when it comes to bomber drones, Ukraine dominates. Ukrainian firms have massively scaled up production of eight-rotor octocopters and six-rotor hexacopters, each of which generally packs three or four grenades as well as day and night cameras and redundant command and video relay systems.
Ukrainian company SkyFall
is typica
l of the private enterprises behind the Ukrainians' bomber drone fleet. Skyfall produces 100,000 bomber drones a year at a unit cost of $8,500.
That's 16 times the cost of a typical FPV, but the bomber is actually cheaper per mission and payload.
An FPV normally flies once and explodes with the force of one grenade. A bomber may complete a dozen sorties, and drop four grenades per sortie, before crashing or getting shot down.
Explore further
Ukraine dominates the drone war at the front—but Russia owns the sky behind it
SkyFall evolves its bombers at a rapid pace in order to stay ahead of Russian countermeasures. When the Russians began jamming GPS-guided bombers, Skyfall added unjammable inertial and terrain-matching navigation.
When the Russians started downing the bombers with small air-to-air FPVs, Skyfall added a defensive flash. Countermeasures to Russian interceptors include EW jamming and a blinding flash. When a bomber detects an approaching interceptor, it triggers the flash. "The FPV video camera is temporarily blinded, and the operator loses track of the target," Canadian drone expert Roy
explained
.
With Russia having fully pivoted from mechanized assaults to infantry assaults, it's more urgent than ever for Ukraine to kill as many Russians as possible, as quickly as possible. FPVs may capture satisfying imagery of Russians in the instant before they're struck, but the lingering bombers with their heavier payloads are killing faster and more efficiently.

Israel president says hasn't decided on Netanyahu pardon after Trump jab
2026-02-12 22:52:05 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-president-says-hasnt-decided-netanyahu-pardon-after-trump-jab

Israeli President Isaac Herzog said Thursday that a request by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu
to be pardoned in his ongoing corruption trials was still under review, after Donald
Trump
called him "disgraceful" for not granting it.
Netanyahu has long argued that the proceedings against him, which began in 2019, are a "political trial", and US President Trump in October directly addressed Herzog in a speech at the Israeli parliament urging him to grant a pardon.
"The Prime Minister's request is currently under review at the Ministry of Justice for a legal opinion in accordance with the established procedures," Herzog's office said.
"Only upon completion of that process will President Herzog consider the request in accordance with the law... and without any influence from external or internal pressures of any kind," it added.
"Contrary to the impression created by President Trump's remarks, President Herzog has not yet made any decision on this matter."
Netanyahu had been in Washington for talks with Trump, who on Thursday said during a press conference at the White House that Herzog "should be ashamed of himself" for not responding positively to the pardon request.
"I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He's disgraceful for not giving it," Trump said.
Netanyahu is facing charges in two cases in which he allegedly negotiated favourable media coverage from Israeli news outlets, and a third involving accusations that he accepted more than $260,000 in luxury gifts from billionaires in exchange for political favours.
A fourth corruption charge was previously dismissed.
Netanyahu, who has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the three court cases, is the first sitting Israeli prime minister to stand trial for corruption.
After Trump's address in parliament, he sent a letter to Herzog asking that Netanyahu be pardoned, which was followed by an official request from Netanyahu's lawyers shortly after.

Minneapolis retreat could undercut Democrats’ message as shutdown looms
2026-02-12 22:30:00 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/minneapolis-retreat-dhs-shutdown-looms-00779544

The Trump administration’s decision to
end its immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis
could undermine Democrats’ messaging leverage on the eve of an
expected partial government shutdown
.
By pulling out of Minneapolis — the epicenter of the left’s fight to overhaul federal immigration enforcement after federal agents killed two American citizens — administration officials and allies argue that Democrats will lose political steam as attention gradually fades from the administration’s aggressive enforcement actions.
“I know everyone was concerned about ICE’s future if we kept acting like idiots,” said an administration official, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “If we are really doing our job well, you won’t notice or have anything to complain about.”
“It’s a side effect of Tom [Homan]’s leadership,” the person added, pointing to the hope that
the border czar’s presence in Minneapolis could tame tensions on the ground
.
The administration’s retreat in Minnesota comes as immigration hawks have pushed Trump officials to stand firm and avoid caving to Democratic demands on policy changes in exchange for funding the Department of Homeland Security. Those demands have included a prohibition on federal agents wearing masks to an expansive limit on places where agents can operate. The belief among some administration officials and allies is that Democrats will eventually bend once agencies such as TSA and FEMA begin to feel the squeeze of a prolonged shutdown.
A person close to the Trump administration, granted anonymity to discuss private conversations, said the deescalation in Minneapolis will help avoid “major incidents” and keep immigration enforcement “off the front pages” in the weeks ahead.
“Then Democrats start to lose their leverage a little bit,” the person said.
Homan on Thursday morning announced that the immigration enforcement surge in Minnesota was ending, a pronouncement that came hours after the White House sent text of its funding counterproposal to Democrats late Wednesday. A senior White House official, granted anonymity to speak about internal thinking, said the decision to leave Minneapolis “functionally … isn’t about leverage” but about “executing immigration enforcement in a way that keeps the American public safe.”
“
I think certainly when Democrats talk about progress being made — what is progress, if not the surge ending in Minneapolis and a serious, detailed, substantive and binding proposal dealing with Department of Homeland Security enforcement practices on the table?” said the senior White House official. “If that’s not progress, I don’t know what is.”
But Democrats insist that the retreat in Minneapolis does not mark a serious, lasting change in the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation efforts. Though a victory, Democrats feel the Minneapolis withdrawal doesn’t negate the need for legislative changes to how ICE and Border Patrol operate across the country.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said ICE’s “abuses cannot be solved through executive fiat alone,” and that Democrats will continue to push for legislation — a message other Democratic lawmakers echoed on Thursday.
“Just because [Trump’s] slinking out of Minneapolis doesn’t mean he won’t do it to another city, another town, he won’t try to put them at a polling place,” said Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.). “So the need for significant reforms stands, regardless of whether he’s trying at the 11th hour to pull back.”
Democrats this week panned the White House’s funding offer as “insufficient” and “unserious,” arguing that it didn’t address some of their major demands, including requiring federal law enforcement officials to obtain a judicial warrant before entering private property.
The senior White House official declined to detail the administration’s offer, but said the legislative specs sent to Democrats are “substantive” and “serious” and that they’re willing to “work in a bipartisan way to ensure — as we’ve seen with Tom Homan in Minneapolis — that we’re enforcing immigration law in the optimal way possible.” The official added that the judicial warrant policy is a red line for the White House, as well as any concessions that might impede the president’s efforts to fulfill his immigration agenda.
Homan on Thursday, speaking from Minneapolis, said a significant drawdown of agents was already underway, and that it would continue into next week. And hours after his announcement, acting ICE chief Todd Lyons told the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee that his agency will be looking at “lessons learned” after Minneapolis.
Republicans on Capitol Hill have echoed the White House’s argument that the actions are evidence the administration is looking to make progress in negotiations. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters Thursday that the White House “has given more and more ground on these key issues.”
“I think the moves that have been made as recently as today by Tom Homan to pull everybody out of Minneapolis, I think is also certainly a demonstration of good faith,” he said.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee panel in charge of DHS funding, also said Homan’s announcement represents a major concession.
“We have exchanged text. That’s what you do in a negotiation, you work to find a pathway forward,” Britt said Thursday. “There was an announcement today that shows we are operating in good faith.”

Iranian teen protester risks execution over policeman's killing: NGO
2026-02-12 22:19:38 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/iranian-teen-protester-risks-execution-over-policemans-killing-ngo

An
Iranian
teenager who took part in nationwide protests in January is facing execution after being convicted on charges of killing a policeman during the demonstrations, an NGO said on Thursday.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) said that Saleh Mohammadi, 18, had already been sentenced to death, although the Iranian judiciary said no final and "enforceable" verdict had been issued in the case.
According to IHR, the court had also ordered that the hanging of Mohammadi take place in public at the scene of the alleged crime in the central city of Qom.
Iran's hardline judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei has warned there will be "no leniency" against those convicted of violent acts during the protests.
Rights groups accuse security forces of killing thousands in their crackdown on the protests, which authorities blamed on the US and Israel.
IHR said that Mohammadi, who had taken part in international wrestling competitions, had been convicted and sentenced to death by a court in Qom on 3 February for killing the policeman on 8 January.
It said Mohammadi "was forced to make self-incriminating confessions in the investigation phase which he later retracted in court", but the court then rejected this.
IHR said "hundreds" of people are facing charges linked to the protests that could see them sentenced to death. The group said this was the first death sentence it had confirmed although several others may already have been issued.
The judiciary's
Mizan
news agency confirmed that Mohammadi was under arrest but added that "no final and enforceable sentence has been handed down to him".
Death sentences in Iran can be appealed. IHR said Mohammadi had 20 days to appeal under the law but warned there had in the past been cases of people being executed before this period elapsed.
More than 7,000 people were killed during the protests, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency NGO, the vast majority -- 6,506 of them -- being protesters shot dead by security forces.
"After the unprecedented mass killing of protesters, Islamic Republic authorities are now seeking to terrorise society through the execution of detained protesters," said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam.
"Saleh's death sentence marks a dangerous escalation," he added.
Iran is the world's most prolific executioner after China, according to rights groups. Last year it hanged at least 1,500 people, according to figures from IHR which also says it executed 12 people in cases linked to a wave of protests in 2022-2023.

ICE’s Largest Prison Contractors Hail ‘New Growth Opportunities’ as Revenue Reaches All-Time High
2026-02-12 22:14:49 GMT
https://time.com/7378284/ice-immigration-detention-contractors-record-revenue/

Two of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE) biggest contractors for building and managing detention centers have posted record revenue in 2025, as companies are expanding their facilities nationwide to hold more immigrants apprehended by the Trump Administration.
GEO Group, which operates 19 facilities for ICE around the country, reported $2.6 billion in total revenue in 2025, up 6% from $2.43 billion in 2024. CoreCivic, which owns and operates at least ten ICE detention facilities, reported $2.2 billion in total revenue in 2025, up 13% from $1.96 billion in 2024.

ICE Is Seeking to Build New Detention Centers Around the U.S. Here’s How Communities Are Battling to Stop It
During their earnings calls, both companies hailed the rapid expansion of their facilities, marking it a “significant growth opportunity,” and said they are working to reactivate facilities that were previously phased out under the Biden Administration to meet ICE’s increasing detention demands. The two companies have told ICE that, together, they can hold an additional population of 19,000 if needed.
Asked by one caller about how he views the current rate of ICE detentions—which, at  fewer than 100,000 immigrants a day, the caller described as “below what investors thought [it] was going to be”— CEO of CoreCivic Patrick Swindle responded by assuring investors that the immigration crackdown will pick up pace.
“When you’re looking at the way that ICE approaches enforcement action, nothing occurs immediately,” Swindle said. “So, as we think about timing, it does take time because it is a very complex ecosystem, and as that ecosystem grows, it’s gonna result in additional bed demand.”
In addition to the expansion of its immigrant detention facilities, GEO Group also saw an increase in ICE’s use of its surveillance devices, which the agency uses to monitor some immigrants as an alternative to detention. During the call, incoming GEO Group CEO George Zoley said the number of participants on GPS ankle monitors has increased from approximately 17,000 in early 2025 to more than 42,000 today.
According to Zoley, ICE is currently holding approximately 70,000 immigrants in 225 separate jails or detention centers, nearly
double
the number of immigrants detained and the number of available facilities from last year.
The Washington
Post
reported
that, thanks to an unprecedented $45 billion budget approved by Congress, ICE intends to expand immigrant detention to parts of the country where none are currently located while building new detention facilities in populous states like California and Texas. The plan would double the agency’s number of large-scale, mega-detention centers—the kind that are contracted out to GEO Group and CoreCivic—as well as building makeshift “soft-sided” structures that can be built in a few weeks.
One of the plans that ICE is pursuing in this effort to build massive detention facilities is acquiring warehouses and turning them into jails, despite
protests
in local communities. GEO Group said it is “cautiously participating in this process,” despite having little experience in renovating warehouses.
“We’ve only had one experience in renovating a warehouse, and that occurred maybe 30 years ago. So it’s more complicated than you may think,” Zoley said during the earnings call.
“As a 40-year partner to ICE, we expect to be a part of this solution,” he added.
For-profit detention centers hold the overwhelming majority of immigrants who are detained by ICE, according to
data
from TRAC Immigration. They have also been the site of most of the fatalities in federal immigrant detention that have occurred in recent months: Of the 38 people who died in ICE custody from January 2025 to now, 71 percent were held in for-profit facilities, according to
data collected
by independent journalist Andrew Free.

$38bn, 35 Patriot missiles, long-range drones: What Ukraine got at Ramstein
2026-02-12 21:49:50 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/allies-pledge-38bn-in-defense-aid-for-ukraine-at-ramstein-meeting/

Allies agreed to provide Ukraine with nearly $38 billion in defense assistance during a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Brussels on 12 February, Ukrainian Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov said,
according to
hromadske.
The meeting at NATO headquarters brought together defense ministers from member states of the Ramstein format to coordinate further military support. Discussions focused on strengthening Ukraine’s air defense, financing drones and missiles, expanding joint defense production projects and increasing contributions to the US-led PURL initiative for procuring critical weapons systems.
Most funding targets air defense and drones
Fedorov said most of the newly announced funding would go toward air defense systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and interceptor drones.
UK Defence Secretary John Healey told reporters that partners had formally allocated $35 billion of the nearly $38 billion pledged in total support for Ukraine. He also confirmed that Britain would
provide
£500 million (around $625 million) in urgent air defence assistance.
Germany tops up Patriot package, pledges €11.5bn for 2026
Allies also agreed to provide 30 PAC-3 interceptor missiles for Ukraine’s Patriot systems. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Berlin was prepared to add five additional PAC-3 missiles to that package, bringing the total to 35 interceptors. He said delivery would be a matter of days.
Pistorius also said Germany would allocate €11.5 billion in support to Ukraine in 2026 and supply long-range drones. He added that Ukraine would require around $60 billion next year to sustain its defense.

Laser weapon that shut down El Paso's skies was LOCUST system
2026-02-12 21:41:20 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/el-paso-laser-weapon-locust-drone

The counter-drone weapon that caused a shutdown of
El Paso's airspace
on Wednesday was AeroVironment's LOCUST, a 20-kilowatt laser system, Axios has confirmed.
Why it matters:
The Army sees the cutting-edge weapon as a way to combat drones without firing expensive interceptors. But the Federal Aviation Administration was so concerned about its use that it shut down the airspace around a major city for nearly eight hours.
Driving the news:
Trump administration officials claimed a "cartel drone incursion" had necessitated a military response, which in turn led the FAA to order the extraordinary
10-day airspace closure
. It was lifted hours later.
Multiple sources told Axios that, in fact, the Federal Aviation Administration reacted because a counter-drone weapon had been fired without sufficient coordination.
In a further twist, a source familiar with the incident told Axios that while the weapon belongs to the military, it was actually fired by Customs and Border Protection.
There have been conflicting reports about what the laser took down or whether there was truly a drone "incursion."
Zoom in:
The weapon in question was the LOCUST laser weapon system, as Reuters was
first
to report and Axios has confirmed.
It was developed by BlueHalo, which was acquired by Virginia-based AeroVironment last year. The company declined to comment for this story.
A LOCUST-equipped
Infantry Squad Vehicle
was spotted by
Laser Wars
near the U.S.-Mexico border in August 2025.
The big picture:
Militaries have been exploring directed-energy weapons for decades, and the Pentagon invested around $1 billion annually into the tech in recent years, but frontline use has not yet become widespread.
An Emerging Technologies Institute
study
published in January 2024 logged more than two dozen directed-energy projects underway across the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.
Plans for the forthcoming Trump-class battleships involve far more powerful lasers — anywhere from 300-600kW, versus 20kW for LOCUST.
What to watch:
The military is using the border mission as a means to test other tech as well, including networking and comms.

The True Story Behind Ryan Murphy’s &lt;i>Love Story&lt;/i>
2026-02-12 21:39:14 GMT
https://time.com/7378261/love-story-jfk-jr-carolyn-bessette/

Ryan Murphy has a knack for producing stories inspired by true events. His
American Crime Story
series found him taking on the OJ Simpson trial, the assassination of Gianni Versace, and the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal in respective seasons. This time, Murphy is in the producer’s chair for FX’s
Love Story
, created by Connor Hines, about the extensively publicized romance between John F. Kennedy Jr. (Paul Kelly) and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy (Sarah Pidgeon).
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Love Story
begins with the 1999 plane ride that would eventually take the couple’s lives. Before getting to the fatal crash, the show jumps back seven years to 1992: when the couple met. Carolyn Bessette was working as a publicist at Calvin Klein, where her innate sense of style and ease working with people had her on the rise. JFK Jr. appeared to be trending in the opposite direction. Bestowed the title of
People’s Sexiest Man Alive in 1988
, by ‘92, he was close to losing his job as assistant district attorney, and treated as something of a joke by the press.
The first three episodes of
Love Story
, out now on FX, trace how after meeting at a Calvin Klein party sometime in 1992, the pair did not actually start dating until a couple years later. Instead, the beginning of the series focuses on Kennedy’s on-again off-again relationship with the actor Daryl Hannah (Dree Hemingway), which his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (Naomi Watts), reportedly never approved of (though in real life, Hannah’s stepmother, Sue Wexler, once told
People
, “Daryl told me [Onassis] has been very warm and affectionate.”) At the end of episode 3, Kennedy Onassis dies; shortly after, Kennedy and Hannah’s relationship ends for good.
In 1994, Kennedy and Bessette began dating, and their relationship was of great fascination for the public. To Americans everywhere, it felt like the couple could be the romantic heirs to JFK and Jackie O, who captured the hearts of Americans in the 1960s.
The romance between JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette
After about a year of dating, Kennedy proposed to Bessette in Martha’s Vineyard in July 1995. As his former assistant, RoseMarie Terenzio, told
People
, he asked the question when they were on a fishing boat. He spoke of life being better with a partner and told Carolyn, “I want you to be my partner.” Carolyn waited three weeks before she agreed to the proposal.
On Feb. 25, 1996, the engaged couple was seen arguing while on a typical walk through Central Park. They were caught on camera, and their spat became national news, including a massive eight-page feature in the
New York Daily News
. Their fight became physical, as John attempted to take a ring (possibly her engagement ring) off her finger, and when John started to walk away, Carolyn jumped on his back. Video footage of the argument was analyzed left and right, and a public moment of frustration turned into a media circus.
Seven months later, on Sept. 21, 1996, Kennedy Jr. and Bessette married. Their ceremony was elaborate yet secluded, at the First African Baptist Church on Georgia’s Cumberland Island. For a couple that was constantly in the public eye, their nuptials, according to a friend of the couple and former
Real Housewives of New York
cast member Carole Radziwill, were “one of the best-kept secrets of modern time,” as she wrote for the
Daily Mail
. Radziwill wrote that upon arrival on the island, guests had to present a special coin—a rare Indian nickel—or else they would be escorted away. The number of attendees varies according to accounts. Radziwill writes that there were just 32 guests, while
People
reported 40 attendees. Regardless of the total number, it’s clear that the wedding provided the famous couple a complete break from the outside world.
After their wedding, the couple, especially Bessette, hoped for a more private life now that the question of whether they’d end up together was answered. She refused to speak to paparazzi, who waited for her outside her house every day, and followed her wherever she went. Her refusal to cooperate with them caused the media to turn on her, and tabloids branded her as an “ice queen,” a
“harpy,”
and even claimed she was “manipulative and controlling.” The more private she became, the angrier the tabloids got.
According to
The List
, Kennedy once made a plea to the paparazzi outside of the couple’s Tribeca apartment in defense of his wife. “I just ask [for] any privacy or room you could give her as she makes that adjustment. It would be greatly appreciated,” he said, before the couple went into a car. Though they cared greatly for each other, their relationship struggled, and like many couples, arguments became part of their routine. “They would love hard and fight hard. But they were very much in love,” Ariel Paredes, granddaughter of Jaqueline Kennedy’s former assistant Providencia Paredes, told
People
.
In the summer of 1999, on July 16, the couple was traveling to the wedding of Rory Kennedy, their cousin, in Martha’s Vineyard. Kennedy, Bessette, and her sister Lauren Bessette flew in a small plane piloted by JFK Jr. to the wedding. According to the
Washington Post
, the plane, a Piper Saratoga, plummeted from 2,200 feet to 1,100 in a span of 14 seconds. The plane crashed, killing Kennedy, 38, Bessette-Kennedy, 33, and Lauren Bessette, 34.
On the morning of July 22, their ashes were scattered at sea from the Navy USS Briscoe, off the coast of Martha’s Vineyard. A memorial service was held the following day, at the Church of St. Thomas More in New York City.

Even Trump’s own appointees are ruling against ICE’s mass detention strategy
2026-02-12 21:30:00 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/donald-trump-judges-mandatory-detention-rulings-00778256

For six months, dozens of judges appointed by Donald Trump have rebuffed — and sometimes pointedly rebuked — his administration’s effort to lock up thousands of immigrants under a novel reinterpretation of decades-old deportation laws.
This mass detention strategy, implemented by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, has met an
overwhelming rejection by federal judges
appointed by every president since Ronald Reagan.
A POLITICO review finds that 373 have rejected the administration’s effort to require detention — without the possibility of bond — for anyone who crossed illegally into the United States, even if they’ve lived in the country for decades without incident. That contrasts with just 28 judges who have sided with the administration’s view.
Even judges Trump appointed are largely against him: 44 of them have ruled against the administration in mass-detention cases. Twenty Trump-appointed judges have signed off on the policy.
The divide underscores the limits of a president’s ability to control the jurists he puts on the bench. These judges, nearly all appointed during Trump’s first term, have likely contributed to
his frustration over the recommendations
he received from groups like the Federalist Society and judicial power player Leonard Leo.
They include Judges Stephanie Haines of Pennsylvania, John Holcomb of California and Fernando Rodriguez, Jr. of Texas, each of whom also rejected key prongs of Trump’s effort to invoke
the Alien Enemies Act
to carry out swift deportations without due process.
Also on the list are New York-based Eric Komitee, who
reinstated protections
for young immigrants over the Trump administration’s objection; Eric Tostrud, who upheld the seizure of MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell’s phone during a 2020 election investigation and recently raised questions about ICE’s handling of the Alex Pretti crime scene in Minnesota; and Alan Albright, a Texas-based judge who
tossed the Trump administration’s legal bid
to eject labor unions from federal agencies.
Though many of the judges who have bucked Trump’s mass detention strategy hail from blue states — where congressional procedures give home-state senators outsize sway over a president’s judicial picks — others come from deep red states and boast conservative credentials. The list includes judges from Texas, Oklahoma, Indiana, Tennessee, Kentucky and Florida.
In total, judges opposing the administration’s expanded detention strategy have rejected it in at least 3,500 cases, while those backing it have ruled in about 150 cases, according to POLITICO’s analysis.
Cases brought by immigrants detained under this mandatory detention push have
flooded courts nationwide
, crowding dockets and overwhelming even the administration’s ability to defend them. Last week, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals
agreed with the slim minority
of district court judges, a ruling that could fuel a race to the Supreme Court.
On the shorter list of judges who have endorsed the administration’s approach to mass detention, it’s a much more uniform group: 20 of the 28 judges were appointed by Trump.
They include North Dakota’s Daniel Traynor, who was pulled into Minnesota to help handle a
surge in cases there
amid the administration’s crackdown in the Twin Cities, and Raag Singhal, a Florida-based judge who
ruled against
Trump’s bid to sue CNN over its use of the term “big lie.” Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump appointee from Louisiana, initially rejected the administration’s view before changing course after the executive branch-run Board of Immigration Appeals, which oversees immigration courts nationwide, backed ICE’s approach last September.
Only one Biden-appointed judge,
Jennifer Rearden
, and two Obama-appointed judges —
Cathy Bencivengo
and
Gregory Woods
— have sided with the administration’s view.

After years of resistance, leaders finally say EU should go at different speeds
2026-02-12 21:21:19 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/alden-biesen-belgium-eu-summit-emmanuel-macron-giorgia-meloni-donad-trump-resistance-leaders-different-speeds/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

ALDEN BIESEN, Belgium — The EU has always prided itself on its members all moving forward as one. That era is over.
At a gathering in eastern Belgium on Thursday, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and others backed plans — that they’ll flesh out as early as the European Council next month — to peel off and sign up to initiatives in smaller groups. Governments spoke of being gripped by a sense of urgency because Europe’s competitive edge is slipping away as many of its ideas get bogged down in indecision and discord.
“We need to act fast,” said French President Emmanuel Macron, who appeared to put his recent disagreements with his German counterpart behind him as they both urged the EU to pursue policies that will spark economic growth.
With the bloc buffeted by multiple geopolitical crises, it’s starting to realize that it can’t come to grips with them if it only acts when all 27 member countries agree. From defense to energy to investment, the European Commission, which makes the rules, and national governments, which are supposed to implement them, are finding themselves hamstrung. Meanwhile, businesses talk of being strangled by red tape and high energy costs.
Donald Trump’s threats to seize Greenland and his wavering on helping Ukraine fend off Russia, combined with China’s strategy of flooding Europe with artificially cheap goods, have provided an impetus to the EU’s most senior decision-makers to finally get moving.
Thursday’s summit of EU leaders — only 15 kilometers from the Dutch city of Maastricht, where one of the most significant treaties underpinning the bloc was signed in 1992 — occasioned some “strategic brainstorming” on how to “promote our prosperity, create high quality jobs and ensure affordability,” European Council President António Costa said.
“Today’s discussion brought a new energy and shared sense of urgency around that objective,” he said.
At their summit back in Brussels next month, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will present what she called a “One Europe, One Market Roadmap and Action Plan” setting out reforms in areas such as reducing administrative burdens and unleashing private and public capital to help European start-ups scale up. Leaders will vote on the plan when they meet again before the summer.
If not all 27 countries agree in some areas, the EU will use what it calls “enhanced cooperation” — smaller groupings of member countries moving faster on policy proposals — which, while it’s been
championed by some leaders before
, has largely been avoided and labeled as divisive.
“Talk of enhanced cooperation could be a bit of a motivating factor to get member states on board,” said a diplomat from a European country, granted anonymity to be able to talk about confidential discussions. The diplomat explained that few capitals will want to risk being left behind on prosperity-driving measures, even if they have concerns about certain aspects of those policies.
‘Geopolitical reality’
“Two or three years ago we would probably not have had a discussion similar to the one we have had today,” German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said. “We are confronted by a completely new geopolitical situation and we are willing to stand up to this geopolitical reality. But Europe will be able to hold its own only if we are competitive.”
One place where “enhanced cooperation” may be used is for the Savings and Investments Union, the EU’s push for a U.S.-style capital market. The Commission wants an EU equivalent to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but EU-wide supervision needs buy-in from capitals — including Dublin and Luxembourg, where most funds reside, and which have been reluctant to give up their powers.
The roadmap will set measurable targets in areas such as telecoms, capital markets, services and energy.
Von der Leyen said
she wants all the targets to be achieved by the end of 2027.
The first proposal will be the “28th regime,” a startup-friendly EU-wide corporate law that is scheduled to be presented March 18. It would allow companies to register 100 percent online within 48 hours and would make it easier for them to scale across EU borders.
At the summit, agreement emerged in four key areas, according to two people briefed on the talks: the need to unlock the savings of Europeans and to use them to invest in key EU businesses; a desire to address high energy costs in some parts of the bloc, including potentially via revisiting old debates on issues such as the Emissions Trading System to bring down prices; a need for the EU to continue striking trade deals with new partners to diversify its dependencies; and greater sympathy for a European preference — aka Macron’s “buy European” pet policy.
That latter point was perhaps the biggest win at the castle retreat, with leaders giving the Commission the go-ahead to come up with a sector-by-sector list of dependencies in which European companies should be given preferential treatment to help prop up key industries such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals.
Bad blood
Fractures between the EU’s big economic players and the rest were on show before the summit began.
A flurry of papers and counter-papers emerged
from EU countries ahead of the meeting, with France and Germany on either side of a “buy European” split and other major disagreements on how far to go when it comes to completing the single market.
A pre-summit session saw 19 leaders meet to discuss the issues in play — with some nations, including the leaders of Spain, Ireland, the Baltic states and Slovenia, not invited.
Those who made the guest list, determined by Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, were selected because they were on the same page when it comes to cutting red tape and more free trade, according to an EU diplomat familiar with the plans.
Several of the leaders who attended the pre-summit were then late arriving in Alden Biesen, holding up proceedings by almost an hour. Merz, Meloni and Macron were so delayed that Costa started without them.
Divisions were also apparent
between EU countries and the Commission
. Germany and Italy issued a statement saying the EU should “limit itself” in pursuit of new rules, while von der Leyen blamed national rules for many of the problems plaguing industry.
But Macron at least was all smiles as he left Alden Biesen, projecting harmony after a rapprochement with old rival Germany and the discovery of some common ground.
Macron was asked by POLITICO whether he was now good friends with Merz, with whom he had appeared side by side in the morning.
“Yes,” Macron laughed, “always.”

The EU moves to kill infinite scrolling
2026-02-12 21:16:29 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/tiktok-meta-facebook-instagram-brussels-kill-infinite-scrolling/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

BRUSSELS — Doom scrolling is doomed, if the EU gets its way.
The European Commission is for the first time tackling the addictiveness of social media in a fight against TikTok that may set new design standards for the world’s most popular apps.
Brussels has
told the company
to change several key features, including disabling infinite scrolling, setting strict screen time breaks and changing its recommender systems. The demand follows the Commission’s declaration that TikTok’s design is addictive to users — especially children.
The fact that the Commission said TikTok should change the basic design of its service is “ground-breaking for the business model fueled by surveillance and advertising,” said Katarzyna Szymielewicz, president of  the Panoptykon Foundation, a Polish civil society group.
That doesn’t bode well for other platforms, particularly Meta’s Facebook and Instagram. The two social media giants are also under investigation over the addictiveness of their design.
The findings laid out a week ago mark the first time the Commission has set out its stance on the design of a social media platform under its Digital Services Act, the EU’s flagship online-content law that Brussels says is essential for protecting users.
TikTok can now defend its practices and review all the evidence the Commission considered — and has said it would fight these findings. If it fails to satisfy the Commission, the app could face fines up to 6 percent of annual global revenue.
It’s the first time any regulator has attempted to set a legal standard for the addictiveness of platform design, a senior Commission official said in a briefing to reporters.
“The findings mark a turning point [because] the Commission is treating addictive design on social media as an enforceable risk” under the Digital Services Act, said Lena-Maria Böswald, senior policy researcher at think tank Interface.
Jan Penfrat, senior policy adviser at civil rights group EDRi, said it would be “very, very strange for the Commission to not then use this as a template and go after other companies as well.”
Defining risks
The Digital Services Act requires platforms like TikTok to assess and mitigate risks to their users. But these risks are vaguely defined in the law, so until now it had been unclear exactly where the regulator would draw the line.
Two years after the TikTok probe was
launched
, the Commission has opted to strike at the heart of platform design, claiming it poses a risk to the mental health of users, particularly children. The Commission’s other concerns with TikTok were settled amicably between the two sides.
At a briefing with reporters, EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen said the findings signal that the Commission’s work is entering a new stage of maturity when it comes to systemic risks.
Facebook and Instagram have been under investigation over the addictiveness of their platforms since
May 2024
, including whether they endanger children. Just like TikTok, the design and algorithms of the platforms are under scrutiny.
Meta has mounted a
staunch defense
in an ongoing California case, in which it is accused of knowingly designing an addictive social media that hurts users. TikTok and Snap
settled
the same case before it went to trial.
TikTok spokesperson Paolo Ganino said the Commission’s findings “present a categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform and we will take whatever steps are necessary to challenge these findings through every means available to us.”
The right solution
The Commission could eventually agree with platforms on a wide range of changes that address addictive design. What they decide will depend on the different risk profiles and patterns of use of each platform — as well as how each company defends itself.
That likely means it will take a while for TikTok to make any change to its systems, as the platform reviews the evidence and tries to negotiate a solution with the regulator.
In another, simpler DSA enforcement case, it took the Commission more than a year after issuing preliminary findings to
declare
Elon Musk’s X was not compliant with its obligations on transparency.
TikTok may pursue a series of changes and may push the Commission to adopt a lighter regulatory approach. The video-sharing giant likely won’t “get it right” the first time, said EDRi’s Penfrat, and it may take a few tries to satisfy Brussels.
“It could be anything from changing default settings, to outright prohibiting a specific design feature, or requiring more user control,” said Peter Chapman, a governance researcher and lawyer who is associate director at the Knight-Georgetown Institute.
He expects the changes could be different for each platform — as while the findings show the Commission’s thinking, interventions must be targeted depending on how design features are used.
“Multiple platforms use similar design features” but they serve different purposes and carry different risks, said Chapman, pointing to the example of notifications that try to draw you back in. For example, notifications for messages carry a different risk of addiction to those alerting a user about a livestream, he said.

Trump warns Iran of 'very traumatic' outcome if no nuclear deal
2026-02-12 21:07:33 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/trump-warns-iran-very-traumatic-outcome-if-no-nuclear-deal

US President Donald
Trump
threatened
Iran
Thursday with "very traumatic" consequences if it fails to make a nuclear deal -- but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu
said he was skeptical about the quality of any such agreement.
Speaking a day after he hosted Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said he hoped for a result "over the next month" from Washington's negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.
"We have to make a deal, otherwise it's going to be very traumatic, very traumatic. I don't want that to happen, but we have to make a deal," Trump told reporters.
"This will be very traumatic for Iran if they don't make a deal."
Trump -- who is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to pressure Iran -- recalled the US military strikes he ordered on Tehran's nuclear facilities during Israel's 12-day war with Iran in July last year.
"We'll see if we can get a deal with them, and if we can't, we'll have to go to phase two. Phase two will be very tough for them," Trump said.
Netanyahu had traveled to Washington to push Trump to take a harder line in the Iran nuclear talks, particularly on including the Islamic Republic's arsenal of ballistic missiles.
But the Israeli and US leaders apparently remained at odds, with Trump saying after their meeting at the White House on Wednesday that he had insisted the negotiations should continue.
Netanyahu said in Washington on Thursday before departing for Israel that Trump believed he was laying the ground for a deal.
"He believes that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time when they didn't reach an agreement, may create the conditions for achieving a good deal," Netanyahu said, according to a video statement from his office.
But the Israeli premier added: "I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the quality of any agreement with Iran."
Any deal "must include the elements that are very important from our perspective," Netanyahu continued, listing Iran's ballistic missile programme and its support for armed groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas, Yemen's Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon.
"It's not just the nuclear issue," he said.
Despite their differences on Iran, Trump signaled his strong personal support for Netanyahu as he criticised Israeli President Isaac Herzog for rejecting his request to pardon the prime minister on corruption charges.
"You have a president who refuses to give him a pardon. I think that man should be ashamed of himself," Trump said on Thursday.
Trump has repeatedly hinted at potential US military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on protests last month, even as Washington and Tehran restarted talks last week with a meeting in Oman.
The last round of talks between the two foes was cut short by Israel's war with Iran and the US strikes.
So far, Iran has rejected expanding the new talks beyond the issue of its nuclear program. Tehran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, and has said it will not give in to "excessive demands" on the subject.

Homeland Security Shutdown All But Certain After Failed Senate Vote
2026-02-12 21:04:41 GMT
https://time.com/7378267/government-shutdown-ice-congress-homeland-security/

The Department of Homeland Security is all but guaranteed to begin a partial shutdown early Saturday morning after the White House and congressional Democrats failed on Thursday to close the gap on a deal to rein in federal immigration enforcement, following two high-profile shootings by immigration agents in Minneapolis.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
The impasse came into sharper focus as the Senate failed to advance legislation to fund DHS and then prepared to leave Washington for a weeklong recess, effectively running out the clock before the deadline. The lapse would shutter only one cabinet department, making it among the narrowest shutdowns in modern history—the result of a single stalled appropriations bill rather than a broader collapse of federal funding as Congress has already passed the other 11 appropriations bills. The closest historical parallel dates back more than four decades, to 1980, when the Federal Trade Commission briefly became the first federal agency to shut down after running out of appropriations.
The shutdown stems from an unresolved fight over immigration enforcement, as Democrats and the White House failed to agree on whether Congress should impose new limits on federal agents in the wake of a backlash over President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis, including the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renée Good. Democrats have insisted that any funding bill for the Homeland Security Department include requirements for judicial warrants before agents enter homes, clear identification and badge numbers for agents, limits on masks, expanded use of body cameras, new use-of-force standards, and explicit bans on racial profiling. Trump has signaled openness to some changes, but Democrats rejected the White House’s latest proposal this week as insufficient.
On Thursday afternoon, the Senate voted 52 to 47 against advancing a yearlong DHS funding bill that did not include the enforcement changes Democrats are seeking. Only one Democrat—Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman—voted for it. An effort to pass a short-term stopgap measure by unanimous consent that would temporarily fund DHS and buy lawmakers more time to negotiate also failed on Thursday. With no path forward, Senate leaders announced plans to send senators home.
“At the moment, we’re not close,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota told reporters after the failed votes. He added that lawmakers would be called back if negotiations suddenly broke through. “That deal space is there,” Thune said. “This can be done.”
Still, Thune struck a skeptical tone about Democrats’ willingness to compromise. “The negotiations will continue and we will see in the course of the next few days how serious they are,” he said.
Any deal reached would also need to pass the House, which is also set to recess.
The standoff has persisted even after the Trump Administration sought to ease tensions by announcing a pullback of immigration enforcement in Minneapolis. Tom Homan, the White House’s border czar, said Thursday that federal authorities would
scale back
the surge of agents sent to the city—a move Republicans pointed to as evidence that the Administration was responding to Democratic concerns.
Democrats, however, dismissed the announcement as cosmetic and reversible, arguing that only legislation could impose lasting guardrails on federal agents. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told TIME that Democrats were not seeking to dismantle immigration enforcement but to subject it to the “same rules that apply to every other law enforcement officer at the local, state and federal level.”
When funding lapses at midnight Friday, the
shutdown’s effects
will be uneven. Immigration enforcement itself—the core of the political dispute—would continue largely uninterrupted. ICE and Customs and Border Protection would keep operating, buoyed by $75 billion in funding approved last year in Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill” that remains available.
Instead, the brunt of the shutdown would fall on other parts of DHS,
particularly the Transportation Security Administration
. Roughly 95% of TSA’s workforce—about 61,000 employees including most airport screeners—would be required to keep working without pay at more than 430 commercial airports nationwide. While they would not miss a full paycheck immediately, they will start to do so if the shutdown drags on for more than two weeks, potentially impacting staffing at airports as workers struggle to cover basic expenses.
“A lack of funding and predictability of resourcing will pose significant challenges to our ability to deliver transportation security with the level of excellence Americans deserve,” Ha Nguyen McNeill, the acting TSA administrator, warned lawmakers at a House hearing on Wednesday.
During the last partial government shutdown, which lasted 43 days in late 2025, McNeill said unscheduled absences for TSA employees increased and some airports saw spikes in delays as the weeks dragged on. Some employees, she told lawmakers, reported sleeping in their cars to save on gas, selling blood and plasma, and taking second jobs to make ends meet.
Other DHS agencies, including the Coast Guard, cybersecurity operations and disaster response at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, would also be affected, though many essential activities would continue under shutdown contingency plans. Overall, more than 90% of DHS’ roughly 272,000 employees would continue working during a partial shutdown, according to the agency’s
September shutdown plan

The United States has issued a warning that Peru risks eroding its sovereignty after a court ruling limited state oversight of a Chinese-controlled megaport, prompting a sharp rebuke from Beijing and intensifying geopolitical tensions over a strategic hub on South America’s Pacific coast.
The dispute centres on the Port of Chancay, a US$1.3 billion deep water facility located about 80 kilometres (50 miles) north of Lima and majority owned by China’s state-run shipping giant Cosco Shipping...

Trump: Herzog should be ashamed for not pardoning Netanyahu
2026-02-12 20:57:01 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/trump-herzog-should-be-ashamed-for-not-pardoning-netanyahu/

President Donald Trump sharply criticized Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Thursday, saying he "should be ashamed of himself" for refusing to grant a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even though he has the authority to do so.
Speaking about negotiations with Iran, his relationship with Netanyahu and responsibility for the October 7 attack, Trump said Herzog had already granted pardons five times in the past but was now refraining from doing so, possibly because "maybe he's losing his power." He added that the Israeli public should shame him for what he described as disgraceful conduct.
At the same time, Trump praised Netanyahu as "a great wartime prime minister," reiterating that he had been "the best friend Israel ever had" and would continue to act accordingly.
Turning to the talks with the Islamic Republic of Iran, Trump said a new deal must be reached and warned that if it is not, "it will be very traumatic."
"They should have made a deal the first time and they got 'the Midnight Hammer' instead," he said, adding that if no agreement is reached, "we'll go to stage two, which will be very tough for them."
Trump described his recent meeting with Netanyahu as "very good," but stressed, "In the end, it's up to me." He said he intended to continue negotiations with Iran "for as long as I want," and that a decision was expected soon.
"I assume within the next month. It has to happen fast. They have to agree very quickly," he said.
Asked whether Netanyahu had asked him to halt the negotiations, Trump replied, "He didn't say that. We didn't discuss it."
In response, the President's Residence said Herzog was currently on a flight back to Israel from an official visit to Australia. It added that, as repeatedly clarified, the prime minister's request is being handled in accordance with regulations by the Justice Ministry for a legal opinion. Only after that process is complete will the president examine the request in accordance with the law, the good of the state and his conscience, "without any external or internal pressure."
The statement also said that Herzog appreciates President Trump for his significant contribution to the State of Israel and its security, and stressed that "Israel is a sovereign state governed by the rule of law." The President's Residence further emphasized that, contrary to the impression created by Trump's remarks, Herzog has not yet made any decision on the matter.

Peace talks were supposed to save lives in Ukraine. Instead, last year became the war’s deadliest for civilians since 2022.
2026-02-12 20:54:35 GMT
https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/02/12/peace-talks-were-supposed-to-save-lives-in-ukraine-instead-last-year-became-the-war-s-deadliest-for-civilians-since-2022

The investigative group Conflict Intelligence Team (CIT) has released a
report
documenting civilians killed and wounded in the war between Russia and Ukraine in 2025. The summary, which tracks victims on both sides of the conflict, is CIT’s second — the
first
covered 2024. The report’s central finding is grim: Peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, brokered by the United States, failed to de-escalate the violence. Instead, civilian casualties surged so sharply that 2025 was the war’s deadliest year for noncombatants since 2022.
Conflict Intelligence Team volunteers have tracked civilian casualties on both sides of the front line since autumn 2023. Their database now holds more than 14,000 records of attacks involving at least one victim — up from 6,000 records a year ago.
To gather data, CIT volunteers primarily rely on statements from officials on both sides of the conflict and scour open sources, such as news reports and Telegram channels, for visual evidence. However, the group warns that it cannot verify every attack, particularly those not reported by local officials.

Overall figures
In 2025, 2,919 civilians were killed on both sides of the front, including 96 children. Another 17,770 civilians were injured, including 1,000 children. Consequently, the combined total of killed and wounded exceeded 20,500.
Compared with 2024, deaths increased by 12 percent and injuries by more than 25 percent.
Although Russia and Ukraine began discussing peace under U.S. pressure, the intensity of strikes on civilian infrastructure only increased in 2025. The monthly number of civilian casualties exceeded 1,550 people in nine of the 12 months of the year. The highest tolls were recorded in April, June, and July, with CIT documenting at least 2,000 killed or injured in each of those months.
According to CIT’s calculations, the deadliest attacks in 2025 targeted
Ternopil
on November 19 (38 killed, 92 injured),
Sumy
on April 13 (35 killed, 129 injured), and
Kyiv
on July 31 (32 killed, 158 injured). A June 24 strike on
Dnipro
caused the highest total casualties (21 killed, 319 injured).
Figures by sides of the conflict
In 2025, civilian casualties in Ukraine’s unoccupied territories totaled 16,300 (2,348 killed, 13,952 injured). In occupied areas, 298 people were killed and 1,751 injured. In Russia, 273 were killed and 2,072 wounded. In total, 79 percent of casualties occurred in territories under Ukraine’s official control.
Over the year, the number of civilian casualties in occupied areas of Ukraine decreased by 6 percent, while in unoccupied areas it increased by 35 percent.
The highest numbers of killed and wounded were recorded in the Donetsk and Kherson regions on both sides of the front line.
In the city and wider region of Kyiv, attacked almost daily by the Russian army, casualty numbers are comparable to frontline regions.
In Russia, Belgorod remains the most affected region for a second consecutive year: 134 civilians killed and 1,202 injured. This was followed by the Kursk region (61 killed, 327 wounded) and the Bryansk region (24 killed, 181 wounded). However, while the number of casualties in the Belgorod region decreased by 13 percent over the year, it increased in the other two regions.
Figures by weapon category
Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) caused the greatest damage. They killed 1,376 civilians and wounded another 10,089 on both sides of the front — more than all other types of weapons combined. Drone casualties increased approximately threefold in 2025 compared with 2024.
UAV attacks killed or injured 2,017 people in Russia, 888 in occupied areas of Ukraine, and 8,560 in the rest of Ukraine. CIT concluded that this disparity cannot be attributed solely to the gap in combat capabilities; rather, the Ukrainian army likely uses drones more carefully than the Russian army.
Artillery shells killed or injured 2,673 people on both sides (down 10 percent from 2024); missile strikes killed or injured 3,580 (down 3 percent); and aerial bombs killed or injured 2,648. Notably, deaths from aerial bombs increased by 40 percent, while injuries remained virtually unchanged.
Almost all civilians killed and wounded in aerial and missile strikes were in unoccupied Ukrainian territory — the Ukrainian Armed Forces have few missiles or aviation bombs for attacks on occupied areas and Russia. On the Russian side, aerial bombs caused 18 casualties over the year; in all cases, they were victims of Russian friendly fire.
CIT’s conclusions
Regrettably, the fourth year of the war will not be its last; combat operations are continuing. Peace talks initiated in the winter of 2025 failed to stop the conflict or even de-escalate it; instead, the opposite trend emerged. This impacted the civilian population, as the number of killed and injured noncombatants rose noticeably compared to 2024.
People in both frontline zones and rear areas fell victim to these attacks. Yet the data reveal a stark contrast: strikes on civilian infrastructure inflicted far greater casualties in non-occupied Ukraine than in occupied territories or Russia. We believe this discrepancy cannot be attributed merely to differences in firepower. Rather, it testifies to the fact that the Russian military employs indiscriminate force — and frequently commits outright war crimes — on a far greater scale than Ukrainian forces.
We must also note the growing role of drones — both small UAVs and large kamikaze drones — in terrorizing the population. The arrival of modern technologies offering greater control over weapons has not, unfortunately, reduced civilian suffering. This finding reinforces a crucial point: the harm weapons inflict on civilians depends first and foremost on the choices made by the military forces deploying them — far more than on the weapons’ design or capabilities.

Space Force, Aiming to Double in Size, Blows Past Recruiting Goal
2026-02-12 20:50:37 GMT
https://www.airandspaceforces.com/space-force-aiming-to-double-in-size-blows-past-recruiting-goal/

To meet growing demand for national security space capabilities, the Space Force’s top enlisted leader says it needs to double in size.
Chief Master Sergeant of the Space Force John Bentivegna told lawmakers Feb. 11 that the service’s current force of 10,000 uniformed Guardians isn’t enough to meet the Space Force’s evolving mission requirements and to confront increasing threats from adversaries like China and Russia.
“To effectively fulfill our national mandate, we must increase our infrastructure and double our size,” he said during a Senate Armed Services personnel subcommittee
hearing
. “This critical expansion is not only necessary, but entirely achievable.”
The Space Force has already surpassed its recruiting goals for fiscal 2026, Bentivegna said, and was at 125 percent of its goal after just five months. That includes 912 recruits who either have already entered basic military training or were enrolled in the delayed entry program as of Feb. 11, a service spokesperson told Air & Space Forces Magazine.
The Space Force’s recruiting goal is a small fraction of that of the other military services: just 730 recruits in 2026, down from 800 new recruits in fiscal 2025,
which the service successfully met last year
.  By contrast, the Air Force’s goal for 2026 is nearly 33,000. But the Air Force also has more than 30 times as many Airmen as the Space Force has Guardians, so proportionately, the difference is small.
A variety of factors go into setting baseline recruiting goals, the most important being needs of the service. Other factors, including recruiting and training capacity and propensity to serve are also factors. The Space Force has met or exceeded its recruiting goals every year since its establishment in late 2019.
“We’ll keep building on this momentum as America’s Space Force continues to grow into the future,” Chief of Space Operations Gen. B. Chance Saltzman wrote in a
social media post
.
Were Congress to authorize more personnel, Bentivegna said, there are ample qualified recruits to fill those spots.
The Space Force established its own recruiting squadron for the first time in 2025,
to help accelerate its growth
. The Air Force Accessions Center continues to manage recruiting for both the Air Force and Space Force, but until then, there was not a dedicated Space Force unit.
“Recruitment for the Space Force has been phenomenal,” Bentivegna said. “We have more individuals who want to commission and/or enlist into the Space Force than we can take in right now, which is why doubling the size is something I think is absolutely achievable.”
Bentivegna’s call for a larger Space Force echoes that of other service leaders in recent months. Speaking in January at an
event
hosted by Space News and Johns Hopkins University, Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. Shawn N. Bratton said he expects that in the next five to 10 years, the Space Force’s active duty and civilian forces will at least double. The service currently has 5,000 civilians, but lost a lot of talent last year as a result of job cuts imposed by the Trump administration.
Space Force budgets have
increased substantially, along with its missions,
since its first independent budget in fiscal 2021. That first budget was $15.4 billion, but spending has grown to nearly
$40 billion in fiscal 2026
, including the baseline budget request and additional funds in the reconciliation bill known as the Big Beautiful Bill Act that Congress approved last summer.
If President Donald Trump’s vision for a
$1.5 trillion defense budget in fiscal 2027
comes to fruition, that budget will grow even more. While Bratton and the service believe there’s a case for doubling or tripling the Space Force budget, he said some of that money should be invested in building out the infrastructure to sustain new and existing missions.
“I worry more now about the people and the infrastructure side of that equation than I do just how much is in the appropriations bill,” Bratton said Jan. 22. “We’re bringing on a lot of work. Do I have the program offices on the acquisition side to develop those capabilities and field them? Do we have the test and training infrastructure to really wring those capabilities out? Do I have … not only the number of Guardians, but do I have the places to operate from?”

The messy breakfast that delayed an EU summit
2026-02-12 20:45:52 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/alden-biesen-belgium-pedro-sanchez-bart-de-wever-giorgia-meloni-the-messy-breakfast-eu-summit/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

ALDEN BIESEN, Belgium — It was supposed to be a simple sit-down with like-minded countries. But an impromptu pre-meeting ahead of Thursday’s EU summit led to leaders being delayed, arrive late and then trade accusations over missing invitations.
The breakfast gathering at a hotel down the road from Alden Biesen castle, where the more formal talks between EU presidents and prime ministers on the bloc’s economy were to take place, was
organized by Italy in conjunction with Germany and Belgium
. It had its beginnings in a coalition that has met before to push tougher migration policy.
This time though, the group counted 19 out of the EU’s 27 leaders — sparking fears among those who weren’t there that the main meeting would be a stitch-up done behind closed doors, according to three diplomats from countries that weren’t invited.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez
lodged a protest with Rome
over the decision, according to newspaper El Mundo.
Joking he was meeting journalists outside the castle “in splendid isolation” while others breakfasted, Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin said “we weren’t invited” and “I don’t get the necessity” of a private club convening separately.
Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever, however, denied there was a rival clique forming. “I think everyone was invited,” he told journalists. “We don’t want the perception that there is a large group of countries that wants to impose its will on other countries, like Spain. That is not the intention.”
Original schedule
Adding to the rancor, the pre-meeting delayed the arrival of the leaders who did attend, with Council President António Costa kicking off the first session on economic growth before the three largest economies were even represented. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron were all running late after breaking bread.
Costa “started the discussion shortly before 11 a.m. because there are many things to discuss and he, as well as his guests, would like to stick to the original schedule as much as possible,” an EU official told POLITICO.
But it turned out those complaining they weren’t invited missed out on little.
“Nothing” said one diplomat from a country that was in attendance, when asked what the discussion focused on. With 19 leaders, few got a chance to speak — while “Meloni turned up late, just before it ended, and she was the one who invited them all.”

Ukraine Gets $35 Billion in Military Aid Pledges After Attacks

Russians paid crypto to restore Starlink. Ukrainian hackers took the money – and the data
2026-02-12 20:37:39 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/ukrainian-hackers-sting-russians-trying-to-buy-back-starlink-access/

Ukrainian hackers and volunteer OSINT analysts say they have disrupted Russian attempts to bypass restrictions on Starlink satellite internet, according to a
statement
from InformNapalm.
Starlink terminals had previously provided Russian forces with reliable communications across frontlines, but technical and access restrictions imposed by operator SpaceX and Ukrainian authorities limited military use in February.
Fake activation channels turned into intelligence trap
Russian personnel reportedly sought Ukrainian civilians willing to register terminals on their behalf for small cryptocurrency payments in an effort to restore connectivity.
Ukrainian cyber specialists, working with volunteers from 256 Cyber Assault Division and MILITANT, set up channels and automated bots that appeared to offer activation services. The operation collected information on Russian units and terminals, rather than enabling access.
2,400 data packages gathered in one week
Within a week, the groups said they gathered more than 2,400 data packages on Russian-operated Starlink terminals, documented dozens of contacts from collaborators, and received nearly $6,000 in cryptocurrency from Russian personnel attempting to restore connectivity.
InformNapalm said all technical data was passed to Ukrainian authorities, and identified terminals were permanently disabled.
The Ukrainian teams said the operation demonstrates the risks Russian forces face when attempting to bypass restrictions, exposing locations, networks, and personnel.
All figures and claims are based on statements from InformNapalm and the collaborating volunteer groups and have not been independently verified.
Why Russian forces turned to workarounds
The sting operation comes as Russian forces scramble to restore connectivity after SpaceX and Ukraine's Defense Ministry
blocked
unauthorized Starlink terminals across the front in early February.
Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov introduced a "whitelist" system that shut down all unregistered terminals, and adviser Serhiy Beskrestnov
called
the result a "catastrophe" for Russian forces, saying command and control had collapsed in many areas.
Starlink-equipped drones prompted crackdown
The crackdown followed a surge in Russian use of Starlink-equipped attack drones, including a strike on a passenger train in Kharkiv Oblast on 27 January that killed six people.
Starlink terminals made those drones
nearly immune
to Ukrainian electronic warfare, operating at frequencies far above conventional jamming range.

Atesh Discovered Russian Base Construction Near Melitopol

Russian occupation forces have begun construction of a new military base in the village of Myrne near Melitopol.
This was reported by the resistance movement
Atesh
.
According to Ukrainian freedom fighters, the occupiers are carrying out large-scale construction work on the site occupied by the 291st Guards Motor Rifle Regiment of the Russian Armed Forces.
This regiment belongs to the 42nd Motor Rifle Division and is permanently stationed in the village of Borzoy in Chechnya.
Construction equipment is working non-stop — the Russian military is building a permanent field camp to house personnel.

Special attention is being paid to the creation of a training cluster: the construction of sites for training unmanned aerial vehicle operators has been recorded.
In this way, the enemy is trying to form a rear base for training reserves and drone operators, counting on the fact that these facilities will remain inaccessible deep within the temporarily occupied territory.
According to Atesh, the facility is located at coordinates 46.930529, 35.417587 and is under constant surveillance by freedom fighters.
Information about its location has already been passed on to the Ukrainian Defense Forces.

Construction is being carried out on the territory that belonged to one of the emergency rescue units of the State Emergency Service, where the Russians have placed their Ministry of Emergency Situations units.
In addition, the Russian forces have occupied the barracks of the 16th Separate Regiment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which were also located on this site.
Previously, in November, the Atesh movement
carried out
a successful sabotage operation on the territory of the 229th air base in Rostov-on-Don, which belongs to the 4th Army of the Air and Space Forces and Air Defense of the Southern Military District of the Russian Federation.

All of the U.S. Government’s Anti-Climate Moves In the Last 7 Days
2026-02-12 20:24:26 GMT
https://time.com/7378238/trump-climate-epa-environment-rollbacks/

The Trump Administration repealed the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) landmark 2009 endangerment finding on Thursday, dismantling the legal framework that gives the government power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. It’s the administration’s biggest climate rollback to date—but it’s not the only anti-climate move President Donald Trump and Republican officials have made recently.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
At a White House event on Wednesday, Feb. 12, Trump announced that he had ordered the Pentagon to purchase more coal-based electricity, and that the Department of Energy would allocate $175 million in funding for six projects to upgrade coal plants in four states.
The announcement comes at a price. Of all fossil fuels, coal emits the
most
carbon dioxide per unit of energy, and burning it releases deadly pollution into the air. Research from the energy consulting group
Grid Strategies
also found that the Trump Administration’s push to keep coal plants open could cost U.S. utility customers between $3-6 billion by the end of 2028. That’s because coal is also among the most costly power sources. In the U.S.,
99% of coal plants
are more expensive to run than it would be to replace them with wind or solar.
“People and businesses across the country are struggling with rapidly escalating electricity costs,” Julie McNamara, associate policy director of the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a
statement
following Trump’s Wednesday decision. “The country has real solutions at hand—yet instead of pushing ahead with investments in the fastest, cheapest, cleanest resources available, the Trump Administration is actively doing everything it can to stop the deployment of new solar and wind projects, to stop investments in energy efficiency, and to stop the buildout of modern grid infrastructure.”

The History of the Endangerment Finding
In another recent setback to environmental protections, the Federal Judicial Center deleted a chapter on climate change from a judicial reference manual last Friday. This came after facing pressure from Republican state attorneys general, more than 20 of which
signed a letter
to the House and Senate judiciary committees stating that the manual was an “inappropriate attempt to rig case outcomes in favor of one side.” The guide is widely used and cited by legal clerks and justices when tackling important scientific questions they face in their decisions. It also includes chapters on other subjects like artificial intelligence, DNA identification, and epidemiology.
The same day, President Trump signed a proclamation on Feb. 6 to allow commercial fishing in the only marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean—a stretch of over 4,000 square miles that’s home to dolphins, endangered whales, sea turtles, and ancient deep-sea corals. “I find that appropriately managed commercial fishing would not put the objects of historic and scientific interest that the monument protects at risk,” he
wrote
in the proclamation.
However, environmentalists counter that commercial fishing will impact the ecosystem.
“Northeast Canyons and Seamounts is a truly special place: a living scientific laboratory, a refuge for creatures as varied as cold-water corals and sperm whales,” Brad Sewell, the managing director of oceans at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a
statement
. “Trump’s move to dismantle those protections is unlawful, and we’re confident that it won’t stand.”
Since taking office last year, President Trump, who has called climate change a “hoax” and a “con job,” has been quick to roll back a number of climate policies. Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law’s “
Climate Backtracker
,” has logged over 300 efforts from the administration to scale back or eliminate federal climate mitigation and adaptation measures—ranging from the withdrawal from the Paris Accords to opening up millions of acres in national forests for road construction and development.
Despite legal challenges to many efforts, the administration shows no sign of changing direction.
On Wednesday, Trump was given a
trophy
by the Washington Coal Club lobby group in the shape of a miner, inscribed with the words “Undisputed Champion of Beautiful Clean Coal.”
McNamara, of the Union of Concerned Scientists, said, “The art of the deal: for President Trump, a trophy; for real people, real costs.”

Virginia Supreme Court rules US Marine’s adoption of an Afghan war orphan will stand

2026-02-12T19:51:42Z
The Virginia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a U.S. Marine and his wife will keep an Afghan orphan they brought home in defiance of a U.S. government decision to reunite her with her Afghan family. The decision likely ends a bitter, yearslong legal battle over the girl’s fate.
In 2020, a judge in Fluvanna County, Virginia, granted Joshua and Stephanie Mast an adoption of the child, who was then 7,000 miles away in Afghanistan living with a family the Afghan government decided were her relatives.
Four justices on the Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday signed onto an opinion reversing
two lower courts’ rulings
that
found the adoption was so flawed
it was void from the moment it was issued.
The
justices wrote
that a Virginia law that cements adoption orders after six months bars the child’s Afghan relatives from challenging the court, no matter how flawed its orders and even if the adoption was obtained by fraud.
Three justices issued a scathing dissent, calling what happened in this court “wrong,” “cancerous” and “like a house built on a rotten foundation.”
An attorney for the Masts declined to comment, citing an order from the circuit court not to discuss the details of the case publicly. Lawyers representing the Afghan family said they were not yet prepared to comment.
The child was
injured on the battlefield
in Afghanistan in September 2019 when U.S. soldiers raided a rural compound. The child’s parents and siblings were killed. Soldiers brought her to a hospital at an American military base.
The raid was targeting terrorists who had come into Afghanistan from a neighboring country; some believed she was not Afghan and tried to make a case for bringing her to the U.S. But the State Department, under President Donald Trump’s first administration, insisted the U.S. was obligated under international law to work with the Afghan government and the International Committee of the Red Cross to unite the child with her closest surviving relatives.
The Afghan government determined she was Afghan and vetted a man who claimed to be her uncle. The U.S. government agreed and brought her to the family. The uncle chose to give her to his son and his new wife, who raised her for 18 months in Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, Mast and his wife convinced courts in rural Fluvanna County, Virginia, to grant them custody and then a series of adoption orders, continuing to claim she was the “stateless” daughter of foreign fighters.
Judge Richard Moore granted them a final adoption
in December 2020. When the six-month statute of limitations ran out, the child was still in Afghanistan living with her relatives, who testified they had no idea a judge was giving the girl to another family. Mast contacted them through intermediaries and tried to get them to send the girl to the U.S. for medical treatment but they refused to let her go alone.
When the U.S. military withdrew from Afghanistan and the Taliban took over, the family agreed to leave and Mast worked his military contacts to get them on an evacuation flight. Mast then took the baby from them at a refugee resettlement center in Virginia, and they haven’t seen her since.
The Afghans challenged the adoption, claiming the court had no authority over a foreign child and the adoption orders were based on Mast repeatedly misleading the judge.
The Virginia Supreme Court on Thursday wrote that the law prohibiting challenges to an adoption after six months is designed to create permanency, so a child is not bounced from one home to another. The only way to undercut it is to argue that a parent’s constitutional rights were violated.
The lower courts had found that the Afghan couple had a right to challenge the adoption because they were the girl’s “de facto” parents when they came to the United States.
Four of the Supreme Court judges — D. Arthur Kelsey, Stephen R. McCullough, Teresa M. Chafin, Wesley G. Russell Jr. — disagreed.
“We find no legal merit” in the argument that “that they were ‘de facto’ parents of the child and that no American court could constitutionally sever that relationship,” they wrote. They pointed to Fluvanna County Circuit Court Judge Richard Moore’s findings that the Afghan couple “are not and never were parents” of the child, because they had no order from an Afghan court and had not proven any biological relationship to her.
The Afghans had refused DNA testing, saying it could not reliably prove a familial connection between opposite-gender half-cousins. They insisted that it didn’t matter, because Afghanistan claimed the girl as its citizen and got to determine her next-of-kin.
The Supreme Court leaned heavily on a 38-page document written by Judge Moore, who granted the adoption, then presided over a dozen hearings after the Afghans challenged it. He wrote that he trusted the Masts more than the Afghans, and believed that Masts’ motivations were noble while the Afghans were misrepresenting their relationship to the child.
The Supreme Court also dismissed the federal government’s long insistence that Trump’s first administration had made a foreign policy decision to unite her with her Afghan relatives, and a court in Virginia has no authority to undo it. The government submitted filings in court predicting dire outcomes if the baby was allowed to remain with the Marine: it could be viewed as “endorsing an act of international child abduction,” threaten international security pacts and be used as propaganda by Islamic extremists — potentially endangering U.S soldiers overseas.
But the Justice Department in Trump’s second administration abruptly changed course.
The Supreme Court noted in its opinion that the Justice Department had been granted permission to make arguments in the case, but withdrew its request to do so on the morning of oral arguments last year, saying it “has now had an opportunity to reevaluate its position in this case.”
The Supreme Court returned repeatedly to Moore’s finding that giving the girl to the family “was not a decision the United States initiated, but rather consented to or acquiesced in.”
The three judges who dissented were unsparing in their criticism of both the Masts and the circuit court that granted him the adoption.
“A dispassionate review of this case reveals a scenario suffused with arrogance and privilege. Worse, it appears to have worked,” begins the dissent, written by Justice Thomas P. Mann, and signed by Chief Justice Cleo E. Powell and LeRoy F. Millette, Jr.
A Virginia court never had the right to give the child to the Masts, the dissent said.
They castigated the Masts for “brazenly” misleading the courts during their quest to adopt the girl.
“We must recognize what an adoption really is: the severance and termination of the rights naturally flowing to an otherwise legitimate claimant to parental authority. Of course, the process must be impeccable. An evolved society could not sanction anything less than that. And here, it was less,” Mann wrote. “If this process was represented by a straight line, (the Masts) went above it, under it, around it, and then blasted right through it until there was no line at all — just fragments collapsing into a cavity.”

IS suspects transferred from Syria to Iraq are interrogated in a Baghdad prison
2026-02-12 20:21:46 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/suspects-transferred-syria-iraq-are-interrogated-baghdad-prison

Inside a heavily guarded detention facility in
Baghdad
, men from scores of different countries and nationalities were brought one after another into interrogation rooms and questioned by Iraqi officers.
The prisoners are suspected members of the
Islamic State
group recently transferred from Syria to Iraq at the request of Baghdad — a move welcomed by the U.S.-led coalition that had for years fought against IS.
Over a period of several weeks, the U.S. military escorted more than 5,000 IS detainees from 60 different nationalities from prisons in northeastern Syria run by the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, to Baghdad.
The transfers have helped calm fears that the fighting in
Syria
would allow the IS prisoners to flee from detention camps there and join militant sleeper cells that even to this day are able to stage attacks in both Iraq and Syria.
On Thursday,
The Associated Press
was given rare access to the sprawling detention facility in western Baghdad — now known as Al-Karkh Central Prison but more widely known as Camp Cooper after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein — where the men are being interrogated.
Iraq is looking to put on trial some of the thousands of the IS detainees who were held for years in Syria without charges or access to the judicial system.
Iraqi Judge Ali Hussein Jafat, who is heading the committee interrogating IS detainees brought from Syria, says it's not easy because of the sheer numbers of prisoners involved.
It's "complicated and not easy at all," he said, adding that the detainees are from 14 Arab and 46 other countries.
Many of the detainees have respiratory diseases so a medical center was set up to treat them, he said.
To make room for the newcomers from Syria, thousands of prisoners long held at Al-Karkh were transferred to other prisons in Iraq.
The interrogations are usually a staggered affair — the men were brought in batches, handcuffed, in yellow or brown uniforms and wearing medical face masks, and taken into a long corridor with rooms on both side.
One by one they are then taken into interrogation rooms, where they sit on a chair as an officer takes down their information. From behind a small window, the
AP
could observe the questioning but not discern the questions or the detainees' answers. It wasn't clear if the prisoners were under duress.
Some of the prisoners are taken to the medical center for a checkup.
The forces of Syria's new government that in December 2024 ousted Bashar Assad launched an offensive in January, capturing wide swaths of territory from the Kurdish-led SDF.
A ceasefire was later reached, ending the fight and the SDF withdrew as part of the agreement.
At the time, the United States announced that many of the nearly 9,000 detainees held in more than a dozen Syrian detention centers will be transferred to Iraq.
So far, 5,383 IS suspects have been brought to Iraq. The last batch is expected to arrive on Sunday, Jafat said.
When IS declared a caliphate — a self-proclaimed territory under a traditional form of Islamic rule — in large parts of Syria and Iraq that the militant group seized in 2014, it attracted extremists from around the world.
From the caliphate, the extremists plotted attacks around the world that left hundreds dead from Europe to Arab countries and Asia.
The group also carried out brutalities in Syria and Iraq, including the enslavement of thousands of Yazidi women and girls who were taken when the militants overran northern Iraq. Strict rules were implemented, with IS beheading its opponents, thieves having their hands amputated while women accused of adultery were stoned to death.
Over the years, an international campaign by a U.S.-led coalition defeated IS in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria in 2019.
"Some of them are extremely dangerous," Jafat said about the detainees.
He added that he has so far seen detainees from Australia, Canada, Turkey, Germany, Britain and the former Soviet Union. There is even one Israeli-Arab man among them, he said.
Many of the countries don't want the militants who are their nationals back and Jafat said it is too early to say whether the detainees could be extradited or repatriated to their countries of origin.
Those who committed crimes in Iraq will stand trials in Iraq and the proceedings will be open to the public, he added.

Zelenskyy comments on his former top aide Yermak's dismissal: I had my reasons
2026-02-12 20:14:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020790/

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has commented on the dismissal of Andrii Yermak from the post of head of the Office of the President, saying the decision was not connected to a corruption investigation or searches at Yermak's home.
Source:
Zelenskyy in an interview with
The Atlantic
journalist Simon Shuster
Quote:
"For years, Zelenskyy resisted pressure from the US.government and many of his closest allies in Ukraine to fire his chief of staff, Andrii Yermak, who served as Ukraine's lead negotiator. An imperious figure with a tendency to grandstand, Yermak feuded with a succession of Western diplomats and just about everyone in Zelenskyy's entourage."
Details:
According to Shuster, the president agreed to dismiss Yermak only last autumn, on the day investigators searched his home as part of a corruption investigation.
However, as he noted, Zelenskyy refused to admit that the corruption investigation had forced his decision.
The president reacted emotionally to the question.
"I had my reasons,"
he said.

were conducting searches at Yermak's office
in the government district. Ukrainska Pravda journalists managed to record around 10 NABU and SAPO employees entering the government district.
Yermak confirmed that his home had been searched and said he was ready to assist the investigation.
Zelenskyy later announced that he

and that the President's Office. On 2 December, Zelenskyy
appointed Kyrylo Budanov

According to ZN.UA, Yermak visited the office of Ukraine's Foreign Intelligence Service on 5 December, although sources of Ukrainska Pravda did not confirm this information.

France and Norway will provide Ukraine with French-made guided aerial bombs as part of a new defense agreement.
The Ukrainian side already uses such weapons and has previously requested additional supplies, according to the
Norwegian Ministry of Defense
.
This likely refers to the
AASM Hammer
, which the Ukrainian Air Force actively uses on the front lines.
Norway will allocate approximately €365 million to implement this support. These funds will be the country’s first contribution under the new agreements between the states.
France will additionally guarantee a loan of approximately €260 million.

In addition to aviation weapons, the agreement provides for the development of surveillance capabilities. The partners also plan to provide the Ukrainian army with tools to improve situational awareness.
“These projects reflect Ukraine’s most pressing priorities and will have a rapid effect,” said Norwegian Defense Minister Tore Sandvik.

‘Stop This Spying’: Members of Congress Accuse the DOJ of Surveilling Lawmakers’ Epstein Files Searches
2026-02-12 19:59:15 GMT
https://time.com/7378099/epstein-files-bondi-jayapal-unredacted-search-history-spying/

Lawmakers have accused the Department of Justice (DOJ) of tracking their queries into files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after photos appeared to show the search history of a member of Congress included in documents held by Attorney General
Pam Bondi
.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Photos captured by
Reuters
and Agence France-Presse depict a sheet of paper in Bondi’s binder and her hand while she was testifying before the House Judiciary Committee that reads “Jayapal Pramila Search History,” in reference to the Democratic representative of Washington. The document then appears to list several of the files the DOJ has released related to Epstein, and brief summaries of their contents.
“It is totally inappropriate and against the separations of powers for the DOJ to surveil us as we search the Epstein files,” Jayapal
posted
on X on Wednesday evening. “Bondi showed up today with a burn book that held a printed search history of exactly what emails I searched. That is outrageous and I intend to pursue this and stop this spying on members.”
Lawmakers began reviewing unredacted documents from the so-called Epstein files this week after the DOJ granted permission for the records to be viewed on computers inside a secure room at the Justice Department. Jayapal confirmed in an
NPR
interview that the searches listed on the sheet Bondi was pictured holding corresponded to ones she had made at the DOJ.
“I do think that there is bipartisan agreement that we should be able to review those files without the Department of Justice surveilling us,” the Congresswoman said, noting that she had spoken to Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on Wednesday night. Jayapal also accused Bondi of intentionally allowing for searches to be made ahead of the hearing in an effort to prepare for questioning by House lawmakers.
At Wednesday’s hearing, Bondi faced criticism and probing questions from both Republicans and Democrats over the DOJ’s handling of the Epstein files’ release that at several points devolved into shouting matches. Lawmakers pressed the Attorney General about the delay in making the records public—despite a
law
that required all government documents related to the disgraced financier to be released by Dec. 19—as well as pushing her to address the redaction of the names of some individuals alleged to be tied to Epstein and the failure to shield private information and photos of a number of victims in the released documents.

Pam Bondi Declines to Directly Apologize to Epstein Victims During Capitol Hill Testimony
Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who has been outspoken in pushing for transparency and accountability in the Epstein case, also alleged that the DOJ is monitoring lawmakers’ searches into the files.
“Yes. I will confirm. DOJ is tracking the Epstein documents Members of Congress search for, open, and review,” Mace
posted
on X Wednesday evening. “I was able to navigate the system today and I won’t disclose how or the nature of how; but confirmed the DOJ is tagging ALL DOCUMENTS Members of Congress search, open and review.”
Mace told
NPR
that “there is someone or two people from the DOJ monitoring you as you sit on those computers” and that lawmakers are given their “own identification” upon being logged into the computers by a “tech person” at the department. “They are tracking all of the documents that members of Congress open, and they’re tracking everything that you do in that room,” she said.

Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, similarly described lawmakers being watched while viewing what he called the “slightly-less-redacted” files, saying in a statement that the department required them to “sit at one of four DOJ-owned computers, use a clunky and convoluted software system provided by DOJ, and search for and read documents while DOJ staffers look over our shoulders.”
“Bondi and her team are spying on Members of Congress conducting oversight in yet another blatant attempt to intrude into Congress’s oversight processes,” said Raskin, who engaged in multiple heated exchanges with Bondi during Wednesday’s hearing. He called for an immediate end to the tracking of lawmakers’ searches and the public release of all files related to Epstein with “all the survivors’ information, and only the survivors’ information, properly redacted.”
“I will also be asking the DOJ Inspector General to open an inquiry into this outrageous abuse of power,” Raskin added.
The DOJ did not immediately respond to TIME’s request for comment.

Homeland Security shutdown seems certain as funding talks between White House and Democrats stall

2026-02-12T19:25:31Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — A shutdown for the Department of Homeland Security appeared certain Thursday as lawmakers in the House and Senate were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break and negotiations with the White House over Democrats’ demands for new restrictions had stalled.
The White House and Democrats have
traded offers in recent days
as the Democrats have said they want curbs on President Donald Trump’s broad campaign of
immigration enforcement
. They have demanded better identification for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal law enforcement officers, a new code of conduct for those agencies and more use of judicial warrants, among other requests.
The White House sent its most recent offer late Wednesday, including what Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said were “concessions” on the part of the Republican administration.
Thune would not say what those concessions were, though, and he acknowledged the sides were “a long ways toward a solution” even as the Senate is scheduled to vote again on the DHS funding.
Democrats did not respond publicly to the White House offer, but Democratic senators voted against a funding bill for the department before leaving town, meaning the funding will
expire Saturday
without further action. The bill was rejected, 52-47, short of the 60 votes needed for passage.
Lawmakers in both chambers were on notice to return to Washington if the two sides struck a deal to end the expected shutdown. But for now, Democrats say they need to see real changes before they will support DHS funding.
Americans want accountability and “an end to the chaos,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Thursday before the vote. “The White House and congressional Republicans must listen and deliver.”
Schumer said it was not enough that the administration had announced an
end
to the
immigration crackdown
in Minnesota that led to thousands of arrests and the fatal shootings of two protesters.
“We need legislation to rein in ICE and end the violence,” Schumer said, or the actions of the administration “could be reversed tomorrow on a whim.”
Judicial warrants a sticking point
Democrats made the
demands for new restrictions on ICE
and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse
Alex Pretti
was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, Some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary.
Renee Good
was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7.
Thune, who has urged Democrats and the White House to work together, indicated that one sticking point is the Democratic request for more judicial warrants.
“The issue of warrants is going to be very hard for the White House or for Republicans,” Thune said. “But I think there are a lot of other areas where there has been give, and progress.”
In a list of demands they sent to the White House last week, Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said DHS officers should not be able to enter private property without a judicial warrant and that warrant procedures and standards should be improved. They have said they want an end to “roving patrols” of agents who are targeting people in the streets and in their homes.
Most immigration arrests are carried out under administrative warrants. Those are internal documents issued by immigration authorities that authorize the arrest of a specific person but do not permit officers to forcibly enter private homes or other nonpublic spaces without consent. Traditionally, only warrants signed by judges carry that authority.
But
an internal ICE memo
obtained by The Associated Press last month
authorizes ICE officers
to use force to enter a residence based solely on a more narrow administrative warrant to arrest someone with a final order of removal, a move that advocates say collides with Fourth Amendment protections.
White House silence
Congress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump
agreed to a Democratic request
that it be separated from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended homeland security funding at current levels only through Friday.
Schumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to
remove their masks
, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.
Democrats also say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests and require that before a person can be detained, authorities have verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.
Republicans have been largely opposed to most of the items on Democrats’ list. But Trump has remained relatively silent about the talks.
Impact of a shutdown
Republicans tried to temporarily extend the funding, but Democrats blocked that bill as well.
“We will not support an extension of the status quo,” Schumer said.
The impact of a DHS shutdown is likely to be minimal at first. It would not likely block any of the immigration enforcement operations, as Trump’s tax and spending cut bill passed last year gave ICE about $75 billion to expand detention capacity and bolster enforcement operations.
But the other agencies in the department — including the Transportation Security Administration, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Secret Service and the Coast Guard — could take a bigger hit over time.
Gregg Phillips, an associate administrator at FEMA, said at a hearing this week that its disaster relief fund has sufficient balances to continue emergency response activities during a shutdown, but would become seriously strained in the event of a catastrophic disaster.
Phillips said that while the agency continues to respond to threats like flooding and winter storms, long-term planning and coordination with state and local partners is “irrevocably impacted.”

After 600 days, Brussels gets a government
2026-02-12 19:37:17 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/brussels-government-600-days/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

Brussels finally has a regional government after parties came to an agreement following more than 600 days of deadlock.
Seven parties have been locked in negotiations since Tuesday and, on Thursday night, Georges-Louis Bouchez, leader of the Francophone liberal Reformist Movement (MR),
posted a picture of white smoke
on social media.
“We are relieved that after more than 600 days we have a government again in the capital of Europe,” Bouchez told reporters, adding all seven parties had found a common position.
The Belgian capital had been without a regional government since an election in June 2024, with parties unable to agree on forming a coalition, causing chaos for the city’s finances. Brussels is currently grappling with a staggering €15 billion debt, raising concerns about a looming financial crisis.
The parties involved in this week’s talks were the Francophone MR, socialist PS and centrist Les Engagés, and the Flemish leftist Groen, social democratic party Vooruit, liberal Anders and conservative CD&V.
Speaking at an informal European leaders summit, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever reacted with cautious optimism to the news.
“I’ve seen the WhatsApp messages coming in about it. I mainly want to see what the agreement entails,” he said, adding “the Brussels budget has completely gone off the rails.”
Belgium’s devolved system of governance means its three regions — French-speaking Wallonia in the south, Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north and Brussels sandwiched between them — each have a government separate from Belgium’s national government.

Democrats eye legal action, GOP seeks answers on Trump admin "spying" on Congress
2026-02-12 19:32:58 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/pam-bondi-trump-spying-congress-doj-epstein

The Justice Department is coming under intense scrutiny from members of Congress in both parties for allegedly cataloguing the search history of lawmakers who have gone to review the
unredacted Epstein files
.
Why it matters:
It's a fresh and high-octane scandal for Attorney General Pam Bondi at a time when she is already
facing bipartisan heat
over her handling of the Epstein matter.
"There is no bottom for the Trump administration," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) said at a press conference Thursday.
The Democratic leader added: "It's a disgrace. It does violate the principles of separate and co-equal branches of government."
Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said he doesn't think "it's appropriate" for anyone to be tracking what members of Congress are searching — though he speculated that it may have been "an oversight."
Driving the news:
Bondi was
photographed
at a
testy House Judiciary Committee
hearing on Wednesday with notes that showed a "search history" for Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) referencing specific Epstein files.
Jayapal was one of several Judiciary Committee members who went this week to go through the
unredacted files
, which have been made available to lawmakers on terminals at the DOJ's headquarters.
Bondi appeared to have rejoinders teed up for specific members of Congress at the hearing, with Judiciary Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) accusing her of having a "burn book" on Democrats.
A DOJ spokesperson told Axios: "DOJ has extended Congress the opportunity to review unredacted documents in the Epstein files. As a part of that review, DOJ logs all searches made on its systems to protect against the release of victim information."
What they're saying:
"For much of the time, there were ... DOJ employees who were looking — I had somebody sitting right behind me for a lot of the time — looking at exactly what I was searching," Jayapal told reporters.
"They had logins that had our names, they logged us into the computers ... so clearly they intended to look at our search history even when they invited us in," Jayapal said.
Jayapal accused Bondi at Wednesday's hearing of wanting "to know what emails we were going to ask about, and then use that information, the surveillance of members of Congress, against us."
What we're hearing:
Democrats told Axios on Thursday that they are eyeing a wide array of responses.
"I think we are within our right to pursue legal action," Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vt.) told Axios.
An official for one outside advocacy group confirmed they are "definitely exploring" legal recourse in coordination with members.
House Oversight Committee ranking member Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) said Democrats will conduct a "full investigation" into the matter, while Raskin said he will ask the DOJ inspector general to open an inquiry.
Zoom in:
Balint also told Axios she and other lawmakers are coordinating a letter to the Justice Department demanding "a change of policy at DOJ, today."
The letter will say "you are not going to be gathering our data separately, it all has to be no discrete logins," Balint said.
The Vermont Democrat said she spoke to House Minority Whip Katherine Clark (D-Mass.), who is "interested in having leadership involved."
The intrigue:
It's not just Democrats up in arms about this. "They're tagging the documents that members of Congress search for and open and review, they're actually physically tagging them," Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) told reporters.
"It makes you wonder why they're doing it," she continued. "I didn't like it, and I found it disturbing and intimidating ... they should have let members know and disclosed that."
House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-Ky.) told Axios he is "going to ask and see if they did that. ... I have no idea if that's what it was or not, we'll try to find out."
The other side:
House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) told Axios he has no issue with the DOJ's actions.
"For people to raise this in light of what we've seen from Jack Smith and the Arctic Frost investigation" is "pretty rich," Jordan said, referring to the Trump special counsel's
seizure of GOP lawmakers' phone records
as part of his Jan. 6 investigation.
Comer said he is "not really" concerned about the issue, telling Axios he is "very satisfied that [the DOJ] has opened everything up and let everybody go there and see it."
The bottom line:
"This is very serious," Balint said. "Very serious. And we're not going to let it go."
Editor's note: This story has been updated with comment from the Justice Department.

Morocco to spend $330 million on regions ravaged by floods: govt
2026-02-12 19:27:08 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/morocco-spend-330-million-regions-ravaged-floods-govt

Morocco
plans to spend some $330 million on regions hit hardest by weeks of flooding across the country's north that have battered its key agricultural zones, the government said Thursday.
King Mohammed VI
instructed the government to launch "a broad support programme for affected families and communities", according to a government statement.
The four deluge-stricken provinces -- Larache, Kenitra, Sidi Kacem, Sidi Slimane -- were designated disaster zones, with a budget of 3 billion dirhams (about $328 million) earmarked for the response.
The funds will go towards repairing damaged road and agricultural infrastructure, relocating displaced households, compensating for lost income and refurbishing flooded homes and businesses.
The aid will also target farmers and cover basic needs for affected populations.
The "exceptional weather conditions" that have swept Morocco since late January have "flooded more than 110,000 hectares" of land and displaced nearly 188,000 people across these regions, the government said.
Authorities carried out preventive and emergency evacuations, but four people died last weekend in the Tetouan area when a flash flood swept away their vehicle. A passenger is still missing.
The Gharb and Loukkos river basins, which empty into the Atlantic and irrigate the four provinces, are among Morocco's most important agricultural zones.
They are home to large cereal farms, livestock holdings and major plantations of red fruits, vegetables and sugar beets for export.
From January 11 to February 11, water inflows reached 8.82 billion cubic metres -- nearly matching the combined total of the past two years (9 billion), according to the government.

2026-02-12T14:09:23Z
MILAN (AP) — An
all-time great comeback
and a
controversial exclusion
are dominating the Milan Cortina Olympics on Day 6.
Later Thursday,
Chloe Kim
of the United States seeks to become the first snowboarder to win three straight Olympic gold medals in women’s halfpipe. And NHL players on the U.S. and Canada teams are joining the action in their opening men’s hockey games.
Brignone back in style
For much of last year, it wasn’t clear if Italian skier Federica Brignone could compete at her home Olympics at all, let alone contend for a medal.
She came away with gold in the women’s super-G on Thursday, following a year spent largely in rehab after
breaking multiple bones
in her leg. She only returned to racing last month.
Brignone shrugged off difficult, foggy conditions to win her fourth career Olympic medal and become, at 35, the oldest female gold medalist in women’s Alpine skiing. Romane Miradoli of France took silver and Cornelia Huetter of Austria got bronze.
Ukrainian slider excluded
As the men’s skeleton competition got under way,
all the attention
was on a Ukrainian athlete who wasn’t on the track.
Vladyslav Heraskevych was barred from racing after refusing to give up his plan to race in a helmet commemorating athletes who have been killed since Russia invaded his country. The International Olympic Committee says it breaks rules against making statements on the field of play.
IOC President Kirsty Coventry turned up at the sliding track in a last-minute bid to change Heraskevych’s mind ahead of the opening run of the competition Thursday morning.
Heraskevych, who had been a contender for the medals, refused and was excluded from the Olympics.
Heraskevych said it “looks like discrimination” to bar him from competing. Coventry, who said she’d hoped to find a compromise, was tearful on what she called an “emotional morning.”
Canada’s men and women win in hockey
Connor McDavid had three assists and Jordan Binnington made 26 saves to help
Canada beat Czechia 5-0
in the opening game of their Olympic campaign.
The U.S. men play their first Olympic game later Thursday against Latvia.
The Canadian women responded after their
worst-ever Olympic loss
by
beating Finland 5-0
to end the preliminary round. That sets up a quarterfinal meeting with Germany on Saturday.
Upset in freestyle
In a
major upset
, Cooper Woods of Australia won freestyle skiing gold in men’s moguls by edging Canadian great Mikael Kingsbury — the sport’s most decorated skier — on a tiebreaker.
American skier Jessie Diggins overcame bruised ribs to take bronze in the women’s 10-kilometer cross-country skiing race. Frida Karlsson
won her second gold medal
of the Milan Cortina Games by leading a 1-2 finish for Sweden.
Italian speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida, whose great aunt was movie star Gina Lollobrigida,
won her second gold
of the Olympics by a tenth of a second in the women’s 5,000 meters.
Alessandro Haemmerle of Austria and Eliot Grondin of Canada repeated as gold and silver medalists, respectively, in
men’s snowboardcross
.
Germany
won the team luge
, as it has done at every Olympics since the event was added in 2014.
Later Thursday, Arianna Fontana of Italy will go for a record-extending 13th career Olympic medal in short-track speedskating.

Scientists say genetic analysis could greatly speed restoration of iconic American chestnut

2026-02-12T19:00:41Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — Billions of
American chestnut trees
once covered the eastern United States. They soared in height, producing so many nuts that sellers moved them by train car. Every Christmas, they’re called to mind by the holiday lyric “chestnuts roasting on an open fire.”
But by the 1950s, this venerable tree went functionally extinct, culled by a deadly airborne fungal blight and lethal root rot. A new study out Thursday in the journal Science provides hope for its revitalization, finding that the genetic testing of individual trees can reveal which are most likely to resist disease and grow tall, thus shortening how long it takes to plant the next, more robust, generation.
A smaller gap between generations means a faster path to lots of disease-resistant trees that will once again be able to compete for space in Eastern forests. The authors hope that can occur in the coming decades.
“What’s new here is the engine that we’re creating for restoration,” said Jared Westbrook, lead author and director of science at The American Chestnut Foundation, which wants to return the tree to its native range that once stretched from Maine to Mississippi.
The American chestnut, sometimes called the “redwood of the East,” can grow quickly and reach more than 100 feet (30 meters), produce prodigious amounts of nutritious chestnuts and supply lumber favored for its straight grain and durability.
But it had little defense against foreign-introduced blight and root rot. Another type of chestnut, however, had evolved alongside those diseases. The Chinese chestnut had been introduced for its valuable nuts and it could resist diseases. But it isn’t as tall or competitive in U.S. forests, nor has it served the same critical role supporting other species.
So, the authors want a tree with the characteristics of the American chestnut and the disease resistance of the Chinese chestnut.
That goal is not new — scientists have been reaching for it for decades and made some progress.
But it has been difficult because the American chestnut’s desirable traits are scattered across multiple spots along its genome, the DNA string that tells the tree how to develop and function.
“It’s a very complex trait, and in that case, you can’t just select on one thing because you’ll select on linked things that are negative,” said John Lovell, senior author and researcher at the HudsonAlpha Genome Sequencing Center.
Breed for disease resistance alone and the trees get shorter, less competitive.
To deal with this, the authors sequenced the genome of multiple types of chestnuts and found the many places that correlated with the desired traits. They can then use that information to breed trees that are more likely to have desirable traits while maintaining high amounts of American chestnut DNA — roughly 70% to 85%.
And genetic testing allows the process to move faster, revealing the best offspring years before their traits would be demonstrated by natural growth and encountering disease. The closer the gap between generations, the faster gains accumulate.
Steven Strauss, a professor of forest biotechnology at Oregon State University who wasn’t involved in the study, said the paper identified some promising genes. He wants scientists to be able to
edit the genes
themselves, a possibly faster, more precise path to a better tree. In an accompanying commentary piece in Science, he says regulations can bog down these ideas for years.
“People just won’t consider biotech because it is on the other side of this social, legal barrier” and that’s shortsighted, he said.
For people who have closely studied the American chestnut, the work begs an almost existential question: How much can the American chestnut be changed and still be an American chestnut?
“The American chestnut has a unique evolutionary history, it has a specific place in the North American ecosystem,” said Donald Edward Davis, author of the American chestnut, an environmental history. “Having that tree and no other trees would be sort of the gold standard.”
He said the tree was a keystone species, useful to humans and vital to bigger populations of squirrels, chipmunks and black bears — hybrids might not be as majestic or effective. He was pleased that the authors included some surviving American chestnuts in their proposal, but favored an approach that relied on them more heavily.
“Not that the hybrid approach is itself bad, it is just that why not try to get the wild American trees back in the forest, back in the ecosystem, and exhaust all possibilities from doing that before we move on to some of these other methods?” he said.
Lovells said resurrecting the species requires introducing genetic diversity from outside the traditional pool of American chestnut trees. The study authors’ goal is tall, resilient trees and they are optimistic.
“I think if we only select American chestnut (tree genes), period, there’s going to be too small of a pool and we’re going to end up with a genetic bottleneck that will lead to extinction in the future,” said Lovell.

Syria clears roadblocks for some Lebanese trucks after ban: state media
2026-02-12 19:17:11 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/syria-clears-roadblocks-some-lebanese-trucks-after-ban-state-media

Lebanon
has secured temporary exemptions for freight vehicles hauling certain goods after a recent ban by Damascus on foreign trucks, state media reported on Thursday.
Damascus
had issued a decision on Saturday stipulating that "non-Syrian trucks will not be allowed to enter" the country, and that goods being imported by road must be unloaded at specific points at border crossings.
The decision exempts trucks that are only passing through Syria to other countries.
Lebanese and Syrian trucks will now unload and reload goods at a joint zone along the border, Lebanon's state-run
National News Agency
said, with a temporary mechanism put in place to regulate movement over seven days.
However, goods transported in tankers, hazardous materials, cement, raw materials for cement production, as well as meat and pharmaceuticals will be exempt from these border transfers.
The deal will also allow the one-time entry of trucks that have been stranded at the border since the ban took effect, Ahmad Tamer, head of land and maritime transportation at the Lebanese transport ministry told
AFP
.
The two sides will meet again before the end of the seven-day deadline to evaluate the situation.
Lebanon sends around 500 trucks to Syria per day, according to Tamer. Syria is the only land route Lebanon can use to export merchandise to wealthy Gulf markets.
Jordan, which is also affected by the ban, has yet to reach an agreement with Damascus, transport ministry spokesperson Mohammed al-Dweiri told
AFP

Trump's big climate reversal sets up a courtroom clash
2026-02-12 19:16:30 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/trump-epa-endangerment-finding-climate-regulation-00778446

President Donald Trump’s campaign to quash climate change policies notched its biggest win yet on Thursday, as EPA eliminated the legal basis for regulations aimed at restricting greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes and smokestacks that are heating the planet.
The repeal of the 2009 “endangerment finding” that served as the regulatory basis for a swath of rules limiting pollution from sources like cars, trucks and power plants comes as the Environmental Protection Agency has moved to roll back regulations it says burden businesses and hinder economic growth. The administration says the move will save companies more than $1 trillion, but critics argue that ignores the much greater costs of climate change from extreme weather, sea level rise and heat-related health impacts.
"We are officially terminating the so-called endangerment finding, a disastrous Obama-era policy that severely damaged the American auto industry and massively drove up prices for American consumers," Trump said in announcing the repeal.
Trump has aided the oil, natural gas and coal industries while slowing or stopping the expansion of electric vehicles and solar and wind power. On Wednesday, he gathered coal miners at the White House to announce
a raft of new measures
aimed at reviving a fuel that has suffered sharp declines in the past two decades amid tightening pollution rules.
Now, the elimination of the endangerment finding represents a foundational statement that the nation’s powerful clean air law can do almost nothing about the pollution driving climate change.
In an unusual move, the president of EPA's biggest staff union issued a statement blasting the administration for siding with "powerful corporate polluters" on climate change.
"This is a deep betrayal of the EPA’s mission and duty to protect public health and safety, and Americans will pay the price," said Justin Chen, an environmental engineer at EPA and president of AFGE Council 238, which represents thousands of EPA workers nationwide.
Environmentalists and Democratic-controlled states will mount a fierce legal challenge to the repeal (Reg. 2060-AW71), which also lifts all greenhouse gas standards for vehicles ranging from sedans to 18-wheelers, the sector representing the largest chunk of U.S. emissions.
“We're going to be taking this fight to the courtroom, and we are going to win,” Manish Bapna, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said at a Wednesday rally outside EPA headquarters.
Joe Goffman, who ran EPA’s air office in the Biden administration and wrote many of the climate rules now being repealed, scoffed at the Trump administration’s reasoning for eliminating the finding.
“Asking the American people to believe that climate pollution no longer poses a danger is, frankly, stupid,” he said. “It's especially stupid since it asks us to deny what we see with our own eyes.”
Rather than challenging established climate science, EPA’s primary argument is that the Clean Air Act was never intended to allow for regulation of greenhouse gases because climate change is a global phenomenon. EPA, it argued, had only ever regulated pollution with direct health impacts or that could create regional issues like acid rain, and should stick to that. Such a limitation, however, is not expressed in the law itself.
The agency had initially mounted an attack on climate science itself, arguing that most scientists have overblown both the impact and harms of climate pollution, a conclusion based on
a draft Energy Department report
written in secret by a handful of scientists known for contrarian views on climate change. DOE was forced to halt that group’s work in recent months after a judge said it had run afoul of federal laws for advisory committees meant to promote transparency and balance.
Trump, who has long argued climate change is a "hoax," maintained that stance on Thursday when asked what he would tell Americans worried about climate impacts on public health and the environment.
"I'd tell them, don't worry about it, because it has nothing to do with public health. This was all a scam, a giant scam. This was a ripoff of the country by Obama and Biden," Trump told reporters.
Many scientists, meanwhile,
pushed back on EPA’s claims
, and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine said last fall that the scientific case for climate change
has only strengthened
over the past decade and a half.
“Much of the understanding of climate change that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 is now resolved and new threats have been identified,” NASEM’s report said.
Ultimately, the administration is banking that the conservative-dominated Supreme Court will uphold the repeal. That would mark a sea change at the high court from almost two decades ago, when the court issued a landmark ruling finding that greenhouse gases count as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act, effectively setting a mandate for EPA to regulate.
Republicans and industry have vehemently opposed the subsequent regulations on vehicles, power plants and the oil and gas sector, and now believe that the high court’s conservative supermajority — which was created by Trump and congressional Republicans in his first term and has since reined in EPA’s authority — is ready to do a U-turn on climate change.
“The new and improved Supreme Court has helped tremendously” in convincing the administration to repeal the finding, said Myron Ebell, Trump's first-term EPA transition leader and a long-time opponent of the finding. “I think a lot of people felt that in [Trump’s first term] that they couldn't actually win at the Supreme Court level.”
Whether the justices will uphold the endangerment finding repeal — and in doing so, throw into chaos decades of climate law and liability — remains to be seen. The court battle likely will take much of the rest of Trump’s time in office.
But supporters of climate action argue the Trump administration’s reasoning is pretextual.
“Science did not change when Donald Trump was inaugurated,” Goffman said. “What did change was the arrival of new EPA management determined to destroy the agency's public health and environmental mission.”
Sen.
Sheldon Whitehouse
(D-R.I.) argued the repeal is part of a broader "scheme" in which the Trump administration is blocking clean energy because it has become cheaper than fossil fuels.
"That means when the clean energy isn't there, the grid has to climb up the generation stack to fossil fuel plants that would not otherwise be running," Whitehouse said. "It is a massive transfer of wealth from electric utility ratepayers to Trump's big fossil fuel donors."
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, warned that if the repeal survives court challenges, there will be more wildfires, floods, droughts and extreme heat deaths.
"Donald Trump may put corporate greed ahead of communities and families, but California will not stand by — we will sue to challenge this illegal action, and we will continue fighting climate pollution here in our state," he said in a statement.
In addition to repealing the endangerment finding and its related vehicle standards, EPA is working to revoke the Biden administration's climate rule for power plants as well as a long-standing requirement forcing major industries to report their greenhouse gas emissions.
The agency is also considering significant changes to the oil and gas industry rule limiting emissions of methane, the main component of natural gas that is a powerful driver of near-term warming when it’s released unburned.

Guardian view on Sir Jim Ratcliffe: Britain does not need political lectures from a billionaire tax exile | Editorial

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/12/guardian-view-on-sir-jim-ratcliffe-britain-does-not-need-political-lectures-from-a-billionaire-tax-exile

Comments on the ‘colonisation of the UK’ by the co-owner of Manchester United were erroneous, crass and a gift to divisive forces in British society
In 2020, the year Sir Jim Ratcliffe moved his huge fortune to Monaco, migrants in the United Kingdom made tax contributions
estimated
to be worth around £20bn. Sir Jim, by jetting off to a tax haven on the French Riviera,
saved
himself an estimated £4bn. It took some brass neck for the expat owner of Ineos and co-owner of Manchester United football club to
lecture
the country, using inflammatory and offensive language, on the perils of immigration.
Where to begin? The statistics used by Sir Jim to back his claim that Britain was being “colonised” by migrants, in an interview with Sky News, were flatly wrong. They were also astonishingly crass, coming from a man who presides over a sporting institution famous for and proud of its global fanbase and international connections.

The Guardian view on Israel and the West Bank: the other relentless assault upon Palestinians | Editorial

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/12/the-guardian-view-on-israel-and-the-west-bank-the-other-relentless-assault-upon-palestinians

A campaign of ethnic cleansing and ‘tectonic’ new legal measures are killing the two-state solution to which other governments pay lip service
Protecting archaeological sites. Preventing water theft. The streamlining of land purchases. If anyone doubted the real purpose of the motley collection of
new administrative and enforcement measures for the illegally occupied West Bank
, Israel’s defence minister spelt it out: “We will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state,” Israel Katz said in a joint statement with the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich.
While the world’s attention was fixed upon the annihilation in Gaza, settlers in the West Bank intensified their campaign of ethnic cleansing. More than 1,000 Palestinians
have been killed there
since October 2023; a fifth of them were children. Many more have been driven from their homes by relentless harassment and the destruction of infrastructure, with
entire Palestinian communities erased
across vast swathes of land.

Trump plans to announce Gaza funding plan, troops at first Board of Peace meeting, US officials say
2026-02-12 19:05:31 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/trump-plans-announce-gaza-funding-plan-troops-first-board-peace-meeting-us-officials-say

US President
Donald Trump
will announce a multi-billion dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and detail plans for a U.N.-authorised stabilisation force for the enclave, the first formal meeting of his so-called Board of Peace next week, two senior U.S. officials said on Thursday.
Delegations from at least 20 countries, including many heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting in Washington, D.C., which Trump will chair on 19 February, the officials told
Reuters
on condition of anonymity.
The details on Trump's plans for the first meeting of his Board of Peace for Gaza have not been previously reported.
Trump signed documents in Davos, Switzerland, on 23 January establishing the
Board of Peace
. The board's creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's Gaza plan.
While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu
, who has an arrest warrant against him by the International Criminal Court, said on Wednesday during his visit to Washington that Israel has joined the board. Trump has stirred concerns that the Board of Peace might try to resolve other conflicts around the world and compete with the United Nations.
However, U.S. officials said the meeting next week will focus solely on Gaza. They said a central part of the meeting will be Trump's announcement of a multi-billion-dollar fund for Gaza, which will include monetary contributions from participating board members.
One official called the offers "generous" and said that the United States had not made any explicit requests for donations. "People have come to us offering," the official said. "The president will make announcements vis a vis the money raised."
The deployment of the International Stabilisation Force is a key part of the next phase of Trump's Gaza plan, announced in September.
Trump will announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilisation force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead, the officials said.
Under Trump's Gaza plan, Hamas members who commit to decommissioning their weapons will be given amnesty, and members of the group who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.
The Board of Peace meetings will also include detailed reports on the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which was established to take over the day-to-day civil administration of Gaza Strip from Hamas. The committee announced its members and held its first meeting in January.
Other updates will cover humanitarian aid for Gaza as well as the Gaza police, the officials said.

Almost half million Ukrainian refugees have left Germany since 2022
2026-02-12 19:03:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020782/

More than 471,000 people who arrived from Ukraine have left Germany since 2022.
Source:
German Interior Ministry data as of 31 January 2026 in response to a
DW
request, as reported by European Pravda
Details:
The Ministry also reported that as of 7 February 2026 Central Register of Foreigners recorded a total of 1.157 million people who entered Germany from 24 February 2022 due to Russia's war against Ukraine and who were granted temporary protection.
Among them were around 484,000 men and around 672,000 women, including around 305,000 minors.
"Of the above number of registered persons with temporary protection, 85,266 were men aged 18 to 26," the ministry noted.
At the same time, the German Interior Ministry noted it does not have data on the number of people with Ukrainian citizenship who entered the country in January 2026 because this group can enter Germany without a visa and stay here for up to 90 days.
The Ministry also said it does not expect "significant decrease in the number of refugees arriving in EU and Germany" in near future given "ongoing hostilities and constant Russian attacks". "However, it is impossible to make reliable forecasts or specific expectations of the German government based on this," the German Interior Ministry stressed.
Background:
At the end of 2025, 4.35 million Ukrainians had temporary protection in the EU, and around 24,600 people obtained it in the last month of the year.

Russia strikes DTEK thermal power plants for 11th time since October as winter energy crisis deepens
2026-02-12 19:02:09 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/russia-strikes-dtek-thermal-power-plants-for-11th-time-since-october/

Russian forces have once again struck DTEK’s thermal power stations and electricity infrastructure overnight on 12 February, Ukraine’s largest energy company said.
The latest strikes are part of a broader pattern of intensified Russian attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this winter. Power plants and substations across the country have repeatedly been targeted in recent months, putting critical services under sustained pressure and complicating efforts to maintain electricity supply amid freezing temperatures.
11th mass attack since October, over 220 since invasion
DTEK
reported
that the latest strike caused significant damage to equipment at one of its thermal power plants.
The company said this marks the 11th mass attack on its thermal stations since October 2025 and reported over 220 attacks on its facilities since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Odesa substation suffers significant damage
Earlier on the same day, DTEK
said
a large substation in Odesa Oblast was damaged in another strike. The company described the destruction as significant and said repairs would take considerable time to restore the equipment.
DTEK said crews were working on-site to clear debris and repair the damage, prioritizing the restoration of electricity to critical infrastructure.

The History of the Endangerment Finding
2026-02-12 19:01:40 GMT
https://time.com/7377810/trump-epa-endangerment-finding-repeal-history/

The Trump Administration repealed the endangerment finding on Thursday, marking its most aggressive climate rollback to date. The landmark legal framework allowed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Revoking the finding now gives the administration authority to erase greenhouse gas pollution limits from cars, power plants, and industries.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Repealing the rule has been a top priority for the Trump Administration. On the first day of his second term, President Trump signed an executive order directing the EPA to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. On Thursday, he called the termination,
“the single largest deregulatory action in American history.”
The decision is a blow to decades of environmental progress in the United States. “It’s the foundation on which all of the other regulations rest,” Chris Field, director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, says of the endangerment finding. “It is the authorization to regulate greenhouse gasses, and without that authorization the legal basis for regulating emissions from automobiles and power plants, is fuzzy at best and potentially non existent.”
What is the endangerment finding?
The endangerment finding is a 2009 EPA ruling that determined greenhouse gases were a threat to public health. The finding originated from a 2007 Supreme Court case,
Massachusetts v. EPA
, in which the Court ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. Following the ruling, the Court ordered the EPA to determine whether greenhouse gasses endanger public health and welfare. The EPA concluded in the 2009 endangerment finding that six greenhouse gases—including carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrofluorocarbons—posed a threat to the public. The agency was then able to use those findings to regulate emissions from cars, trucks, and power plants.
“They concluded, based on a vast body of information, that greenhouse gas emission from the combustion of fossil fuel and other sources endanger public health and well being, and that sets the foundation for the requirement for the government to regulate the sources of these gasses,” says Field.
How does the endangerment finding protect environmental and public health?
The decision provided the backbone for regulation from everything from pollution from coal and gas-fired power plants to car and truck exhaust. “We have seen dramatic improvements in the efficiency of the electricity sector, in terms of the amount of carbon per unit of electricity produced. We’ve seen dramatic increases in the efficiency of vehicles in terms of miles traveled per carbon dioxide reduced,” says Field.
Overall greenhouse gas emissions have, for the most part, been trending downward in the U.S. over the last decade, he notes, though preliminary estimates show that the same
won’t be true
for 2025 emissions.
During the announcement, Trump said that the endangerment finding “had no basis in fact.” Science shows, however, that cutting back on all this pollution is proven to bring huge health benefits.
A large body of research has linked air pollution from greenhouse gasses to adverse health effects. Air pollution from burning fossil fuels can cause a
number
of health issues, including asthma, cancer, heart disease, and premature death. A
2025 study
found that air pollution from oil and gas is responsible for more than 91,000 premature deaths and hundreds of thousands of health issues across the United States each year—with Black, Asian, Native American, and Hispanic groups consistently among the most affected. A separate
study
found that fine particulate matter air pollution declined 24% between 2009 and 2016, before rising due to a decrease in enforcement of the Clean Air Act, coupled with increases in economic activity, and wildfires in the west.
Why does the Trump Administration want to repeal the endangerment finding?
The finding has been challenged a number of times over the years. Most notably, two groups— Concerned Household Electricity Consumers Council (CHECC) and the FAIR Energy Foundation—filed multiple petitions for reconsideration of the endangerment finding in 2017 and 2019. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit
dismissed their lawsuits
, calling their arguments “inadequate, erroneous, and deficient.” The groups asked the Supreme Court to reconsider the case, but the request was denied.
Project 2025, the conservative policy playbook created by think tank the
Heritage Foundation
, also lays out a plan to “establish a system, with an appropriate deadline, to update the 2009 endangerment finding.” The Heritage Foundation has
said
that the EPA “used the finding to justify sweeping restrictions on CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions across the economy, imposing huge costs.”
The EPA has said that the rollback would save taxpayers over $1.3 trillion and bring car prices down by almost $3,000, though they didn’t provide details on how they came up with the number.
The Trump Administration’s ruling is likely to face legal challenges from environmental groups. The scientific evidence supporting the endangerment finding—and the impact of greenhouse gasses on the planet—can’t be denied. “The science is incredibly strong, stronger now, far stronger now than it was in 2009 when it was already pretty strong,” says Robert Howarth, professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University. “How can you go from science which was very, very strong in 2009 and is only stronger now in 2026 to saying science isn’t strong enough to support it. You cannot. That’s not a scientific judgment. That’s a political judgment.”
The impact cannot be understated, says Dr. Lynn Goldman, professor of environmental and occupational health at the George Washington University, who previously led the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention at the EPA from 1993 through 1998 under President Bill Clinton. “One of the most effective things we’ve ever done for public health is lowering air pollution. It has had an incredibly strong payoff,” she says, adding that a reversal of the endangerment finding would put millions of people’s lives at risk from air pollution. “If they’re successful with doing this, there will be a huge economic impact through the cost of not only lives lost, but all the health care costs that will be caused by not addressing climate change here in the United States and worldwide.It’s just a huge multiplier.”

But the planetary system around a star called LHS 1903, located 116 light-years from Earth, apparently does not follow this order, according to the University of Bern. Using CHEOPS, the international research team, which includes researchers from the universities of Bern and Geneva, discovered a rocky planet in a location where, according to current theories, a gas giant should have formed. The results were published in the journal Science. To explain this anomaly, researchers first examined various hypotheses that could also be reconciled with established theories.

2026-02-12T18:44:01Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration on Thursday revoked a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for U.S. action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight
climate change
, the most aggressive move by the president to roll back climate regulations.
The rule finalized by the Environmental Protection Agency rescinds a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.
The endangerment finding by the Obama administration is the
legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations
under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.
Legal challenges are certain for an action that repeals all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks, and could unleash a broader undoing of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say. Overturning the finding will “raise more havoc” than other actions by the Trump administration to roll back environmental rules, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the UCLA School of Law.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin
, who has pivoted the agency toward a business-friendly approach that has repeatedly reversed climate regulations, said repeal of the endangerment finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America.”
Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in U.S. history against federal authority to address climate change.
Zeldin announced the rule completion on Thursday alongside President Donald Trump. The EPA also said it will propose a two-year delay to a Biden-era rule restricting greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks.
Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying that in the name of tackling climate change, they were “willing to bankrupt the country.”
Withdrawing the endangerment finding “is the most important step taken by the Trump administration so far to return to energy and economic sanity,’' said Myron Ebell, a conservative activist who has questioned the science behind climate change. The decision “will make our economy more productive and benefit consumers, most immediately by allowing auto manufacturers to produce the vehicles that people want to buy,” he said.
Supreme Court has upheld endangerment finding
The Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
Since the high court’s decision, in a case known as
Massachusetts v. EPA
, courts have uniformly rejected legal challenges to the endangerment finding, including a 2023 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
The endangerment finding is widely considered the legal foundation that underpins a series of regulations intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change. That includes deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world.
Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who served as White House climate adviser in the Biden administration, called the Trump administration’s actions reckless. “This EPA would rather spend its time in court working for the fossil fuel industry than protecting us from pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change,” she said.
EPA has a clear scientific and legal obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, McCarthy said, adding that evidence backing up the endangerment finding “has only grown stronger” as the health and environmental hazards of climate change have “become impossible to ignore.”
David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump and Zeldin are trying to use repeal of the finding as a “kill shot’’ that would allow the administration to make nearly all climate regulations invalid. The repeal could erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to address global warming.
The EPA action follows
an executive order
from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.
Tailpipe emission limits targeted
Zeldin and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have moved to drastically scale back limits on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. Rules imposed under Democratic President Joe Biden were intended to encourage U.S. automakers to build and sell more
electric vehicles
. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.
The Trump administration announced a proposal in December to
weaken vehicle mileage rules
for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The EPA said its two-year delay to a Biden-era rule on greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks will give the agency time to develop a plan that better reflects the reality of slower EV sales, while promoting consumer choice and lowering prices.
The mileage plan would significantly reduce requirements that set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline. Trump said the rule change will lower the price of new cars and increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.
Environmental groups said the plan would keep polluting, gas-burning cars and trucks on U.S. roads for years to come, threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.
Biden-era standards for clean cars and trucks are among the most important and effective protections to address climate pollution, advocates say.

Turkish, Greek leaders voice desire to resolve issues after talks
2026-02-12 18:48:39 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/turkish-greek-leaders-voice-desire-resolve-issues-after-talks

The leaders of Turkey and Greece voiced their desire to resolve longstanding maritime disputes hobbling ties during discussions in Ankara on Wednesday, as the NATO allies and historic rivals try to build on warming relations.
The neighbours have been at odds over a range of issues for decades, primarily maritime boundaries and rights in the Aegean, an area widely believed to hold energy resources and with key implications for airspace and military activity.
Following years of heightened tensions, a 2023 declaration on friendly relations prompted a thaw in rhetoric, though their maritime issues have remained unresolved, and the two sides still disagree over regional matters.
Speaking at a press conference in Ankara with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said they had discussed their issues in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean "in an open and sincere way" during the talks.
"While the issues may be thorny, they are not unsolvable on the basis of international law. I saw that we were in agreement with my friend Kyriakos," Erdogan said.
He added that the two countries would continue working to achieve their goal of reaching $10 billion in bilateral trade.
Mitsotakis said he hoped circumstances would allow the sides to solve a dispute on the demarcation of maritime and exclusive economic zones in the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.
"It is time to remove any substantial and formal threats to our relations, if not now, when?" Mitsotakis said.
"Destiny has appointed us to live in the same neighbourhood. We cannot change geography, but we can make it an ally, choosing convergence, dialogue and trust in international law... to build a future of peace, progress and prosperity for our people."
Despite the positive tone, Greece's foreign minister earlier said Athens planned to extend its territorial waters further, including potentially in the Aegean.
Shortly after, Ankara said it had issued a maritime notice urging Greece to coordinate research activities in areas of the Aegean that Turkey considers part of its continental shelf.
In 1995, Turkey's parliament declared a casus belli — a cause for war — should Greece unilaterally extend its territorial waters beyond six nautical miles in the Aegean, a stance Athens says violates international maritime law. Greece says it wants only to discuss demarcation of maritime zones.
Mitsotakis also said the flows of migrants in the Aegean Sea had decreased by almost 60% last year due to cooperation between the two countries, adding this should be strengthened.
Fifteen migrants died in a shipwreck off the Greek island of Chios last week after their boat collided with a Greek coastguard vessel and sank in the Aegean Sea off the Turkish coast.
Turkey is a transit country for migrants seeking to reach the European Union via Greece. Ankara says the EU has not fully delivered on commitments under a 2016 migration deal and Athens wants Turkey to do more to curb irregular crossings.

Rutte defends US SACEUR role as Europe takes lead
2026-02-12 18:46:43 GMT
https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/rutte-defends-us-saceur-role-as-europe-takes-lead/

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said Defence Ministers concluded a “productive” meeting in Brussels centred on deterrence, defence investment and continued military support for Ukraine, describing the atmosphere as a turning point for the Alliance.
Rutte told reporters the meeting felt fundamentally different from previous ministerials, stating
“what I saw and heard today is unlike any NATO meeting I have taken part in”
since he began attending NATO meetings in 2010. He argued that the effects of last year’s Hague Summit decision to raise defence and security investment to 5% of GDP by 2035 were already visible, but said the more significant development was political momentum behind a stronger European contribution within NATO. According to Rutte, ministers demonstrated
“a real shift in mindset, a unity of vision, a much stronger European defence within NATO.”
He highlighted examples of states already reaching or exceeding NATO’s spending ambitions, including Denmark, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, describing their progress as being
“a decade ahead of schedule.”
Germany, he added, is on track to double defence investment compared with recent years. Rutte said the purpose of the spending drive is to ensure NATO can deliver the forces and capabilities required for “warfighting readiness”, warning that meeting capability targets will require more than political commitments alone.
Rutte repeatedly emphasised that increased spending must translate into industrial output, arguing that the Alliance must move faster to meet growing demand.
“We need quantity, and we need quality, and we need it quickly,”
he said, calling for
“more air defence, more ammunition and stronger supply chains across the Alliance.”
He stressed the need to expand production capacity on both sides of the Atlantic and said multinational procurement arrangements were increasingly central to NATO’s approach.
Pointing to agreements signed during the meeting, he said Allies are pursuing cooperation on
“deep precision strike capabilities”
and
“capabilities for ballistic missile defence.”
He also highlighted the development of NATO’s Task Force X Baltic initiative, launched a year ago to enhance security of critical undersea infrastructure following incidents in the region. Rutte said the pilot effort is now moving into adoption by participating nations, noting that
“eight Allies are now adopting and integrating these innovative multi-domain capabilities.”
He argued such multinational frameworks provide industry with the demand signals needed to expand production, describing cooperation as a “smart way” to deliver agile capability development while improving value for money. Rutte also linked this approach directly to lessons emerging from Ukraine, describing Ukraine’s defence sector as a driver of innovation in areas such as drones and counter-drone technology.
“Ukraine is not only resilient, but remarkable in its ingenuity,”
he said, praising Ukrainian battlefield adaptation and the work of Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
On military aid, Rutte said Ukraine continues to face persistent Russian strikes on civilian infrastructure and warned that the requirement for air defence remains urgent. He reaffirmed confidence in the NATO Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), which funds rapid procurement of US equipment for Ukraine, saying he was
“absolutely confident”
the flow of US air defence systems would continue. He described PURL as central to meeting Ukraine’s needs, particularly in relation to Patriot systems.
Rutte also addressed repeated questions about US representation at the ministerial after Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth again did not attend, with Under Secretary of Policy Elbridge Colby representing Washington. Rutte rejected claims this signalled a weakening of US commitment, arguing Colby’s remarks reinforced Washington’s strategic view that NATO remains vital for American security, particularly given risks of simultaneous crises in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. He said European Allies stepping up would strengthen the Alliance overall, calling the meeting one of the most pivotal he has attended.
Responding to questions on internal Alliance tensions and recent US comments regarding Greenland, Rutte argued NATO’s nature as a democratic alliance inevitably produces debate, but said it consistently “finds a way forward”. He said the defining feature of the current moment was Europe’s acceptance of long-term responsibility, stating the shift is now politically embedded rather than temporary.
“People realising we will never break up. We will always stay together,”
he said.
Rutte also defended the continued US role as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), arguing that a strong American conventional and nuclear presence will remain essential, even as Europe takes greater responsibility through European-led Joint Force Commands. He described this as a logical balance in an alliance where the US economy represents over half of NATO’s total economic weight.
Closing the press conference, Rutte said NATO’s support for Ukraine remains inseparable from wider Alliance security, stating
“NATO stands with Ukraine”
and stressing that deterrence efforts such as Arctic Sentry demonstrate NATO’s commitment to defend “every inch” of Allied territory.

EPA repeals landmark finding that climate pollution is harmful
2026-02-12 18:44:54 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/epa-repeals-endangerment-finding-vehicle-climate-standards-00732274

EPA on Thursday swept away a cornerstone of U.S. climate policy and set in motion plans to unwind a slew of federal programs used to combat global warming.
The rollback of the endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions is one of the most significant blows to domestic climate efforts by the Trump administration, unshackling its efforts to eliminate requirements on industry aimed at lowering climate pollution from sources like cars, semitrucks and power plants.
The 2009 finding established under President Barack Obama underpinned a broad range of federal climate policies by empowering EPA to regulate six greenhouse gases through the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called it the "
holy grail of the climate change religion
."
The move Thursday finalizes a proposal announced by the agency in July to repeal what many conservatives came to see as a mythical symbol that fueled climate action by Democratic presidents and activists for 16 years. The same package also scraps Biden-era vehicle standards for climate pollution, leaving the highest-emitting U.S. sector unregulated for carbon.
Removing the endangerment finding could ease EPA’s deregulatory efforts and make it harder for future administrations to implement climate rules under the same statutory authorities.
But first, the Trump repeals will have to survive inevitable court challenges — a process that could take two years or more if the dispute lands at the Supreme Court.

====================================================================================================

EPA abandons the foundation of greenhouse gas rules
2026-02-12 18:44:41 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/epa-greenhouse-gas-emissions-humans

The EPA has overturned a formal 2009 scientific finding that greenhouse gas emissions are a threat to human health and welfare, President Trump said Thursday.
Why it matters:
It's the Trump administration's most direct effort yet to rip out climate regulations root and branch — and make it harder for a successor to impose new ones.
The "endangerment finding" provides the legal underpinning for controlling heat-trapping gases under the Clean Air Act, and reflects scientific agreement that global warming poses major risks.
But EPA's move will face immediate litigation. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a swiftly issued statement: "California will not stand by — we will sue to challenge this illegal action."
Driving the news:
EPA is expected to issue a final regulation Thursday
that removes the finding for emissions from vehicles.
The rescission came alongside separate rules that repeal CO2 standards for cars and trucks, with EPA claiming it now lacks authority to impose them.
But by extension, the conclusions could bring challenges to future emissions controls on power plants and other big industrial sources.
EPA last August issued the proposal that Administrator Lee Zeldin called "basically driving a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion."
Tesla, in comments submitted
before EPA's action, was among the companies that
urged
EPA not to take such a step.
Elon Musk's company said the endangerment finding "and the vehicle emissions standards which flow from it have provided a stable regulatory platform for Tesla's extensive investments in product development and production."
State of play:
"We are officially terminating the so called endangerment finding, a disastrous Obama-era policy," Trump said at the White House, boasting that it would help cut consumer costs.
EPA's decision rests on several scientific claims that split with many mainstream climate researchers.
It points to Supreme Court decisions in
2022
and
2024
that limit agencies' power to craft major rules without specific authorization from Congress.
Friction point:
The long-awaited repeal brought immediate attacks from a vast array of environmental and public health groups.
"This decision prioritizes the profits of big oil and gas companies and polluters over clean air and water, the health of kids and all people, and the progress we've made to respond to climate change," said Lisa Patel, who heads the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health.
The intrigue:
While major industries support less regulation than Biden-era officials sought to impose, some are wary of outright killing the endangerment finding.
For-profit utilities last year warned EPA that the repeal focused on auto emissions could have spillover effects. "[D]ifferent parties will assert that such an action casts doubt" on whether EPA can regulate power sector CO2, the Edison Electric Institute wrote in comments on the plan.
Power companies could face a patchwork of "competing and conflicting" state rules, and get hit with new lawsuits, it warned.
Politically, Newsom made clear he plans to use it as a cudgel, issuing a statement headlined "Donald Trump declares the Republican Party the pro-pollution party."
Democrats, climate activists and others
also made clear they will push back against Trump's claim that a repeal will cut costs.
"Repealing it sends a clear message: this government doesn't care," World Resources Institute U.S. Director David Widawsky said in a statement.
"It doesn't care that hotter summers are driving up energy bills and sending people to emergency rooms. It doesn't care that extreme weather is raising homeowner insurance, pricing families out of mortgages and homes."
Flashback:
EPA issued the 2009 finding in response to a landmark 2007 Supreme Court decision,
Massachusetts v. EPA
.
That ruling authorized regulation of heat-trapping emissions if EPA concluded they threatened humans.
Zeldin has said his interpretation of the decision is that it stipulated EPA was authorized — but not obligated —
to regulate greenhouse gases
.
"It didn't just regulate emissions — it regulated and targeted the American dream," Zeldin said Thursday.
What's next:
Expect court challenges to quickly begin.
"We anticipate that the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will rule against him, so Trump must race against the clock to get a final Supreme Court ruling, in his favor, by July 2028, before his term as president ends," Capital Alpha Partners James Lucier said in a note.
Editor's note: This story has been updated with comments from Gov. Gavin Newsom and additional reporting.

Ukrainian Companies Receive First Weapons Export Licenses

Ukrainian companies have received their first permits for the controlled
export
of weapons.
This was announced by the Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine,
Rustem Umerov
.
A key step in this process was the resumption of work by the Interdepartmental Commission on Military-Technical Cooperation and Export Control after an eight-month hiatus.
All decisions on exports are made with priority given to meeting the needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Sales are only permitted in those segments where domestic production capacity significantly exceeds the volume of purchases for domestic needs.
Today, the total production capacity of the Ukrainian defense industry is estimated at over $55 billion. The greatest potential is observed in the areas of unmanned aerial vehicles, electronic warfare, and reconnaissance.

It is in these areas that the capabilities of enterprises already exceed the volume of domestic financing, making external supplies economically necessary.
Receiving foreign currency revenues will help enterprises not only to preserve jobs, but also to launch new technological developments.

Brawl erupts in Turkey's parliament over justice minister appointment
2026-02-12 18:33:39 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/brawl-erupts-turkeys-parliament-over-justice-minister-appointment

A brawl erupted in
Turkey's
parliament on Wednesday after lawmakers from the ruling party and the opposition clashed over the appointment of a controversial figure to the Justice Ministry in a Cabinet reshuffle.
Opposition legislators tried to block Istanbul Chief Prosecutor Akin Gurlek, who President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan
appointed to the top judicial portfolio, from taking the oath of office in parliament. As tempers flared, legislators were seen pushing each other, with some hurling punches.
As
Istanbul
chief prosecutor, Gurlek had presided over high‑profile trials against several members of the main opposition party, the Republican People’s Party or CHP — proceedings that the opposition has long denounced as politically motivated.
The former prosecutor was later seen taking the oath surrounded by ruling party legislators.
Erdogan also named Mustafa Ciftci, governor of the eastern province of Erzurum, as interior minister.
Hundreds of officials from CHP‑run municipalities have been arrested in corruption probes. Among them was Istanbul’s mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, widely seen as Erdogan’s chief rival, who was arrested last year.
The government insists the judiciary acts independently.
No official reason was given for Wednesday's shake‑up, though the Official Gazette said the outgoing ministers had "requested to be relieved" of their duties.
The new appointments come as Turkey is debating possible constitutional reforms and pursuing a peace initiative with the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, aimed at ending a decades‑long conflict. Parliament is expected to pass reforms to support the process.

Judge temporarily blocks Pentagon from punishing Sen. Mark Kelly for call to resist unlawful orders

2026-02-12T17:57:31Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge agreed Thursday to
temporarily block
the Pentagon from punishing Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, a former Navy pilot, for participating in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon ruled that Pentagon officials violated Kelly’s First Amendment free speech rights and “threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees.”
Kelly, who represents Arizona,
sued in federal court
to block
his Jan. 5 censure
from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.
In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers appeared on a video in which they urged troops to uphold the Constitution and not to follow unlawful military directives from the Trump administration.
Republican President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.
Hegseth said Kelly’s censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from the senator’s retired rank of captain and subsequent reduction in retirement pay.
The judge concluded that Kelly’s speech is entitled to full First Amendment protection. Leon wrote, “Horsefeathers!” in response to the government’s argument that Kelly is trying to exempt himself from the rules of military justice.
“Rather than trying to shrink the First Amendment liberties of retired servicemembers, Secretary Hegseth and his fellow Defendants might reflect and be grateful for the wisdom and expertise that retired servicemembers have brought to public discussions and debate on military matters in our Nation over the past 250 years,” Leon wrote.
“If so,” he added, “they will more fully appreciate why the Founding Fathers made free speech the First Amendment in the Bill of Rights!”
The Pentagon did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on the judge’s ruling.
Kelly said in a video statement posted after the ruling that the case was about more than just him and that the administration “was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they too can be censured or demoted just for speaking out.”
He added that the ruling was unlikely the end: “This might not be over yet, because this president and this administration do not know how to admit when they’re wrong.”
The 90-second video was first posted on a social media account belonging to Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania also appeared in the video. All of the participants are veterans of the armed services or intelligence agencies.
The Pentagon
began investigating Kelly
in late November, citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court-martial or other punishment. Hegseth has said Kelly was the only one of the six lawmakers to be investigated because he is the only one who formally retired from the military and still falls under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.
Kelly’s lawyers said the Pentagon’s censure of Kelly — and its efforts to reduce his retirement grade and pay — are an unprecedented attack on the rights of veterans to publicly debate national security issues.
“Defendants assert an absolute and unreviewable authority to impose military punishment on a retired veteran and sitting United States Senator for engaging in speech a civilian political appointee dislikes. That position is as alarming as it is unprecedented,”
they wrote
.
Government lawyers said the case “is not about legislative independence or freedom of speech in civilian society.”
“Instead, this case involves a retired military officer who seeks to use his military status as a sword and his legislative position as a shield against the consequences of his actions in military personnel matters,”
they wrote
.
Hegseth, the Defense Department, Navy Secretary John Phelan and the Navy are named as defendants in the lawsuit.
Leon was nominated to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush.

FDA Refuses to Review Moderna’s New Flu Shot
2026-02-12 18:12:06 GMT
https://time.com/7377817/moderna-new-flu-shot-fda-review/

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently informed Moderna that it would not review the company’s application for approval of its new flu vaccine, which is its first using mRNA technology for influenza.
The FDA has been going back and forth with Moderna for nearly two years since the company submitted Phase 3 data on the vaccine. That data showed the effectiveness of the mRNA flu vaccine, called mRNA 1010.6, when compared to existing flu shots.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Moderna posted on its website a timeline of its communications with the FDA, in which the agency asked for additional information comparing how Moderna’s flu shot stacked up against existing ones for older people, who are more vulnerable to flu complications. The company says it started a Phase 3 study in 2025 involving more than 40,000 people over age 50—some of whom took mRNA 1010.6, and others who took the flu shot Fluarix.
In the FDA’s
letter
to Moderna, which the company posted on its website, the agency said the application “is not sufficiently complete to enable a substantive review.” Dr. Vinay Prasad, director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) at FDA, signed the letter and faulted the lack of data on a control against which Moderna’s flu vaccine can be compared. “CBER does not consider the application to contain a trial ‘adequate and well-controlled’ and the application is therefore, on its face, inadequate for review. This is because your control arm does not reflect the best-available standard of care in the United States at the time of the study.”
According to reporting by
STAT
, Prasad made the decision against the advice of staff at FDA, who recommended reviewing the application and were prepared to do so. The decision reflects growing scrutiny and restrictions on vaccines under the Trump Administration; Prasad also overruled FDA staff in limiting yearly COVID vaccines to people over 65 and those with weakened immune systems.

The New Way to Predict Your Risk of a Heart Attack
At issue with Moderna’s mRNA flu shot is communication from CBER to Moderna suggesting that the company’s vaccine be compared against a control shot designed more specifically for older people. Moderna says the FDA didn’t directly request any changes to the design of the study.
FDA spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement, however, that “the FDA rejected Moderna’s application for filing because the company refused to follow very clear FDA guidance from 2024 to test its product in a clinical trial against a CDC-recommended [high-dose] flu vaccine to compare safety and efficacy,” and said “Moderna exposed participants age 65 and over to increased risk of severe illness by giving them a substandard of care against the recommendation of FDA scientists.”
Moderna maintains that the company provided the needed control comparison for older people. “The letter is inconsistent with previous written communications from CBER to Moderna,” the company said in a statement. The company also says “CBER did not raise any objections or clinical hold comments about the adequacy of the Phase 3 trial after the submission of the protocol in April 2024 or at any time before the initiation of the study in September 2024.”
Moderna’s mRNA flu vaccine is being reviewed outside of the U.S.—in Europe, Canada, and Australia—and the company plans to submit requests for approval in other countries as well this year.

8 Phrases That Will Instantly Get Your Doctor’s Attention
The FDA’s decision could mean that people in other countries would get the first mRNA flu shots before Americans do. One important advantage of the mRNA technology is its speed; currently, the World Health Organization reviews data from flu cases in the southern hemisphere before making a recommendation about which strains seem to be causing the most disease, and recommending those for the next yearly updated flu shot. That generally happens in the spring, ahead of the fall and winter flu season in the northern hemisphere, which includes the U.S. and Europe. About 80% of current flu shots are made by growing the influenza virus in chicken eggs, which requires months of advance planning. Some shots are made with more modern technology, such as cell-based platforms, but the majority are still made using decades-old methods that take time.
mRNA technology, on the other hand, takes just weeks to incorporate new virus strains, as the world saw with the quick development of the COVID vaccines matched to the strains causing the most disease. mRNA based technology could help health officials to respond more quickly to changing varieties of influenza, and ultimately prevent and protect against more disease.
Since taking office in January, the Trump Administration has been dismantling existing policies and recommendations about vaccines. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees the major health agencies including FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has removed and replaced members of the CDC’s expert committee that reviews and makes recommendations about which Americans should receive which vaccines. He also removed recommendations for most children and adults to get annual flu and COVID shots. Earlier this year, HHS
canceled
a $590 million contract with Moderna to develop an mRNA-based bird flu vaccine, before Kennedy
said
the government’s Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which was involved in that development, would be “winding down” mRNA vaccine work in favor of other platforms.

2026-02-12 18:11:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020776/

Lithuania has condemned a decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych for using a "helmet of remembrance".
Source:
European Pravda
Details:
President of Lithuania Gitanas Nausėda praised the athlete's courage in a post on social media platform
X (Twitter)
, noting that the memory of those who were killed will remain forever.
"We are proud of you, Vladyslav Heraskevych, for your courage in showing the true face of war at the 2026 Olympics. Glory to the heroes!"
he wrote.
Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kęstutis Budrys, in turn,
described
the decision by the International Olympic Committee as despicable.
Quote:
"Remembrance of fallen Ukrainian athletes is not a violation. The helmet shows faces, not slogans – a human tribute to the Ukrainian sportsmen killed in Russia's war, one that should be respected, not silenced or banned.
The IOC's decision to ban this tribute is a despicable move, unworthy to uphold the spirit of sport."

she
stated
.

Poland Prepares to Launch Domestic SAR Satellite Eycore-1
2026-02-12 18:09:03 GMT
https://militarnyi.com/en/news/poland-prepares-launch-satellite-eycore-1/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=poland-prepares-launch-satellite-eycore-1

Polish company Eycore is preparing to launch its first SAR
satellite
, Eycore-1.
The launch of the satellite into Earth orbit is scheduled for the end of April, according to
Space24
.
The mission is based on a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) developed and built in Poland, which operates in the X-band. The system has been fully integrated with the Kongsberg NanoAvionics platform, which has extensive experience in commercial orbital projects.
The radar has already passed all the necessary qualification tests and is ready for operation.
The satellite will be delivered to low Earth orbit using SpaceX’s Falcon 9 launch vehicle.

The implementation of the project will enable Eycore to become the second private European company to own a satellite with SAR technology. This technology allows observation of the Earth’s surface regardless of cloud cover or time of day.
Eycore
Eycore is a subsidiary of Advanced Protection Systems (APS), a well-known manufacturer of anti-drone systems. APS technologies are already actively used in combat conditions, particularly in Ukraine and the Middle East. The parent company’s experience in the field of defense solutions has become an important basis for the development of the SAR satellite.

Munich Security Report 2026 paints stark picture of Europe’s security crisis
2026-02-12 18:00:59 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/munich-security-report-2026-paints-stark-picture-of-europes-security-crisis/

The rules-based world order that underpinned European prosperity for eight decades is unraveling. Russia wages war and hybrid attacks across the continent. Washington retreats behind conditions and commercial demands. And Europe—caught between denial and adaptation—has yet to answer the most basic question of this era: can it defend itself? The short answer: not yet.
That is the central finding of the
Munich Security Report 2026
, titled "Under Destruction,"
released
this month by the Munich Security Conference. The
report documents a continent in prolonged confrontation
with Russia. At the same time, Europe grapples with an unreliable American security guarantee, rising defense costs, and an industrial base too fragmented to meet the moment. As Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
warned
at the 2025 conference: "If not Brussels, then Moscow. It's your decision. That's geopolitics. That's history."
"If not Brussels, then Moscow. It's your decision. That's geopolitics. That's history."
— Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Munich Security Conference, February 2025
The report's implications extend far beyond defense budgets. They touch on the survival of the European project itself—and on whether Ukraine will have partners capable of standing beside it.
How Munich's 2025 disaster foreshadowed the crisis
The Munich Security Conference has served since 1963 as the world's premier forum for security policy debate. The
2025 conference was a watershed
—and not a good one. European leaders arrived hoping for clarity on Russia, Ukraine, and NATO's future. Instead, US Vice President JD Vance
delivered
a speech that "sent shockwaves through Europe," as the MSC's own
analysis
put it. Vance lectured European democracies on internal threats to free speech. He
never mentioned Russia as a security concern
. "The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China," he said. "What I worry about is the threat from within."
At one point, Vance paused for applause. The vice president was met with silence. German leaders
rejected
what they saw as American interference. The MSC debrief
concluded
starkly: "The feeling among most European participants was that America is turning its back." The 2026 report suggests that those fears were justified.
The framework Europe relied on is collapsing
The Munich Security Report does not describe a temporary disruption. It documents a structural collapse. The rules-based order that shielded European prosperity for decades is breaking apart—and not only because of Russia.
The V-Dem Institute's
Democracy Report 2025
found
that
72 percent of the world's population now lives under autocratic rule
—the highest share since 1978.
Forty-five countries are actively autocratizing
. Most alarming for Europe: the United States, its former anchor ally, is among them.
V-Dem's lead author, Professor Staffan Lindberg,
warned
bluntly:
the United States "will not score as a democracy" in the next report if current trends hold
.
A Carnegie Endowment
study
echoed V-Dem's findings. It found US democratic erosion is proceeding "with striking speed," weakening checks "across multiple levels all at once." The pace exceeds comparable cases in Hungary, India, or Türkiye.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney put it most bluntly. At Davos in January 2026, he
called
the post-Cold War settlement a "pleasant fiction." He received a
rare standing ovation
. His warning landed squarely on European ears: "If we're not at the table, we're on the menu."
"We are in the midst of a rupture, not a transition. The old order is not coming back."
— Mark Carney, Davos, January 2026
Carney was speaking about Canada. But the description fits Europe well. European states are middle powers. They built their prosperity on American security guarantees and multilateral rules. Both are now eroding. At the same Davos forum, Zelenskyy
warned
that "a year has passed—and nothing has changed" since he first urged Europe to learn to defend itself.
Russia's hybrid war comes home
The threat is no longer theoretical—or confined to Ukraine. The Munich Security Report
documents
a sharp escalation in
suspected Russian hybrid operations across EU and NATO countries
, including sabotage, arson, cyberattacks, and unauthorized drone overflights. The fall of 2025 saw these incidents spike. On 9-10 September,
around 24 Russian drones
intruded
into Polish airspace
. Three Russian MiG-31 fighter jets also
violated
Estonian airspace for 12 minutes. Both governments
invoked
NATO consultations under Article 4.
Moscow is
blending
cyber and kinetic tactics
in surveillance, sabotage, and attacks on energy grids, deliberately blurring the line between war and peace. Most incidents are designed to remain deniable or ambiguous—enabling Russia to evade attribution while exerting psychological pressure and inducing political paralysis. Analysts view these operations as deliberate probes of Europe's defenses, aimed at sowing division, intimidating publics, and
diverting attention from Ukraine toward domestic security concerns
.
The pattern echoes what Ukrainians have endured for a decade—now applied across the continent. Europe must deter further provocations without triggering inadvertent escalation. The timeline is tight. Some intelligence agencies
estimate
Russia could reconstitute forces for a
regional war in the Baltic Sea area within two years of a potential ceasefire in Ukraine
.
Europe's defense dilemma: guns, butter, and fragmentation
The Munich Security Report quantifies Europe's response—and its limits. European NATO members boosted defense budgets by
41 percent between 2021 and 2025
. At the Hague summit last June, members pledged
3.5 percent of GDP on core defense
plus 1.5 percent on security measures
by 2035
.
But the numbers conceal a fracture. The report identifies a
clear divide between fiscally solid, high-spending states in the northeast and strained, lower-spending states in the southwest
. Poland now allocates over four percent of its GDP to defense. Germany has pledged hundreds of billions. But southern European nations face "guns versus butter" trade-offs that threaten political stability.
"We have a simple choice—either money today, or blood tomorrow. I'm not talking about Ukraine; I'm talking about Europe."
— Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, December 2025
The industrial picture is bleaker. Despite EU pledges to spend "better, together, and European,"
US systems accounted for 51 percent of equipment spending by European NATO members between 2022 and 2024
. That share rose from 28 percent between 2019 and 2021. Rising defense budgets are fueling what the report calls
"a new wave of industrial nationalism"
—deepening fragmentation and inflating costs. Europe is spending more, yet not together.
What does Washington's retreat cost Ukraine
The cost is measured most concretely in Ukraine. US military aid
dropped sharply
after January 2025. The Trump administration
suspended
intelligence sharing in March. It halted Patriot missile deliveries in July. The administration
disbanded
KleptoCapture, a task force tasked with tracking Russian oligarchs' assets. And when a 28-point US-Russian peace plan
leaked
in November, it envisioned sweeping territorial concessions for Ukraine while demanding almost nothing from Moscow.
European allies scrambled. The "coalition of the willing"—more than 30 nations—took responsibility for coordinating military and financial aid. France
stepped in
to provide two-thirds of Ukraine's intelligence. Germany began
building spy satellites
to replace American coverage. But the December EU summit exposed the limits of European resolve. Leaders failed to agree on how to use €210 billion in frozen Russian assets. Instead, they settled for a
€90 billion loan
—enough to avert Ukraine's financial collapse, but far short of what the moment demanded.
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte framed the stakes in December:
"Russia has brought war back to Europe. And we must be prepared for the scale of war our grandparents endured."
What comes next
The report's prescription is clear: Europe must move
"from anxiety to agency."
That means coordinated procurement, shared capability priorities—air defense, drones, intelligence satellites—and the political will to act without waiting for Washington.
It also means anchoring Ukraine within Europe. EU accession is not charity—it is a
strategic necessity
. Ukraine offers battle-tested military experience, a growing defense industry, and the geographic depth European deterrence requires.
Higher defense spending means cuts elsewhere or higher debt. Procurement reform means surrendering national prerogatives. Supporting Ukraine means accepting that confrontation with Russia is generational. But the alternative, as Zelenskyy put it, is submission. Not to Brussels—but to Moscow.

New EU industry act keeps friends closer — and shuts out China
2026-02-12 17:57:51 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/new-eu-industry-act-keeps-friends-closer-and-shuts-out-china/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

ALDEN BIESEN, Belgium — The European Union should open up more to its trade partners in public procurement and curb Chinese investment in sectors like green tech, according to a new draft of a landmark industry act
obtained by POLITICO
on Thursday.
Free-trade partners like the United Kingdom and Japan will breathe a sigh of relief as the draft Industrial Accelerator Act (IAA) foresees a definition of “Made in EU” that includes “trusted partners.” Brussels wants to throw up a higher barrier to investment from China by imposing a cap on foreign direct investment by countries that dominate a given global industry.
The leak of the bill came as EU leaders held a retreat at a Belgian castle to wargame ways to reverse the bloc’s industrial decline in the face of China’s export dominance and America’s tech supremacy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is trying
to find a balance
between France’s protectionist instincts and calls for more openness led by Germany, Italy and the EU’s Nordic contingent.
Leaders played down differences as they gathered at the Alden Biesen estate, with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni saying her views on industrial strategy converged with those of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and
brushing off suggestions
the duo were trying to isolate French President Emmanuel Macron. “It is not something that we do against someone else, by excluding someone else,” she told reporters.
Leaders reached a form of consensus on areas including the concept of a European preference, where there was openness to examining what it may mean and where it may be needed, according to a person briefed on the talks. The meeting kicked off an intense month of politicking on restoring EU competitiveness and its single market project, with the IAA due out on Feb. 25 and leaders to reconvene for a full-blown summit on March 19-20.
The draft drew a swift and strong rebuke from Chinese business.
“The latest version of the Industrial Accelerator Act is likely to undermine the investment confidence of leading Chinese companies,” the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU said. “Beyond the political signaling, many of the proposed measures raise serious practical concerns, including the feasibility of mandatory local partnership requirements, which in many cases may simply not be commercially or technologically viable.”
A big question mark over the industry push, which is being led by Industry Commissioner Stéphane Séjourné, is whether it can be sufficiently decisive to turn the economic tide.
“Whatever new FDI rules will be enacted will be ineffective,” said Yanmei Xie, a senior associate fellow at the Mercator Institute for China Studies. Each EU member country has a different agenda and building a united front against Chinese dominance is a near impossibility. “Whoever is the lowest denominator becomes the de facto gatekeeper.”
Trusted partners
The latest draft of the IAA, which runs to 96 pages,
broadens the definition
of a European preference as it would apply to public procurement and other taxpayer-funded programs in energy-intensive industries, net-zero technologies and the automotive sector. In so doing it should allay fears among friendly trading nations of a “Fortress Europe” scenario.
The scope of Made in EU should include content originating from the EU and the European Economic Area, which spans Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The draft also leaves the door open to “trusted partners” whose manufacturing “should be deemed equivalent to Union origin content.”
Earlier on Thursday, Séjourné dismissed the notion that the Made in EU push would exclude trade partners. His cabinet said there was broad support, both politically and in industry for the work of the Commission, although “opinions diverge on the conditions and modalities of its implementation.”
A broader Made in EU concept will be welcome in the U.K. after the country’s finance minister, Rachel Reeves, said on Wednesday that
Britain needed to be part of the Made in EU club
. “I actually support the idea of some sort of ‘Made in Europe’ or ‘Made in countries that share each other’s values,’” she told an event.
Japan, a major auto exporter, will also welcome the shift. The country “very much meets the definition of a Trusted Partner of the EU,” Patrick Keating, Honda Europe’s head of government affairs, told POLITICO.
Getting tougher
The EU executive doubled down on its efforts
to curb foreign direct investments from China
in its latest draft.
Should the current form hold, the IAA would limit investments by companies based in countries that control more than 40 percent of global manufacturing capacity across four sectors: batteries, electric vehicles, solar technologies, and the processing and recycling of critical raw materials.
“The sectors indicated — those in which Beijing is a leader — as well as the reference to the 40 percent manufacturing capacity, highlight how the increasingly clear target of these measures are Chinese foreign direct investments,”said Luca Picotti, a lawyer at Italy’s Osservatorio Golden Power.
The Commission’s proposal, which effectively mirrors Beijing’s 1980s forced joint venture policy, remains in the new draft.
Chinese automakers that could be forced to give up some of their technology to their European competitors are pushing back on that strategy. BYD CEO Stella Li has called the model “outdated.”
“It’s not efficient: We take decisions in a second, a joint venture takes months. It’s a model of the past,”
she told Italian daily Corriere della Sera
at the Davos World Economic Forum last month.
Governments would also be compelled under the IAA
to buy more climate-friendly materials
, though the scope of the requirement remains elusive in the latest draft of the upcoming industry booster. The act also proposes introducing voluntary green steel labels.
The scale of the Commission’s intervention remains unclear in the draft, which is missing a section devoted to specific materials as well as a set of annexes, though hints are sprinkled throughout the document.
“Public procurement is a powerful lever,” von der Leyen told industry representatives at an event in Antwerp on Wednesday, noting it amounts to 15 percent of EU GDP. “This is massive financial firepower controlled by European governments. But too often, we see that our public buyers have to take the subsidized foreign products instead of the high-quality European alternatives. That is homegrown value that we are leaving on the table.”
Aude van den Hove reported from Alden Biesen, Francesca Micheletti, Jordyn Dahl and Sebastian Starcevic from Brussels, and Zia Weise from Antwerp.

Federal court blocks Hegseth effort to punish Democratic senator
2026-02-12 17:54:26 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/court-hegseth-kelly-senator-00778449

A federal judge has sided with Sen. Mark Kelly to stop Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from punishing the former Navy captain for advising troops not to follow illegal orders.
U.S. District Judge Richard Leon, in
a Thursday ruling
, issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Pentagon’s effort to demote the
Arizona Democrat
’s rank and reduce his retirement pay.
“This Court has all it needs to conclude that Defendants have trampled on Senator Kelly’s First Amendment freedoms and threatened the constitutional liberties of millions of military retirees,” Leon wrote. “To say the least, our retired veterans deserve more respect from their Government, and our Constitution demands they receive it!”
The decision is the second legal setback this week for the Trump administration’s campaign to punish Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers, who
released a video last fall
telling military personnel they don’t have to adhere to illegal orders.
The Justice Department on Tuesday
failed to secure criminal charges against the six Democrats
— all of whom have military or intelligence backgrounds — over the video after a grand jury in Washington rejected an indictment.
“This administration was sending a message to millions of retired veterans that they too can be censured or demoted just for speaking out,” Kelly said in a statement. “That’s why I couldn’t let it stand.”
Hegseth vowed the ruling “will be immediately appealed."
"Sedition is sedition, 'Captain,'"
Hegseth said in a post on X
, referencing the rank Kelly achieved before retiring, which could be reduced if the Trump administration prevails.
The Pentagon
launched an investigation into Kelly
in November after the release of the video. At the time, Hegseth had threatened to call Kelly — a fighter pilot who served 25 years in uniform, including time as a NASA astronaut — back to active duty to face a court-martial. But the Defense Department ultimately stopped short of that, instead launching a process to demote him.
Kelly sued Hegseth and the Defense Department in January after the Pentagon chief announced the demotion proceedings. Hegseth also issued a letter of censure to Kelly for his comments, which he said were part of a “pattern of reckless misconduct.”
President Donald Trump and Hegseth have attacked the Democrats’ video remarks as “seditious.” Kelly and the other lawmakers contend the Trump administration is attempting to intimidate them for stating the law and exercising free speech.
In arguments last week, Leon, a George W. Bush appointee, appeared likely to side with Kelly’s lawyers’ arguments that punishing a sitting member of Congress for his comments would violate protections in the Constitution’s speech and debate clause as well as his First Amendment rights.
The Trump administration has also gone after the five other Democrats who appeared in the video — Sen.
Elissa Slotkin
of Michigan and Reps.
Jason Crow
of Colorado,
Chrissy Houlahan
of Pennsylvania,
Maggie Goodlander
of New Hampshire and
Chris Deluzio
of Pennsylvania. The four House Democrats are all military veterans while Slotkin served in the CIA and at the Pentagon.
Those lawmakers have said they are the subject of an FBI probe due to the video. Several of them publicly refused to cooperate with a Justice Department investigation and said they wouldn’t sit for interviews with the FBI, arguing the move amounts to political intimidation.
A federal grand jury in Washington rejected an effort by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office to charge the lawmakers, the latest extraordinary rejection of efforts to take legal action against the president’s political foes. It is unclear which charges Pirro sought to bring against the lawmakers.
Kelly and the other lawmakers did not specify in the video what orders they considered illegal. But Democrats have argued Trump is putting the military in a legal gray area with deadly strikes against suspect drug smuggling boats in Latin America and by deploying the National Guard to U.S. cities.
Several of the Democrats targeted by the administration have said they’re keeping their legal options open in response to the probe against them, including potential lawsuits.

Israel denies entry to Italian journalist over critical coverage
2026-02-12 17:52:22 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-denies-entry-italian-journalist-over-critical-coverage

An Italian freelance photojournalist has been
barred from entering Israel
despite having visited the country 15 times before, including on a government-issued press card.
Alessandro Stefanelli attempted to enter Israel via the
Karama crossing
between Jordan and the
occupied West Bank
in January but was reportedly held for questioning for five hours before being denied entry.
The Israeli Police subsequently handed him a paper in which they said their decision was because Stefanelli "reports unilaterally against Israel".
According to the statement, Israel also based the decision on Stefanelli’s labelling of Israel’s actions in the West Bank as "apartheid".
Before his latest attempt to enter the occupied territories, Stefanelli had his digital visa rescinded in July last year.
When he spoke to the Israeli embassy in
Rome
regarding the decision, he was given no explanation for the revocation of his media pass, which had been issued by Israel’s Government Press Office.
Stefanelli has freelanced for major international news organisations including
The New Yorker
and
Bloomberg
, as well as national newspapers
El Pais
in Spain and
La Repubblica
in Italy.
Stefanelli’s photographs have centred on the effects of the Israeli occupation on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank as well as Bedouin communities in the Negev.
The latest incident comes amid increased
efforts by the Israeli government to crack down on foreign media
and impose restrictions on local outlets critical of the Netanyahu coalition.
Israel previously passed legislation commonly known as the ‘Al Jazeera Law’ allowing the government to
shut down foreign media outlets
in the country under the pretext that they were "harming state security".
Since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, it has continuously prohibited foreign journalists from entering the besieged territory to report independently on the war. Only journalists embedded with the Israeli military are able to enter.
The UK's National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has condemned Israel’s continued repression of media, saying that it was "a matter of global public interest that not only local but also international journalists bear witness and document the ongoing war in Gaza".
Palestinian journalists have argued Israel’s foreign media ban functions as a policy aimed at controlling the narrative of the war in Gaza and the continuing military occupation.
Multiple other Italian nationals critical of the Israeli government have likewise been declared persona non grata, including UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territies,
Francesorca Albanese
, and Italian activists intercepted by the Israeli navy while on board the Gaza Flotilla aimed at ending the maritime siege on Gaza in October 2025.

‘I Was Feeling Their Presence.’ Maxim Naumov on Skating in the Olympics After His Parents’ Deaths
2026-02-12 17:48:34 GMT
https://time.com/7378025/maxim-naumov-parents-olympics-skating-interview/

There is always pressure for athletes competing at the Olympics, but for
Max Naumov
, all of that melted away before he took to the ice for the men’s short program at the Milano Ice Skating Arena on Feb. 10.
“This competition felt totally different,” he told TIME following a practice session two days after the event. “Obviously the stakes are high and it’s the biggest stage, but in all honesty, I felt calm and comfortable.”
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Naumov lost his parents, Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, in January 2025 when their
commercial plane collided with a military helicopter
in Washington, D.C., returning home from a skating competition. Shishkova and Naumov were also his coaches, and for months afterward, Naumov wasn’t sure he would compete again.
Making the Olympic team
was a family goal, and one of the last conversations Naumov had with his parents involved their plan for making that happen for Milan.
Now that he’s at the Olympics, carrying the weight of those expectations, and the emotional grief that he’s still processing over their deaths, could easily overwhelm him. But they didn’t seem to weigh Naumov down at all during
the short program
. Instead, he felt a sense of peace—a serenity that he’s been chasing throughout his career but has only felt “in bits and pieces. I never let myself fully dive into that feeling and accepted it,” he says. “But here, I want to go more into that and just relax and enjoy the experience and let my body take over.”
“Emotionally, he’s stronger now than he was at the beginning of last year,” says his coach Vladimir Petrenko, who with his wife Elena were close friends of his parents and stepped in to support Naumov, both on and off the ice, over the past year. “[The grief] is never going to go away of course, but he can handle it, or we can handle it.”
“I was feeling their presence the entire time,” says Naumov, who felt as if his parents were guiding him, like a chess piece on a board, from one element to another. “I was just having conversations with them saying, ‘Man, look what we did. Look what we have accomplished.’ Moments like that really help me connect with them more.”
Shishkova stopped watching her son compete live when he reached the juvenile level, because it made her too anxious. The more important the competition, and the higher he advanced, the farther away she would wait. Initially, she stood outside the arena, then would remain in the hotel. “She loved and cared about me so much that it was really difficult [for her to watch],” he says. “I remember her saying, ‘When you’re out there, I can’t do anything, I can’t say anything, I can’t fix anything. It’s just you out there.’ But I felt her support no matter if she was there or not.”
Naumov finished 14th in the short program, which qualified him to compete in the free program on Feb. 13. After the glare of the arena lights and the adrenalin of the competition dissipated and he was back in his room in the
Olympic Village
, “I had my moment with them, one on one, and it made me feel really good and happy,” he says. “Once the dust settles and everything clears, you have a moment of clarity, where you can be intentional with what you’re thinking about. They are usually the go-to for me. Obviously it’s a bittersweet moment, but it’s something that helps push me forward and gave me good, positive thoughts for today and the next day. So we’ll try to keep up those vibes.”

PAL PAC launches to challenge pro-Israel lobbying in US
2026-02-12 17:47:46 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/pal-pac-launches-challenge-pro-israel-lobbying-us

A new political action committee has launched in the United States with the aim of backing
congressional candidates
who support Palestinian rights ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The Peace, Accountability and Leadership PAC, known as PAL PAC, announced its formation on social media on Wednesday.
In a post on
Instagram
, the group said it was "dedicated to building a world where human rights, dignity, and international law are universally upheld".
"By helping elect candidates who embody these principles, we can transform the landscape of American politics and send a powerful message: the era of unconditional support for oppression is over," the post added.
According to its website, the PAC's "defining priority" is "ending Israel's ongoing human rights abuses against Palestinians and stopping US complicity".
The group publicly backed four members of Congress as part of the announcement, including the only Palestinian-American member of congress
Rashida Tlaib
, who said that PAL PAC "has my full support as the only PAC exclusively committed to justice and accountability for the Palestinian people."
The other three include Summer Lee,
Ilhan Omar
, and Delia Ramirez, with congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, who is running in a democratic primary to be a congressional candidate for Illinois's 9th district, being added on Thursday.
PAL PAC has links to the Institute for Middle East Understanding's Policy Project, and according to
Anadolu Agency,
is led by Margaret DeReus, who also serves as executive director of the IMEU Policy Project.
Anadolu
quoted DeReus as saying that "we are living in a new political moment", describing the upcoming midterms as an "unprecedented opportunity" to shift the debate on Palestine in Congress.
The PAC's endorsement of Abughazaleh places it in direct contrast with the
American Israel Public Affairs Committee
(AIPAC), one of the most influential pro-Israel lobbying groups in the US.
According to
The Intercept
, AIPAC has spent just under half a million dollars on advertisements supporting Illinois state senator Laura Fine, who is also running in the race.
Reacting to the endorsement, Abughazaleh said that as a Palestinian-American, she was proud to stand for Palestinian freedom.
"Our government cannot, and must not, continue to fund genocide and endless war abroad," she said.

Healey says allies ‘more united than ever’ to support Ukraine
2026-02-12 17:41:58 GMT
https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/healey-says-allies-more-united-than-ever-to-support-ukraine/

UK Defence Secretary John Healey used his remarks at the Ukraine Defence Contact Group (UDCG) press conference in Brussels to frame the war as entering a decisive year, warning that Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities are intensifying while Western support must accelerate in response.
Opening his statement, Healey said the pledges announced at the meeting should be seen as
“a demonstration of our total commitment to stand with Ukraine”
, as the conflict approaches its fourth anniversary. He underlined the scale of the war by noting that it has now lasted longer than the period of fighting between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War.
Healey argued that despite the duration of the conflict, Ukraine continues to demonstrate resilience and operational effectiveness, highlighting that Ukrainian forces are now
“hitting targets deep into Russia”
, inflicting significant casualties on the front line, and even
“retaking territory.”
He described Ukrainian military and civilian determination as unchanged since the opening phase of the invasion, stating that Ukrainians are fighting with
“the same courage and defiance as they did in February 2022.”
While welcoming recent diplomatic efforts led by the United States, Healey cautioned that the war remains active and violent, stressing that
“for now, the war continues.”
He said that Russia is escalating its campaign, with
“brutal missile and drone attacks”
continuing to strike Ukrainian population centres, with civilians increasingly targeted alongside military positions.
Setting out the purpose of the UDCG, Healey said the group’s task remains twofold:
“support Ukraine in the fight now and help secure the peace for tomorrow.”
He said the meeting had been shaped by a push for substantial new commitments at the start of what he described as a critical year.
Healey confirmed that the latest UDCG meeting resulted in a combined pledge of
“$35 billion worth of new military aid for Ukraine.”
He said the UK contribution would reach record levels, adding that
“the UK is spending the highest level of support… military aid for Ukraine ever.”
Central to his statement was the announcement of a new British air defence package, which he said would meet Ukraine’s most urgent requirement. Healey told the press conference he had announced
“a new half a billion pound package of urgent air defence support for Ukraine,”
describing it as President Zelensky’s top priority.
He closed his remarks to press by saying the UDCG message to Moscow was intended to be unambiguous, stating:
“We’re more united and more determined than ever.”
Healey said the coalition would increase both military support and pressure on Russia, concluding with the ambition that
“we want to make 2026 the year this war ends, the year we secure peace.”

700,000 Western-brand cars sold in Russia since Ukraine invasion, routed through China bypassing sanctions – Reuters
2026-02-12 17:38:58 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/western-brand-cars-sold-in-russia/

Foreign-brand vehicles continue to reach Russia despite Western and Asian sanctions imposed after Moscow’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, with China emerging as the primary conduit for cars entering the Russian market through gray-market channels that bypass export restrictions and automaker pledges to withdraw, Reuters reported on 12 February.
The trade underscores how sanctions on Russia’s automotive sector are being diluted through third-country channels. While carmakers pledged to halt exports after Moscow’s full-scale invasion, Chinese intermediaries and reclassification schemes have allowed foreign-brand vehicles to continue flowing into the Russian market at scale.
130,000 sanctioned-country cars sold in 2025
Citing Russian registration data and interviews with five people involved in the trade, Reuters
said
Chinese intermediaries are enabling Russian dealers to import vehicles from brands that pledged to exit the Russian market.
According to data from Russian research firm Autostat reviewed by Reuters, nearly 130,000 vehicles made by automakers from sanctioning countries were sold in Russia in 2025. Almost half were manufactured in China.
Since the start of the full-scale invasion, more than 700,000 vehicles from such foreign brands have been sold in Russia, the data show.
New cars relabeled as "used" to dodge restrictions
The report says many of the cars are built in China through joint ventures with international brands or routed through China after being produced elsewhere.
A growing share are zero-mileage vehicles registered as sold in China and then reclassified as used before export. Reuters previously reported that this practice allows traders to avoid automaker approval for Russia sales and to benefit from China’s subsidized auto market.
In Russia, these cars are often sold at prices comparable to new vehicles, despite being labeled as used in export documentation, according to shipping records and a Russian dealer cited by Reuters.
Toyotas, BMWs, Porsches among top sellers
Autostat data reviewed by Reuters show that Russians bought nearly 30,000 Toyotas last year, almost 24,000 of them made in China. Nearly 7,000 Mazdas were sold, almost all China-made.
German brands also remain present. Nearly 47,000 BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group vehicles - including Audi, Porsche and Skoda - were registered in Russia in 2025, Reuters reported. More than 20,000 were manufactured in China.
Some models, including the Mercedes G-class produced in Austria, are also reaching Russia via China, according to industry analysts and shipping documents reviewed by Reuters.
Automakers say sales unauthorized
Automakers including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Volkswagen, Toyota and Mazda told Reuters they prohibit exports to Russia and are taking steps to prevent unauthorized sales. BMW said any gray-market imports occur outside its control and against its will.
Sanctions experts told Reuters that even with compliance measures in place, it is difficult to fully prevent restricted goods from entering Russia due to complex supply chains and intermediary networks.
China has emerged as the primary conduit for foreign vehicles reaching Russia, Reuters reported, though the agency said it could not determine every pathway used. Chinese and Russian authorities did not respond to requests for comment.

ULA Successfully Launches Space Force Mission, Despite Booster Anomaly
2026-02-12 17:34:15 GMT
https://www.airandspaceforces.com/ula-successfully-launches-space-force-mission-despite-booster-anomaly/

United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket flew its second Space Force mission Feb. 12, carrying multiple Space Force payloads to geosynchronous orbit after observing a performance issue with one of its solid rocket boosters early in the flight.
The mission, USSF-87, took off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Fla., just after 4 a.m., on a 10-hour journey carrying payloads for the Space Force’s
Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program
as well as an undisclosed test and experimentation mission.
The launch was successful but following liftoff, ULA confirmed it had observed an issue involving one of the vehicle’s four solid rocket motors. In a later statement, the company’s Vice President for Atlas and Vulcan Programs Gary Wentz characterized it as a “significant performance anomaly.”
“Despite the observation, the Vulcan booster and Centaur performed nominally and delivered the spacecraft directly to geosynchronous orbit,” the company said. “The integrated U.S. government and contractor team is reviewing the technical data, available imagery, and establishing a recovery team to collect any debris. We will conduct a thorough investigation, identify root cause, and implement any corrective action necessary before the next Vulcan mission.”
It’s not immediately clear how this latest anomaly might impact the company’s upcoming launch plans. ULA is scheduled to launch the Space Force’s 10th GPS III satellite in March, a Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared satellite in May, and spacecraft for the Space Development Agency’s Tranche 1 Tracking Layer in June.
Space Systems Command said in a statement that its System Delta 80, which oversees the launch enterprise, “will work closely with ULA per our mission assurance space flightworthiness process before the next Vulcan national security space mission.”
ULA and SpaceX are the only two launch providers with rockets certified to fly the Defense Department’s most pressing missions, though
Blue Origin’s New Glenn
, which flew its second mission last November, is making progress toward certification. ULA had planned to launch 10 Vulcan rockets last year, but ultimately only flew the vehicle once due to an investigation into an anomaly with its second stage booster.
It is unclear if there is any relation between previous issues with the Vulcan and the rocket’s Feb. 12 anomaly.
Company officials said this week
the firm is “laser focused”
on increasing its launch rates and plans to fly up to 18 missions in 2026.
“We have an inventory of already built rockets that will allow us to get up to that rate through this year,” interim CEO John Elbon told reporters Feb. 10, prior to the launch. “What we need to do is execute our launch activities at the Cape and at Vandenberg, and that’s very achievable for us.”
During the same briefing, Wentz said USSF-87 was Vulcan’s longest to date, and is the class of launch the rocket was designed to fly.
“This is the type of mission that the team actually designed this launch vehicle to support,” he told reporters Feb. 10, prior to the launch. “It’s significant payloads to very complex orbits, multi-manifested, national security space, direct to GEO. This is tailor-fitted for that mission; this is why we put Vulcan in place.”
The mission, USSF-87, featured an undisclosed number of payloads for
the Space Force’s GSSAP program
, which has been called the service’s “neighborhood watch” constellation, observing activities in geosynchronous orbit. The Space Force launched its first six GSSAP satellites in pairs and had indicated USSF-87 would repeat that pattern, but declined to say how many of the satellites were onboard the mission.
“Data from the GSSAP will uniquely contribute to timely and accurate orbital predictions, enhancing our knowledge of the GEO environment and further enabling space flight safety, including satellite collision avoidance,” Space Systems Command said in a statement.
Besides GSSAP, the launch carrried other research and development and training systems. According to SSC, Guardians will use the spacecraft to “refine tactics, techniques, and procedures for precision on-orbit maneuvers” and that they would “enhance and validate resiliency and protection” in GEO. The command would not confirm further details about their mission.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has stated that the Ukrainian negotiating team is prepared to meet with the Russian delegation again.
Source
: Zelenskyy in his
evening address
Quote
: "
Our negotiating group is working continuously – the guys are in contact with the American side. Ukraine is ready for meetings [with the Russian delegation – ed.], but at this point, unfortunately, we still do not have firm answers from Russia regarding what has been proposed for next week
."

This is certainly not about peace
," he pointed out.
Background
:
On the afternoon of 12 February, Ukraine's Air Force reported a possible launch of a Russian medium-range ballistic missile. At the same time, monitoring channels reported that an Oreshnik missile could have been launched from the Kapustin Yar testing range. The Air Force did not confirm this information, and later the all-clear was given.
On 11 February, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine was ready to take part in the next round of talks in either Miami or Abu Dhabi, but the Russian side had not yet confirmed attendance. He said he had used the word "or" because the US had proposed holding a meeting in Miami as early as the following week, and Ukraine had immediately confirmed its readiness to attend. They were waiting for a response from the Russians, and as far as Zelenskyy was aware, Russia was still deliberating.

The Samaritans: A living bridge to Palestine's past
2026-02-12 17:28:55 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/analysis/samaritans-living-bridge-palestines-past

To most people, the term 'Samaritans' recalls the biblical parable of the Good Samaritan, a story deeply embedded in Western culture that celebrates voluntary and unexpected kindness to strangers in need.
Yet few realise that they are not just figures from scripture, but a living community that still exists today.
The small ethno-religious group, numbering less than 900, live in an area stretching from Mount Gerizim, also known as Jabal Tor, near
Nablus
in the occupied Palestinian West Bank, to Holon in Israel.
Both Samaritan communities are well-integrated into their respective societies and politically neutral, holding both Israeli, Palestinian, and Jordanian citizenship. While those in Holon are mandatorily conscripted into the Israeli military - but often choosing not to serve in the West Bank - those in the village of Kfar Luza, or Kiryat Luza, on
Mount Gerizim
are entirely exempt.
While their population in ancient times was much larger - with estimates of
one million
in the 5th century - their decline results from multiple waves of conquest and conversions over the centuries. Their general reluctance to accept converts also threatens their shrinking numbers, although many have also started
looking abroad
for marriage partners.
Straddling Israel’s military occupation of Palestinian territory, their unique history places them on a sensitive fault line, one that brings both challenges and opportunities as they strive to maintain their traditions.
Samaritanism: A unique history
Claiming to descend from the remnants of the northern Israelite tribes of the Holy Land, “Samaritan” means “keeper” or “guardian” in various Semitic languages.
It is thought that the community gradually split from Judaism over the centuries, with a key catalyst, among other factors, being the refusal to let Samaritans help rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem around 520 BCE, prompting the community to build their own on Mount Gerizim.
Abood Cohen, who serves as the community’s unofficial spokesperson to the international media, resides in Kfar Luza on Mount Gerizim. The hill overlooks the city of Nablus and is not far from the illegal Israeli settlement of Har Brakha.
“Well, the truth is we believe Judaism split from the Israelites who were on Har Gerizim,” Cohen tells
The New Arab.
Although the Samaritan religion is similar to Judaism, they assert that they are the purest representatives of the ancient Israelite religion and differ in many respects.
For example, while Judaism regards Jerusalem as the holiest city, Samaritans believe that Mount Gerizim or Jabal Tor instead holds this distinction. Samaritans also claim that their dialect of Hebrew preserves the original script and intonation, whereas the Hebrew used in Judaism employs the Aramaic square script and predominantly Sephardic and Ashkenazi pronunciation.
While the Jewish Torah and Samaritan Pentateuch share overall similarities, they differ in interpretation.
Raed Debie, a political science lecturer, researcher, and spokesperson at An-Najah National University in Nablus who specialises in
minorities in Palestine
, notes that the Samaritans have a distinct calendar system and Passover sacrifice in Mount Gerizim, compared to modern Jewish Israeli traditions.
“In many ways, the Samaritan community functions as a living bridge [to] the ancient populations in this land, including the Canaanite and Israelites because … their presence in Palestine has been uninterrupted since the time of the [Abrahamic] prophet Moses,” he tells
TNA
, citing this as proof of the rights of Palestinians to the Holy Land.
Stretching across both the occupied Palestinian West Bank and Israel, Debie notes that while both communities are essentially the same people, those who moved to Holon in 1967 - mainly for economic reasons - have more
complex relations
with Palestinians.
While some individuals maintain cordial ties, even choosing to
avoid deployment
in the West Bank, others have embraced more mainstream Israeli narratives.
Samaritan identity across the divide
Cohen defines his community's unique identity as one that navigates both Palestinian and Israeli realities while remaining staunchly Samaritan.
“We have a Palestinian identity reflected in our traditions, food, weddings, and ID cards. I studied in Nablus for 14 years, speak fluent Nablusi Arabic, and we even participate in Palestinian elections, so a significant part of us is Palestinian,” he tells
TNA
.
“Additionally, we have connections to the 12 tribes of the Jewish people, specifically Judah and Benjamin, which makes us kind of cousins. But most importantly, we identify as Samaritans.”
Ishaq Radwan, another Samaritan who worked at the Palestinian Authority (PA) Ministry of Education for three decades before transferring to the Foreign Ministry, describes his community as “a bridge of peace” between Israelis and Palestinians. However, he himself fully identifies as Palestinian and acknowledges that “like the Palestinians, we are living under occupation”.
Israel’s 59-year military occupation of the West Bank, deemed illegal under international law, often creates difficulties for the residents of Kfar Luza, especially due to the presence of checkpoints at the village’s entrance.
“When we want to bring a guest, a friend, or a worker to Kfar Luza, or if someone is having a wedding and the workers are from Nablus, it can cause delays. I have friends who come to play basketball every Thursday, but they can sometimes be denied entry,” says Cohen. “The checkpoint operates from around 7am to 10pm, so if you want to leave at 10pm, you cannot.”
He says the Israeli military checkpoint is “unnecessary”, especially since his community has never felt threatened by Palestinians.
The Samaritans of Kfar Luza are unique in that they possess both Israeli and Palestinian passports and IDs, which can sometimes evoke suspicion and confusion among Israeli airport and border officials.
For this reason, many were
arrested
by Israel during the two Palestinian Intifadas, or uprisings, spanning the late 1980s and early 2000s, respectively.
Despite their political neutrality, Debie says, their simple act of participation in a majority-Muslim Palestinian society with rights as full citizens indirectly supports the Palestinian cause by demonstrating that the roots of the conflict are political, not religious.
A window into the ancient roots of Palestinians
It is thought that a significant number of Palestinian families in Nablus and its periphery were originally Samaritans who converted to Christianity or Islam over time, as the region was once part of the ancient Samaritan kingdom.
This theory finds support in
genetic studies
and oral histories, and, as Debie notes, the numerous archival documents in Samaritan libraries contain the lists of family trees.
Radwan expresses a similar view, noting that his community’s population was much larger prior to mass conversions under multiple waves of conquest.
Samaritan community spokesperson Abood Cohen, meanwhile, insists that his people have resided in the Holy Land long before Zionism, a fact evidenced by their ancient Hebrew dialect, traditions, clothing, places of worship, and archaeological finds across Palestine and Israel.
For instance, Cohen claims he can trace his ancestry back 130 generations. Although the variety of Hebrew used by the Samaritans is primarily for liturgical and ceremonial purposes, Cohen emphasises the rich oral history behind it.
In comparison to Israeli Hebrew, which is more widely spoken, both Cohen and Radwan believe that their dialect retains greater authenticity and depth. Cohen claims Samaritans have successfully preserved over 1,000 melodies and
chants in their ancient dialect
.
Radwan, like Palestinian academic Raed Debie, insists that the Samaritans, not modern Israeli Jews, are the true modern representatives of the Israelites because, despite their shrinking numbers, they have preserved their customs and traditions for more than 3,000 years after Jewish exile.
However, the Samaritan dialect of Hebrew will likely never extend beyond liturgical use anytime soon, as both Arabic and Israeli Hebrew are considered more practical for daily communication. Moreover, community leaders say that their unique script makes it difficult for either Israelis or Palestinians to read.
Beyond language, Cohen says, Samaritan clothing styles and chants could be integrated into various forms of Palestinian cultural expression, such as through art exhibitions or Dabke, a traditional dance.
Ultimately, the Samaritans sit physically and culturally between Israeli and Palestinian society - yet belong fully to neither. Their uninterrupted historical continuity, however, challenges both the Zionist myths central to Israeli politics and society, as well as oversimplified definitions of modern Palestinian identity.

Top US official calls for ‘NATO 3.0’
2026-02-12 17:27:28 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/elbridge-colby-nato-europe-defense-spending/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

BRUSSELS — Deputy Pentagon chief Elbridge Colby on Thursday urged Europe to continue boosting defense spending in a conciliatory speech that did not mention Donald Trump’s earlier efforts to annex Greenland.
“The turning of the tide has happened and we should take pride and confidence in that,” Colby
told the alliance’s defense ministers
in a closed-door meeting in Brussels.
In an attempt to mollify the U.S. president, NATO on Wednesday
proposed a new Arctic mission
meant to respond to Trump’s criticism that the island’s security has been neglected.
Colby, the architect of the recent U.S. defense strategy and seen as a hardliner on Europe, said Washington would “continue to provide the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent” but told allies America wanted “partnership, not dependency.”
He added the U.S. would also “in a more limited and focused fashion” supply key capabilities that European allies lack, and underlined that the administration remains committed to NATO’s common defense under Article 5 of the alliance’s founding treaty.
Mark Rutte, the NATO secretary-general who has devoted most of his energy to stopping Trump from demolishing the alliance, praised Colby’s “excellent speech.”
He also brushed off concern over
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s snubbing the gathering
. “We were very fortunate to have Bridge Colby,”
he told reporters
, calling him “a leading thinker on the role of the U.S. in NATO.”
“He has been a consistent force over the years for Europe and Canada to really step up, when it comes to defense spending,” Rutte
said
.
However, Colby also underlined that NATO will have to change as the U.S. under Trump shifts to focus more on “the defense of the U.S. homeland and interests in the Western Hemisphere, as well as reinforcing deterrence by denial in the Western Pacific.”
That means a “NATO 3.0,” he said, where Europeans pay more for their own defense and slim NATO’s activities down to its core task of defending alliance territory.
The term won immediate praise from some allies. NATO 3.0 is “a good way to explain his point, which we totally agree on,” Norwegian Defense Minister Tore Sandvik told POLITICO.
“We know the Americans, they need to be more present in the Pacific — and that is changing NATO as well,” he said. “We in Europe haven’t done enough.”
More broadly, Colby’s remarks prompted relief from European allies, some of whom had privately worried the U.S. envoy would use the opportunity to lash out at them.
The comments mark a stark contrast to recent NATO summits, where American officials like
Hegseth admonished Europe
for not paying their fair share for defense and for
trying to limit purchases of U.S. weapons
.
Colby’s address was “relatively positive and tempered,” said one NATO diplomat, who was granted anonymity to speak freely. It felt like “the calm after the storm,” a second NATO diplomat added.
For his part, Rutte downplayed criticism that the row over Greenland had damaged the alliance. “You will always have debates and discussions within NATO,” he said. “I can assure you, it will be very boring if it wasn’t the case.”

Lebanon army chief to present weapons monopoly plan next week
2026-02-12 17:24:13 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-army-chief-present-weapons-monopoly-plan-next-week

Lebanese
army commander General Rodolphe Haykal, is preparing to present his monthly report on a plan to place all weapons under state control at a cabinet session expected early next week
amid growing international scrutiny
.
The session, likely to be held on Monday, comes at a critical stage for the plan, particularly as it moves towards areas north of the Litani River, where
Hezbollah
has signalled it would not cooperate.
The outcome is also expected to influence international efforts to bolster support for the
Lebanese Armed Forces
.
Haykal is expected to brief ministers on the results of his recent visits to the United States,
Saudi Arabia
and upcoming trip to Munich.
According to a Lebanese military source who spoke to
The New Arab
's sister site
Al-Araby Al-Jadeed
, the meetings were "positive" and stressed the importance of supporting the army in implementing its weapons monopoly plan.
The source said the commander would present an assessment of the first phase of the plan, which focused on areas south of the Litani River.
That phase included dismantling hundreds of military sites, warehouses and tunnels belonging to Hezbollah and confiscating thousands of weapons. The army is said to have identified additional locations where further operations are planned.
Haykal is also expected to outline a roadmap for the second phase, which would
extend north of the Litani River
up to the Awali River north of Sidon.
The push to expand the plan comes amid sustained US pressure on Beirut to curb Hezbollah's military capabilities and ensure that arms remain solely under state authority.
However, the army is insisting that the near-daily Israeli attacks must cease and that Israeli forces should withdraw from positions they have continued to occupy in southern Lebanon to ensure the success of the plan.
The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) are coordinating through the ceasefire monitoring mechanism and with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), according to the source, who stressed the army's commitment to maintaining civil peace and avoiding internal clashes with residents during its disarmament operations.
Ministers from Hezbollah and its allied Amal Movement are expected to attend next week's cabinet session.
According to information obtained by
Al-Araby Al-Jadeed
, they are likely to reiterate their position that Israel's withdrawal from occupied Lebanese territory, an end to violations and the release of Lebanese detainees must take priority.
There are currently no indications that the ministers would resign from government. Hezbollah MP Hussein al-Hajj Hassan said the group would remain part of the state and continue to express its views from within government institutions.
He argued that if authorities wish to extend state authority, they must first halt Israeli attacks, secure withdrawal from occupied land, ensure the release of detainees and advance reconstruction efforts.
On Thursday, Prime Minister
Nawaf Salam
departed for Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference, where Haykal is also expected to participate.
In southern Lebanon, Israeli forces continue to breach the ceasefire that took effect on 27 November 2024.
Israeli troops entered the outskirts of Adaisseh in southern Lebanon and demolished two buildings before advancing into central Kfarkela and detonating another structure.
Shelling was also reported on the outskirts of Yaroun, damaging two homes, while Israeli aircraft flew at low altitude over southern areas.

US pays Afghans to return home as Qatar camp faces closure
2026-02-12 17:15:20 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/us-pays-afghans-return-home-qatar-camp-faces-closure

The US State Department has begun paying
Afghans
to repatriate as it attempts to close a camp in Qatar where they have been stranded for years, the top State Department official for South and Central Asia told lawmakers on Wednesday.
More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base
Camp As Sayliyah
(CAS) since at least early last year, when Republican President Donald Trump's administration halted resettlement for Afghans who feared retribution from Taliban authorities for their links to the US military.
Advocates say the group includes civilian refugees, women who served as special operators for the US during its
20-year war
in Afghanistan, and family members of US servicemembers, all of whom would be in danger if returned to the country.
Democrats have blasted the administration's plan to offer payment to those who agree to "self-deport" ahead of the planned closure of the facility at the end of March. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee holding the hearing on Wednesday, called it a "betrayal of our Afghan allies."
Assistant Secretary of State S. Paul Kapur said he believed around 150 had already accepted the payments, but did not know what happened to them after they returned.
"We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we're not forcing anybody," Kapur said.
"We're looking to relocate them. We're in negotiations with third countries to do that. Our belief is that is actually a good outcome. Keeping them indefinitely on CAS is not...reasonable."
Kapur did not offer details of the payments, and the State Department did not respond to a request for comment.
Shawn VanDiver, head of #AfghanEvac, a coalition of veterans and advocacy groups, told
Reuters
the payments being offered were $4,500 for a main applicant and $1,200 per additional person who relocates.
VanDiver said the repatriation was not truly voluntary, saying that staff at the facility in Qatar were telling the Afghans they should accept the offer, with third-country relocation uncertain.

French conservative leader Retailleau announces presidential run
2026-02-12 17:11:39 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/french-conservative-leader-bruno-retailleau-announces-presidential-run/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

PARIS — The leader of the French conservatives, Bruno Retailleau, announced Thursday that he will run in next year’s presidential election as campaign season gets
underway particularly early.
The former interior minister joins what is expected to be a crowded field to replace President Emmanuel Macron, who cannot run because of term limits.
The far-right National Rally is currently ahead in the polls, though whether the party will be represented by the up-and-coming Jordan Bardella or longtime leader Marine Le Pen cannot be decided
until after July 7,
when a verdict will be rendered on Le Pen’s appeal of the five-year election ban she was handed after being convicted of embezzlement.
After spending most of his political career in relative anonymity, the 65-year-old Retailleau burst onto the scene two years ago after being named interior minister by former Prime Minister Michel Barnier.
Retailleau’s political savvy and hard-line, unapologetic stance on hot-button issues such as immigration
electrified supporters of his seemingly moribund political party
, Les Républicains, and prompted speculation that he could parlay his high-profile ministerial role into a presidential campaign.
But Retailleau’s role in bringing down Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu’s first government after
just 14 hours
— the then-minister argued it included
too many people close to Macron
— has cost him political capital.
The conservative leader exited government after the debacle and has since appeared to lose momentum, struggling to make headlines. Retailleau’s favorability ratings dropped 11 percentage points from 35 percent last March to 24 percent just before the new year,
according to a poll from the firm Elabe
.

on the presidential election conducted by reputable pollster Odoxa showed Retailleau finishing fifth in the first round of the contest with 8 to 10 percent of the projected vote.
Retailleau joins former Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, Greens leader Marine Tondelier and Socialist MP Jérôme Guedj among politicians who have formally declared their intentions for the 2027 election.
They’re expected to be joined in the coming months by former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, center-left MEP Raphaël Glucksmann and three-time hard-left presidential candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin has said he is also considering entering the race.
Retailleau is expected to face some competition from within his own party as well.
Michel Barnier, the former prime minister and Brexit negotiator; Xavier Bertrand, the president of the northern French region of Hauts-de-France; and Laurent Wauquiez, the conservative lawmaker Retailleau
handily defeated
in last year’s race to lead Les Républicains, have all publicly mapped out plans to run.
The party has not said whether it will hold a primary election to choose a candidate, as it did during the last presidential election. Retailleau has publicly pushed back against
calls to hold a primary
featuring candidates from the center-right to the far-right of France’s political spectrum.

Detained Venezuelans board the flight to Venezuela at San Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez International Airport as part of a detainee exchange agreement between Venezuela and United States on July 18, 2025 in La Paz, El Salvador. According to U.S government officials, 238 Venezuelans detainees held at maximum security CECOT prison in El Salvador, will be exchanged for five U.S. citizens and five U.S. permanent residents. The Venezuelans had been sent to El Salvador in March after U.S President Donald Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport presumed 'Tren de Aragua' gang members without passing under normal immigration processes.

Your article (

proposed 30%
funding cuts on the next generation of physics and astronomy researchers. The proposals also risk a generational destruction of the country’s ability to produce skilled graduates, retain specialist knowledge, and support physical science in industrial and educational settings.
This comes against a backdrop of wider threats to university finances, from rising costs to declining international student numbers. An estimated

UK physics departments are already at risk of closure, and recent cuts and

Melania Trump facilitates return of children from Ukraine and Russia to their families for the third time
2026-02-12 17:09:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020763/

The White House has stated that US First Lady Melania Trump has assisted in returning kidnapped Ukrainian children to their families for the third time.
Source
:
European Pravda
, citing a press release by
White House
Details
: The press release underlines that Trump's wife helped not only Ukrainian children, but also "Russian children" reunite with their families. As stated by the White House, Melania Trump has reunite d Russian and Ukrainian children with their families on this day.
It is known that the Russian Federation is responsible for the forced transfer of Ukrainian children to occupied Crimea and Russia. As of February 2026, at least 20,000 children had been abducted since the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022.
The White House characterised the Russo-Ukrainian war as a "
regional conflict
" in its press release.
Quote
:
"
I appreciate that Russia and Ukraine are dedicated to bringing back the children who have been displaced because of the circumstances surrounding this conflict. Although all parties are cooperating and our communications remain robust, I urge Russia and Ukraine to intensify their efforts to ensure the safe return of every child to their families and guardians."
Melania Trump and her representative are still in the process of negotiating with both countries, as noted.
Background
:
In August, Melania Trump raised the issue of Ukrainian children in Russia in a
personal letter to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin
. US President Donald Trump had personally delivered the letter to Putin during their talks in Alaska.
Afterwards, the US first lady said she has an
"open channel of communication"
with Putin regarding the return of abducted Ukrainian children.
US First Lady Melania Trump said that
seven abducted Ukrainian children
were brought back to their families thanks to "bridge-building" by Ukraine and Russia.
It was due to the forcible transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine that the International Criminal Court issued an
arrest warrant for Putin
in 2023.

Trump nominates White House lawyer to trade court that could decide details of any tariff refunds
2026-02-12 17:08:34 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/trump-lawyer-trade-court-00778128

President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped one of his White House lawyers to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Court of International Trade, a federal court that could prove pivotal in deciding tariff refunds if the Supreme Court strikes down some of the president’s duties.
In a post on Truth Social
, Trump said it is his “Honor” to nominate White House associate counsel Kara Westercamp, calling her “a very experienced Trade Lawyer.”
Westercamp, who previously worked as a trade attorney at the Department of Justice, “knows the Wisdom and Courage required to protect the American People, who have been ripped off by other Countries for far too long. She will always put America First. Congratulations Kara!” Trump wrote.
If confirmed by the Senate, Westercamp would receive a lifetime appointment to the nine-judge court, which has nationwide jurisdiction over civil cases arising under U.S. trade laws, including challenges to tariff actions and disputes over how U.S. Customs and Border Protection assesses and collects duties.
The New York-based court has been central to litigation over the administration’s tariff policies, including the “reciprocal” duties and others the president has imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a 1977 law that had never before been used to justify tariffs. The Supreme Court is now reviewing the scope of presidential authority under that law, and any ruling against the administration would likely return to the trade court for implementation.
Judges at the court have previously said it has the authority to order CBP to redo duty calculations and issue refunds if the tariffs are ultimately found unlawful.
Westercamp's nomination comes as Trump works to reshape the federal judiciary and continues to lash out at the trade court and its judges.
Following the Court of International Trade’s May decision striking down portions of his tariff program, Trump questioned
in a social media post
“where these initial three Judges come from” and suggested their ruling was driven by “hatred of ‘TRUMP,’” even though one member of the panel, Judge Timothy M. Reif, was nominated by the president during his first term.

We want to protect red squirrels – so why don’t we protect their habitats? | Letter

Conservation efforts to improve red squirrel numbers in mid Wales are being undermined by developers, writes
Lorna Brazell
of the Cambrian Mountains Society
I was interested to read about the efforts being debated to conserve England’s embattled red squirrel population (
‘On a knife edge’: can England’s red squirrel population be saved?, 6 February
). In view of the inexorable spread of the greys across Great Britain, it was actually a surprise to learn there are still reds anywhere as central to the island as the Lake District. But it was also a disappointment to find that the article overlooked Welsh red squirrels entirely – despite the significant success of efforts to conserve them on Ynys Môn and the presence of a significant, genetically distinct population here in the Cambrian Mountains.
Reds are, as you mention, the most-missed threatened mammal species of Great Britain, so we cannot afford to ignore any of their few remaining fastnesses. Ideally, we would also be taking concrete steps to protect those places from further erosion of habitat or human disturbance.

The 1 Question to Deepen Your Romantic Relationship
2026-02-12 17:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7373235/questions-for-couples-improve-relationship/

Couples ask each other countless questions over the course of a day, a year, an entire relationship. Many are trivial:
Chinese or Thai for dinner? Need anything from the store?
Few probe how each person is actually feeling.
Yet taking the time to ask thoughtful, intentional questions can deepen connection. Laura Todd, a therapist in Silicon Valley, thinks of relationships as vines that either grow together or apart; the goal is for them to intertwine so they become stronger and fuller. “Just because you’ve been together for a long time doesn’t mean that the vines always grow together,” she says. “You have to be mindful of making sure they don’t start growing apart, and part of that is asking really deep questions or having really meaningful conversations that continue to strengthen that relationship.”
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
We asked experts which single question they recommend starting with.
A deceptively simple check-in
The No. 1 question Todd recommends couples ask each other is a simple way to take the temperature of where they stand: “If you could describe our relationship in three words, what would they be and why?”
“It gives a really quick summary snapshot of where you and your partner are at emotionally,” she says. “We don’t always know how to verbalize what we’re feeling or thinking—we just know that something’s off, or maybe some things are good.”
Articulating your feelings in just three words—rather than jumping straight into a long, emotionally charged conversation—can make it easier to open a conversation about what’s working and what isn’t. Todd recommends doing this low-pressure check-in once a year, or more often in difficult seasons, like when you’re navigating a major change. “You’re encouraging that open dialogue without feeling threatening, or like it’s attacking anybody or you’re trying to do a ‘gotcha’ moment,” she says. “You can bring it up any time and just be like, ‘How are things going? Are we feeling aligned right now, or are we not feeling aligned?’”
Read More:
11 Questions to Ask on a First Date
When Todd’s clients do this exercise, they report hearing a range of words: disconnected, heavy, supportive, pressure, caring, connected. If it’s clear you need to talk something through, aim to follow up as soon as you have the space and time to do so, she says. If it’s 9 p.m. and you’re both exhausted, it’s probably a good idea to save the conversation until another day. Consider, too, whether you’ve both had the opportunity to digest the words you shared with each other.
When you start talking, aim to use “I” statements and make it clear you’re open to feedback. “It’s so easy to take things personally and to be accusatory and be like, ‘You did this, you did that,’” Todd says. “At the end of the day in a relationship, you want to be able to meet each other’s needs, but in order to understand what the other person’s needs are, you need to communicate that to that person, and they need to hear it.”
A bonus question
Another question can help you build on what you’ve already learned from your partner: “I love the life we have together—but what do you want more of?”
It often helps people realize that, even if they’re generally content, there are still things they’d like to do that they’re afraid to bring up. “There’s a hesitation around asking for what you really, really want, and there’s a possibility that your partner could let you down,” says April Lancit, an assistant professor of marriage and family therapy at La Salle University in Philadelphia. Yet it’s better to ask than to keep your feelings quiet and risk feeling regretful and resentful down the road.
Some of the couples Lancit works with have told each other they’d like to be more spontaneous, go on special trips together, try new restaurants, have more conversations, or simply sleep in and watch Netflix on a Sunday morning instead of sticking to a tight schedule. “It’s a wonderful thing to be able to explore,” she says, “especially if you’ve gotten a little stagnant and are used to the monotony of what you’ve been doing.”
Read More:
14 Things to Say Besides ‘I Love You’
Lancit suggests checking in like this every six months to a year—and being intentional about following through on what each partner wants more of. To make those ideas more concrete, some couples create relationship vision boards, she says, imagining what they’d like to do together in the year ahead. “It starts with having the conversation, putting it on paper, visualizing it, and then using a shared calendar to pencil it in,” she says. Taking turns adding one meaningful activity to the calendar each month can help ensure that both partners feel engaged and involved.
“I’ve had a good track record with couples coming back and telling me what they’ve done and what they’ve tried and the progress they’ve made,” Lancit says. “It allows them to be a dreamer again.”

The office job decline may solve a mystery of the 2020s economy
2026-02-12 16:59:31 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/ai-jobs-market-unemployment-rate

Data: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Note: "White-collar core" includes finance, insurance, information, and professional and business services; Chart: Axios Visuals
Usually, when the economy grows, so does employment in the kinds of office jobs that form the backbone of modern corporate life. It hasn't been true lately, and that may solve a key mystery of the 2020s' economy.
The big picture:
While overall employment trends have been steady, companies have successfully squeezed more out of a falling number of workers in the sectors that are the major sources of white-collar office jobs.
These sectors — finance, insurance, information, and professional and business services — normally add jobs steadily outside of recessions. In the last three years, they have cut jobs on net, despite solid GDP growth.
That started long before
AI advances
threatened more widespread job losses. That means there is a risk of an even gloomier future for people whose job is to look at a screen all day and move around words, numbers and lines of computer code.
American workers are pessimistic about the job market, despite a low unemployment rate and rapid GDP growth. The decline in core white-collar sectors means it might not be much of a mystery at all.
Zoom out:
Gad Levanon, chief economist of the Burning Glass Institute, calls these sectors the white-collar core of the economy. They account for more than 40% of U.S. GDP and 20% of U.S. employment.
What is striking is that over the last three years, these sectors have continued growing in GDP terms, even as their employment has shrunk.
They have thus become more productive and, Levanon argues, have become the major driver of an economy-wide productivity surge.
By the numbers:
Total employment in these sectors peaked in November 2022 and is down 1.9% since then. Private sector employment outside those industries is up 4.1% in the same span.
For context, from 2010 to 2019, these sectors added an average of 569,000 jobs a year. In the last three years, they've lost an average of 191,000 jobs a year.
What they're saying:
"These industries form the white-collar core of the modern economy," Levanon
wrote recently
, encompassing banks, insurers, software, media, consulting, accounting, legal services and many corporate back-office functions.
"They are also unusually exposed to process standardization and technology-driven efficiency gains, including workflow redesign and, increasingly, AI-enabled automation."
The intrigue:
One potential factor in the job losses is that companies are course-correcting after excessively expanding payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.
But the fact that the headcount reduction has been underway for more than three years suggests there's more to it than that.
If the pandemic had never happened and the 2010-2019 hiring patterns had continued through today, these sectors would employ 2.3 million more workers than they actually do — implying there is some bigger structural break in demand for white-collar workers.
Between the lines:
What seems to be happening is a multistep process by which core business functions require fewer workers.
Step 1: In 2023, companies realized they hired more people than they needed during the super-hot job market of 2021 and 2022, and cut back.
Step 2: They streamlined and automated work processes in 2023 and 2024 to deal with leaner staffing, and found that those steps allowed them to continue trimming labor costs.
Step 3: In 2025 and now 2026, they either already see AI advances that allow them to push those savings further, or anticipate them arriving imminently.
The bottom line:
"These are the office jobs that hire a lot of professionals with a college degree," Levanon tells Axios. "They're also the ones that show up at the top of the exposure measures to AI."

https://www.newarab.com/news/saudi-names-new-investment-minister-vision-2030

Saudi Arabia
appointed a senior executive at its sovereign wealth fund, Fahd bin Abduljalil bin Ali al Saif, as its new investment minister on Thursday as part of a shift in the Gulf state's far-reaching economic diversification plan.
Al Saif had headed up the global capital finance division and investment strategy at the $925 billion
Public Investment Fund
(PIF). He replaces Khalid Al-Falih, who oversaw the kingdom's opening to foreign investment under the Vision 2030 transformation blueprint and previously served as energy minister and chairman of the state oil giant Aramco.
The cabinet reshuffle, in which Al-Falih was appointed Minister of State, was announced by royal decree. PIF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter, is pivoting from heavy expenditure on futuristic
Vision 2030
projects such as NEOM's The Line, to initiatives in logistics, mining, AI and other sectors seen as more pressing and potentially profitable.
"The timing is likely linked to the telegraphed shift in investment strategy, toward more high-impact and revenue-generating sectors," said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank.
"Central to the investment programme is the need to increase capital inflows. The change in minister is likely linked to this, alongside the focus on AI."
Falih was appointed to the post in 2020 with the aim of opening up the economy and attracting more foreign direct investment to fund Saudi Arabia's ambitious plans to diversify its oil-focused economy.
The kingdom is pursuing a target of $100 billion in annual foreign direct investment by 2030. While foreign direct investment has been increasing under a series of structural reforms to attract global capital and investors, it has lagged ambitious targets. FDI inflows totalled 119.2 billion riyals ($32 billion) in 2024.
'Safe pair of hands'
The PIF was due to unveil a new five-year strategy this week, the biggest reset yet of the Vision 2030 strategy to reduce the Gulf country's dependence on
oil revenues
.
The national repositioning also reflects mounting fiscal pressures as oil prices remain well below levels needed to fund the ambitious transformation agenda.
Within this context, Al Saif's record in both the public and private sectors will ensure he is seen as a "safe pair of hands", said Justin Alexander, Gulf analyst at GlobalSource Partners and director at Khalij Economics.
"Al Saif is well known and respected by the investor community ... He is a safe pair of hands as the kingdom works to boost investment at all levels to finance Vision 2030 during a period when lower oil prices are likely to result in fiscal and current account deficits," Alexander said.
Al Saif set up Saudi Arabia's National Debt Management Centre and previously held banking roles at HSBC/Awwal.

OTTAWA, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will shortly visit the remote British Columbia town of Tumbler Ridge, where nine people died in one of the country's worst mass shootings, his office said on Thursday.
Police say 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, who had suffered mental health problems, killed her mother and stepbrother on Tuesday before shooting a teacher and five young students at the local school.

Van Rootselaar, who police say was born a male but began identifying as a woman six years ago, then died by suicide.
"The Prime Minister will be visiting Tumbler Ridge shortly in support of the community ... (we are) working closely with the community and local authorities to finalize details based on their own immediate needs," Carney's office said in a brief statement, which gave no details.
Across Tumbler Ridge, a town of around 2,400 in the Canadian Rockies, flowers and stuffed animals could be seen at unofficial public memorials.
"Hold your kids tight, tell them you love them every day. You never know," a tearful Lance Young, father of 12-year-old victim Kylie Smith, told reporters on Wednesday.
Police, who say they still do not have a motive, held a meeting with provincial officials late on Wednesday.
"They are working very hard - they recognize the public does need to hear information to fill that vacuum," local provincial legislator Larry Neufeld told CBC News on Thursday.
Police said they had visited Van Rootselaar's house on several occasions to address mental health issues and had twice taken her away for formal assessments. British Columbia premier David Eby said on Wednesday he had reached out to local health officials to ask for more details of the interactions.
At one point police seized guns from the house but returned them after the owner - who they did not identify - successfully appealed the decision.
British Columbia on Thursday observed an official day of mourning. Provincial lieutenant-governor Wendy Cocchia, the personal representative of King Charles, Canada's head of state, is due to give a speech in the legislature honoring the victims.

Russia
plans to evacuate its tourists from
Cuba
in the coming days and suspend all flights until the fuel situation stabilizes.
The aviation regulator
Rosaviatsiya
announced this on Wednesday.
The airlines Rossiya, part of the Aeroflot group, and Severny Veter will only operate flights to return passengers from the island.
In joint statements, the carriers outlined that this flight regime will take effect on Thursday.
Why is Russia evacuating its citizens?
The suspension of air service was due to an acute shortage of aviation fuel. Cuban authorities warned international airlines that fuel on the island would be unavailable for refueling aircraft starting Tuesday.

The economic crisis in Cuba has worsened after the administration of US President Donald Trump declared the island a threat to national security.

Not even ‘madman’ Trump can pull off a regime change war in Iran
2026-02-12 16:41:20 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/opinion/not-even-madman-trump-can-pull-regime-change-war-iran

The recent deployment of major U.S. military assets to the Middle East — including the
USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group
,
repositioned Patriot missile systems
, and increased fighter and reconnaissance aircraft — has fuelled speculation that Washington may be preparing for a major confrontation with Iran.
Following
the first round of indirect negotiations between Iran and the US
, President Trump’s
contemplation of deploying a second aircraft carrier
, coupled with his warning that failure to reach a nuclear agreement could bring
“very steep” consequences
,  potentially including military action, has amplified those fears.
But despite the rhetoric and visible military build-up, a large-scale US attack on Iran remains highly unlikely. The reason is structural. Since the 2008 global financial crisis, U.S. grand strategy has shifted in ways that constrain the likelihood of another Middle Eastern ground war. The central priority of American foreign policy is no longer to reshape the Middle East through direct invasions or US-led regime change. It is containing China.
Post-2008 strategic shift
The 2008 financial crisis marked a strategic inflection point for the US. It underscored the fiscal and political costs of prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan just as China’s rise was accelerating. From that moment forward, successive administrations,  whatever their rhetorical differences, aligned around a quieter but consequential recalibration of Middle East policy. The Asia-Pacific became the primary arena of long-term competition; large-scale occupations fell out of favour; sanctions and economic pressure replaced invasion as preferred instruments; and regional partners were expected to shoulder more of the security burden.
This approach, often labelled “leading from behind”, did not signal withdrawal. It reflected a shift in method. Washington sought to reduce direct military exposure while sustaining influence through financial leverage, airpower, intelligence cooperation, and alliance management. The aim was not disengagement, but lower-cost dominance.
As a result, regional actors were granted greater operational latitude. Turkey and Saudi Arabia adopted more assertive roles. The Saudi-led Gulf bloc helped suppress the upheavals unleashed by the Arab Spring, stabilising a regional order aligned with both Gulf and American preferences.
This redistribution of responsibility also expanded Israel’s room for manoeuvre. In recent years, it has carried out sustained operations against Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis, as well as repeated strikes in Syria and against Iran in the summer of 2025. Crucially, US backing for Israeli military latitude has remained broadly consistent from the Biden administration to Trump since 2022, underscoring the structural continuity of American policy rather than its partisan fluctuation.
Trump’s foreign policy, despite its rhetoric, fits within this broader trajectory. The addition of tariffs to an already sanctions-heavy toolkit deepens economic coercion but does not signal a return to large-scale interventionism. The architecture of the post-2008 strategy remains largely intact.
Rhetoric vs. structural constraints
Military deployments are instruments of coercive diplomacy. They signal capability and resolve. But signalling is not synonymous with preparation for invasion.
A full-scale attack on Iran would not resemble limited strikes on militia targets. Iran is geographically vast, militarily entrenched, and deeply networked across regional proxy forces. Any serious attempt to neutralise its capabilities would likely escalate toward regime-level confrontation. And that is precisely the problem.
A war capable of threatening regime collapse in Tehran would carry enormous risks: regional fragmentation, energy disruption, proxy retaliation, and possible Russian or Chinese opportunism. Such a war would also divert resources from the Indo-Pacific at precisely the moment Washington views China as its central strategic competitor.
The November
2025 National Security Strategy
(NSS) and subsequent
National Defense Strategy
(NDS) reinforce this logic. It places homeland defence and deterring China at the centre of US policy, while expecting regional allies to confront subordinate threats, including Iran, with more limited American assistance.
The document reaffirms enduring US interests in countering Islamist militancy, preventing Middle Eastern energy corridors from falling “into the hands of an outright enemy”, and safeguarding Israel’s security. Yet none of these objectives necessitates a large-scale invasion. They require deterrence and burden-sharing.
Even internal debates within the administration do not fundamentally alter this trajectory. The Pentagon and “China hawks” favour American primacy across key regions of Europe, the Middle East and Asia, but that does not translate into support for another massive occupation in the Middle East. Meanwhile, populist-isolationist factions explicitly oppose costly foreign entanglements. Neither camp advocates an Iraq-style war against Iran.
Tehran knows the limits
Iran’s regional standing has been weakened as its “axis of resistance” has come under sustained Israeli attack in recent years, with the fall of Assad further accelerating its decline. Despite this, Iran’s behaviour suggests that it is acutely aware of the constraints shaping US policy. Tehran has confined negotiations to the nuclear file while refusing to compromise on
the missile program
or regional influence.
Iran’s supreme leader dismisses US war threats as rhetorical, warning that any attack would ignite a broader regional conflict. Khamenei recently
called
such language familiar posturing, saying Americans have long claimed “all options are on the table”, and adding that Iranians “should not be frightened” by talk of carriers and military pressure by Trump.
Meanwhile, following the first round of indirect negotiations between Iran and the US,
Ali Larijani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, travelled to Oman and Qatar, where in addition to meeting some Gulf leaders, he also
met
Hamas representatives and officials from Yemen’s Ansarullah, signalling continuity: Iran’s regional posture remains the same even amid diplomacy.
The one genuine uncertainty is Trump himself.  His personalist style introduces volatility, and a sudden strike, or even a tacit green light for expanded Israeli action, cannot be ruled out.
Pressure without war
Yet even such a scenario would likely fit within the broader “leading from behind” framework rather than signal a US-led war of regime change. Encouraging or permitting Israeli military action would shift the operational burden to a regional ally while limiting direct American exposure, which is consistent with the post-2008 strategic playbook.
Recent history reinforces this constraint. The
12-day war between Israel and Iran
this summer demonstrated Washington’s limited appetite for a protracted regional conflict. American involvement remained calibrated and indirect, focused on containment rather than expansion.
Fiscal pressures, alliance considerations, regional
reluctance
among Gulf states and Turkey, and the overriding priority of competition with China narrow the range of viable options. Presidents shape tone and tempo, but they operate within strategic realities they do not control.
None of this means tensions are insignificant. The military build-up increases deterrence credibility and reduces the risk of miscalculation from Iran. It strengthens the US bargaining position in negotiations. But coercive pressure is not equivalent to preparation for invasion.
Since 2008, the United States has systematically reduced its appetite for large-scale Middle Eastern wars while re-orienting toward great-power competition in Asia. That structural shift remains intact. Unless that hierarchy of priorities changes, the current show of force is best understood as leverage in diplomacy, not a prelude to regime-toppling war.

Ukraine flew drones almost to the Urals — and hit an oil refinery at a record 1,700 km Russia thought was out of reach
2026-02-12 16:34:18 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/ukraine-flew-drones-almost-to-the-urals-and-hit-an-oil-refinery-1700-km-away-russia-thought-was-out-of-reach/

Ukrainian drones struck a Lukoil oil refinery in Ukhta, Komi Republic, roughly 1,700 km from Ukraine in a straight line, in what appears to be the longest confirmed drone strike of the war
, while a separate overnight wave set fire to a defense plant in Tambov Oblast and disrupted power across Bryansk Oblast. Ukraine's General Staff confirmed hits on the Progress defense factory and several more attacks.
Amid Russia's ongoing full-scale invasion, Ukraine continues its deep-strike drone campaign against Russian military-industrial and energy targets, progressively stretching Russia's layered air defenses across thousands of kilometers. The attacks aim to degrade Russian military fuel logistics and production capabilities.
Drones reach Lukoil refinery near Ural Mountains
Attack drones hit the Lukoil-Ukhtanaftepererabotka refinery in Ukhta on the morning of 12 February, sending thick black smoke over the facility, Russian news Telegram channel Astra
reported
. Published footage showed drones in flight resembling Ukraine's long-range Liutyi kamikaze drone.
The Ukhta refinery processed about 2 mn tons of crude oil in 2020.
The Liutyi is a Ukrainian attack drone with a claimed range of about 2,000 km, Militarnyi
notes
. It carries a 50-75 kg warhead and uses artificial intelligence for autonomous navigation, making it resistant to Russian electronic warfare systems that spoof GPS signals.

The Ukhta strike likely sets a new distance record for Ukrainian drone attacks
.
Prevous record strikes were hundreds kilometers shorter.
In May 2024, Ukrainian drones
hit a Russian early-warning radar
in Orsk, near the Kazakhstan border, roughly 1,500 km from the front line. Last
October
and November, the
drones struck an oil facility
in the same town.
Ukrainian drones have also
repeatedly
targeted
Russia's
Shahed drone plant in
Yelabuga
, Tatarstan, about 1,150 km from Ukraine's border.
Multiple
media
outlets
have
reported
the distance to Ukhta as 2,000 km, but this figure appears to be based on road routes on Google Directions rather than the straight-line distance of about 1,700 km. Drones notably don't use highways.
Defense plant producing missile guidance systems struck for second time
Attack drones hit the Michurinsk Progress Plant in Tambov Oblast overnight on 12 February,
Militarnyi reported
. A fire broke out on the plant's premises after the strikes. Tambov Oblast Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov
confirmed
the attack.
Before the explosions, locals heard small-arms fire as Russians attempted to shoot down the drones. A series of blasts followed, igniting a fire on the factory grounds.
The plant produces gyroscopic instruments for stabilization and control, course indicators and autopilots for navigation and automatic flight control, and angular velocity sensors and other elements of piloting and navigation systems. This equipment goes into Russian aircraft, helicopters, and missile systems.

This was the second
confirmed attack
on the Progress plant. Drones first struck the facility in June 2025, causing significant damage.
Drone attack disrupts Bryansk Oblast power supply
As Russia continues its daily campaign of
strikes against Ukraine's energy grid
, Ukrainian forces carried out a retaliatory strike in Bryansk Oblast that caused energy disruptions. Ukrainian Telegram channel Supernova+
published video
of one of the hits, which produced a powerful flash.
"
Lights are periodically flickering in residents' homes
," local outlet Novosti Bryanskoy Oblasti
reported
.
Some streets lost power entirely, while other districts experienced sharp voltage surges. Fires were also reported, likely caused by debris or direct hits.
Russia's defense ministry
claimed
its air defenses intercepted 106 Ukrainian drones overnight across 15 oblasts, including 21 over Bryansk Oblast and 13 over Tambov Oblast. The report didn't mention the Komi Republic.
Ukraine's General Staff confirms multiple targets
Ukraine's General Staff
confirmed
the
strike on the Michurinsk Progress Plant,
describing it as an enterprise producing high-tech equipment for aviation and missile systems that supports the Russian army. A fire broke out on the plant's territory, according to preliminary information, with damage still being assessed.
The General Staff also reported hits on Russian
ammunition depots near the settlements of Terpinnia and Rozivka in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast
.
The General Staff also said that overnight on 12 February,
Ukrainian forces also struck a GRAU (Main Missile and Artillery Directorate) arsenal
for comprehensive storage of missiles, ammunition, and explosives near Kotluban in Volgograd Oblast, using the FP-5 Flamingo long-range missiles.

Additionally, the GenStaff
confirmed results of the 11 February
strike on the Lukoil Volgogradneftepererabotka refinery
in Volgograd Oblast. The strike damaged the main primary oil processing unit ELOU-AVT-1, elements of the AVT-3 unit, and infrastructure on the refinery's territory, the military says. Secondary processing facilities at the site either reduced output or halted operations entirely.

Home sales plunge despite affordability improving
2026-02-12 16:33:50 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/real-estate-mortgage-rates-home-sales

Existing home sales posted their largest monthly sales decline in four years despite increasing affordability.
Why it matters:
The slump in sales underscores a disconnect in the housing market: Buying conditions are improving on paper, but constrained supply and broader economic uncertainty may be weighing on demand.
Driving the news:
Existing home sales fell 8.4% from December to January, the National Association of Realtors
reported
Thursday.
Economists had expected a 4.6% monthly drop,
according
to WSJ data.
Sales were down 4.4% from a year earlier, hitting a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.91 million.
Zoom in:
The decline was most acute for single-family homes, where sales fell 9%. Regionally, the West was down 10.3%, the South 9% and the Midwest 7.1%, while the Northeast rose 5.9%.
Between the lines:
The decline came despite NAR's data showing that housing is the most affordable it's been since March 2022.
"This is due to wage gains outpacing home price growth and mortgage rates being lower than a year ago," NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. "However, supply has not kept pace and remains quite low."
Cold, snowy weather might've played a role in suppressing home sales in January, Yun noted.
Economic jitters
may be playing a part too. "Potential buyers are "still struggling," Yun said on a call with reporters,
per CNBC
.
The bottom line:
Despite declining sales, median prices rose for the 31st straight month, rising 0.9% from a year ago to $396,800.

Will Israel reoccupy Gaza?
2026-02-12 16:29:55 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/will-israel-reoccupy-gaza/

The containment of containment
Everyone owes some soul-searching for their part before October 7. My own reckoning is a column I wrote in 2018 dismissing the complaints about fields near Gaza being burned by incendiary kites. I mistakenly believed the kites were a pathetic remnant of Hamas's plans to destroy us all, and not worth getting excited about. I failed to understand that they were a warning sign: that no wall is insurmountable with a bit of creativity, and that where fields are burned, eventually command centers and homes will burn.
Since then, we have all developed an allergy to "containment" and to anything less than total victory.
With those caveats, here is a debate now unfolding at the top of Israel's security and political establishment regarding Gaza: what is preferable, the current situation in the Strip, or renewing the war until Hamas is destroyed?
The terror organization still controls Gaza's interior, reorganizes its ranks, and collects money from taxes imposed on "humanitarian aid", or more simply, goods ranging from iPhone 17s to premium coffee beans. Weapons stockpiled in the first campaign will be used to massacre Israelis long before a third.
So, ostensibly, there is no question.
But in fact there is: as long as Israel refuses to permanently occupy the Strip, a military operation has no way to deprive Hamas of its center of gravity, small arms. Most of them would flee along with the population from combat zones. Dismantling all the tunnels would take years. The IDF has been in Rafah for nearly two years and tunnels are still being discovered.
The army, and several very senior ministers, therefore believe it is preferable for Israel to remain permanently in 58% of the Strip and continue suffocating Hamas, rather than enter a war that would damage legitimacy and still fail to achieve the required result.
As for rearmament, that is the main dispute. Reservists in the field claim it is happening, including tunnel rehabilitation. The leadership believes the reports are greatly exaggerated. After all, neither cement nor iron, the primary materials for tunnels and rockets, are entering the Strip and will not as long as Hamas remains unreformed.
The primary objective is to increase the pace of strikes to keep Hamas on the defensive, without looking for excuses to eliminate the perpetrators of the massacre.
In short: is most of the Strip without Hamas disarmament preferable, or Hamas disarmament without most of the Strip?
Catch 61
Four months have passed since the return of the hostages and the declaration of the end of the war in Gaza. Eighty-six polls have been published since then. All but one show that the "change bloc" does not have 61 seats, the majority required to form a stable government without rotation with Netanyahu and without favors from Ra'am chairman Mansour Abbas.
As many party leaders as there are, so too are the answers to the question: "How will you form a coalition?" Gantz proposes unity; Golan proposes a government with Abbas. You already know Eisenkot's "58-plan." Liberman repeats like a mantra the number "63," hoping somehow the bloc will reach it.
And Bennett? Here the answer splits in two. One part hints that Religious Zionism could join such a government, making Abbas unnecessary. The only problem is that the same thing was said after the 2021 election, and Smotrich, unfortunately, did not connect to the idea. The second part is a kind of parity unity government. Bennett has said there is no mandate to sit with the Arabs, but has not made a similar commitment regarding Likud. That is a substantive shift: like Gantz, it implies a government with Netanyahu. Not as a fifth wheel, as Blue and White once proposed, but like in a driving lesson, two steering wheels in one car.
The clearest evidence that the change bloc has internalized the new electoral reality is the flood of budget-heavy initiatives in the Arab sector: a "day of disruption" (one really wonders where the idea of blocking the Ayalon to force change came from) and massive voter-mobilization campaigns now being built for the election.
If the goal is to achieve 61 Zionist votes, massive Arab turnout is a catastrophe. If the goal is to block Netanyahu from reaching 61, encouraging turnout in the Arab sector is the order of the day.
The reestablishment of the Joint List was not Bennett's initiative, quite the opposite. But the assumption is that this many-car train has already left the station, and there is no point fighting it.
The next test will nevertheless come: what will Netanyahu and his opponents do when a proposal is brought to disqualify Balad from running for the Knesset? This is a party with a rich record of support for terrorism or partnership in it by its senior members. Disqualifying it could reduce Arab willingness to vote. In the last election, neither Likud nor Yesh Atid took a clear stand: Netanyahu wanted Balad to waste votes; Lapid feared angering Arab voters. The fate of the fanatic faction now depends on the polling numbers toward the end of the summer.
Who's afraid of the ballot box?
The Haredim looked toward elections, and then lowered their gaze. One had to reread again and again the briefing by a "senior Haredi figure" (said to be MK Moshe Gafni): "At present, the Haredi factions are seriously considering accepting most of the demands of the legal advisers, so that sanctions would take effect immediately, apply until age 29, and the enlistment targets would be higher."
The second option is to pass an exemption law without the support of the legal advisers, even though the High Court would immediately issue an injunction against it.
"The chances that Rabbi Landow will instruct us to go to elections are very low," ruled the senior source from Bnei Brak.
Wait, this is confusing. Either total surrender on the most decisive issue for the Haredim, or all-out war to the end. But elections? No.
In short, after three years of smoke screens, threats, crises, ultimatums, deadlines and near-signings of divorce writs, it turns out, astonishingly, that it was all nothing. Who would have believed it, aside from everyone?
There are two reasons for this. First, Shas and Degel HaTorah understand very well that the party responsible for the current situation is the High Court, not the coalition. So what would revenge against the coalition achieve? Second, leaving the government would be an irrational move that would almost certainly lead to the opposition for the foreseeable future. No better government would arise, only worse.
To the credit of the Gur Hasidic faction, they understood this already a year ago. They chose to leave Netanyahu's bloc; Deri and Gafni chose to stay, and the rest has been background noise. Now the talk is of symbolic punishment, moving the election from October to September. Even the sanctions the Haredim propose for draft-dodgers are less ridiculous.
The main goal of passing a draft law is no longer to regulate the status of yeshiva students, but to return the Haredi parties to the coalition ahead of elections whose prospects of victory do not look especially promising. If there are several months of a transitional government, and even more so if Israel returns to repeated election cycles, Shas and United Torah Judaism ministers want to be there when it happens.

EU loans-for-weapons scheme gets political in Poland
2026-02-12 16:29:33 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-loans-weapons-safe-scheme-gets-political-poland/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

WARSAW — Poland wants to borrow an enormous €43.7 billion under the EU’s loans-for-arms
SAFE program
, but that’s running into doubts from the country’s nationalist President Karol Nawrocki.
Nawrocki has
urged caution
over Poland’s planned loan — the largest of any country borrowing under the €150 billion
Security Action for Europe
scheme — describing it as “a huge debt that will be repaid by the Polish state for years.”
His staff
said Thursday
that they would work on amending the government’s SAFE proposal.
That contrasts sharply with the view of pro-EU Prime Minster Donald Tusk, who said the loans were being issued on “very favorable terms, unavailable on the market in any other way.”
SAFE provides low-interest, long-term loans with a 10-year grace period for principal repayments, raised by Brussels on capital markets and offering significant savings compared to national borrowing.
Those terms are crucial for Poland, which plans to devote 4.8 percent of its GDP to defense this year, one of the highest levels in NATO. The country’s public finances are under pressure due to its long-term effort to build up its military to deter Russia and support Ukraine.
But Nawrocki is wary, and his advisers warn SAFE is aimed at helping Germany rather than Poland — an appeal to Nawrocki’s core voters who are suspicious of Berlin.
Poles deserve clarity on costs, conditions and any political strings attached to SAFE, Nawrocki said during a Wednesday meeting of Poland’s National Security Council, which he chairs.
“Although SAFE formally operates as a loan mechanism, the indirect risk cannot be ignored — namely that disbursements could be linked to broader political conditionality,” the president said. “The final decision on payments and the terms attached to them will rest with the European Commission.”
Nawrocki also pressed the government to publish the list of all 139 planned projects to be financed from SAFE and questioned whether the program could ultimately favor West European defense companies rather than Polish ones.
After the Wednesday meeting, Tusk warned Nawrocki not to veto the SAFE plan.
“I hope that the doubts and grimaces of disapproval that came up during the discussion are not a prelude to a veto,” Tusk
said
before boarding a plane for an EU leaders’ summit in Belgium.
The government
approved
a draft law to implement SAFE in Poland on Wednesday.
Tusk and Nawrocki
have been at each other’s throats
for months as both sides gear up for a crucial parliamentary election next year. The president has vetoed several key pieces of legislation, and Tusk’s parliamentary coalition doesn’t have the votes to override him.
Tusk underlined that 80 percent of the SAFE money would stay in Poland, slamming the former nationalist Law and Justice government for signing big defense deals that he said hadn’t given much business to Polish arms firms.
“I did not fully understand what the doubts or uncertainty of the president and his associates are regarding the added value that SAFE provides,” he said.
Defense Minister Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz said the money could start to flow by March if the Polish parliament and Nawrocki act in time.
“Now it’s time for efficient work in the parliament and the president’s signature. We are not paying attention to political spite,”
he said on social media
.

Egypt sends troops to Somalia amid Israel tensions
2026-02-12 16:29:33 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/egypt-sends-troops-somalia-amid-israel-tensions

Egypt
has deployed a significant number of troops and arms to Somalia as part of the Africa Union peace mission, after
Israel
recognised the breakaway region of
Somaliland
as an independent state.
The
Egyptian army published videos
on Wednesday showcasing its approximately 1,100 troops set to take part in the AU-led mission in Somalia, days after a visit by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to Cairo.
According to Egyptian media, the package includes armoured vehicles such as the BAE Caiman and air assets such as Mi-24 helicopter gunships and Mi-17 helicopters intended for counterinsurgency and intelligence or surveillance operations.
Paul Williams, an expert on AU peacekeeping operations, told
The New Arab
that Egypt’s deployment "looks like a fairly standard package of troops and vehicles with specialized support capabilities", highlighting that the mission itself follows typical AU procedures, even if its timing and scope carry political weight.
The African Union Support and Stabilisation Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) has primarily worked to back Somali authorities in countering the presence of the militant group al-Shabab in the country.
Egypt’s participation is officially framed as support for Somalia’s stability and counter-terrorism efforts.
But analysts also link Cairo’s involvement to broader Horn of Africa geopolitics, including tensions with Israel over its controversial recognition of Somaliland.
African‑led peace operations have evolved beyond traditional peacekeeping roles over the past few years and have become increasingly shaped by political, strategic and security considerations specific to the continent’s conflicts and actors, the
African Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD)
said last December.
In practice, the Africa-based think-tank argues, AU peacekeeping missions often overlap with geopolitical signalling, even when their primary mandate is operational.
The deployment comes amid regional tensions following
Israel’s recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland
, a move which caused outrage in Mogadishu and was rejected by Egypt and most countries in the region, who reaffirmed support for Somalia's territorial integrity.
Previous reporting by the UAE-owned outlet
The National
suggested that Egypt had begun to increase boots on the ground in  Somalia following Israel’s move amid concerns over the potential growth of Israeli influence in the Horn of Africa.
In addition Ethiopia’s bid for port access in Somaliland and its diplomatic engagement with the breakaway region, perceived by Mogadishu as undermining territorial integrity, is likewise raising concerns in Somalia about foreign influence.
Gulf states such as
Saudi Arabia
and the UAE are also active in the Horn, investing in security and infrastructure, adding further complexity to Cairo’s interests in the region.

conducted a special operation to detect
Starlink
terminals used by Russian invaders.
They
worked together
with the
InformNapalm
intelligence community and the
MILITANT
Telegram channel.
To do this, they created a network of fake channels and bots that offered Starlink activation services for a fee. The main goal of the initiative was to identify the means of communication the enemy was using to circumvent existing restrictions.
In one week of operation, the network collected 2,420 data packets on enemy terminals. The information obtained contains the exact coordinates of enemy positions, allowing the Defense Forces to identify locations where personnel and equipment are concentrated around operational equipment.

In addition to technical data, activists recorded 31 requests from individuals seeking to become intermediaries or “drops” to activate devices. All information about potential traitors and collaborators was forwarded to representatives of Ukrainian law enforcement agencies for processing.
The financial result of the operation was the collection of $5,870 in payments from Russian military personnel. The organizers plan to use funds obtained from the enemy to cover the Ukrainian Defense Forces’ current needs.

Starmer slams Jim Ratcliffe claim UK 'colonised by immigrants'
2026-02-12 16:25:34 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/starmer-slams-jim-ratcliffe-claim-uk-colonised-immigrants

UK Prime Minister
Keir Starmer
has condemned comments by billionaire Jim Ratcliffe, who said Britain had been "colonised by immigrants", saying they were wrong and would play into the hands of those who wanted to divide the country.
Ratcliffe, one of Britain's most successful businessmen who founded the chemicals giant INEOS and owns nearly a third of
Manchester United
, told
Sky News
that high migration and people living on benefits were damaging the economy.
"You can't have an economy with nine million people on benefits and huge levels of immigrants coming in. I mean, the UK has been colonised - it's costing too much money," Ratcliffe said in an interview aired on Wednesday.
"The UK has been colonised by immigrants, really, hasn't it?"
Manchester United groups urge Ratcliffe to apologise
His comments have been condemned by politicians, campaigners and by fan groups at Manchester United, including its Muslim Supporters Club, who said the term "colonised" was frequently used by far-right activists to frame migrants as invaders.
"Public discourse shapes public behaviour," the group said. "When influential figures adopt language that mirrors extremist talking points, it risks legitimising prejudice and deepening division."
Others noted that the Manchester United first team was largely made up of international players and staff, and questioned whether Ratcliffe should be commenting on
British politics
when he had moved to the tax haven of Monaco.
Starmer said Britain was a proud, tolerant and diverse country and said Ratcliffe's comments would threaten social ties, adding: "Jim Ratcliffe should immediately apologise".
The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said Ratcliffe's comments were inflammatory and should be withdrawn.
Immigration
has consistently been among the top voter concerns in Britain according to opinion polls, and has helped fuel the rise of Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party Reform UK.
Rhetoric around immigration has hardened in recent years, and a wave of
protests
broke out last summer outside hotels housing asylum seekers. Widespread rioting also occurred in 2024, sparked by false information circulating online that a teenager who killed three young girls was an Islamist migrant.
Sky
said Ratcliffe had cited incorrect figures to back up his argument. He said the population had risen from 58 million to 70 million people since 2020. The Office for National Statistics estimates the UK population was 67 million in mid-2020 and 69 million in mid-2024.
The population was around 59 million in 2000.
Farage
responded to the comments by saying that Britain had undergone mass immigration that had changed the character of many areas in the country. "Labour may try to ignore that but Reform won't," he said.

Do Recovery Shoes Actually Work?
2026-02-12 16:23:26 GMT
https://time.com/7377777/recovery-shoes-do-they-work/

Slipping achy feet into recovery shoes after a long day or tough workout can feel like getting a mini-massage with every step. It’s a luxe experience, and, clearly, people are into it: The recovery footwear market is
predicted to hit
$18 billion this year—and jump up to over $28 billion by 2034.
But do these cushy, slipper-like shoes actually speed up recovery, or do they just feel good? Here’s what experts have to say about the trend.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
What makes recovery shoes unique
To the naked eye, the thick soles of recovery shoes don’t look all that different from what you see in maximally cushioned sneakers. But while athletic shoes are meant to keep your feet safe and your movements efficient during activities like running, playing pickleball, or walking around all day at work, recovery shoes are designed to help your muscles and joints recuperate from those activities, says sports medicine foot and ankle surgeon Gideon J. Lewis.
“Compared to other shoes, recovery shoes are giving your feet a break,” says Sally Crawford, a biomechanical expert who’s conducted
research
commissioned by OOFOS, the brand that popularized recovery shoes.
Although the exact design of recovery shoes can vary, there are a number of common features intended to help your feet bounce back from whatever kinds of stress you put them through.

The Internet’s New Favorite Insult: ‘Did AI Write That?’
For starters, whether it’s a sandal or sneaker, a recovery shoe is typically made with an extra-wide toe box to give your forefoot plenty of space to spread out. There’s usually arch support and often a heel drop (meaning the heel sits higher up than the toes). Many recovery shoes are also designed with a curved rocker bottom, which rolls underneath you as you step through your stride, and that means your foot doesn’t have to move as much while you walk. These elements place the foot in a position that allows the plantar fascia along the bottom of the sole and the flexor tendons of the toes to relax and stretch out, says Dr. Sean Bryan, a primary sports medicine physician at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.
Almost all of these shoes offer lots of cushy foam for ample shock absorption. “The thought is that by having extra cushioning and that positioning, it allows the tissues to rest and feel better, and possibly recover from repetitive stress,” Bryan says.
Most recovery shoes are also made to let your sweaty feet air out, either through a sandal design or breathable materials in the upper fabric of a sneaker. “It’s not just recovering from a musculoskeletal issue or pain—it’s also for skin protection as well,” Lewis says.
Some footwear manufacturers have recently begun taking things a step further, injecting more advanced tech into these shoes. Last year, Nike and the athletic recovery brand Hyperice released the “Hyperboot,” a $799 battery-powered shoe that blasts your feet with heat and compressed air as you walk around. There are also some shoes that integrate red light therapy that claim to bring more blood flow to your feet. Lewis predicts we’ll soon see shoes with vibration and cooling mechanisms.
Do recovery shoes actually help you recover?
Unfortunately, there’s not much hard data on recovery shoes outside of
research
funded
by
footwear companies
. “I’m not aware of any clear scientific evidence that proves that recovery shoes actually speed recovery at a cellular level or a tissue level,” Bryan says.
That doesn’t necessarily mean they have nothing to offer. Plenty of anecdotal evidence suggests that recovery shoes can help reduce symptoms like foot pain, muscle fatigue, tightness, and soreness in people who repeatedly subject their feet to large amounts of stress, Bryan says. He also points out that several recovery sandals and sneakers have been given the American Podiatric Medical Association’s Seal of Acceptance, a distinction awarded by a committee of podiatrists to products that promote good foot health.

7 Ways to Reduce Fatigue Naturally
When it comes to the more high-tech recovery shoes, some small studies have found that air compression can
temporarily reduce muscle soreness
, while heat can speed up
post-workout muscle recovery
, and red light therapy can
decrease inflammation and oxidative stress in muscles
. But research is early, and these futuristic shoes are still more likely to be found on the feet of pro athletes than everyday exercisers on a budget.
How to get the most out of recovery shoes
If you’re looking to make your feet and legs feel a bit better after exercise, experts agree that wearing recovery shoes might help. But only in moderation. For the most part, these shoes are not designed to support long bouts of walking around, since they’re typically pretty unstable. Also, because they can alter your gait and posture, Bryan believes long-term wear could put abnormal kinds of stress on soft tissues like the plantar fascia and ankle tendons, which could lead to “degeneration, discomfort, and pain,” he says.
Lewis says he typically tells his clients to only wear a recovery sandal at home after a big workout or competition. That way they’re not wearing them for too long (or trying to walk far), and they’re in a controlled environment where the instability is less likely to make them trip.
Bryan also reminds patients that recovery shoes don’t magically erase all the strain you put on your feet and legs throughout the day. “I try to encourage [patients] to use them appropriately, not thinking that they can get away with as much standing, walking, and running as they want just because they have recovery shoes,” he says. He adds that to truly let your tissues recover, you need adequate time off from whatever activity is stressing them, as well as sleep and proper nutrition—not just another pair of shoes.

Ukraine’s Flamingo missiles strike Russia twice in one week; rocket arsenal hit
2026-02-12 16:21:06 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/ukraines-flamingo-missiles-strike-russia-twice-in-one-week-rocket-arsenal-hit/

Ukrainian cruise missiles lit up a Russian arsenal overnight near the town of Kotluban on 12 February, the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine
announced
. The identity of these missiles: none other than the controversial FP-5 Flamingo.
“This arsenal is one of the largest ammunition storage sites for the Russian army,” the General Staff wrote in its announcement.
This is the second time that the Ukrainian military has openly acknowledged using Flamingo missiles in attacks on Russia. The first time was
a week ago
, when Ukrainian forces launched at least four FP-5s at a nearby Russian missile base in Kapustin Yar, where Russia assembles and tests the nuclear-capable Oreshnik ballistic missile.
The Kapustin Yar attack proved disappointing. Observers pointed out the relatively minor damage inflicted by the Flamingos, despite their massive warheads. This, plus the rarity of the missile’s use so far, and the controversy surrounding its developer, Fire Point, suggested to many that the FP-5 is more of a propaganda tool than a mainstay deep strike weapon.
However, this latest attack may suggest that the Flamingo is being improved and the Ukrainian military is getting better at flying it through Russian defenses,
according to
Ukrainian military analysis site Defense Express.
Powerful explosions at Russian rocket artillery arsenal
The Kotluban arsenal is based in Russia’s Volgograd Oblast, some 300 kilometers away from the nearest Ukrainian border and 120 kilometers from Kapustin Yar.
According to the General Staff, powerful explosions, followed by secondary detonations were recorded at the arsenal, which belongs to Russia’s Main Missile and Artillery Directorate (GRAU). This body is responsible for procuring and equipping the Russian armed forces, and operates most of Russia’s military arsenals.
Open source monitors
claimed
that the attack targeted facilities where Russia's rocket artillery was being stored and modernized. Purported videos of the strike posted on open source channels showed flashes illuminating the night sky.
Local residents reported loud explosions and a fire in the arsenal’s vicinity — the local Russian governor ordered an evacuation of Kotluban.
Long range, big warhead, massive hype
The Flamingo was revealed to the world in August, with much fanfare. It promised to strengthen Ukraine’s deep strike arsenal, held back by the limited payloads that long-range drones can carry.
The FP-5 is a chonker of a missile, with a reported takeoff weight of 6,000 kilograms, propelled by a turbofan engine that’s used in manned aircraft.
The developer, Ukrainian company Fire Point, claimed that the missile has a maximum range of 3,000 kilometers, a top speed of 1,500 kilometers per hour and can carry a payload of over 1,000 kilograms.
However, to keep costs down, the Flamingo lacks modern cruise missiles’ stealth features and its massive engine is top-mounted. These factors make it "highly visible" to enemy radar, wrote Oslo University missile expert Fabian Hoffmann.
This means that on paper, Russia’s air defenses should have no problem taking it down.
Doubt and controversy
Fire Point had stated it was producing about one missile per day and planned to scale that amount sevenfold over the coming months.
But this claim quickly came under scrutiny, thanks to the tentative pace of deployment, vague language from the Ukrainian government, and a
probe
by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) over possible inflated delivery projections or component costs, according to a Kyiv Independent investigation. The company has landed in
further controversies
since then.
Fire Point has since partnered with Denmark to launch joint manufacturing lines, but a question continued to hang over the pace of production. As recently as November, Ukraine’s defense officials referred to the missile as “experimental,” possibly implying that it wasn’t ready for mass deployment.
As of last week, available evidence
showed just four
Flamingo raids involving potentially just nine missiles, resulting in damage to two targets. The previous attack may have taken place in October, with Flamingos used in combination with the shorter-range R-360 Neptune cruise missiles to attack
targets in Crimea
.
Some observers used harsher language. Observer Thorkill, who closely monitors social media for evidence of Flamingo usage,
described
the missile as a "a certain marketing-propaganda hoax."
Can the Flamingo redeem itself?
However, things may not be that cut and dry, Defense Express wrote.
“The second official announcement of the FP-5 Flamingo’s effective use not only speaks to the frequency of the attacks, but that this cruise missile was ‘trained’ to fly and effectively break through Russian air defense and electronic warfare systems.”
Both the missile base at Kapustin Yar and the GRAU arsenal near Kotluban are supposed to be protected “quite tightly” by both air defense and EW.
Defense Express also noted that these sites are just 120 kilometers apart. Russia does not appear to have beefed up air defenses in the area after the previous strike.
The most recent attack might add credence to Fire Point’s announcement that they added the capability for low-altitude flight to the huge missile.
According to Defense Express, it’s possible that such an upgrade may involve the TERCOM system. This is a missile navigation package that compares readings from an onboard radar altimeter to a terrain contour map, with the aim of improving accuracy.
The advantages of TERCOM are twofold. First, it reduces a missile’s reliance on satellites, which improves resistance to electronic warfare.
And second, “the lower the flight altitude of a cruise missile, the better it penetrates air defenses, because it hides from radar beyond the horizon.”

Is the Flamingo missile a real weapon, or just marketing?
Ukraine fired a barrage of Flamingo missiles at Russia’s Oreshnik missile base—and apparently missed
Tomahawks would be useful. Funding Ukraine’s missile factories would be smarter.

Fedorov at the start of the Ramstein meeting at NATO headquarters in Brussels on 12 February, as reported by European Pravda
Details:
Fedorov briefed NATO allies on Ukraine's critical need for missiles for Patriot air defence systems.
Quote:
"Today one of the largest ballistic strikes was carried out against Ukraine… The most effective way to counter these missiles is PAC-3 missiles for Patriot systems. We critically need this equipment because the Russians are attempting to destroy our country's infrastructure."
Details:
Fedorov emphasised that air defence is a key priority for Ukraine.
"I urge partners to provide PAC-3 missiles from their stockpiles to protect our infrastructure during the winter," he said.
Fedorov also called for strengthened cooperation through the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) programme, "as it is working very well and we are receiving critically important components".
Background:
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that
he had grounds for his harsh criticism
of Europe at Davos after a lack of funding led to a shortage of air defence missiles. He said that the reason for the missile shortage was a lack of funding to purchase PAC-3 anti-missile systems, which are capable of intercepting ballistic missiles, from the US.
NATO insists there has been
no delay in the supply of Patriot missiles
, contrary to Zelenskyy's remarks.
Earlier, Alona Hetmanchuk, Ukraine's ambassador to NATO,
listed six countries
that have provided Ukraine with the most support under PURL.

Germany Will Provide Four Eurofighter Typhoon Fighters for NATO Mission in the Arctic
2026-02-12 16:15:21 GMT
https://militarnyi.com/en/news/germany-eurofighter-typhoon-nato-arctic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=germany-eurofighter-typhoon-nato-arctic

Germany
will join NATO’s Arctic Sentry mission by sending four
Eurofighter Typhoon
fighter jets.
German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius announced this in Brussels, according to
Der Spiegel
.
According to sources in the Bundeswehr, the aircraft could be transferred to the Arctic by the end of this week to begin surveillance flights.
The German fighter jets will be based in Iceland. The primary mission of the air group will be air combat and patrol.
What else, besides the Eurofighter Typhoon, can Germany send?
In the coming weeks, the German presence in the region may expand significantly. In particular, the possibility of using maritime reconnaissance aircraft to monitor the water area is being considered. The German Air Force may also provide refueling aircraft to ensure long-range flights.

In addition, the Bundeswehr may use A400M transport aircraft to provide logistical support to other countries participating in the mission. This will help partners who lack their own transport for long-distance cargo transfers.
The
Arctic Sentry
mission is part of efforts to strengthen deterrence and defense amid Russia’s increased military activity and China’s heightened interest in the Far North.

Report: Trump administration secretly smuggled Starlink terminals to aid Iran protesters
2026-02-12 16:15:12 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/report-trump-administration-secretly-smuggled-starlink-terminals-to-aid-iran-protesters/

The Trump administration secretly smuggled thousands of Starlink satellite internet terminals into Iran following last month's brutal crackdown on anti-regime protests, according to senior US officials who spoke to
The Wall Street Journal
.
Iranian authorities have been accused of violently suppressing widespread demonstrations and imposing an almost complete internet blackout. Now, the Journal reports that the US covertly transferred about 6,000 Starlink satellite internet kits into the Islamic Republic. It marks the first time Washington has directly sent Starlink equipment into Iran.
The State Department purchased close to 7,000 Starlink terminals, most of them in January, in an effort to help anti-regime activists circumvent internet restrictions. The procurement followed a decision by senior Trump administration officials to divert funds from other Iran internet freedom initiatives toward acquiring the Starlink devices.
President Donald Trump was aware of the shipments, the officials said, although they could not confirm whether he or another senior official directly approved the plan.
Tehran has repeatedly accused Washington, without providing evidence, of playing a central role in last month's nationwide protests in the country of 90 million people. Iranians took to the streets to protest years of economic mismanagement, currency devaluation and strict clerical rule.
The US has denied any involvement in the unrest. However, the "Starlink operation" suggests the Trump administration has provided far more assistance to regime opponents than previously known. As demonstrations spread across Iran, Trump publicly encouraged Iranians to continue protesting against the regime, telling them that "help is on the way."
Since then, however, the two countries have entered high-stakes negotiations over dismantling Iran's nuclear program. Tehran has refused to halt uranium enrichment, insisting it is necessary for civilian purposes, while Washington is seeking to block any pathway that could enable Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.
If no agreement is reached, Trump could authorize a military strike on Iran using aircraft carriers, warships and fighter jets that the US has deployed to the Middle East.
Possession of a Starlink terminal, owned by Elon Musk's SpaceX, is illegal in Iran and can carry a prison sentence of several years. The regime tightly restricts access to independent and foreign communications.
Nevertheless, tens of thousands of Iranians are believed to possess the satellite terminals, analysts and activists told the Journal, using them to maintain contact and share information beyond government censorship. Iranian authorities have conducted home and rooftop searches of suspected users in an effort to uncover Starlink equipment.
Trump and Musk discussed in January how to ensure that Iranians could use Starlink to access the internet during the protests, the White House confirmed at the time.
For months, officials had pushed for Starlink as the most effective way to support anti-regime protests in Iran, alongside or instead of virtual private networks, or VPNs. Mora Namdar, who until December headed the State Department's Middle East bureau, sent a memo in August to Secretary of State Marco Rubio urging the explicit purchase of Starlink devices for delivery to Iran.
While her bureau "funded a variety of VPN and other internet freedom technologies, that is useless when the internet is shut down," she wrote.
A State Department official said the department supports a range of tools, including VPNs and other technologies, to help Iranians stay connected despite internet restrictions and shutdowns. The official told the Journal that the administration is expanding those capabilities and working with international partners to share the costs.
The report added that a handful of American civil organizations are also assisting in the purchase of Starlink terminals, according to US officials.

Ukraine creates new military branch to shield critical infrastructure from Russian air strikes
2026-02-12 16:13:38 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/ukraine-creates-new-military-branch-to-shield-critical-infrastructure/

Ukraine will establish a new branch of its armed forces tasked with protecting critical infrastructure from Russian aerial attacks, Commander-in-Chief of Ukraine’s Armed Forces Oleksandr Syrskyi said on 12 February, outlining structural changes to the country’s air defense system.
The move comes amid continued Russian drone and missile strikes and follows recent criticism from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over gaps in short-range air defense.
New branch to take over infrastructure protection
The reform will redistribute responsibilities between existing anti-aircraft missile units and a newly created branch focused specifically on covering key infrastructure sites.
Organizational measures are already underway, including expanding and upgrading interceptor drone capabilities and coordinating with international partners to address shortages of missiles for surface-to-air systems and fighter aviation.
Up to 200 Shaheds a day, 74% interception rate
According to
Syrskyi, Russia deploys between 100 and 200 Shahed-type attack drones each day, alongside intermittent large-scale missile and aviation strikes.
Over the past two years, Ukraine’s air defense effectiveness has remained at approximately 74%, Syrskyi said. In many cases, he added, around 70% or more of incoming aerial threats are destroyed, depending on weather conditions and the mix of systems deployed.
Syrskyi described anti-aircraft missile forces as the backbone of Ukraine’s air defense, particularly in adverse weather. When conditions allow, he said, fighter aircraft, helicopters, and interceptor drones are used to strengthen coverage.
Zelenskyy demanded action
The announcement follows Zelenskyy’s 6 February
address
, in which he said the component responsible for intercepting Shahed-type drones “must operate far more effectively” and ordered personnel changes in Air Force units in several regions.
Zelenskyy warned that uneven defensive coverage was allowing Russian drones to penetrate in some areas, particularly as winter attacks intensified pressure on civilian and energy infrastructure.
He described the Air Force’s performance in certain regions as unsatisfactory and tasked newly appointed Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov with directly overseeing improvements to counter-drone defenses. The Air Force commander received additional instructions as part of what Zelenskyy called urgent corrective steps.
The creation of a dedicated infrastructure protection branch signals a broader effort to tighten coordination, address weaknesses exposed by recent strikes, and adapt Ukraine’s air defense structure to the sustained scale of Russia’s aerial campaign.

https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/france-germany-explore-new-ballistic-missile-arianegroup-says-2026-02-12/

Feb 12 (Reuters) - France and Germany are among European countries that have shown interest in a new land-based ballistic missile proposed by aerospace firm ArianeGroup, the latest sign of Europe's push to close its deep-strike weapons gap.
The French defence ministry is in talks with ArianeGroup about the system, according to the company, which says the missile could hit targets more than 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) away within minutes. It said it is also in contact with the German government and providing information on the capability.

here.
"People are trying to understand what is at stake with ballistic systems," Vincent Pery, ArianeGroup's director of defence programmes, told journalists on Thursday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
He said the company is holding "preliminary discussions with several countries" about how the weapon would fit into the geopolitical context, citing Russia's ballistic missile strikes on Ukraine, and the use of such weapons in the Middle East.
Germany's defence ministry had no immediate comment. France's defence ministry did not immediately respond.
KEEPING UP WITH RUSSIA
Germany and France are among countries that have raised defence spending since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and as U.S. President Donald Trump made clear Europeans should expect less support from NATO's leading military power.
Russia's growing missile use has prompted some European nations to explore their own options to strike deep into enemy territory.
Last month, Russia used its
intermediate-range Oreshnik
ballistic missile for the second time in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin has said it is impossible to intercept due to its reported speed of more than 10 times the speed of sound.
"We are within range of these missiles," French President Emmanuel Macron said last month, arguing Europe must develop comparable weapons to deter Russia and secure the continent. France's budget proposed up to one billion euros for a ground-based ballistic-missile programme.
Still, Europe is years away from fielding such a weapon, said Zuzanna Gwadera, a research analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. She said the region's various deep-strike initiatives, which could also include cruise missiles, remain largely at the conceptual stage.
France is currently the only European NATO member with a domestically developed ballistic-missile programme: the M51 submarine-launched ballistic missile built by ArianeGroup, Europe's biggest maker of space launchers.

Love Story: JFK Jr. & Carolyn Bessette Is Trying Too Hard to Be The Crown for America
2026-02-12 16:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7372644/love-story-jfk-jr-carolyn-bessette-review/

If the Kennedys are the closest thing America has to a royal family, then Carolyn Bessette Kennedy was our
Princess Diana
. Like her British counterpart, she was an outsider—albeit a beautiful, stylish, blonde, privileged one—to the palace intrigue that consumed the family she married into. She was stalked by paparazzi, restricted in her professional pursuits and social life, alternately worshiped and vilified in the media. And then she died, in her mid-30s, in a horrible accident, alongside
a man
with whom she may or may not have had a future, only to have her legacy dissected for decades to come. We never let either woman rest in peace.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
These parallels are not lost on the makers of FX’s
Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr. & Carolyn Bessette
, the anxiously awaited first season of
Ryan Murphy
’s real-life romance anthology. Created by Connor Hines (
Space Force
) and adapted from Elizabeth Beller’s 2024 book
Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy
, the show adheres to what might be called Ryan Murphy’s Law: Every morsel of narrative subtext must be converted into text before the end of the season. As soon as you think to yourself,
wow, they’re really giving Carolyn the Diana treatment
, characters start saying things like: “You’re going to be the American people’s princess.” This results in a surprisingly restrained fusion of
The Crown
’s later seasons
and a
Murphyverse
obsessed with reframing 20th century American mythology—a story that contains many strong elements but doesn’t dig deep enough to avoid tedium.
Like
Once Upon a Time
, which challenges previous accounts that painted Bessette Kennedy as a “
bitchy
” degenerate,
JFK Jr. & Carolyn Bessette
is a revisionist project that makes Carolyn its protagonist. The casting was crucial here, and
Love Story
really got it right with Sarah Pidgeon. A Tony-nominated Broadway alum who came into the series with a few TV (
Tiny Beautiful Things
,
The Wilds
) and film (
The Friend
,
I Know What You Did Last Summer
) credits, she will still look like a fresh face to most viewers, as Bessette did to the world when her relationship with Kennedy went public. Pidgeon’s performance is brilliant. Far from the tabloid caricature, her Carolyn is a model of intelligence, poise, ambition, and control—a no-nonsense career woman who seems, at once, to be genuinely reticent to step into the Kennedy spotlight and playing hard to get in a savvy romantic long game that recalls the hit mid-’90s dating manual for women,
The Rules
. We get to know and like the character not in spite of her complexity, but because of it.
The Kennedys are less enthralling, maybe by design. True newcomer Paul Anthony Kelly looks a lot like the tall, dark, and dashing John Jr., and does a fine job in the blandly written role of a son unwilling and likely unable to equal a father he barely knew, his failures constantly enumerated in headlines. (“I don’t want to be a great man,” he tells Carolyn. “I just want to be a good man.”)
Naomi Watts
, who was mesmerizing as society icon Babe Paley in Murphy’s
Feud: Capote vs. the Swans
, gives an uncharacteristically broad, baby-voiced performance as
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
, chafing at her “America’s widow” identity and dancing shakily to the
Camelot
soundtrack with a painting of JFK. Whether you call this mode camp or melodrama, this is the rare Murphy production where it doesn’t work. Kennedy Onassis’ death in 1994, before her son could bring Carolyn home, was tragic for the world but well-timed in the context of the show, which improves after her early exit. Amid a mess of indistinguishable Kennedy cousins, the one memorable portrayal is Grace Gummer as John’s protective older sister, Caroline, still playing surrogate parent to the overgrown boy she cared for while their mother lost herself in grief.
Pidgeon and Gummer aside, the show’s greatest assets are its audio and visual elements. In response to
early criticism
of the leads’ costumes and wigs, the
Love Story
team
rededicated itself
to getting John and especially Carolyn’s looks right—and to my admittedly non-expert eyes, costume designer Rudy Mance and hair department head Michelle Ceglia have done it. Carolyn’s wardrobe is all drapey, meticulously simple elegance. The black, white, and khaki that predominate in the offices of Calvin Klein, the center of the fashion universe at the time, where Bessette worked her way up from the retail floor to become a publicity director and “VIP whisperer,” read just as they did at the time, as sleek and modern and minimalistic rather than boring. (In a storyline that doesn’t amount to much, Alessandro Nivola’s slightly catty Calvin bristles that his employee’s fame is eclipsing his own.) Production designer Alex DiGerlando’s ’90s New York is neither generic ’90s nor generic New York; it’s young, glamorous, elite Manhattan, from John’s industrial Tribeca loft to the leafy interior of then-trendy fusion restaurant slash celebrity hangout Indochine. The music is more romantic and sophisticated than the grunge, nu metal, gangsta rap, and teen pop that dominated the radio throughout the decade: Mazzy Star, Björk, Sade. In accordance with Ryan Murphy’s Law, there’s an absurdly on-the-nose dance to
Pulp’s “Common People,”
but the scene is too much fun to groan at.
The
mise-en-scène
is so immersive and Pidgeon’s Carolyn so compelling, I often forgot that the story itself was slow and repetitive. We barely glimpse the couple’s lives before they met; she unenthusiastically dates a doofy model-actor-waiter, Michael Bergin (Noah Fearnley), while John tries to extricate himself from a clingy Darryl Hannah (Dree Hemingway), who comes off poorly in an episode that implies she used Jackie’s death to try to get him back. Instead, we see a lot of false starts to a relationship whose chemistry could, frankly, be more vividly conveyed. Also: a lot of
Crown
-style lamentation about the media “vultures” who have been pecking at the Kennedys for generations. The real tragedy, we’re made to understand through endless reiteration, is that Carolyn thinks she understands what she’s getting into—that she plans and hesitates and analyzes and forces John to have hard conversations before she’ll even consider his marriage proposal. But once they do return to Manhattan after a remote, troubled wedding, the feeding frenzy is many degrees of magnitude worse than it had been when they were dating. It turns this capable woman into a shut-in, a wreck. She’s jealous that John has
George
, his faltering magazine, while she’s too much of a distraction to work in the industry she loves.
It’s ironic, certainly, that marrying John destroys the very independence that made her so attractive to him. But that isn’t quite enough to hang an eight-episode drama on. The experience that
The Crown
depicts and
JFK Jr. & Carolyn Bessette
echoes is that of the ultimate gilded cage—what perpetual scrutiny does to a family compelled to prioritize appearances over relationships, tradition over love. Through the former’s Diana and the latter’s Carolyn, we observe how fundamentally the lives of royalty, official or honorary, differ from normal lives, and how impossible it is for a person who didn’t grow up in such a maelstrom to adapt to it.
But that’s easy enough to grasp that there should be room for other ideas. For all its flaws,
The Crown
balanced its royal characters’ travails with bigger questions. It asked what function the monarchy fulfilled over the course of Queen Elizabeth II’s long reign, what impact the Windsors had on the British, the peoples they colonized, national and global politics. On occasion, it spent time with regular citizens—servants, bureaucrats, journalists, coal miners—filling in negative space.
Love Story
shows no interest in understanding what the Kennedys meant, and still mean, to a nation that prided itself on having no kings but elevated this particular dynasty as a surrogate royal family. That’s a shame, especially as heirs whose affiliations range from the far right to the young left continue to drive American politics. If the people we put on pedestals are mirrors for society, then what did the Kennedys say about us in the 1960s? The ’90s? Today?

RFK Jr. promised to restore trust in US health agencies. One year later, it’s eroding

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's choice to be Secretary of Health and Human Services, appears before the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing, at the Capitol in Washington, Jan. 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis, file)
2026-02-12T15:03:30Z
NEW YORK (AP) — Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
one year ago
, he has defended his upending of federal health policy by saying the changes will restore trust in America’s public health agencies.
But as the longtime leader of the anti-vaccine movement scales back immunization guidance and dismisses scientists and advisers, he’s clashed with top medical groups who say he’s
not following the science
.
The confrontation is
deepening confusion
among the public that had already surged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Surveys show trust in the agencies Kennedy leads is falling, rather than rising, as the country’s health landscape undergoes dramatic change.
Kennedy says he’s aiming to boost transparency to empower Americans to make their own health choices. Doctors counter that the false and unverified information he’s promoting is causing major, perhaps irreversible, damage — and that if enough people forgo vaccination, it will cause a surge of illness and death.
There was a time when people trusted health agencies regardless of party and the government reported “the best of what science knows at this point,” said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.
“Now, you cannot confidently go to federal websites and know that,” she said.
HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon argued that trust had suffered during the Biden administration. “Kennedy’s mandate is to restore transparency, scientific rigor, and accountability,” he said.
Trust slid during the COVID pandemic
Historically, federal scientific and public health agencies enjoyed strong ratings in public opinion polls. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for decades scored above many other government agencies in Gallup surveys that asked whether they were doing a “good” or “excellent” job.
Two decades ago, more than 60% of Americans gave the CDC high marks, according to Gallup. But that number fell dramatically at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, amid agency mistakes and guidance that some people didn’t like.
In 2020, the percentage of Americans who believed the CDC was doing at least a “good” job fell to 40% and then leveled off for the next few years.
Alix Ellis, a hairstylist and mom in Madison, Georgia, used to fully trust the CDC and other health agencies but lost that confidence during the COVID-19 pandemic. She said some of the guidance didn’t make sense. At her salon, for example, stylists could work directly on someone’s hair, but others in the room had to be several feet away.
“I’m not saying that we were lied to, but that is when I was like, OK, ‘Why are we doing this?’” the 35-year-old said.
Kennedy helped create the trust problem, doctor says
Part of Kennedy’s pitch as health secretary has been restoring Americans’ trust in public health.
“We’re going to tell them what we know, we’re going to tell them what we don’t know, and we’re going to tell them what we’re researching and how we’re doing it,” Kennedy told senators last September, while explaining how he intended to make the CDC’s information reliable. “It’s the only way to restore trust in the agency — by making it trustworthy.”
Before entering politics, Kennedy was one of the loudest voices spreading false information about immunizations. Now, he’s trying to fix a trust problem he helped create, said Dr. Rob Davidson, a Michigan emergency physician.
“You fed those people false information to create the distrust, and now you’re sweeping into power and you’re going to cure the distrust by promoting the same disinformation,” said Davidson, who runs a doctor group called the Committee to Protect Health Care. “It’s upside-down.”
Kennedy has wielded the power of his office to take multiple steps that diverge from medical consensus.
Last May, he announced COVID-19 vaccines were no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, a move doctors called concerning and confusing.
In November, he directed the CDC to
abandon its position
that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying new evidence. And earlier this year, the CDC under his leadership reduced the number of vaccines recommended for every child, a decision medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.
Kennedy also has overhauled his department through canceled grants and mass layoffs. Last summer, Kennedy fired his new CDC chief after less than a month over disagreements about vaccine policy.
Confusion emerges as trust erodes
Some have applauded the moves. But surveys suggest many Americans have had the opposite reaction.
“I have much less trust,” said Mark Rasmussen, a 67-year-old retiree walking into a mall in Danbury, Connecticut, one recent morning.
Shocked by Kennedy’s dismantling of public health norms, professional medical groups have urged Americans not to follow new vaccine recommendations they say were adopted without public input or compelling evidence.
The American Academy of Pediatrics, along with more than 200 public health and advocacy groups, urged Congress to investigate how and why Kennedy changed the vaccine schedule. The American Medical Association, working with the University of Minnesota’s Vaccine Integrity Project, this week announced a new evidence-based process for reviewing the safety of respiratory virus vaccines — something they say is needed since the government stopped doing that kind of systematic review.
Many Democratic-led states also have rebuffed Kennedy’s policies, even
creating their own alliances
to counter his vaccine guidance.
“We see burgeoning confusion about which sources to trust and about which sources are real. That makes decision-making on an individual level much harder,” said Dr. Megan Ranney, dean of the Yale School of Public Health.
She said she worried the confusion was contributing to the recent rise in diseases like whooping cough and measles, which were once largely eliminated in the U.S.
Surveys indicate growing public wavering over support for the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine. Although a large majority of people support giving it to children, the proportion declined significantly in just over nine months, according to Annenberg research. An August 2025 survey finds that 82% would be “very” or “somewhat” likely to recommend that an eligible child in their household get MMR vaccine, compared with 90% in November 2024.
Surveys show trust is declining again
New findings from the health care research nonprofit KFF in January show that 47% of Americans trust the CDC “a great deal” or “a fair amount” to provide reliable vaccine information, down about 10 percentage points since the beginning of Trump’s second term.
Trust among Democrats dropped 9 percentage points since September, to 55%, the survey found. Trust among Republicans and independents hasn’t changed since September, but it has declined somewhat among both groups since the beginning of Trump’s term.
Even among MAHA supporters, the poll shows, fewer than half say they trust agencies like the CDC and FDA “a lot” or “some” to make recommendations about childhood vaccine schedules.
Gallup surveys also show a drop in Americans who believe the CDC is doing a “good job,” from 40% in 2024 to 31% last year.
Those results came alongside a decline of trust across the government — not just agencies under Kennedy’s oversight. Yet concerns about Kennedy’s trustworthiness also have emerged in the past year. Documents recently obtained by The Associated Press and The Guardian, for example,
undermine his statements
that a 2019 trip to Samoa ahead of a measles outbreak had “nothing to do with vaccines.” The documents have prompted senators to assert that Kennedy lied to them over the visit.
HHS officials say they are promoting independent decision-making by families while working to reduce preventable diseases. They say reducing routine vaccine recommendations was meant to ensure parents vaccinate children against the riskiest diseases.
HHS did not make Kennedy available for an interview, despite repeated requests. But as he has pledged to restore trust, he’s also urged people to come to their own conclusions.
“This idea that you should trust the experts,” Kennedy said recently on The Katie Miller Podcast, “a good mother doesn’t do that.”

Key Democrat accuses the Justice Department of ‘spying’ on lawmakers reviewing Epstein files

2026-02-12T15:41:59Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — A top Democrat is calling for a watchdog investigation after photographs emerged suggesting that the Justice Department has been tracking the search history of lawmakers who are reviewing files from the
Jeffrey Epstein investigation.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, asked the Justice Department’s inspector general to investigate what he characterized as “spying” on members of Congress who this week have reviewed less-redacted versions of the Epstein files at a department annex and on department-owned computers.
Photographs taken during
Attorney General Pam Bondi’s hearing before the House Judiciary Committee
on Wednesday showed her holding a binder open to a page that said “Jayapal Pramila Search History” and that listed a series of documents that were apparently reviewed. Pramila Jayapal is a Democratic congresswoman and was among the Judiciary Committee members who pressed Bondi during the hearing about the department’s handling of the Epstein files.
Jayapal called it “totally unacceptable” and said lawmakers will be “demanding a full accounting” of how the department is using the search history.
“Bondi has enough time to spy on Members of Congress, but can’t find it in herself to apologize to the survivors of Epstein’s horrific abuse,” Jayapal said in a post on X.
A bipartisan contingent of lawmakers has traveled in recent days to a Justice Department outpost to review less-redacted records from the files, but some who have seen the documents have complained that too much information about Epstein associates remains withheld from view. The Trump administration Justice Department said last month that it was releasing more than 3 million pages along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images related to Epstein investigations.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department did not immediately return a request seeking comment Thursday. Representatives for the inspector general’s office also did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
In a statement, Raskin said that not only had the Justice Department withheld records from lawmakers “but now Bondi and her team are spying on members of Congress conducting oversight in yet another blatant attempt to intrude into Congress’s oversight processes.”
He added: “DOJ must immediately cease tracking any Members’ searches, open up the Epstein review to senior congressional staff, and publicly release all files—with all the survivors’ information, and only the survivors’ information, properly redacted—as required by federal law.”

NATO has completed its first focused Operation Sea Guardian deployment of 2026, running from 21 January to 9 February in the Eastern Mediterranean, as the Alliance continues efforts to strengthen maritime security and improve situational awareness in the region.
The operation was led by the Turkish flagship TCG Gaziantep, bringing together Allied surface forces, submarines and air assets to build what NATO described as a more comprehensive operational picture across the Eastern Mediterranean.
During the mission, TCG Gaziantep conducted more than 300 hours of intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance patrols, monitoring activity across the operational area. The ship and its embarked helicopter also carried out more than 100 hailings of commercial vessels, conducted in both English and Arabic, aimed at deterring terrorism and illicit activity. Air support was provided by Greece, Turkey and the United States, including airborne early warning and maritime patrol aircraft, contributing more than 50 combined flight hours, alongside NATO Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Force aviation support.
Submarines from Greece, Italy and Turkey also operated during the deployment, with NATO highlighting their role in undersea surveillance and their contribution to a wider maritime picture. The Turkish flagship made a logistics stop in Mersin, Turkey, between 2 and 3 February to replenish supplies and sustain operational readiness. NATO also highlighted cooperation with partners during the deployment, with a Georgian Coast Guard team embarked on TCG Gaziantep conducting NATO-compliant boarding training alongside Turkish personnel, including weapons familiarisation, drills and fast-rope training.
Operation Sea Guardian is NATO’s standing maritime security mission in the Mediterranean, aimed at supporting counter-terrorism, enhancing maritime awareness and strengthening cooperation with Allied and partner forces.

Two Israelis have been charged with using classified military information to place bets on how future events will unfold,
Israeli authorities
said Thursday, accusing the individuals of "serious security offences".
A joint statement by the Israeli Ministry of Defence, domestic security service
Shin Bet
, and police said that a civilian and a reservist are suspected of placing bets on the US-based prediction market Polymarket on future military operations based on information that the reservist had access to.
"This was allegedly based on classified information to which the reservists were exposed through their military duties," the statement said. Lawyers for those charged were not immediately able to be reached.
The statement said that after it found sufficient evidence against a civilian and a reservist, the State Prosecutor's Office decided to indict them for serious security offences, as well as charges of bribery and obstruction of justice.
"The security establishment emphasises that engaging in such gambling activities based on confidential and classified information poses a real security risk to IDF (Israeli military) operations and to state security," it said.
Israel's Attorney General's Office decided to prosecute the two individuals following a joint investigation by police, military intelligence, and other security agencies that led to several arrests. The two face charges including bribery and obstruction of justice.
Authorities offered no details on the identity of the two individuals or the reservist's rank or position in the
Israeli military
, but warned that such actions posed a "real security risk" for the military and the Israeli state.
Israel's public broadcaster
Kan
had reported earlier that the bets were placed in June ahead of Israel's
war on Iran
and that the winnings were roughly $150,000.
Israel's military and security services "view the acts attributed to the defendants very seriously and will act resolutely to thwart and bring to justice any person involved in the activity of using classified information illegally," the statement said.
The accused will remain in custody until the end of legal proceedings against them, the Prosecutor's Office said.
Israeli media said the case was likely linked to an investigation where an anonymous user bet that Israel would strike Iran on the Friday that it did so in
June 2025
.
The military said that "according to the investigation findings, no operational damage was caused in the current incident". But it said there was a "severe ethical failure and a clear crossing of a red line, which are not consistent with the values of the IDF and what is expected of its service members."
Criminal and disciplinary proceedings will be taken against any party found to be involved in such actions, it added.
Prediction markets are comprised of typically yes-or-no questions called event contracts, with the prices connected to what traders are willing to pay, which theoretically indicates the perceived probability of an event occurring.
Their use has skyrocketed in recent years, but despite some eye-catching windfalls, traders still lose money every day. In the US, the trades are categorised differently from traditional forms of gambling, raising questions about transparency and risk.

Remote Canadian community grapples with aftermath of mass shooting that left 9 people dead

People attend a candle light vigil at the front steps of the legislature in Victoria, B.C., on Wednesday, Feb. 11, 2026 in honor of the victims of the school shooting in Tumbler Ridge, B.C. (Chad Hipolito/The Canadian Press via AP)
2026-02-12T15:13:36Z
TUMBLER RIDGE, British Columbia (AP) — Mourners in a remote Canadian town are building a memorial of flowers, lights and stuffed animals as the community copes with a mass shooting that killed eight people, mostly children, in addition to the 18-year-old shooter who died from an apparent self-inflicted wound.
Young children, teenagers, parents and grandparents huddled against the cold and the grief at a vigil the day after Tuesday’s killing spree in the British Columbia district of Tumbler Ridge, with the mayor telling mourners, “It’s OK to cry.”
Mayor Darryl Krakowka said late Wednesday that the town is “one big family,” and encouraged people to reach out and support each other, especially the families of those who died in the attack. The community must support victims’ families “forever,” not only in the days and weeks to come, he said.
The suspect in a school shooting in Canada was an 18-year-old who had a history of police visits to her home to check on her mental health, authorities said.
Police said Jesse Van Rootselaar was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound following the assault on a school in the small mountain community of Tumbler Ridge.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald said Van Rootselaar first killed her mother and stepbrother at the family home before attacking the nearby school. She had a history of mental health contacts with police, he said.
The motive was unclear.
The town is near the provincial border with Alberta
The town of 2,700 people in the Canadian Rockies is more than 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) northeast of Vancouver, near the provincial border with
Alberta
.
Police said the victims included a 39-year-old teacher and five students, ages 12 to 13.
The killings at the home occurred first, McDonald said. A young family member at the home went to a neighbor, who called police. The bodies of the suspect’s mother, who was also 39, and her 11-year-old stepbrother were found at the home.
At the school, one victim was found in a stairwell and the rest were found in the library, McDonald believed. The suspect was not related to any of the victims at the school, he said.
“There is no information at this point that anyone was specifically targeted,” McDonald said.
Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun. McDonald said officers arrived at the school two minutes after the initial call. When they arrived, shots were fired in their direction.
“Parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers in Tumbler Ridge will wake up without someone they love. The nation mourns with you, and Canada stands by you,” an emotional Prime Minister Mark Carney said as he arrived in Parliament.
Deadliest rampage since 2020
The attack was Canada’s deadliest rampage since 2020, when a gunman in
Nova Scotia killed 13 people
and set fires that left another nine dead.
Carney said flags at government buildings will be flown at half-staff for seven days and added: “We will get through this.”
Shelley Quist said her neighbor across the street lost her 12-year-old. “We heard his mom. She was in the street crying. She wanted her son’s body,” Quist said.
Quist said her 17-year-old son, Darian, was on lockdown in the school for more than two hours. The provincial government website lists Tumbler Ridge Secondary School as having 175 students in grades 7 to 12.
“The grade sevens and eights, I think, were upstairs in the library, and that’s where the shooter went,” she said. Her son was in the library just 15 minutes prior to the attack.
Quist was working at the hospital down the street when the shooting started.
“I was about to go run down to the school, but my coworker held me back. And then I was able to get Darian on the phone to know he was OK,” she said.
Darian Quist said he knew the attack was real when the principal came down the halls and ordered doors to be closed. He said fellow students texted him pictures of blood while he remained locked down in a classroom.
“We used the desk to block the doors,” he said.
School shootings are rare in Canada, which has
strict gun-control laws
. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a
recently broadened
ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.

Investigators ask for surveillance video from specific dates in Nancy Guthrie disappearance
2026-02-12 15:23:02 GMT

This combo from images provided by the FBI shows surveillance footage at the home of Nancy Guthrie the night she went missing in Tucson, Ariz. (FBI via AP)
2026-02-12T15:08:28Z
TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Investigators are pleading with people to share home surveillance camera footage from specific dates leading up to the disappearance of
Nancy Guthrie
as they deal with thousands of tips in their hope to
crack the case
of “Today” show host
Savannah Guthrie
‘s missing mother.
It was unclear Thursday
where the investigation stands
. Fresh surveillance images of
a masked person
on Nancy Guthrie’s porch the night she went missing, coupled with intense police activity across Arizona and the detention of a man, had raised hopes that authorities were nearing a major break. But then the man was released after questioning.
On Wednesday, FBI agents carrying water bottles to beat the 80-degree Fahrenheit (27-degree Celsius) heat walked among rocks and desert vegetation at Guthrie’s Tucson-area home. They also fanned out across a neighborhood about a mile (1.6 kilometers) away, knocking on doors and
searching through cactuses, brush and boulders
.
“They were just asking some general questions wondering if there was anything, any information we could shed on the Nancy Guthrie issue. Wanted to look around the property and after that, cameras and such,” Ann Adams, a neighbor of Nancy Guthrie’s other daughter, Annie Guthrie, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Annie Guthrie lives several miles away from her mother.
“They did ask specifically for the 31st of January and the morning of the first of February and then they wanted to know if we saw anything suspicious on cameras since then,” Adams said.
Authorities have said Guthrie, 84, was
taken against her will
. She’s been missing since Feb. 1. DNA tests showed
blood on her porch
was hers, and authorities say she takes several medications and there’s concern she could die without them.
News stations in Tucson also reported Wednesday that people with Ring doorbell cameras in the area got an alert saying investigators are requesting footage from Jan. 11 between 9 p.m. and midnight regarding the Guthrie case. That’s nearly three weeks before Guthrie went missing.
Ring allows local public safety agencies to submit requests to users in the community that appear publicly on the “Neighbors” feed, according to the Ring website. Users in a designated area receive a notification.
The stations also reported that a pair of black gloves were recovered during agents’ search and have been submitted for DNA analysis.
Several hundred detectives and agents are now assigned to the investigation, which is expanding in the area, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said.
Two investigators emerged from daughter Annie Guthrie’s home Wednesday with a paper grocery sack and a white trash bag. One, still wearing blue protective gloves, also took a stack of mail from the roadside mailbox. They drove away without speaking to reporters.
Adams, the neighbor, said she was out walking her dog earlier this week when, “it started to get really busy and then I heard about them searching, looked down the street, I saw them slowly moving this way.”
A day earlier, authorities said they had stopped a man near the U.S.-Mexico border, just hours after the FBI released videos of a person wearing a gun holster, ski mask and backpack and approaching Nancy Guthrie’s home. The man told media outlets early Wednesday that he was released after several hours and had nothing to do with Guthrie’s disappearance.
Authorities have not said what led them to stop the man Tuesday but confirmed he was released. The sheriff’s department said its deputies and FBI agents also searched a location in Rio Rico, a city south of Tucson where the man lives.
In the first significant break in the case, the FBI released black-and-white images and videos showing what the agency said was “an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie’s front door the morning of her disappearance.” But the images did not show what happened to her.
FBI Director Kash Patel said
investigators spent days
trying to find lost, corrupted or inaccessible images.
Even though the images don’t show the person’s face, investigators are hopeful someone will know who was on the porch. More than 4,000 calls came into the
Pima County sheriff’s
tip line within the past 24 hours, the department said Wednesday afternoon.
Longtime NBC host Savannah Guthrie
and her two siblings have indicated a willingness to pay a ransom. It is not known whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic, and whether the family has had any contact with whoever took Guthrie.

Europe live – latest updates
The top adviser to the EU’s highest court has said it should annul a decision by the European Commission to unfreeze billions of euros of payments to Hungary that had been suspended because of serious concerns over corruption and the rule of law.
Tamara Ćapeta, the advocate general of the European court of justice, said on Thursday the commission should not have paid out the funds because Hungary had not actually carried out the judicial reforms that were a condition for their release.

The Head of the Ministry of Defense stressed that this equipment will help the Ukrainian military to effectively operate the aircraft they have received.
In recent weeks, the Netherlands has allocated hundreds of millions of euros to purchase drones and ammunition. This aid is intended to strengthen the Ukrainian army during the current winter.
In the long term, the Netherlands plans to maintain aid at the same level as in previous years. The country expects to allocate approximately 0.25% of its GDP to support Ukraine.

Climate leaders gathered outside the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) headquarters on Wednesday to condemn the Trump administration’s plans to repeal the legal finding underpinning all federal climate regulations, and promised to fight against the rollback.
“This is corruption, plain and simple.

Ukrainian hackers gather data on Russian positions and Starlink terminals via Telegram

https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020740/

The 256 Cyber Assault Division, together with InformNapalm and MILITAN, have collected information on 2,420 Russian Starlink terminals and precise frontline positions, offering Russians to register their terminals in Ukraine to bypass restrictions.
Source:
InformNapalm
Details:
In addition to data packages gathered during this operation, US$5,870 in donations from Russian military personnel were obtained and redirected to the needs of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Thirty-one Ukrainians who attempted to assist Russians were also identified, and their personal information was passed to relevant security services.

According to InformNapalm, after SpaceX restricted Russian access to Starlink, the Russians began seeking "drops" in Ukraine – individuals willing to activate terminals for extra payment. These expected actions were exploited to harm Russia.
The 256 Cyber Assault Division, InformNapalm and MILITAN created a network of Telegram channels and bots offering Russians to activate their Starlink while actually collecting information on their positions. The data on the terminals was then transferred to the relevant structures to fully block them.
Background:
At the end of January, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence
contacted SpaceX to resolve the issue of Starlink usage
by Russian military personnel. By early February, this yielded results. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote that
the measures worked
.
Shortly after, Ukrainian Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov stated that Ukrainian military personnel need to register their Starlink terminals to ensure continued operation. He later added that Ukrainian Starlink terminals included in the "white list" are operational, while Russian terminals remain inactive.

Trump Administration Announces End to Surge in Immigration Enforcement in Minneapolis
2026-02-12 15:03:59 GMT
https://time.com/7377981/minneapolis-ice-tom-homan-trump-immigration/

In the wake of two people shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis and widespread demonstrations in Minnesota, the Trump Administration said Thursday it is winding down its massive immigration enforcement operation in the state.
“I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude,” border czar Tom Homan told reporters in a press conference in Minneapolis on Thursday.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
President Donald Trump sent Homan, his top immigration advisor, to Minnesota
late last month
to address the growing unrest over excessive use of force by immigration officers in the state, including the shooting deaths of Alex Pretti and Renee Good. Homan took over leadership of “Operation Metro Surge” from Border Patrol commander
Gregory Bovino
and quickly set up meetings with local and state leaders including sheriffs,  police chiefs, Governor Tim Walz, Minneapolis
Mayor Jacob Frey
, and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison. Last week, Homan
announced
he was pulling 700 immigration agents from the city, leaving around 2,000 in the area.
“Operation Metro Surge is ending,” Homan said Thursday.  “A significant drawdown has already been underway this week.”
Homan had previously said a withdrawal from the Minneapolis area would need to be linked with state and local law enforcement cooperating better with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. On Thursday, Homan said he was satisfied that local police will reliably inform immigration agents when someone in the country illegally is being released from jails, and that Minnesota had built on its existing practice of state prisons notifying ICE about relevant people completing their prison sentence. Homan said that state and local police have also increased their response time to removing protest barricades and dispersing protestors who are disrupting federal operations.
Homan said that immigration agents made “over 4,000” arrests during the surge in operations. But he said he did not know how many of those were “targeted” arrests of people deemed to pose a public safety threat and how many had no criminal record.
Governor Tim Walz celebrated Homan’s announcement while stressing that the Administration’s tactics had left scars that will linger, particularly on the state’s immigrant communities. “As we go on this long road to recovery, it’s going to be hard for many of you to get back the trust, to be able to go out again without fear you’re going to be asked for your papers, or to be singled out for how you look,” Walz said at a news conference.

How Trump’s Immigration Crackdown Changed Minneapolis
Democrats in Congress, who are on track to force a shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security this weekend over concerns about ICE’s tactics, reacted to Homan’s announcement with deep skepticism.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts told TIME she did not consider the surge in Minneapolis meaningfully over. “Until there are rules in place that are enforceable, and there’s oversight in place, ICE has given every indication that they are going to keep roaring back, claiming they own the streets, they have a right to push people to the ground, they have a right to snatch up little children, and they have a right to shoot anybody they want with no accountability,” she said.
Senator Adam Schiff of California also doubted the Trump Administration’s commitment to follow through and warned that, absent safeguards, ICE could simply redeploy agents to Minneapolis or  tactics to other cities. “They have demonstrated just how arbitrary and capricious they can be,” he said in an interview, adding that Democrats were focused on securing reforms that could not be undone “tomorrow.”
“I don’t think people are prepared to think everything’s better now,” he added.
Trump’s larger goal of deporting millions of people who are in the U.S. illegally won’t stop, Homan said. “President Trump made a promise of mass deportations and that’s what this country is going to get,” he said, touting a “record number of arrests and deportations under Trump’s first year.” And we will continue that effort.”
“Prioritizing public safety threats and national security threats doesn’t mean we will forget about everybody else,” Homan added. “We will take action on everybody else. That’s just a stone cold fact.”

on the eve of the Munich Security Conference, Busch, who leads the Christian Democrats in Sweden’s center-right coalition government, added: “Europe has to be saved from itself” by becoming more agile and not being slowed down by an increasingly powerful bureaucracy.
She said that instead, European leaders need to “toughen up and need to stop waiting for the Commission to take a lead” on deregulation, competitiveness and promoting energy security through new nuclear energy.
Despite expressing her admiration for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Busch had strong words of criticism for the EU institutions.
“The European Union was built for stability, not for speed,” she said. “We need to make sure that we are building strong democracies and not very large bureaucracies,” she added, because the latter are eroding the bloc’s public legitimacy.
“That’s why we lost our British friends, and that is why we’re also now seeing long-term support for the union being undermined in a lot of member states.”
Busch said member states need to take the initiative in certain areas, rather than Brussels. “Just look at the commitment of cutting our dependence on Russian gas, for example, after the full-scale invasion [of Ukraine]. It took until the Energy Council in Luxembourg last October before we made the final decisions. And then we’re still waiting a few more years [for them to be implemented].”
It’s a warning she’s repeated before: Following weeks of tension after President Donald Trump’s threat to annex Greenland from Denmark,
Busch advised
her EU counterparts to follow the lead of Nordic and Baltic states in boosting defense and energy security. As EU leaders meet today in Belgium to discuss the bloc’s future, it remains to be seen whether they will heed her advice.
Busch warned
that Europe is at a “crossroads now, not only in words, but in action” as the war in Ukraine approaches its fourth anniversary. Asked why the Trump administration is sidelining Europe in the peace talks, Busch said: “This is the reason why Europe needs to be respected in its own strength and unity, because it’s very apparent that the Trump administration has become increasingly unpredictable and is not very impressed by our slow and steady institutions.”
She added: “The president does not respond well to weakness.”
An emerging figure with forthright views on the European stage, Busch is no stranger to controversy at home. She has argued that extremist forms of Islam have no place in Swedish society and criticized pro-Palestinian protestors for threatening freedom of speech after protesting outside ministerial offices.
This week, the Swedish government has proposed toughening the rules on deportations of foreign criminals and is calling on other European countries to overhaul international conventions — particularly the UNHCR — that can limit the scope of such deportations.
“If you look at where we’ve seen gun violence and predominantly the gang violence in Sweden, it has been in areas where we have a high degree of migrants,” Busch said, adding that even migrant communities now say “someone is actually fighting for Swedish values and Swedish law to apply to me.”

European leaders and defense ministers gathering at the Munich Security Conference are grappling with how to end the war in Ukraine as it approaches its fourth anniversary. But do they have any influence on how and when it might end — and on whose terms?
In this bonus episode of EU Confidential, host Anne McElvoy talks to Ebba Busch, Sweden’s deputy prime minister and energy minister, who is calling for a more robust stance against Russia and insists that “Europe must now lead itself, not wait for American leadership or even wait for EU institutions.” She argues that “Europe has to be saved from itself” in becoming more agile and not being slowed down by an increasingly powerful bureaucracy.
Busch’s Christian Democrats formed a coalition with other right-leaning parties, marking a shift in Sweden’s political landscape and defending conservative values on issues from immigration to energy security. Busch has also emerged onto the wider European stage, but can her forthright brand of politics make a difference in Brussels?

Scuffles at Syria’s Al-Hol camp as IS detainees sent to Iraq
2026-02-12 14:59:37 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/scuffles-syrias-al-hol-camp-detainees-sent-iraq

Scuffles broke out on Wednesday at
the notorious Al-Hol camp in Syria’s Al-Hasakeh province
as some of the camp’s remaining residents attacked UN staff, leading the body and several other international organisations to suspend operations at the facility.
The camp is known for its poor humanitarian conditions and for housing the families of Islamic State group militants and other civilians. After the collapse of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) this year, security of the camp has been replaced
Syria government forces
.
Syrian residents of the camp have previously accused SDF guards of abusive practices, including the beating of women and children.
Some 24,000 people lived there, mostly women and children, including around 15,000 Syrians, several thousand Iraqis and more than 6,000 other foreigners from around 40 nationalities.
However,
AFP
reported on Thursday that most of the foreigners had now left, leaving only around 20 families in the so-called foreigners’ annex.
There were also reports that some of the foreign families had gone to Idlib province in Syria, with a source telling
AFP
that there were no more than 20 families now left in this area, populated mostly by foreigners.
The camp is still suffering from ongoing humanitarian issues, with a camp official telling
The New Arab’s
sister site
Al-Araby Al-Jadeed
that a group of camp residents gathered in front of the main gate and threw stones at a UN meeting centre, prompting the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
and other UN teams to evacuate their staff from the site.
The official added that employees of international organisations received threats that their vehicles would be burned if they did not leave the camp. Some were also prevented from entering by protesters, leading to a temporary suspension of activities to ensure staff safety.
He added that all employees had left in a convoy of about 40 vehicles, with no injuries reported.
UNHCR said it would stop operations there but water distribution would continue through UNICEF, to stop the humanitarian situation inside the camp from deteriorating further.
Iraq to complete transfer of IS fighters from Syria
In a related development, the Iraqi government announced that it had nearly completed
the transfer of thousands of Islamic State group detainees from Syria
to facilities in Iraq.
Iraqi Justice Minister Khaled Shwani said that procedures to transfer the final group of alleged IS members from Syria to Iraqi territory would be completed on Thursday.
There are around 60 nationalities among the transferees, although the vast majority are Syrian, with their cases now being examined by the First Karkh Investigative Court in Baghdad, which specialises in terrorism cases.
Shwani added that Iraq will not return any detainee to their home country before completing judicial procedures and issuing final rulings against them.
Most of the territory once held by the SDF in Syria, including the Al-Hol camp was taken over by government forces in an offensive this month, following the breakdown of a March 2025 integration agreement. SDF guards left the camp on 20 January with a ceasefire in place.
Sheikhmous Ahmed, head of the Office of Displaced Persons and Refugee Affairs in the Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (DAANES), told
Al-Araby Al-Jadeed
that the SDF-affiliated body is no longer responsible for the camp.
"We do not know what is happening inside it now or how those who remain there will be removed," he said.
A source from the Syrian government blamed the SDF for the current tense situation, saying they did not consider security at Al-Hol or the safety of the residents once their guards had departed.
Syrian government officials are now carrying out a census of the camp, but Damascus would not confirm if anyone had escaped the camp, with one source saying if anyone had, it was the fault of the SDF, "which withdrew from the site" without a proper handover.

Ukraine's International Legions fully integrated into assault units
2026-02-12 14:56:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020735/

The Ground Forces Command has reported that the international legions of Ukraine's defence forces have been integrated into assault units, calling it a logical step.
Source:
Ground Forces Command
Quote:
"Foreign volunteer units are not disappearing. They are transforming to become stronger. Instead of remaining separate 'light' battalions, they are being integrated into effective and experienced Ground Forces units."
Details:
The Ground Forces consider this a logical step because legionnaires are servicemen of special forces battalions within the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The command also recalled that assault operations and counter-sabotage missions are what the legions' personnel have been doing since the first days of their establishment.
"The integration into other units does not reduce their level but, on the contrary, increases capabilities, provides better protection for servicemen on the battlefield and strengthens support with unmanned systems, artillery and aerial reconnaissance. Foreign units have gained access to the resources and logistics of regular formations," the statement said.
The Ground Forces stressed that combat tasks for the personnel of the international legions remain unchanged and the soldiers continue operating on the relevant axes – in the same areas and under the same conditions.
"The only difference is enhanced support, which significantly increases their combat resilience. Legion servicemen have also gained opportunities for professional development and retraining – as UAV operators, artillerymen, reconnaissance soldiers or specialist military personnel in rear-echelon positions in line with their competencies," the military said.
Background:
There are three combat international legions and one training legion within the Armed Forces of Ukraine. According to Ukrainska Pravda, Legion 1 joined the 475th Assault Regiment Code 9.2 and Legion 2 joined the 253rd Assault Regiment Arei.

Syria says its forces have taken over al-Tanf base
2026-02-12 14:55:13 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/syria-says-its-forces-have-taken-over-al-tanf-base

Syrian government forces
have taken control of a base in the east of the country that was run for years by US troops as part of the war against the Islamic State group, the Defence Ministry said in a statement Thursday.
The
al-Tanf base
sits in a strategic location, close to the borders with Jordan and Iraq. In a terse statement, the Syrian Defence Ministry said the handover of the base took place in coordination with the US military, and Syrian forces are now "securing the base and its perimeters."
The US military did not immediately respond to an email from
The Associated Press
regarding the Syrian statement.
The Syrian Defence Ministry also said that Syrian troops are now in place in the desert area around the al-Tanf garrison, with border guards to deploy in the coming days.
The
United States
on Thursday confirmed its forces have departed the base.
"The orderly departure of US forces from al-Tanf" was completed the previous day, US Central Command (CENTCOM), which is responsible for American forces in the Middle East, said in a statement.
It described the move as being "part of a deliberate and conditions-based transition".
CENTCOM
chief Admiral Brad Cooper insisted that American forces remained ready to respond to threats from the Islamic State group, saying that maintaining pressure on the militants "is essential to protecting the US homeland and strengthening regional security."
The deployment of Syrian troops at al-Tanf and in the surrounding areas comes after last month's deal between the government and the US-backed and Kurdish-led
Syrian Democratic Forces
, or SDF, to merge into the military.
Al-Tanf garrison was repeatedly attacked over the past years with drones by Iran-backed militias, but such attacks have dropped sharply following
the fall
of Bashar Assad's government in Syria in December 2024, when insurgent groups marched into his seat of power in Damascus.
Syria's interim President
Ahmad al-Sharaa
has been expanding his control of the country, and last month, government forces captured wide parts of northeast Syria after deadly clashes with the SDF. A ceasefire was later reached between the two sides.
Al-Tanf base played a major role in the fight against the
Islamic State
group that declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014. IS was defeated in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later.
Over the past weeks, the US military began transferring thousands of
IS prisoners
from prisons run by the SDF in northeastern Syria to Iraq, where they will be prosecuted.
The number of US troops posted in Syria has changed over the years.
The number of US troops increased to more than 2,000 after October 2023, as Iranian-backed militias
targeted
American troops and interests in the region in response to Israel's bombardment of Gaza.
The force has since been reduced to around 900.

2 Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid dock in Cuba as US blockade sparks energy crisis

HAVANA (AP) — Two Mexican Navy ships laden with humanitarian aid docked in
Cuba
on Thursday as a U.S. blockade
deepens the island’s energy crisis
.
The ships arrived two weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump
threatened tariffs
on any country selling or providing oil to Cuba, prompting the island in recent days to ration energy.
The Mexican government has said that one ship is carrying some 536 tons of food including milk, rice, beans, sardines, meat products, cookies, canned tuna, and vegetable oil, as well as personal hygiene items. The second ship is carrying just over 277 tons of powdered milk.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum
has said that while diplomatic maneuvering to resume oil supplies is underway, humanitarian aid would be sent. She said Thursday that as soon as the ships return, “we will send more support of different kinds.”
“We have stated to both the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Embassy in Mexico that Mexico is doing everything possible to foster a dialogue that, within the framework of Cuba’s sovereignty...creates the conditions for peaceful dialogue and ensures that Cuba, without any country imposing sanctions, can receive oil and its derivatives for its daily operations,” she said.
Before Trump’s announcement, the state-owned oil company Petróleos Mexicanos, Pemex, had already suspended crude oil shipments to Cuba in January, although it has not clarified the reasons behind that decision.
Cuba relied heavily on oil shipments from Venezuela that were halted when the U.S. attacked the South American country in early January and arrested its leader.
Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel has called Trump’s threats an “energy blockade” and said it affects transportation, hospitals, schools, tourism and the production of food.
Cuban aviation officials warned airlines earlier this week that there isn’t enough fuel for airplanes to refuel on the island. On Monday,
Air Canada announced
it was suspending flights to Cuba, while other airlines announced delays and layovers in the Dominican Republic before flights continued to Havana. The cuts in fuel are expected to be another blow to Cuba’s
once thriving tourism economy
.
Cuba also has reduced bank hours and suspended cultural events, while fuel distribution companies have said that sales only will be made in dollars and limited to 20 liters (5.28 gallons) per user.
In addition to severe blackouts, Cuban officials note that U.S. sanctions, which increased under Trump’s second term, cost the country more than $7.5 billion between March 2024 and February 2025.

Trump’s defamation lawsuit against the BBC is set to go to trial in 2027, US judge says

2026-02-12T14:32:29Z
LONDON (AP) — A U.S. judge said President Donald Trump’s $10 billion lawsuit against the BBC can go to trial in 2027.
Judge Roy K. Altman of the federal court for the Southern District of Florida rejected an attempt by Britain’s national broadcaster to delay proceedings.
He set a February 2027 trial date.
Trump filed a lawsuit in December over the way the BBC edited a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. The claim seeks $5 billion in damages for defamation and $5 billion for unfair trade practices.
The speech took place before some of Trump’s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.
The BBC had broadcast the documentary — titled “Trump: A Second Chance?” — days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. It spliced together three quotes from two sections of the 2021 speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” Among the parts cut out was a section where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.
The
broadcaster has apologized
to Trump over the edit of the Jan. 6 speech. But the publicly funded BBC rejects claims it defamed him. The furor triggered the resignations of the BBC’s
top executive and its head of news
.
Papers filed last month said the BBC plans to file a motion to dismiss the case on the basis that the court lacks jurisdiction and Trump failed to state a claim.
Ahead of that motion it asked the court to postpone discovery — the pretrial process in which parties must turn over documents and other information — pending a decision on the motion to dismiss. The discovery process could require the BBC to hand over reams of emails and other materials related to its coverage of Trump.
The judge said the motion “is premature” because it’s too early in the legal process for the BBC to request such a stay.

Federal authorities announce an end to the immigration crackdown in Minnesota

MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The immigration crackdown in Minnesota that led to mass detentions, protests and two deaths is coming to an end,
border czar
Tom Homan said Thursday.
Democratic
Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday
that he expected Operation Metro Surge, which started in December, to end in “days, not weeks and months,” based on his conversations with senior Trump administration officials.
“As a result of our efforts here, Minnesota is now less of a sanctuary state for criminals,” Homan said at a news conference.
“I have proposed and President Trump has concurred, that this surge operation conclude,” he continued.
Federal authorities say the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sweeps focused on the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area have led to the arrest of more than 4,000 people. While the Trump administration has called those arrested “dangerous criminal illegal aliens,” many people with no criminal records, including children and U.S. citizens, have also been detained.
“The surge is leaving Minneapolis safer,” Homan said. . “I’ll say it again, it’s less of a sanctuary state for criminals.”
Homan
announced last week
that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 on Minnesota’s streets. Homan said Thursday that the drawdown began this week and will continue next week. He said he plans to stay in Minnesota to oversee the drawdown.
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he had a “positive meeting” with Homan on Monday and discussed the potential for a further drawdown of federal officers.
Homan took over the Minnesota operation in late January after the
second fatal shooting
by federal immigration agents and amid
growing political backlash
and questions about how the operation was being run.
“We’re very much in a trust but verify mode,” Walz said, adding that he expected to hear more from the administration “in the next day or so” about the future of what he said has been an “occupation” and a “retribution campaign” against the state.
Walz said he had no reason not to believe
Homan’s statement last week
that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but the governor added that that still left 2,300 on Minnesota’s streets. Homan at the time cited an “increase in unprecedented collaboration” resulting in the need for fewer federal officers in Minnesota, including help from jails that hold deportable inmates.

Israel to revoke citizenship of citizens convicted of spying for Iran
2026-02-12 14:53:00 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/israel-to-revoke-citizenship-of-citizens-convicted-of-spying-for-iran/

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered legal proceedings to begin to revoke the citizenship of Israelis convicted of
spying for Iran
during the war, in what officials describe as an unprecedented move that will also apply to Jewish Israeli citizens.
The directive, issued with the backing of Attorney-General Gali Baharav-Miara, instructs law enforcement authorities to pursue citizenship revocation once legal proceedings are complete and a final, binding conviction has been handed down for serious espionage offenses carried out on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In a closed-door discussion, Netanyahu said he views espionage activity against Israel with utmost severity, calling it "a fundamental breach of trust."
The issue was raised during a broader debate over revoking the status of terrorists. Representatives of the Attorney-General's Office, the Justice Ministry and the Population and Immigration Authority confirmed to Netanyahu that such a move is legally possible, but only after a final conviction for severe espionage crimes. The prime minister's directive was issued accordingly.
Under Israel's Citizenship Law, citizenship may be revoked from anyone who has committed a breach of loyalty to the State of Israel, including those convicted of espionage or treason. Until now, the clause had primarily been considered for use against Arab Israelis involved in terrorist activity. Extending it to Jewish citizens marks a significant and unprecedented expansion.
Limited practical impact, significant symbolic weight
In practical terms, the consequences of revoking citizenship may be limited. An individual who does not hold another nationality and whose Israeli citizenship is rescinded is still entitled to permanent residency status and may continue living in Israel.
However, the move carries substantial symbolic and civic ramifications. Loss of citizenship affects civil status, including the right to vote, and is likely to carry a lasting public stigma.
Over the past two years, around 40 indictments have been filed against approximately 60 defendants recruited by Iran. Most are ordinary citizens with no prior criminal record.
Last week, a serious indictment was filed against two 20-year-old brothers from Jerusalem who allegedly maintained contact with Iranian intelligence operatives and transferred various security-related information while aware that they were acting under Iranian direction in exchange for payment.
In a position paper submitted by the Shin Bet security agency in one of the espionage cases, the agency described a troubling trend: a marked increase in Iranian efforts to recruit Israeli agents, posing what it called a high level of danger. According to the Shin Bet, the growing number of cases and their emergence as a broader phenomenon indicate that current deterrence measures are insufficient.
Elimelech Stern of Beit Shemesh, one of those arrested on suspicion of spying, denied the charges. Prosecutors were required to prove through digital evidence, documentation of communications and testimony from relevant service personnel that he had been in contact with an agent acting on behalf of a foreign state, carried out assignments at that agent's direction in exchange for payment in digital currencies and even recruited additional Israeli citizens to perform various tasks.
Although the Jerusalem District Attorney's Office sought a seven-year prison sentence, stressing that the offenses were severe and part of a widening national security phenomenon involving Iranian recruitment efforts inside Israel, the court sentenced Stern to three years in prison. Law enforcement officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the leniency of the sentence and are considering an appeal.

a decree published on the official website of the president of Ukraine
Details:
The relevant decree was published on the official online platform of the president of Ukraine.
Today, on 12 February, the Ukrainian Olympian
was disqualified
from competing at the Olympic Games 2026 for failing to comply with the ban on using the
"helmet of remembrance".
Background:
On 9 February, the IOC banned Heraskevych from competing
in a helmet featuring portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed during the war
. The IOC suggested that he wear a black armband as an
alternative
. The Ukrainian athlete responded that in spite of the ban, he planned to compete wearing the helmet.
The situation gained worldwide attention, and Heraskevych received support from many well-known figures, including Olha Kharlan, a Ukrainian sabre fencer, and Volodymyr Klitschko, a Ukrainian boxer. Ukrainian athletes and members of the military have also expressed their support.
The Ukrainian parliament called on the IOC to allow Ukrainian athletes to use symbols honouring the memory of fallen Ukrainian athletes and defenders of Ukraine and to reconsider the participation of Russian and Belarusian athletes in competitions.

Homan announces end to Minnesota immigration enforcement surge
2026-02-12 14:42:43 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/homan-announces-end-to-minnesota-immigration-enforcement-surge-00777990

The Trump administration’s massive immigration enforcement surge throughout Minnesota is coming to a close, White House border czar Tom Homan said during a press conference Thursday.
"I have proposed, and President [Donald] Trump has concurred, that this surge operation conclude,” Homan said, citing arrests of “public safety threats” in coordination with state officials.
A “significant drawdown” in federal immigration agents is already underway, Homan said, and will continue into the next week. But Homan has directed certain officers to remain in strategic areas throughout the state to coordinate with local sheriffs on more arrests.
But while Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is “cautiously optimistic” that “this surge of untrained, aggressive federal agents” will now depart the state, local officials are far from ready to move on from the chaos of the last several weeks.
“The fact of the matter is, they left us with deep damage, generational trauma,” he told reporters Thursday. “They left us with economic ruin in some cases. They left us with many unanswered questions. Where are our children?”
The White House has diminished its presence in Minneapolis amid public outcry after two
federal agents shot and killed 37-year-old Alex Pretti
, a local nurse, during a protest in January.
Protests raged
after video surfaced
that showed Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino had mischaracterized how the shooting unfolded after
first describing Pretti as a would-be domestic terrorist
. And the administration took heat from a surprising source, gun rights groups furious at the assertion that Pretti’s conceal-carry status contributed to his killing.
The
agents were placed on administrative leave
. Bovino was removed from his post overseeing the state operation. And just last week,
Homan announced the White House would shrink
the number of immigration officers in the state by 25 percent.
“Minnesotans stood together, stared down ICE, and never blinked,” Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who
announced her run for governor of the state
in January,
wrote on X on Thursday
.
Homan characterized the White House pullback as evidence that the president had succeeded in his efforts to fight crime and remove violent undocumented people from the state.
And he praised Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, both Democrats, for their collaboration with federal authorities in recent weeks, and for using rhetoric that he said helped deescalate the chaotic clashes between law enforcement and protesters.
“We’ve seen a big change here in the last couple of weeks,” Homan said. “And it’s all good changes.”
Frey celebrated the pullback in a post on X.
“They thought they could break us, but a love for our neighbors and a resolve to endure can outlast an occupation,”
he wrote
. “These patriots of Minneapolis are showing that it’s not just about resistance — standing with our neighbors is deeply American.”
Homan’s Thursday press conference was a major departure from the administration’s longstanding approach to the violence in Minnesota. In the wake of Pretti’s slaying and
law enforcement’s earlier killing of Renee Good
, another protester,
White House officials
blamed Democrats for the escalating violence and heaped pressure on Frey and Walz to stop “spreading lies.” The
Department of Justice subpoenaed
Walz, Frey and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison in January amid a federal investigation into the state’s response to the heightened immigration enforcement.
“This is something that I don't think any state has ever experienced,” Walz said Thursday. “And through that entire time, the dignity, the compassion, the love, the care and the absolute determination to do what was right never wavered amongst Minnesotans.”
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the probe in light of the Minnesota operation’s conclusion.
“This tragedy occurred as a result of a deliberate and hostile resistance by Democrat leaders in Minnesota,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters after Pretti’s death.
Meanwhile in Washington, Ellison and Minnesota corrections chief Paul Schnell defended the state’s practices broadly in testimony to the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. The two officials both rejected claims that the state wasn’t already cooperating with the federal government on immigration enforcement.
“Minnesota honors immigration detainers and has coordinated with federal authorities for many years. Any suggestion that we refuse to cooperate or harbor non-citizens is baseless,” Schnell said.
Schnell also said that the White House’s move to dispatch Homan to Minneapolis was a “positive” move, though he cautioned that issues with coordination between federal and state officials remain.
“Information sharing remains an issue,” Schnell said.
Ellison, for his part, insisted that Minnesota law does not bar local and state law enforcement from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement when there are final orders of removals filed against unauthorized immigrants. He also clarified that local jurisdictions can enter what are called “Section 287(g) agreements” with ICE that mean that unauthorized immigrants police apprehend are immediately turned over to ICE.
“We're not saying that people can't do ‘287(g) agreements.’ We're saying that there is a procedure that they have to follow that involves engaging with their county board. That's all,” Ellison said.

Kyiv combined heating and power plant stops again after new Russian strike, district head proposes alternatives

The combined heating and power plant (CHP Plant-6) in the Troieshchyna neighbourhood in Kyiv has halted again after another Russian strike on 12 February.
Source:
Maksym Bakhmatov, Head of Desnianskyi District State Administration in Kyiv, on
Facebook
Quote:
"Another hit on the CHP plant. Heating in Ukraine's largest district has stopped again. If we don't start thinking now about decentralised heat and power generation, the Desnianskyi district will freeze next year.
Even if we pour billions of hryvnias or maybe even [US] dollars into repairing the destroyed CHP plants, the aggressor state will keep striking them. And the heat [supply] will stop again."
Details:
Bakhmatov said that smaller facilities could improve the situation for Kyiv's left bank.
Quote:
"There are 130 small boiler houses in Kyiv, and they are providing heating right now. That is the right bank. We don't have that.
By 15 September, we must build 100 MW of electricity capacity and 300 MW of heating. Or more.
That volume will definitely give us a chance to get through the next heating season. Without an alternative for electricity and heating, there won't even be a chance in the years ahead."
Background:
Russia once again
attacked
a thermal power plant belonging to DTEK, the largest private energy company in Ukraine, on 12 February.
Nearly 2,600 apartment blocks in the city of Kyiv have been
left without heating
due to a large-scale Russian attack on the night of 11-12 February.
Another 1,100 buildings remain without heating after earlier attacks.
It was reported on 9 February that heating
was partly restored
in one of Kyiv's most affected districts, Troieshchyna.

Israeli rabbi judge who levelled Gaza homes 'breached ethics'
2026-02-12 14:33:22 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/israeli-rabbi-judge-who-levelled-gaza-homes-breached-ethics

An Israeli rabbinical
judge
has been criticised by a state ombudsman for violating "ethical guidelines" during Israel's war on
Gaza
, after bulldozing dozens of homes in the enclave and boasting that Palestinians' bodies were left on the streets to be eaten by feral animals.
Avraham Zarbiv, a judge in the
occupied West Bank
settlement of Ariel, was found to have breached a code of ethics over statements and media appearances in which he advocated the destruction of Gaza.
Live on air, the rabbi once boasted that "there are tens of thousands of dead [Palestinians]" and that "the dogs and the cats ate them because no one collected them".
Israel's war on Gaza has killed at least 71,000 Palestinians, with many more believed to be trapped under the rubble of destroyed apartment blocks and other buildings.
State ombudsman Ahser Kula wrote that "the soldier's uniform does not shed him of the robe of a rabbinic judge, nor of the ethical duties that continue to apply to him even during his military service", according to
Haaretz
.
Zarbiv, who spent hundreds of days on reserve duty in Gaza, shared videos of himself demolishing buildings with an Israeli army D9 bulldozer and appeared on Israel's
Channel 14
, boasting about his actions.
During the interview, Zarbiv was referred to as the Israeli rabbi who 'flattened'
Jabalia
, and said he had destroyed 50 buildings a week.
He also said Palestinians would have nothing to return to and warned against agreeing to a ceasefire deal.
Far-right Israelis have called for Gaza to be destroyed and depopulated, with Jewish settlers moving into the territory.
According to Haaretz, Zarbiv also engaged in political activity outside his reservist duty, including taking part in the pro-settler "Gaza - The Day After" conference.
He was also scheduled to lecture at a yeshiva under the title "To Zarbiv Gaza", though the event was later cancelled.
In January 2025, the Hind Rajab Foundation filed a
legal complaint
with the International Criminal Court calling for his arrest over comments it said violated the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Rome Statute.
"It is imperative that Rabbi Avraham Zarbiv is apprehended and prosecuted without delay," the foundation said at the time, adding, "His actions, and the impunity that often shields perpetrators of such crimes, cannot go unchallenged."

Trump administration to end Minnesota immigration crackdown
2026-02-12 14:32:47 GMT
https://www.axios.com/local/twin-cities/2026/02/12/trump-ice-metro-surge-ends-minneapolis

The Trump administration will end its
immigration crackdown
in the Twin Cities, White House border czar Tom Homan announced Thursday.
Why it matters:
The 10-week surge roiled Minnesota, left two U.S. citizens dead and proved
politically toxic
for the White House.
Driving the news:
Homan said at a Thursday morning news conference that a "significant drawdown" of the roughly 2,000 remaining federal agents is underway and will continue through next week.
"Operation Metro Surge is ending," he said. "In the next week, we're going to deploy the officers here on detail back to their home stations or other areas of the country [that] are needed."
What he's saying:
While local immigration enforcement will continue, Homan said the operation has achieved the "successful results we have came here for," citing over 4,000 arrests and "unprecedented cooperation" from local law enforcement.
"The Twin Cities and Minnesota in general are and will continue to be much safer for the communities here because of what we have accomplished," he said.
Catch up fast:
The White House flooded the state with thousands of agents over the last two months, citing concerns about
alleged fraud in government programs
involving residents of Somali descent.
Backlash from the public and Congress grew following social media videos and news reports documenting racial profiling, alleged civil rights violations and aggressive conduct by agents, including the fatal shootings of
"ICE Watch"
observers
Renee Good
and
Alex Pretti
.
Fallout over the surge and the administration's handling of the shooting investigations
drove over a dozen federal prosecutors
in Minnesota to quit.
In late January, as polls cratered and political pressure grew,
Trump sent Homan
to Minnesota to meet with state and local officials and oversee a drawdown.
What to expect:
Homan said a "small footprint of personnel will remain for a period of time to close out and transition full command and control back to the field office."
He said he has directed federal agents based in Minnesota to be deployed across the state so that jails can transfer inmates without having to hold them beyond their scheduled release date.
That move could address a key friction point for local sheriffs, who say complying with longer detainer requests can expose their agencies to lawsuits.
The intrigue:
Homan claimed that he secured commitments from local law enforcement to transfer undocumented inmates within jails into federal custody and help agents "shut down unlawful agitator activity" impeding their operations, but details of those potential agreements remained unclear Thursday morning.
The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office — which runs the state's largest jail and has a policy against cooperating with ICE — said in a statement that it "does not conduct civil immigration enforcement, and our policies remain unchanged."
Gov. Tim Walz told reporters that "nothing has changed" for the state, which maintains that it already complies with ICE detainer requests.
"My take was they knew they needed to get out of here — but in very Trumpian fashion, they needed to save face," he said.
Between the lines:
Critics continued to raise concerns about ICE's targets and tactics despite Homan's drawdown announcement, citing the presence of agents at or around courthouses, schools and bus stops.
On Wednesday, a pursuit by federal agents resulted in a
multi-car crash
near a busy pedestrian intersection in St. Paul.
What we're watching:
While the crackdown is winding down, local officials say the emotional and economic damage to families,
businesses
and
schools
will be difficult and costly to repair.
"This operation has been catastrophic for our neighbors and businesses, and now it's time for a great comeback," Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said on X.

DOJ fires acting US attorney in NY who was appointed by judges
2026-02-12 14:30:57 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/doj-fires-acting-us-ny-attorney-00777984

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche fired the acting U.S. attorney in the Northern District of New York late Wednesday night, mere hours after he was appointed by a panel of federal judges.
It’s the latest move by the Trump administration to circumvent both the Senate and the courts to install favored prosecutors.
New York-based federal judges picked
longtime lawyer Donald Kinsella
to serve as the new U.S. attorney working in Albany,
tapping into their long-held power
to appoint top prosecutors when an interim U.S. attorney’s term ends.
Blanche, however, announced the administration’s intention to sack Kinsella in a post on X Wednesday night.
“Judges don’t pick U.S. Attorneys, @POTUS does,”
he wrote
. “See Article II of our Constitution. You are fired, Donald Kinsella.”
The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the personnel maneuvers in New York.
In districts across the country, courts have rebuffed the Trump administration’s efforts to install and keep favored prosecutors in U.S. attorney jobs. In New Jersey, Trump loyalist Alina Habba left her post after an appeals court upheld her disqualification. In several other districts, the administration is fighting rulings deeming its U.S. attorney picks illegal.
Kinsella was appointed to replace John Sarcone III, a
Trump loyalist who was disqualified by a judge in January
after the Trump administration used a procedural maneuver to keep him in the job beyond his 120-day term as interim U.S. attorney. Sarcone, who had no apparent prosecutorial experience when he was selected for the post, was leading an investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime Trump foe.
“When the Executive branch of government skirts restraints put in place by Congress and then uses that power to subject political adversaries to criminal investigations, it acts without lawful authority,” said District Judge Lorna Schofield, an Obama appointee,
in her 24-page opinion
.
In disqualifying Sarcone, the judge also quashed two subpoenas to James that had been signed by Sarcone. The Justice Department is appealing Schofield’s decision.

BRUSSELS — Belgian police searched offices of the European Commission on Thursday as part of an investigation into the 2024 sale of several Commission buildings to the Belgian state.
The European Public Prosecutor’s Office (EPPO), an independent body responsible for investigating and prosecuting crimes affecting the EU’s financial interests, is leading the probe.
EPPO confirmed to POLITICO it is conducting “evidence-collecting activities” related to “an ongoing investigation.” The office declined to provide further details, citing the need to protect the integrity of proceedings.
The investigation concerns “the sale of 23 Commission buildings to the Belgian state in 2024,” a Commission spokesperson told POLITICO.
The property sale “followed established procedures and protocols,” the spokesperson said, expressing confidence that the transaction was conducted in compliance with applicable rules.
“The European Commission is committed to transparency and accountability and will cooperate fully with EPPO and the competent Belgian authorities on this issue, providing any information and assistance needed to ensure a thorough and independent investigation into this matter,” the spokesperson added.
According to reporting
first published
by the Financial Times, the searches took place at multiple Commission locations, including the budget department.

WASHINGTON, Feb 12 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's border czar Tom Homan said on Thursday that a significant drawdown of immigration enforcement agents in Minnesota is underway and he has proposed that the surge there should conclude.
Under Operation Metro Surge, Trump had deployed about 3,000 armed immigration agents by the end of January to deport migrants in Minnesota, focused on Minneapolis, its biggest city.
Sign up
here.
"I have proposed and President Trump has concurred that this surge operation conclude," Homan told reporters at a press conference.
A week ago, Homan announced that about 700 immigration agents would be withdrawn. He said on Thursday that many of the remaining agents deployed from other states would be sent home in the coming week, citing in part what he called "unprecedented" coordination with local law enforcement agencies in Minnesota.
The deportation sweeps have been staunchly opposed by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, and other elected officials in the state. The agents, usually dressed in face masks and military-style camouflage gear, have repeatedly drawn angry protests from Minneapolis residents, who have blown whistles and used their cellphones to record video of the agents.

Many social media posts by Tesla CEO on his platform are indiscernible from those of white supremacists, say experts
Elon Musk’s
longtime fixation on a white racial majority is intensifying. The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.
“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.

Grieving families press Congress on aviation safety reforms after midair collision near DC

2026-02-12T05:01:11Z
Key senators and the families of the 67 dead in an
airliner collision with an Army helicopter
near the nation’s capital are convinced that advanced aircraft locator systems recommended by experts for nearly two decades would have prevented last year’s tragedy. But it remains unclear if a bill will pass Congress requiring the systems around busy airports.
The Senate Commerce Committee is planning a hearing Thursday to highlight why the National Transportation Safety Board has been recommending since 2008 that all aircraft be equipped with one system that can broadcast their locations and another one to receive data about the location of other aircraft. Only the system that broadcasts location is currently required. The hearing will review all 50 of the NTSB’s recommendations to prevent another midair collision like that of Jan. 29, 2025.
Everyone aboard the helicopter and the American Airlines jet flying from Wichita, Kansas, including
28 members of the figure skating community
, died when the aircraft collided and plummeted into the icy Potomac River.
The Senate already
unanimously approved the bill
that would require all aircraft flying around busy airports to have both kinds of Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast systems installed. However, leaders of the key House committees seem to want to craft their own comprehensive bill addressing all the NTSB recommendations instead of immediately passing what’s known as
the ROTOR act
. The
ADS-B out systems
continually broadcast an aircraft’s location and speed and have been required since 2020. But ADS-B in systems that can receive those signals and create a display showing pilots were all air traffic is located around them are not standard.
If the American Airlines jet and the helicopter had also been equipped with one of the ADS-B in systems that can receive location data, the NTSB and the victims’ families and key lawmakers say, the pilots may have been able to avoid the collision.
The receiving systems would have provided more warning along with an indication of where the other aircraft was. But for that to work the helicopter’s ADS-B out system that’s supposed to broadcast its location would have to be turned on and working correctly, which wasn’t the case on the night of the crash.
Tragedy could have been prevented
These locator systems are one of the measures that might have been able to overcome all the systemic problems and mistakes the NTSB identified in the disaster. That’s why this requirement was endorsed by NTSB Chairwoman Jennifer Homendy — the only witness called to the hearing — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and all of the Senate.
“This seems like a no-brainer, right? Especially when this is not a new thing that they’re proposing,” said Amy Hunter, whose cousin Peter Livingston died on the flight with his wife and two young daughters.
Afterward, the FAA made
several changes
including prohibiting helicopters from flying along the route where the crash happened whenever a plane is landing on the secondary runway at Reagan National Airport and requiring all aircraft to use their ADS-B out systems to broadcast their locations.
The crash anniversary and NTSB hearing on the causes of the crash have made recent weeks challenging for victims’ families. And now
the Olympics
are reminding Hunter and others that their loved ones — like young Everly and Alydia Livingston — will never have a chance to realize their dreams of competing for a gold medal.
Cost concerns for plane owners
The biggest stumbling block is cost. Upgrading some airline jets might cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, placing an expensive burden on some — especially regional airlines with tighter profit margins like the one that flew the jet that collided with the Army helicopter. Some also worry whether general aviation pilots could afford the upgrades.
But some airlines have already begun to add the technology to their planes, partly because in addition to the safety benefits, the systems can help increase the number of planes that can fly into an airport by spacing them more precisely. American Airlines leads the industry, having added the technology to its Airbus A321s over the past several years, equipping more than 300 of its roughly 1,000 planes to date.
Any plane more than a decade old likely doesn’t have either of these systems installed. Most newer planes have at least an ADS-B out system that broadcasts their location.
But roughly three quarters of the pilots of business jets and smaller single-engine Cessnas and Bonanzas use portable devices that only cost several hundred dollars, made by companies like ForeFlight, that can tap into this location data and display the information about nearby aircraft on an iPad. So it doesn’t appear the legislation would create a significant expense for them.
Tim Lilley, a pilot himself, said having both these locator systems would have saved the life of his son Sam, who was copilot of the airliner, and everyone else who died. He said small plane owners have an affordable option, but even the expensive upgrades to large planes would be worth it.
“If those recommendations had been fully realized, this accident wouldn’t have happened,” Lilley said. “I don’t know what value we put on the human life, but 67 lives would still be here today.”

A pilot scheme in Brooklyn is giving businesses batteries to form an electricity storage network – part of a growing number of innovative DIY energy ideas around the world
In the back of Black Seed Bagels in northern Brooklyn is a giant catering kitchen filled with industrial-size containers of condiments and freezers full of dough. A tall, silver electric oven named the Baconator stands in a far corner, cooking thousands of pounds of meat every week to accompany Black Seed’s hand-rolled, wood-fired bagels. The Baconator is connected to a battery the size of a carry-on suitcase, which is plugged into the wall.
While the morning rush is under way, the 2.8-kilowatt-hour battery can directly power the commercial oven to reduce the company’s reliance on the electric grid, Noah Bernamoff, Black Seed’s co-owner, explained recently at the company’s Bushwick shop. Two more batteries are paired with energy-intensive refrigerators in the front.

Chinese Crypto Scam Fugitive With St. Kitts Passport Owns Dubai Property
2026-02-12 14:19:00 GMT
https://www.occrp.org/en/news/chinese-kittian-crypto-scam-fugitive-owns-dubai-property

Daren Li, a Chinese and Saint Kitts and Nevis national on the run from a 20-year United States prison sentence for his role in a large Cambodia-based cryptocurrency scam operation owns property in Dubai, real estate records show.
Tenancy contract data shows that under his Saint Kitts passport, Li owns a five bedroom residential villa in Wadi Al Safa 7, a gated community in Dubai’s suburbs.
As of last year, this property was leased to a Chinese national, on a contract valid at least up until September 2025, which was generating AED250,000 ($68,000) in annual income for Li. Records also show he had leased it out to another Chinese national the previous year, on a similar contract basis.
Li was
sentenced
in absentia on Monday to 20 years in federal prison by the Central District Court of California for his role in a cryptocurrency investment conspiracy that allegedly laundered more than $73 million stolen from U.S. citizens, said a statement by the U.S. Attorney’s Office.
He pleaded guilty in November 2024 to one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering but is now a fugitive after cutting an electronic monitoring device from his ankle and absconding in December 2025, the U.S. attorney’s office said.
Contacted by email this week after his sentencing, Li wrote to OCCRP that the U.S. verdict was “unjust,” that he had been “deceived and induced to plead guilty,” and that his legal team had filed an appeal. He did not answer OCCRP questions about his property in Dubai.
.In his guilty plea, Li allegedly told U.S. authorities that he and co-conspirators established spoof domains and websites to dupe victims into investing in fraudulent cryptocurrency trading platforms.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office said in his plea he also admitted to laundering the proceeds of these scams by directly depositing the ill-gotten funds into U.S. shell companies which then opened bank accounts and eventually converted the money into cryptocurrencies.
In
announcing
his April 2024 arrest at Atlanta’s international airport, the U.S. Secret Service alleged the money was converted from bank accounts in the Bahamas into the virtual asset USDT, or Tether.
Li is among eight alleged co-conspirators who have pleaded guilty to the scheme. At least three other of his alleged co-conspirators have also been
sentenced
to prison.

Lurie wades in as teachers’ strike roils San Francisco
2026-02-12 14:15:00 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/lurie-wades-in-as-teachers-streak-roils-sf-00777771

SAN FRANCISCO — Mayor Daniel Lurie is inserting himself in tense negotiations between the city’s teachers’ union and district officials amid a strike that will close public schools citywide for a fourth day today.
The mayor drafted former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to join him earlier this week in issuing a statement urging the teachers to postpone their strike, according to a Pelosi ally granted anonymity to discuss private conversations.
While the union rejected their request, the mayor has had several follow-up phone calls with Pelosi in recent days to strategize how to end the city’s first school strike in almost 50 years, affecting nearly 50,000 students.
That outreach illustrates the significance of the strike to Lurie — which, if it drags on, could present one of the biggest tests of his young mayorship. Lurie, an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune who ran for office as a political outsider, has few longtime ties with labor and now most make inroads with one of the liberal city’s largest and most powerful unions.
“He’s bringing out the big guns,” said a Lurie adviser who was also granted anonymity to speak freely. “One of his superpowers is getting people into a room.”
Lurie has dispatched his top advisers to sit at the negotiating table full time, including Staci Slaughter, his chief of staff and former vice president of the San Francisco Giants, and Kunal Modi, a former McKinsey partner who now oversees the city’s homelessness and health services.
Lurie also recruited consultant Steve Kawa to help guide the negotiations, a power move given Kawa was previously chief of staff to former mayors Gavin Newsom and Ed Lee and a top aide to Willie Brown.
Lurie took the rare step Tuesday night of visiting the bargaining room himself and spoke with union and district leaders for about two hours. The mayor’s allies said he’s implored both sides with a simple message: Do not stop talking until a deal is done — even if it means staying at the bargaining table all night.
Keeping the union and district talking has been a central sticking point four days into a strike led by the United Educators of San Francisco.
District officials have repeatedly accused union representatives of walking away from negotiation sessions early. Their statewide union, the California Teachers Association, has mounted a coordinated campaign in school districts across the state to align their contract expiration dates in order to threaten a wave of mass strikes.
The Lurie adviser said the mayor has avoided wading into recriminations from either side, instead focusing on keeping the talks going for as long as possible.
He has experience in this arena. Last fall, the mayor and a few billionaires with ties to the city convinced Trump to
back off his plan
to “surge” federal immigration agents into San Francisco. In the weeks before Lurie took office in early 2025, he also brokered an end to the city’s longest hotel workers strike in recent history.

Switzerland May Abandon Patriot Purchase — Why?

https://militarnyi.com/en/news/switzerland-abandon-patriot-purchase-why/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=switzerland-abandon-patriot-purchase-why

Switzerland may reconsider its choice of air defense system in favor of the French SAMP/T or the Israeli Arrow due to supply issues with American Patriot systems.
NZZ
reported on this.
Swiss officials are not confident that the delivery schedule for American systems will be met by 2028. The reason cited is the Donald Trump administration’s announcement last July that it would prioritize Patriot deliveries to countries that transfer these systems to Ukraine.
Moreover, Bern has not received any updates from Washington regarding its order for a long time, resulting in a suspension of payments.
At the same time, ArmaSuisse — the Federal Office of Armament — assures that “negotiations are ongoing.” Switzerland expects to receive a “roadmap” by the end of March.

If no progress is made, the possibility of turning to other suppliers, particularly European or Israeli ones, cannot be ruled out.
Colonel Dominique Riener, president of the Pro Militia association of current and former military personnel, said that Switzerland is no longer a priority for the US.
According to him, one option is the Israeli Arrow missile. Another option being discussed among politicians responsible for security policy is the French SAMP/T system.
Even conservative security policymakers no longer rule out the possibility that Switzerland may need to pursue alternative solutions.

Additional difficulties may arise due to potential increases in system costs. A similar situation has already
occurred
with the F-35 fighter jets.
In December, it was announced that the country was considering reducing its order for 36 Lockheed Martin F-35A fifth-generation fighter jets due to an approximately $610 million increase in the contract value.
The Swiss Federal Department of Defense, Civil Protection, and Sports stated that, given the projected additional costs, maintaining the originally planned number of aircraft is financially unfeasible.
At the same time, it is emphasized that the “maximum” number of fighters will be purchased within the approved budget of 6 billion Swiss francs (approximately $7.5 billion).

Britain’s care system promotes modern slavery. A genuinely humane government would reform it | Andrea Egan
2026-02-12 14:10:44 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/12/britain-care-system-promotes-modern-slavery-reform

New proposals that would force poorly paid migrant workers to wait longer for earned settlement are nothing more than an assault on working-class people
Andrea Egan is the general secretary of Unison
Billionaires and politicians fan the flames of hate, but without migrant workers, Britain would grind to a halt. That’s especially true when it comes to health and social care:
more than a fifth
of the NHS workforce is made up of migrant staff. The same proportion of care workers nationally are migrants, rising to
half
in London
.
Yet these workers, many of whom are members of Unison, have increasingly become a punchbag for politicians. In particular, they have become a scapegoat for this Labour government, which has sunk to a new low with its proposals on
earned settlement
. These changes could see low-paid public sector workers, including carers, forced to wait
15 years
before being granted indefinite leave to remain, instead of the five years they were promised before they made the decision to come here. These changes would entrench and worsen the environment of fear and exploitation that defines the current system.

Mindich said his sister had no ties to Russia. Investigators found her in a Putin general’s flat
2026-02-12 14:09:00 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/mindich-sister-moscow-putin-general-apartment/

While
Zelenskyy’s
former business partner allegedly ran a $100 million kickback scheme inside Ukraine’s nuclear energy company, his sister was living in the Moscow apartment of a Russian general who spent his career building things for Russia’s Defense Ministry and managing property for
Vladimir Putin
.
The flat belongs to Yelena Abroskina, wife of General Nikolay Abroskin, who served as director of the Federal Agency for Special Construction.
That is the finding of a
joint investigation by Slidstvo.Info and Dnipro.media
, which traced
Liubov Mindich
—sister of fugitive businessman
Tymur Mindich
—to an apartment on Malaya Bronnaya Street near Moscow’s exclusive Patriarch’s Ponds neighborhood.
The flat belongs to
Yelena Abroskina
, wife of General
Nikolay Abroskin
, who served as director of the Federal Agency for Special Construction under Russia’s Defense Ministry from 2004 to 2011, then as first deputy to the Manager of Affairs of the President of Russia from 2015 to 2020.
The complicating connection
Tymur Mindich co-owns Kvartal-95, the comedy studio behind
Servant of the People
—the TV show that made Zelenskyy a household name and launched his presidential campaign. NABU
accuses Mindich
of orchestrating a kickback scheme at state nuclear operator Energoatom that cost Ukraine an estimated $100 million.
Mindich fled Ukraine hours before NABU raids and was later tracked down in Israel.
The scandal
forced the resignations
of Justice Minister
Herman Halushchenko
and Energy Minister
Svitlana Grynchuk
, then brought down chief of staff
Andriy Yermak
.
Zelenskyy imposed sanctions
on his own former associate. Mindich fled Ukraine hours before NABU raids and was later
tracked down in Israel
, where he refused to return.
The corruption charges showed stolen money. The Moscow apartment shows where the family sat while the money was stolen—inside Russia’s presidential infrastructure, throughout the full-scale war.

Zelenskyy tried to kill NABU. Then it exposed his friend’s $100M scheme.
In a general’s flat since Russia seized Crimea
Liubov Mindich had been ordering deliveries from Moscow’s TsUM department store to the Malaya Bronnaya address since at least 2014—the year Russia annexed Crimea and launched its war in the Donbas. Russian medical service profiles still listed the same apartment as her residence in 2024.
Mindich’s sister was mentioned in connection with a planned $6 million house purchase in Switzerland.
Her husband appears to be Russian businessman
Andrey Zhuravlyov
, with whom she has three children—all Russian citizens, according to the investigation. Zhuravlyov has business ties to the Region group of companies, which cooperates with Russian oil giants Rosneft and Tyumenneftegaz.
Liubov Mindich confirmed she remained in contact with her brother.
In
NABU recordings released in November
, Mindich’s sister was mentioned in connection with a planned $6 million house purchase in Switzerland, with the money to be transferred in two installments.
When Slidstvo.Info journalists asked Liubov Mindich about the Swiss property in November 2025, she confirmed she remained in contact with her brother but said she was “not prepared to discuss” the purchase.
The lie, not the ties
Having Russian family connections is not a crime. Ukraine’s own Commander-in-Chief,
Oleksandr Syrskyi
, was born in Vladimir Oblast, Russia; his parents and brother still live there. What matters in the Mindich case is the concealment.
Tymur Mindich
told Slidstvo.Info journalists
that his sister “has no property in Russia and does not conduct any activity there.” Delivery records, medical registrations, and property ownership documents say otherwise—and if this was hidden, the question is what else was. And why.

Another drone on Turkey's beaches. A new Black Sea phenomenon?
2026-02-12 14:08:31 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/another-drone-turkeys-beaches-new-black-sea-phenomenon

Turkish authorities
have recovered an unmanned aerial vehicle washed up on shore on the Black Sea coast, the latest in a series of drone-related incidents along Turkey's northern shoreline.
Turkey's defence ministry said on Thursday that a drone found on a beach in the Unye district of Ordu province on Tuesday did not contain explosives and is
believed to be of Russian origin.
In its weekly press briefing, ministry spokesperson Zeki Akturk said a special forces team was dispatched to the area on Wednesday.
The drone was later handed over to local security authorities for further examination.
The official statement contradicts earlier local media reports, which had described the aircraft as an Iranian-made "suicide drone" found by fishermen and suggested it could pose an explosive risk.
According to Turkish daily
Sabah
, fishermen first spotted the object a day earlier and alerted authorities.
Police, gendarmerie and coast guard units secured the area, temporarily closing the coastal highway in both directions due to fears it could contain explosive material.
Specialist explosive disposal teams and Turkish special operations forces were flown in from Istanbul to inspect the debris and see how the drone ended up on a Turkish shore.
The discovery adds to a growing number of suspicious objects found along Turkey's Black Sea coastline in recent months, with fishermen netting sea mines and maritime drones believed to be linked to the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.
The Black Sea has seen repeated incidents involving Russian and Ukrainian naval assets, including attacks on vessels linked to Moscow's so-called "shadow fleet".
In September and October 2025, unmanned sea drones were found off the coast of Trabzon and later near Artvin's Hopa district, with Turkish naval teams rushing to the scene over fears they contained explosives.
In late December, a sea mine believed to be of Russian origin washed up on the Agva shore and was destroyed by security forces.
Separate incidents have also been recorded further west, where in December, two crashed drones were discovered near Istanbul and Balıkesir, with one identified as a Russian-made Orlan-10.

The Six Republicans Who Broke With Trump to Overturn His Canada Tariffs
2026-02-12 14:08:14 GMT
https://time.com/7377952/republicans-break-with-trump-to-overturn-canada-tariffs/

Six House Republicans
broke ranks with President Donald Trump
by voting with the Democrats to pass a resolution to repeal his tariffs on Canada.
In a move that rebelled against what House GOP leaders fought for, the dissenting Republicans  joined all but one Democrat (
Jared Golden
of Maine) in voting for the joint resolution put forward by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York. The motion aims to block the
President from using
the National Emergencies Act to impose levies against Canada.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Meeks had urged his colleagues across the aisle to vote in support of his resolution on Wednesday, presenting it as a simple decision that would “lower the cost of living for American families.”
“Will you keep prices high out of loyalty to Donald Trump?”
he queried
. “For over 50 years, emergency authorities have been declared for civil wars, pandemics, or massive human rights crises. Canada is none of those things.”
Trump warned against any dissent from within his party as the vote was coming to a close.
“Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against tariffs will seriously suffer the consequences come election time, and that includes primaries,”
he said.
“Tariffs have given us economic and national security, and no Republican should be responsible for destroying this privilege.”
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said he was “disappointed” by the outcome of the vote, calling it a “fruitless” and “pointless” exercise.
“Trump has veto power, and there’s not a two-thirds majority in both chambers to override the veto, so it’s not going to change the policy,” he argued.
Three of the Republicans who voted with the Democrats—Don Bacon of Nebraska, Kevin Kiley of California, and Thomas Massie of Kentucky (who often clashes with the President)—had already rebuked Trump’s tariff policy on Tuesday, after
voting against a resolution
that would have prevented both the House and Senate from terminating the President’s use of national emergencies until July.
Section 202
of the National Emergencies Act allows a joint resolution to be entered at any time in either chamber for this purpose.
Trump has often used tariffs as a threat against countries around the world during his second term. These economic charges have formed a key, albeit contentious, part of his economic and foreign policy.
The Trump Administration is currently involved in an ongoing legal battle as it fights to maintain the validity of various charges. A federal appeals court ruled in August that many of Trump’s sweeping tariffs were unlawful. In response, the Trump Administration asked the Supreme Court to overturn the lower court decision.
Trump urged the Supreme Court to make its decision swiftly, calling it a matter of “life or death”  for the country. But a ruling has yet to be made.
The resolution related to tariffs on Canada will now head to the Senate, where
four Republicans
—Sen. Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska—joined Democrats last October in a similar
joint resolution
terminating the national emergency declared to impose global tariffs. However, per Johnson’s remarks, Trump is expected to veto this latest resolution, leaving the tariff policy in place.
With tariffs causing a fracture within Trump’s own party, here are the six Republicans who broke ranks to rebuke the charges against Canada.
Rep. Jeff Hurd of Colorado
Jeff Hurd’s break from party lines was prompted by concerns over Congress’ ability to regulate tariffs, he explained.
“Congress has delegated limited authority to the Executive Branch, particularly in matters involving national emergencies. But those delegations were never intended to serve as a permanent vehicle for sweeping, long-term trade policy,”
said Hurd
after the vote. “If we normalize broad emergency trade powers today, we should expect that a future president—of either party—will rely on the same authority in ways many of us would strongly oppose.”
The Colorado lawmaker also relayed the concerns of his constituents in Colorado, describing how tariffs impact agricultural producers, supply chains, and steel production.
“When trade policy becomes unpredictable, it affects payrolls, investment decisions, and long-term planning,” he said. “My obligation is to defend both my district and the constitutional framework that protects us over the long term. This is not a partisan calculation; it is an economic and institutional one.”
Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington
Dan Newhouse echoed complaints over the economic impact his voters could incur over tariffs on Canada.
“Washington State’s economy is heavily intertwined with that of our neighbors to the North,”
said Newhouse
in a statement following the vote, highlighting that Canada is a major trading partner of the U.S.
“Our agricultural producers’ input and equipment prices have continued to climb, and Canada’s reciprocal tariffs and actions have harmed our state’s beer, wine, and spirits industry,” he added.
Newhouse also pointed towards the constitutional powers of Congress as part of his decision.
“Equally important is the fact that Congress should not tie its own hands on our Constitutional authority to levy tariffs,” he argued. “While I understand the President’s approach to utilize tariffs as leverage to secure more trade deals, the fact of the matter remains: the tariffs on Canada have harmed Washingtonians.”
Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska
In a statement issued to TIME the day after the vote, Don Bacon offered insight on his decision by pointing to the importance of the U.S.-Canada alliance.
“We have a trade agreement that President Trump negotiated, and Canada has complied with it. The United States and Canada are close allies with a strong and equitable trade and services relationship, and we should be working to build on that partnership, not undermine it,” he said.
Bacon, who recently criticized Trump’s efforts to
acquire Greenland
, had strongly criticized tariffs earlier in the week.
“As an old fashioned Conservative, I know tariffs are a tax on American consumers. I know some disagree, but this debate and vote should occur in the House,” he said via social media,
arguing
that “real conservatives oppose tariffs.”
Rep. Kevin Kiley of California
Kevin Kiley has not publicly commented on his Wednesday decision, but the California lawmaker was key in voting against the temporary block on the House’s ability to enact such termination.
“This was an attempt from the House leadership to take power away from members… that was a big problem for me,”
Kiley told CBS news
after the initial vote on Tuesday. “This is also authority that the House of Representatives has under Article 1 of our constitution, and I think it’s important in our system of checks and balances that we protect the powers that belong to our branch of government.”
Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky
Thomas Massie, another Republican lawmaker who has longstanding disagreements with the Trump Administration, voiced his support for Congressional approval when raising tariffs.
Responding to a post that said “Congressional approval should be required to raise tariffs,” he
argued
: “The Constitution requires it.”
The lawmaker also defended his decision to vote against Tuesday’s bill to block terminations from either chamber. “My goal is to defend the Constitution and to represent the people. Taxing authority is vested in the House of Representatives, not the Executive,”
he said
.
Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania
Brian Fitzpatrick has often shown support for bipartisan legislation in the House.
Prior to voting with the Democrats on Wednesday, he has favored joint party measures against
congressional stock trading
, as well as a
push to extend
healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.

NATO planning worlds largest drone fleet to guard Baltic
2026-02-12 14:05:20 GMT
https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/nato-planning-worlds-largest-drone-fleet-to-guard-baltic/

NATO is moving to expand the use of unmanned systems in the Baltic Sea, after senior Alliance officials described the deployment of a large drone fleet in 2025 as a major proof of concept for rapidly fielding commercially available technology to protect critical undersea infrastructure.
The next phase of the initiative, Task Force X Baltic, will be formalised through a new letter of intent signed by eight participating Allies, with NATO arguing the programme represents a practical shift from innovation testing towards real operational adoption.
Speaking at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Nikolaos Loutas, Director in NATO’s Defence Industry, Innovation and Armaments Division, told myself and other journalists that the effort is tied directly to the Alliance’s wider post-2025 Summit drive to accelerate the pace of technology integration.
“At the 2025 NATO Summit, Allied governments agreed a substantial increase in our defence spending to deliver on a new ambitious set of defence targets,”
he said, adding that they also endorsed
“a rapid adoption action plan to accelerate the pace of technology adoption to deliver on those targets.”
He described the action plan as a mechanism to embed innovation into defence planning, aimed at addressing what he called the urgent operational need for effective new technology.
“The action plan mainstreams NATO’s innovation efforts into defence planning and capability development to address our Armed Forces’ urgent need for innovative and effective technological products,”
Loutas said.
He said Allies had committed to measures designed to accelerate procurement and integration, including shared best practice, new adoption pathways, and greater experimentation to reduce risk for new products.
“They committed to de-risk new products through providing more testing and experimentation opportunities to innovators,”
he said, pointing to Task Force X Baltic as one of the practical mechanisms enabling this. Loutas said the initiative is now reaching a significant milestone, with NATO preparing to launch the second phase.
“One measure in this direction is the Task Force X framework, which is reaching a second milestone today, a very important one, with the signing of a letter of intent for the second phase of Task Force X Baltic,”
he told reporters.
Loutas said the first phase of Task Force X Baltic was launched in support of NATO’s Baltic Sentry activity in 2025 and was intended to show that Allied forces could integrate new technology at speed alongside conventional capabilities.
“Task Force X supports Allies rapidly acquiring, integrating and deploying new technological products alongside our conventional forces,”
he said. He added that the project demonstrated how close collaboration between militaries and industry could deliver persistent surveillance at scale, covering multiple domains.
“The first phase of Task Force X Baltic demonstrated that allied navies and army forces, when collaborating closely with industry, can deliver persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance from sea floor to space at speed, at scale and more affordably,”
he said. NATO officials said the second phase will see eight Allies reaffirm cooperation on rapidly acquiring technology-enabled, multi-domain capabilities for naval operations: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden.
“At today’s signing ceremony… eight participating Allies… reaffirmed their readiness to cooperate on rapidly acquiring new technology enabled multi domain capabilities for naval operations,”
Loutas said, adding that the work supports NATO’s broader Digital Ocean concept endorsed by Defence Ministers.
“This will contribute to the implementation of the Digital Ocean vision,”
he said.
Alongside Task Force X Baltic, Loutas said several other multinational initiatives were progressing, including cooperation on military airworthiness in crisis or conflict, ballistic missile defence capability development, a deep precision strike initiative involving drone technology, and Sweden’s entry into an existing NATO air mission memorandum.
“All these initiatives demonstrate concrete actions taken by Allies to meet their capability targets,”
he said, framing them as part of the Alliance’s wider effort to strengthen deterrence and defence. He added that Task Force X Baltic in particular is intended to translate experimentation into deployment, with a focus on rapid acquisition of commercial systems and real-world testing in operational conditions.
“We will see commercially available drones and systems be acquired quickly and deployed in operational conditions in the Baltic Sea,”
he said.
“By integrating those innovative solutions alongside our conventional forces Allies will be able to test real time interoperability and command and control integration,”
with lessons then captured in a playbook that can be scaled.
“Lessons learned… will be summarised [in] a playbook which will allow NATO to scale and quickly establish further Task Force instantiations in the future,”
he said.
NATO’s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, Admiral Pierre Vandier, linked the origins of Task Force X Baltic directly to the cable-cutting incidents in the region, saying NATO seized the moment to demonstrate rapid response and capability deployment.
“Remember, in December one year ago, we got the cables that were cut in the Baltic,”
he said.
“I seized the opportunity [to] demonstrate that NATO was able to take that into account, and probably more rapidly than [people expected].”
Vandier said the first vessels deployed quickly, with NATO able to show the presence of an unmanned fleet within a month.
“The first two ships that were able to sail… was only 30 days after the cables were cut,”
he said. He added that the effort expanded sharply in the following weeks, reaching 50 boats before the NATO Summit.
“During the following month, we demonstrate that we were able to operate a fleet of 50 boats before the summit,”
Vandier said, claiming the United States later increased the size of the force by providing additional platforms.
“The US… provided 20 boats more,”
he said.
Vandier described the activity as unprecedented in scale, stating:
“We have operated during one month the biggest unmanned fleet… on this earth.”
He said the aim now is to move beyond experimentation and into multinational adoption, arguing that NATO is pushing towards a new era of integrated operations between traditional platforms and unmanned systems.
“Now we are in a state where… we have the nations to adopt,”
he said.
“We are on the way to make nations cooperate on this and open a new era of cohabitation between legacy platforms and unmanned platforms.”
According to Vandier, such integration would increase operational dilemmas for adversaries, while also improving cost efficiency.
“[It] will create more dilemmas for the enemy… and a better use of the money,”
he said.
The Admiral repeatedly framed the case for unmanned systems as a response to both mass and affordability problems, contrasting the cost of major surface combatants with the need for persistent presence and surveillance.
“When you just look at… a frigate… [the] price per day at sea is 5 million,”
he said.
“It’s something you can’t afford.”
He linked this to broader lessons from Ukraine, arguing that the challenge of countering mass drone threats has forced militaries to think differently about sustainable capability.
“As we see… where we need to… kill these drones with affordable munitions, it’s exactly the same with [unmanned surface vessels],”
he said, describing them as a way to apply technology to achieve effects that would otherwise require prohibitively expensive force structures.
When asked how NATO intends to prevent further cable sabotage, Vandier acknowledged that physical prevention is difficult but argued that persistent surveillance and attribution are achievable through sensor networks and unmanned monitoring.
“You can’t prevent a ship to drag its anchors on the sea bed and cutting the legs,”
he said.
“But today… we have sensors that hear the heat of the anchor on the sea bed.”
He said such systems can detect the act of dragging and identify responsible vessels.
“You hear the drag, and then, with persistence, surveillance fixed, you can identify who is the ship which is trying to do that,”
he said, comparing it to criminal deterrence through monitoring.
“It’s exactly as robbers… if you have video surveillance in your city, you will get them caught,”
Vandier said.
Pressed on how large a future unmanned fleet could become, Vandier said size decisions would remain with participating nations, depending on funding and contract structures.
“The size of the fleet is nations’ business,”
he said.
“It depends on the money and the type of contract.”
However, he suggested that if Baltic states each fielded around 20 platforms, the region could see a fleet approaching 100 unmanned vessels, which he argued would be sufficient for monitoring the Baltic Sea.
“If each of the Baltic country has… 20 ships, we’ll see a fleet of less than 100 which is worth enough to monitor the Baltic Sea and for a very limited amount of money,”
he said.
A key theme of the briefing was the exploration of new procurement and support models, including leasing or hiring platforms rather than traditional ownership. Vandier said NATO’s early work demonstrated that commercial capability could be brought into service rapidly through such approaches, with multiple companies offering solutions.
“We demonstrate that we were able to hire something,”
he said.
“You have today a bunch of companies… you have some US, you have some French, you have some Danish, you have a lot of offers.”
Loutas reinforced that Task Force X is partly intended to explore how defence acquisition must adapt to rapidly evolving systems that blur the line between hardware and software.
“It’s also an important exercise for us to understand and explore different ways of developing capabilities,”
he said.
“In some cases, might make sense to acquire. In other case might make sense to lease,”
he added, arguing that the Alliance must understand which business models deliver the best results under modern conditions.
Vandier warned that rapid technological change means long-term procurement assumptions are increasingly risky, particularly as artificial intelligence, miniaturisation and commercial communications technologies drive fast obsolescence cycles.
“The speed of obsolescence is very, very high,”
he said.
“If you think that you will buy a ship that will be in your inventory for the next 10 years, you are making a great mistake.”
He argued that future fleets will need regular refresh cycles for sensors, command-and-control and effectors.
“Each year… two years, you will have to refresh your C2, your effectors, [your] sensors,”
he said. Vandier also indicated that while ISR is a core requirement, some tested systems may have additional roles, including interception.
“Some of the… [systems] we tested are also interceptors,”
he said.
“They can be weaponised.”
The briefing also suggested NATO is already considering how the Task Force X model could be expanded beyond the Baltic. Asked whether it could be duplicated for Arctic Sentry or Eastern Sentry operations, Vandier said a project is already under way to replicate the approach in the Arctic environment.
“We’ve launched… [a] project… replicating this in the weather conditions… of the Arctic,”
he said, noting that cold temperatures, battery limitations and rough seas present distinct challenges.
He said similar work is also being pursued in support of Eastern Sentry.
“We also launched something similar for Eastern Sentry,”
Vandier said, adding that the first operational exercise in that context had already taken place in Finland last year. Looking ahead, he said NATO’s transformation command plans a large-scale exercise in Romania intended to test emerging counter-drone concepts, with Ukraine involved to assess outcomes.
The Alliance sees unmanned systems as a central tool for achieving mass, persistence and affordability in contested maritime environments. With the second phase of Task Force X Baltic now being formalised, NATO is positioning the programme as a template for wider adoption, with lessons from the Baltic cable incidents driving a push to embed commercial unmanned capability into NATO capability.

NATO defence ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss Ukraine’s defence amid almost four years of war with Russia and to strengthen security in Greenland and the Arctic. Dafyyd Townley, Teaching Fellow in US politics and international security at the University of Portsmouth, notes Russia’s long-term strategy aims to demoralise Ukraine through strikes on energy infrastructure, while the US is pressuring Ukraine on potential deals, exposing fractures within NATO. Still, the “coalition of the willing” is helping fill gaps left by the US, and the alliance is showing a tangible commitment to strategic regions like the Arctic.

Minister Of Health Proposes New National Action Plan On Obesity

https://grapevine.is/news/2026/02/12/minister-of-health-proposes-new-national-action-plan-on-obesity/

The Minister of Health, Alma Möller, has opened a parliamentary proposal on measures to tackle obesity for public consultation via the government’s consultation portal. One of the stated aims is that childhood obesity in Iceland should no longer be the highest among the Nordic countries,
reports RÚV
.
The proposal sets out setting out a five-year action plan to address obesity nationwide.
One goal is to strengthen prevention efforts and reduce the incidence and progression of obesity, particularly among young people. This includes working to counter negative attitudes and stigma.
The plan also aims to ensure that obesity among children is no longer the most prevalent in the Nordic countries, to treat obesity in the same way as other chronic illnesses, and to offer a range of professional treatment options.
The explanatory memorandum accompanying the proposal states that 59 percent of Icelanders are overweight or obese, as are 26 percent of children. Of these, 22 percent of adults and 7 percent of children are classified as obese. The prevalence of obesity is described as one of the greatest public health challenges of our time, with case numbers having risen rapidly in recent decades.
The government’s proposed future vision includes:
Strengthening preventive measures, with a focus on reducing new cases of obesity and preventing the development of severe obesity, particularly among young people, alongside efforts to counter negative attitudes and stigma.
Reducing childhood obesity so that rates in Iceland are no longer the highest in the Nordic region.
Treating obesity in the same way as other chronic illnesses, including structured assessment, formal diagnosis, and access to long-term, evidence-based treatment and rehabilitation.
Ensuring access to a wide range of professional treatment options for those requiring healthcare support for the condition.

More Than 100 Patients Treated In Space Meant For 36 At Landspítali Emergency Room
2026-02-12 13:54:06 GMT
https://grapevine.is/news/2026/02/12/more-than-100-patients-treated-in-space-meant-for-36-at-landspitali-emergency-room/

Staff at Landspítali’s emergency department in Fossvogur say conditions have reached a critical point, with more than 100 patients regularly being treated in facilities designed for just 36. In a resolution adopted at a meeting of 180 staff members yesterday, workers warned that overcrowding, understaffing, and inadequate facilities pose a serious and ongoing threat to the safety of both patients and employees,
reports RÚV
.
The meeting was convened by the chairs of the Icelandic Medical Association, Efling (the trade union), the Icelandic Association of Ambulance Personnel, Sameyki (public sector union), and the Icelandic Nurses’ Association. The state of the emergency department was described as worse than ever before.
According to the resolution adopted at the meeting, Alma Möller, former Director of Health, now Minister of Health, confirmed in a memo in June 2022 that the emergency department did not meet professional standards due to overcrowding, excessive numbers of patients, and understaffing. As a result, it was not possible to guarantee patient safety or the quality of care. The resolution also refers to Alma Möller’s statement that, in reality, the correct course of action would be to close the department — though this was not a realistic option, as it is the only one of its kind in the country.
“These serious statements by the Director of Health were ignored. Since then, the situation has not improved, but worsened,” the resolution states.
It adds that, on average, more than 100 patients are accommodated in facilities designed for 36.
“Isolation is impossible, the safety of agitated or unstable patients cannot be ensured, and oxygen cylinders and other equipment are stacked in the corridors of the emergency department like firewood, creating an obvious fire and explosion hazard. This constitutes a serious safety risk for staff and patients, and with this number of patients, working conditions for staff are completely unacceptable,” the resolution further states.
For a long time, the emergency department has been caring for inpatients who should already have been transferred to appropriate wards. It is not the role of the emergency department to operate a de facto double ward on top of emergency services. “This paralyses the emergency department’s response capacity and prevents staff from having the space and calm required to carry out their legally mandated duties in receiving and treating the injured and acutely ill.”
Staff are therefore forced to work in conditions that go against their professional knowledge and recognised standards of good and safe healthcare. “Staff and patients are placed in situations where the risk of infection, accidents, violence, and serious consequences is clear and ongoing,” the resolution states.
An outbreak in December, when eight staff members in the department were diagnosed with tuberculosis, underlines the consequences of inadequate infection control and facilities that do not comply with laws and regulations.
The meeting participants put forward several demands in the resolution: that the workplace comply with laws on health, safety, and working conditions, and that immediate action be taken, as a persistent and worsening state of emergency is in place. This situation must be addressed without delay.
They further demand that the authorities with statutory responsibility respond immediately and follow up on previous comments, assessments, and committee findings:
The Office of the Director of Health must firmly follow up on required improvements following its assessment of the department’s conditions.
The Administration of Occupational Safety and Health must conduct a comprehensive inspection of staff working conditions and respond to violations of occupational safety legislation.
The Environmental Health Authority must assess conditions with regard to hygiene and infection control.
Fire safety authorities must follow up on their assessment of fire hazards related to oxygen equipment and overcrowding.
The Data Protection Authority must examine conditions with regard to privacy and the protection of patients.
Health authorities must conduct an assessment of patient harm and mortality in relation to length of stay in the emergency department.
“The safety of patients and staff must no longer be treated as an acceptable sacrifice. It is wholly unacceptable that these conditions have been allowed to persist for years despite repeated warnings. Instead of promises, we demand concrete improvements. Those responsible for governance and oversight in the healthcare system must assume responsibility and exercise their authority immediately,” the resolution concludes.

Ukraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych out of Winter Olympics over banned helmet honoring war dead

2026-02-12T05:01:06Z
CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych, a likely medal contender at the
Milan Cortina Games
, was barred from racing Thursday after refusing a last-minute plea from the International Olympic Committee to not use a helmet that
honors more than 20 athletes and coaches
killed in his country’s war with Russia.
The decision came roughly 45 minutes before the start of the competition and ended a three-day saga where Heraskevych knew he was risking being pulled from the Games by wearing
the helmet
, one that the IOC says breaks rules against making statements on the field of play.
The International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation said his decision to wear the helmet was “inconsistent with the Olympic Charter and Guidelines on Athlete Expression.” He wore the helmet in training, but the IOC asked for him to wear a different helmet in races. It offered concessions, such as wearing a black armband or letting him display the helmet once he was off the ice.

“I believe, deeply, the IBSF and IOC understand that I’m not violating any rules,” Heraskevych said. “Also, I would say (it’s) painful that it really looks like discrimination because many athletes already were expressing themselves. ... They didn’t face the same things. So, suddenly, just the Ukrainian athlete in this Olympic Games will be disqualified for the helmet.”
IOC President Kirsty Coventry, who was slated to be in Cortina d’Ampezzo to see Alpine skiing, went to the sliding center instead to meet Heraskevych. She was waiting at the top of the track when he arrived around 8:15 a.m., and they met privately. After about 10 minutes, Coventry was unable to change Heraskevych’s mind.
“We didn’t find common ground in this regard,” Heraskevych said.
Tears rolled down Coventry’s face after the meeting. The Olympic champion swimmer made clear that she wanted a different outcome, and the IOC said the decision was made with regret.
In photos: Ukraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych out of Winter Olympics over banned helmet tribute
Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych is out of the Milan Cortina Games after he refused to stop wearing a banned tribute helmet. This is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.
“As you’ve all seen over the last few days, we’ve allowed for Vladyslav to use his helmet in training,” Coventry said. “No one, no one — especially me — is disagreeing with the messaging. The messaging is a powerful message. It’s a message of remembrance. It’s a message of memory and no one is disagreeing with that. The challenge that we are facing is that we wanted to ask or come up with a solution for just the field of play.”
Coventry and Heraskevych agreed that the helmet isn’t clearly visible during races anyway, given that sliders are zipping down the icy chute at around 120 kph (75 mph). That, the IOC hoped, was the window to a compromise. Heraskevych would not budge.
“Sadly, we’ve not been able to come to that solution,” Coventry said. “I really wanted to see him race today. It’s been an emotional morning.”
Heraskevych said he would appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but the race went on without him. The first two runs were Thursday, the last two are Friday. Regardless of what CAS says, if anything, his chance to race in these Games is gone. The IOC is letting him keep his credential, meaning he can remain at the Olympics as an athlete — just not a competing one.
About a dozen Russian athletes are being allowed to compete at the Olympics as neutral individuals along with seven Belarusians. They are not allowed to compete under their national flag or anthem. Heraskevych has spoken out several times about why he believes they shouldn’t be at the Olympics and said the IOC’s decision “plays along with Russian propaganda.”

The decision drew immediate condemnation from officials in Ukraine and some athletes.
“Sport shouldn’t mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors,” Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media. “Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise.”
“Disqualified. I think that’s enough to understand what the modern IOC really is and how it disgraces the idea of the Olympic movement,” added Ukrainian skier
Kateryna Kotsar on Instagram
. “Vladyslav Heraskevych, for us and for the whole world, you’re a champion. Even without starting.”
The IOC had sided with Ukraine’s top slider before. When he displayed a
“No war in Ukraine”
sign after his fourth and final run at the 2022 Beijing Olympics, the IOC said he was simply calling for peace and did not find him in violation of the Olympic charter.
This time, Heraskevych said he believes there are inconsistencies in how the IOC decides what statements are allowed. Among those he cited: U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov bringing a photo of his late parents — former pairs
world champions Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov
, who were
among the 67 people killed
in a plane crash on Jan. 29, 2025 — to the kiss-and-cry area after his skate in Milan this week, and Israeli skeleton athlete Jared Firestone’s decision to appear at the opening ceremony wearing a kippah that bore the names of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches killed in the 1972 attack during the Munich Games.
“A competitor literally placed the memory of the dead on his head to honor them,” Heraskevych wrote on Instagram. “I frankly do not understand how these two cases are fundamentally different.”
Firestone said he admired Heraskevych. “I think he’s a man with strong values,” he said.
In Milan, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said if athletes were allowed to display messaging without restrictions on the field of play “that would lead to a chaotic situation.”
“Sport without rules cannot function. ... If we have no rules, we have no sport,” Adams said.
Heraskevych was fourth at the world championships last year and was among the fastest in training leading into the Olympic races. A medal was certainly within reach, but to Heraskevych, the helmet mattered more.
“The International Olympic Committee destroyed our dreams,” said Mykhailo Heraskevych, the slider’s coach and father. “It’s not fair.”

US applications for jobless benefits fall to 227,000 last week, remaining at recent healthy levels

2026-02-12T13:41:24Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week, remaining within the historically healthy range of the past few years.
Applications for jobless aid for the week ending Feb. 7 fell by 5,000 to 227,000 from the previous week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That’s basically in line with the 226,000 new applications that analysts surveyed by the data firm FactSet had forecast.
Filings for unemployment benefits are viewed as representative of U.S. layoffs and are close to a real-time indicator of the health of the job market.
On Wednesday, the government reported that U.S. employers added a
surprisingly strong
130,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate fell to a still-low 4.3% from 4.4%. However, government revisions cut 2024-2025 U.S. payrolls by hundreds of thousands. That reduced the number of jobs created last year to just 181,000, a third of the previously reported 584,000 and the weakest since the pandemic year of 2020.
While weekly layoffs have remained in a historically low range mostly between 200,000 and 250,000 for the past few years, a number of high-profile companies have announced job cuts recently, including
UPS
,
Amazon
,
Dow
and the
Washington Post
in recent weeks.
Mounting layoff announcements in the past year, combined with the government’s own sluggish labor market reports, have left Americans
increasingly pessimistic
about the economy.
The Labor Department also recently reported that
job openings fell in December
to the lowest level in more than five years, another sign that the American labor market remains sluggish, even though the economy is
registering solid growth
.
Data over the past year has broadly revealed a labor market in which hiring has clearly slowed, hobbled by uncertainty raised by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and the lingering effects of the high interest rates the Fed engineered in 2022 and 2023 to tamp down a spike of pandemic-induced inflation.
Economists are conflicted about whether the stronger-than-expected January job gains are a one-off or possibly the first sign of a recovering labor market, which could lead the Fed to further delay more cuts to its key interest rate.
Some Fed officials have specifically argued that last year’s weak hiring shows that borrowing costs are weighing on growth and discouraging companies from expanding. A sustained pickup in hiring could undercut that theory.
Fed officials signaled
in December
that they expect to reduce their key rate once more this year, while Wall Street investors expect two reductions, according to futures pricing.
Thursday’s unemployment benefits report from the Labor Department also showed that the four-week moving average of jobless claims, which balances out some of the weekly volatility, rose by 7,000 to 219,500.
The total number of Americans filing for jobless benefits for the previous week ending Jan. 31 increased by 21,000 to 1.86 million, the government said.

Iraq's Maliki calls for 'one army' sparks debate over PMF's fate
2026-02-12 13:46:19 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/iraqs-maliki-calls-one-army-sparks-debate-over-pmfs-fate

Nouri al-Maliki, leader of the State of Law Coalition and the Coordination Framework's
candidate for prime minister
, has called for all weapons to be placed under state control and for
Iraq
to have a unified army. These remarks have restarted the debate concerning the future of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF).
On Wednesday, Al-Maliki, in response to journalists' questions sent to his media office,
said
, "The Iraqi people have endured years of war and violence, and today they deserve to live in security and dignity."
Maliki asserted that genuine stability requires reducing tensions, achieving political unity, fully implementing the rule of law, and ensuring the state's exclusive control over weapons. He further emphasised that forming a single national army, representative of all segments of Iraqi society and led by the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, is essential for national stability.
He indicated that stability would create a secure environment, attract investment, generate employment opportunities for youth, and facilitate reconstruction efforts throughout Iraq.
Subsequently, in a
pos
t on X, Maliki clarified that the main goal is to reinforce state authority and centralise security decision-making. He described the PMF as an official entity established by law and ratified by parliament.
Maliki emphasised that any changes to the security apparatus must follow constitutional procedures and be determined by the state, rather than by "rumours" or media reports.
He also maintained that improving the PMF's operational capability should not compromise its effectiveness.
Political implications
Maliki's statements come as he faces an American veto of a third term. Maliki previously served as
Iraq's
prime minister from 2006 to 2014.
During his second tenure, Iraq's army was unable to prevent the Islamic State (IS) from seizing a third of the country's territory in 2014. Iraqi security forces, including the PMF and the Iraqi Kurdistan region's Peshmerga forces, with support from the international coalition, defeated IS in 2017.
Maliki's reference to a "one army" under the commander-in-chief has prompted speculation about his position on integrating the PMF into Iraq's regular armed forces, an issue that is sensitive due to its complex political and sectarian dimensions.
Ghani al-Ghadban, an Iraqi political and security analyst, told
The New Arab
that Maliki's statements may be directed at both international and domestic audiences.
"Maliki's statements about merging the PMF with the armed forces to form a single army are an attempt to court the Americans," al-Ghadban said. "He is seeking to secure US approval and lift the veto against him in the race for Iraq's premiership by any means."
Al-Ghadban argued that even if Washington were to soften its position, which he described as unlikely, Maliki would continue to encounter resistance from factions within the Shia Coordination Framework and from broader segments of Iraqi society opposed to his return to office due to Maliki's legacy of the
IS
taking over large areas of Iraq, and the Camp Speicher massacre is still living in the memories of the Iraqis.
He added that the PMF, as a military body approved by parliament with distinct security and intelligence functions, could not realistically be dissolved or absorbed without provoking major opposition, particularly among Shia constituencies that view the force as central to the fight against the Islamic State group.
He further said Maliki's statements about dissolving the PMF have angered Shia Muslims.
US President Trump has
warned
that American aid to Iraq could be withdrawn if Maliki returns to power.
"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again", Trump said in a late January social media post announcing his opposition to al-Maliki. "Because of his insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq and, if we are not there to help,
Iraq
has ZERO chance of Success, Prosperity, or Freedom".

Extended citizenship wait needed for security reasons, says Sweden's intelligence agency

Lyssna:
Extended citizenship wait needed for security reasons, says Sweden's intelligen
Sweden's intelligence service, Säpo, is in favour of the government's longer residency requirement for Swedish citizenship, announced this week and set to come into force in June.
Säpo, one of the authorities consulted during the government's inquiry into tightening requirements for Swedish citizenship, wrote last March that it saw a need for an extended qualification period in light of its role in assessing potential security threats.
And it agrees with the government that the citizenship rule changes should also include people who have citizenship cases pending with the Migration Agency. Säpo has declined an interview with Radio Sweden, instead referring to what it said in the round of consultation on the original inquiry in March 2025.

OpenAI pivots its California ballot fight to Legislature
2026-02-12 13:30:00 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/exclusive-openai-pivots-its-california-ballot-fight-to-legislature-00777919

OpenAI and Common Sense are putting their kids chatbot safety ballot campaign on hold this year, as they try their hand at negotiating with the Legislature on a solution instead.
“We look forward to working with the Legislature to enact a framework that includes age assurance, annual child safety risk assessments, meaningful parental controls, protections against harmful and manipulative design, strong privacy safeguards, independent audits, and enforcement by the Attorney General,” Max Szabo, a spokesperson for the ballot committee told POLITICO.
Should talks with lawmakers not pan out, the Parents and Kids Safe AI Act campaign is keeping its 2026 ballot measure committee open and reserving the option to go for the 2028 ballot.
Szabo added that the coalition sees the measure's language as a potential way to establish a national benchmark for child AI safety — a sign that it'll look to take the debate to other statehouses.
The decision to take the legislative route came shortly after the ballot initiative received a title and summary from the state attorney general’s office on Tuesday, which would’ve allowed the campaign to start collecting the hundreds of thousands of signatures required to get the proposal before Californians in November.
It avoids an unpredictable, expensive and potentially polarizing ballot fight that
just a few tech giants
have historically been willing to see through. For this year in particular, campaigns anticipate needing even more money to qualify and ultimately succeed, given the high number of proposals competing to land on the 2026 ballot.
The change in strategy is also a win — though perhaps only a temporary one — for some kids’ safety advocates and tech critics who have argued against a ballot initiative and in favor of a legislative fix. They have painted the ballot initiative as an industry effort that
doesn’t go far enough
to protect kids against harms posed by using AI, and one that would be
exceedingly difficult to change
— unlike more malleable legislation.
In California, it’s not uncommon for groups to use the threat of a ballot measure to pressure legislators into negotiating with them on a compromise bill, rather than losing control over policy details to a statewide vote.
But Sacramento watchers of OpenAI’s campaign were taking it seriously after the ChatGPT maker put $10 million behind it last month and brought on Common Sense as a partner.
Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan told POLITICO this week that she would still be open to working with Common Sense and its CEO Jim Steyer after he allied himself with OpenAI, a sentiment echoed by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks.
“Many of us still work with Common Sense Media on this issue and others,” Wicks told POLITICO. “I certainly will continue to do so.” The Oakland Democrat said she also welcomes input from groups that have been critical of the ballot initiative, like the California Initiative for Technology and Democracy and Children Now, as well.
Asked how she is planning to reformulate her vetoed chatbot safety legislation from last year, Bauer-Kahan noted she wasn’t the biggest fan of the ballot approach.
“The initiative process has thrown me for a bit of a loop,” she said. “I don't think it meets the needs of California’s children.”
The development in OpenAI’s campaign also deals a blow to the likelihood that voters will be voting on AI regulations at the ballot box this fall. Of the set of AI proposals looking to make it there, OpenAI and Common Sense’s measure was the only campaign with verifiable money in the bank.

Ukrainian company unveils project for Shershen air defence system supporting five missile types
2026-02-12 13:29:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020709/

Radionix, a Ukrainian defence industry company, has presented a project for the Shershen (Hornet), a multi-calibre anti-aircraft missile system, at the World Defence Show 2026 in Saudi Arabia.
Source:
Militarnyi
, a Ukrainian military news outlet
Details:
Radionix is a member of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries (NAUDI).
The Shershen air defence missile system has been tested with five types of missiles: Soviet-era, foreign-made and Ukrainian-made.
Quote from NAUDI Director Serhii Honcharov:
"This eliminates dependence on a single supplier, as they operate in a competitive environment and aim to tie the customer to them for decades. Hypothetically, you could have launchers but no missiles, and the volume of missile production is, first, limited, and second, becomes more expensive every year."
More details:
The Shershen anti-aircraft missile system comprises a radar control station, launchers, loading vehicles and transport and loading vehicles.
The launcher is based on the Israeli-made Barak air defence missile system. This means it does not need to fire from the vehicle. Using a "multilift" system, a mechanism that lifts and moves the launcher, the unit can be removed from the platform and deployed on the ground, enabling the vehicle to relocate afterwards.
The system does not rely on a single radar station.
Honcharov also explained that the system can be adapted to different radar stations at the customer's request and is not strictly tied to any specific manufacturer.
The control system was designed for flexibility. Honcharov said it is at least three times cheaper than its overseas counterparts.
The Shershen air defence system can also operate with
Krechet
, a command-and-control system produced by Ukrainian Armor. It receives data from other radars and air target detection sources.
The engagement range depends on the type of missile. The launcher model in the transport position is equipped with R-27 missiles. In the R-27ET1 variant, which features a heat-seeking warhead, these missiles are used on the Indian Samar-2 air defence system, where the engagement range against airborne targets does not exceed 20 km.
The missile system falls into the short-range category in terms of capabilities. Militarnyi draws comparisons with the German IRIS-T SLM and the Norwegian-American NASAMS.
Background:
Ukraine has ordered 18 additional IRIS-T air defence systems from the German manufacturer Diehl Defence. The Ukrainian Armed Forces already operate nine IRIS-T systems. The company also announced that it plans to increase production of launchers for the IRIS-T SLM and IRIS-T SLS versions in 2026.
Norway has partnered with Ukraine to
integrate Ukrainian-made interceptor missiles into NASAMS
air defence systems.

Inside Roman Gofman's ascent to Israel's most sensitive post
2026-02-12 13:23:42 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/inside-roman-gofmans-ascent-to-israels-most-sensitive-post/

In January 2024, Benjamin Netanyahu visited the Bnei David pre-military academy in the settlement of Eli. In those days, the prime minister was looking for a new military secretary, who would replace Maj. Gen. Avi Gil, nearing the end of a three-year term. During the visit, as Netanyahu sat down for lunch, Rabbi Eli Sadan joined him. Sadan is a dominant figure in the religious Zionist community and the founder of the academy, which has made it its mission to integrate knitted-kippah wearers into the IDF. Sadan had several recommendations for the military secretary post, all of them officers who grew up in religious Zionism or are identified with it. The prime minister listened closely.
A short time later, Netanyahu summoned three candidates to his office for the role, considered one of the most sensitive in Israel's defense system: David Zini and Dado Bar Kalifa, both from the heart of the religious Zionist community, and Barak Hiram, who is secular but lives in the settlement of Tekoa and is considered an especially hawkish officer. However, a person who spoke with Netanyahu after that round of meetings says the prime minister was not impressed by any of the three candidates, even though he would later appoint Zini as head of the Shin Bet security agency. A few days later, Netanyahu asked to interview another candidate: Roman Gofman.
Gofman, born in Belarus and who immigrated to Israel at 14, does not wear a kippah and lives in Ashdod. But Netanyahu discovered that while Gofman was sent by the army to pursue academic studies, he devoted one day a week to Jewish studies at the Bnei David academy. "I was there from morning to evening," Gofman said in the past. "They accepted me as I am, without a kippah." According to a source familiar with the details, "Rabbi Sadan gave his approval for Gofman because he studied in Eli."
The first meeting between Netanyahu and Gofman lasted about 20 minutes, a short time by the prime minister's standards. Netanyahu, who tends to prolong meetings of this kind, ended it dissatisfied. A person who spoke with him afterward says the prime minister was mainly troubled by the fact that Gofman did not speak English.
But a few days later, Gofman found himself again at the Prime Minister's Office for a working meeting on a completely different matter. The chief of staff, Tzachi Braverman, happened to see him there. "Why don't you go in again," Braverman told Gofman. "Now is a good time."
It was, indeed, good timing. When Gofman was brought into Netanyahu's room, he found Netanyahu's wife Sara inside as well. About 15 minutes later, Sara left the room and left the two men alone. A few days later, Channel 14 reported that Gofman had been chosen for the military secretary post. A person who was near him when he received the news says Gofman was surprised. "Roman was in shock that he got the job," he says.
"No privilege"
Why did Netanyahu choose Gofman as his military secretary? According to a person who knows both men well, Gofman's personality fit Netanyahu like a glove. "On the one hand, Gofman is a kicking horse, and on the other he's very obedient," he explains. "Wild, but the kind who bows his head to authority. Even if he knows how to voice an opinion and argue, when he gets an order, in the end he carries it out."
This week, Army Radio reported that Gofman cooperated with Netanyahu in collecting classified documents that the prime minister used to craft his response to the state comptroller, in which he attacked the IDF and the Shin Bet head-on. "The military secretary is supposed, on the one hand, to represent the entire security community, and on the other to serve the prime minister," says a security official who worked with Gofman as military secretary. "From my interface with him, Gofman tends to prefer the prime minister's needs more than the interests of the security community."
Today it can be said with certainty that Netanyahu was pleased with his new military secretary. In December 2025, he announced he had chosen to appoint Gofman, a man who grew up in the Armored Corps, served in only one role as a major general and never commanded an intelligence unit, as the next head of the Mossad.
The announcement, seen as a vote of no confidence in the Mossad's senior leadership, shook the organization and led several department heads to consider their future. Two sources who recently spoke with current Mossad chief David Barnea say Barnea expressed concern to them about the organization's future. "We're at war, with fronts spread out," one of them explains. "We have no privilege to take someone with no experience in managing and processing intelligence, including the most advanced technological systems, and put him at the top of the system."
On the other hand, several people who worked closely with Gofman argue the appointment is appropriate. "A thorough, deep and brave person in how he acts and how he thinks," says a former senior official in the Military Intelligence Directorate who knows Gofman well. "An excellent officer who will be an excellent Mossad chief," another security source adds. "In all my years in the defense establishment I've never encountered abilities like Roman's. He starts working at 5 a.m. and finishes at 1 a.m., and repeats. With any other officer parachuted like this into heading the Mossad I'd raise an eyebrow, but Roman is an autodidact. I have not the slightest doubt he will sit for weeks and read every page, every intelligence report and every study he can get his hands on, in order to excel."
In recent weeks we have spoken with dozens of people who know Gofman, from his youth as a new immigrant in Ashdod, through his military service and up to his current role as the prime minister's military secretary. The result is a profile of a combative, creative and hardworking officer, but also a reckless man whose daring sometimes disrupts his professional judgment. It also emerges that Gofman was almost dismissed from the National Security College, and that recently he considered leaving the military for a role in the police, after concluding he had little chance of advancing in the IDF command ladder. Now, paradoxically, he is a step away from one of the most important jobs in Israel's security system.
You can learn about Gofman's character by watching the short video documenting his wounding on October 7. Gofman, then a brigadier general who commanded the National Ground Forces Training Center, drove on his own initiative from his home in Ashdod to the south and at a certain point reached the Shaar Hanegev junction, which was already clearly in the hands of terrorists. In the video you can see how, with courage worthy of appreciation, he entered the junction alone and fought a very brief battle, during which he managed to wound two terrorists.
But within seconds, Gofman himself took a bullet in the leg, after finding himself at a disadvantage and trying, unsuccessfully, to hide behind a thin road sign pole. Instead of managing the combat zone, the most senior commander on the scene was wounded and the force had to deal with evacuating him. "All credit to him for going south and getting there very quickly," says a former senior infantry officer, "but when he decides to enter a kill zone without understanding the situation picture, that's a critical mistake stemming from recklessness. In short, classic Roman."
Too much independence
Gofman recovered quickly from his October 7 wound. Afterward he served for several months as chief of staff to the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, and he was already formally appointed to his next post as a division head in the Planning Directorate. Then Netanyahu's decision came and upended the plan. From the start, the appointment as military secretary, which requires the IDF chief of staff's approval, did not sit well with the chief of staff at the time, Herzi Halevi. As reported in
Israel Hayom
, Halevi did not actively oppose Gofman's appointment, but he did not push for it either.
Later, Halevi also remained dissatisfied. In the chief of staff's eyes, Gofman showed too much independence and was perceived as someone serving Netanyahu's agenda at the expense of the IDF's. "As military secretary, Gofman often saw himself as someone providing the prime minister with a second opinion, as a substitute for the chief of staff," says a former member of the IDF General Staff forum.
"Sometimes it sounds like Gofman is saying what Netanyahu wants to hear, or that Netanyahu uses Gofman to say, 'Look, there are other opinions in the army.'"
One example occurred in spring 2024, immediately after Gofman entered the role, when the cabinet discussed what became known as the "Biden outline" for releasing hostages in exchange for ending the war. Then-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, Chief of Staff Halevi and the head of the hostages directorate Maj. Gen. Nitzan Alon supported advancing the outline together with the Shin Bet, while Netanyahu opposed it and Mossad chief Barnea was cautious.
"Netanyahu found himself in an inferior position opposite the defense establishment, which was almost unified on the issue and opposed his stance," says a former security source who was in the know at the time. "To balance the picture, Netanyahu held 'security consultations,' but because he knew what the chief of staff and the Shin Bet position would be, they were not invited to those consultations. The most senior security figure in the room was Gofman, who provided Netanyahu with the supposedly military position that supported Netanyahu's stance. Netanyahu simply played divide and rule, and Gofman chose a side. He made the switch pretty quickly."
On the other hand, a former senior officer in Military Intelligence says Military Secretary Gofman played a central role in Netanyahu's successful decision-making process that led to the killing of Hassan Nasrallah and Operation RIsing Lion. "Roman had enormous influence on these operations," he says. "He knew how to bring Netanyahu to the right visits, in the right units and at the right time."
For example, the final decision to kill Nasrallah was made while Netanyahu was visiting Unit 8200, a visit Gofman arranged on his own initiative. "There Netanyahu heard directly from intelligence personnel that the window for the strike was about to close, after Nasrallah's advisers urged him to go underground," says the former senior intelligence officer. "Netanyahu listened and was convinced during that visit that it was time to act. Even during the dilemmas ahead of the strike in Iran, Gofman knew how to bring Netanyahu where he needed to be so he would receive information firsthand."
The trust Netanyahu placed in Gofman helped him, within just a few months, become Netanyahu's personal envoy to Moscow and liaison to Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an unusual arrangement. Sources in the defense establishment argued at the time that Gofman was receiving more and more authority from Netanyahu and was effectively functioning even as head of the National Security Council. They still did not imagine that one day Gofman would also be appointed head of the Mossad.
"Gofman is a gray figure, without an intelligence background, but also a loyal confidant who owes his career to Netanyahu. Netanyahu knows that whatever happens between him and Gofman from now on, Gofman will take with him to the grave," says a former senior Mossad official who had worked opposite both men. "At the Mossad we always laughed at Arab states, where intelligence chiefs were appointed based on loyalty. We said we're not like that. Gofman's appointment changed that. It's a blow to the Mossad's ethos."
"Make them fight"
As of this writing, Gofman's formal appointment as Mossad chief still requires approval from the Grunis Committee for senior appointments. Recently it was reported that the committee decided to examine more deeply an event that clouds Gofman's past from his time as a divisional commander. This is a sprawling security affair that we will try to put in order within the constraints of the gag orders surrounding it.
Around May 2022, the defense establishment began noticing that secret information from Military Intelligence was leaking to a popular Hebrew-language Telegram channel. "We went crazy seeing things go up on Telegram that only a few people knew, and it exposed forces and endangered lives," says a senior Military Intelligence official from that period. After joint discussions involving the information security unit, the Shin Bet and the police, it was decided to arrest three suspects in the leaks: a reservist and a regular-service soldier in Military Intelligence, and a 17-year-old boy from Ashkelon named Uri Elmakayes.
In their Shin Bet interrogation, it emerged that the three had set up a shared Telegram group through which the two intelligence personnel passed secret information to Elmakayes. He, in turn, published the information on a Telegram channel he operated under a pseudonym. The Military Intelligence soldier has since been convicted of disclosing a secret, while the reservist's trial is still ongoing.
During the Shin Bet interrogation of Elmakayes in the serious affair, which lasted 44 long days and included sleep deprivation and denial of a meeting with a lawyer, he claimed that alongside the secret information he received from the reservist and the Military Intelligence soldier, additional material he published on Telegram was sent to him by an intelligence officer in Division 210. Division 210 is responsible for the Golan border area and at the time was commanded by Gofman. According to Elmakayes, this was part of a divisional influence operation meant to convey messages to actors on the Syrian side of the Golan through the Telegram network.
Elmakayes insisted that the messages between him and the intelligence personnel, proving his claims, were on his phone. But the phone was never opened by Shin Bet and police investigators.
Still, in light of the claims that arose in the interrogation, the IDF decided to conduct an internal review led by Brig. Gen. G., head of the activation division in Military Intelligence. G. called Gofman by phone, but Gofman told him he did not know a boy named Elmakayes and certainly had not used him for influence operations. Following that, the IDF issued a statement saying: "In a thorough review among authorized IDF personnel involved in operational shaping, influence and deception processes, no evidence was found that the Telegram channels relevant to the investigation were part of an influence or deception act."
After the IDF's denial, based on Gofman's blanket disavowal of the affair, an indictment was filed against Elmakayes. He was later released to house arrest, where he remained for about a year and a half. It should be emphasized that the indictment against Elmakayes related to leaking the secret information he received from the reservist and the Military Intelligence soldier, with no connection to the events involving Division 210.
But while the teenager waited under house arrest for his trial to begin, the IDF discovered there was, in fact, a link between Elmakayes and Gofman. A deeper review in Division 210 found that Gofman had initiated an influence operation in which he approved his subordinate intelligence officers passing non-classified information to the operator of a Hebrew-language Telegram channel that was popular among residents of the Syrian Golan. Gofman claimed he did not know the channel's operator was Uri Elmakayes.
It also emerged that Elmakayes' activation was only part of a broader intelligence effort Gofman ran in the division. "Gofman constantly pushed to influence the population on the other side," says a former senior Military Intelligence official. "For example, to expose al-Qaida and Islamic State people to villagers, to make them fight one another." But in some of these cases, Gofman acted without obtaining the required approvals and without coordination with Military Intelligence. "You expect a division commander to carry out influence operations, but with coordination and approval," says the former senior official, "because when you operate vis-a-vis a civilian population, it has implications far beyond the division."
After Gofman's unauthorized activity was exposed, he was summoned to the office of the then-northern command chief and received a command reprimand. But what Gofman, and others in the IDF, "forgot" to do was to update the lawyers for Elmakayes, who was still under arrest waiting for his trial. Only much later, when the lawyers received Elmakayes' cellphone and opened it, they discovered that the teenager's claims were true: he had indeed been activated by Division 210 intelligence officers.
As a result, the lawyers approached the prosecution, which apparently, due to the investigative failures, decided in an extremely unusual step to cancel the indictment against Elmakayes. In effect, it can be said that thanks to the irregular conduct of Gofman's managers, Elmakayes was saved from a serious indictment.
In any case, Elmakayes and his lawyers have very serious claims against Gofman. They argue he could have confessed earlier to his ties with Elmakayes but chose to conceal the truth while the teenager remained in Shin Bet interrogation and then in custody. These days, the teenager is pursuing a civil case against Gofman, and his lawyers have also sent the Grunis Committee a statement expressing their opposition to appointing him as Mossad chief. "We believe the affair of activating the minor whom we represent constitutes a black stain," say the lawyers, Orit Chayon and Din Kochavi, this week. "Abandoning the minor to Shin Bet interrogations and leaving him in prolonged custody constitute a moral and ethical injury and do not allow trust in Gofman. We hope the Grunis Committee will reach the only required conclusion, which is disqualifying the appointment."
"Because he's creative"
Maj. Gen. Roman Gofman, 50, married and a father of three daughters, was born in the provincial city of Mazyr in southern Belarus, not far from the border with Ukraine. His mother was a teacher. His father, Vladislav, worked as a doctor at the local hospital, specialized in anesthesiology and later became deputy director of a hospital in Russia. In 1990, after the family immigrated to Israel, the father worked as a security guard. Only a year later did he begin working at Assaf Harofeh Hospital, where until recently he managed the recovery unit and respiratory intensive care.
Gofman, a skinny, bespectacled boy, struggled to find his place in Ashdod, where the family settled. "To get to school Roman had to cross a street where a few 'arsim' lived who harassed new immigrants," says someone who knew him. "Roman refused to take a detour. He would walk through the arsim street, even if it meant getting beaten." At some point he learned boxing, mainly to defend himself, and as a teenager became Israel's runner-up in boxing in his weight category.
He attended high school at ORT Officers of the Sea Ashdod, in an electrical studies track. He is remembered as a thorough student, exceptionally meticulous, but also an opinionated youth who challenged his teachers frequently, traits that would carry into his military career. It seems he understood early that the most efficient way to integrate into Israeli society was through combat service. In a photo from high school, he appears with a close-cropped Marines haircut and a cut-off shirt. Friends said he trained a great deal ahead of enlistment, and on stormy winter days he would go to the beach, enter the water and fight the waves. In the school yearbook, he was described briefly: "This guy is really a serious tool, during breaks he trains regularly, one punch of his and you're in hospital for a week."
Because of his glasses, Gofman was not accepted to an elite unit and enlisted in the Armored Corps. There he found not only personal purpose but also a collective identity. "As a commander in the army I received my Zionist and Israeli identity," he said in a media interview, revealing that only in the army did he first learn the words of the national anthem. "It was a vacuum I carried since immigration."
"A man without pose"
Gofman excelled as an armored combat officer, rose through the ranks, and in 2011 was appointed battalion commander in the 7th Armored Brigade. His combative yet reckless nature surfaced at least once in that role. While holding a sector in the north, he was called to chase a shepherd who crossed the border. "Gofman started chasing him, and at some point had to cross a stream," says a former officer. "He went into the water with his radio operator, with all their gear, and the radio operator almost drowned. It ended with having to rescue the radio operator, and the shepherd got away."
Gofman's first steps outside the Armored Corps came when he commanded the Ephraim Brigade, which covers the Gush Etzion area. There he built his image as a creative officer with an open, original mind, an image he still clings to today. One way he did this was by changing the brigade's approach to the local population. "We worked to significantly expand the circle of interlocutors and to become directly familiar with the terrain through tours in civilian clothing and fascinating collection interrogations with terrorists in prisons," Gofman wrote in an academic article published at the end of his term, titled "From Security Routine to Governance." "We searched for answers as to why one day a Palestinian youth becomes a terrorist."
An intelligence officer who worked opposite Gofman at the time says, "He had a positive influence on the sector, not only in the military aspect but also in the work he did with the Palestinian population, out of an understanding that influencing them would lower the level of terrorism." He says Gofman also worked extensively with the Jewish population in Gush Etzion, which appreciated him greatly as a brigade commander.
Later, too, Gofman would be seen as a prolific and creative writer who published several original academic articles. Reading these pieces shows fluent, clear writing, supported by footnotes and full of quotations from songs and classical sources. An article he published in 2015 titled "Toward a Third Lebanon War," for example, opens with a long quote from the Babylonian Talmud.
But not everyone was convinced by Gofman's creative momentum. Two former members of the IDF General Staff forum whom we spoke with describe him as "over-smart." "The problem with Gofman is that he tries too hard to be original," says one. "You can take any bizarre idea of Gofman's and say, 'Yes, it's because he's creative,'" says the other. "There's a tendency to glorify his originality, but it's nonsense. Everything he does gets spun as 'creativity,' but it's not really there."
Not everyone agrees. Others describe him as someone who "always provided angles you don't get from other officers in the IDF, who all speak in the same voice." The peak moment in that sense, which also brought Gofman considerable fame, took place at a senior command conference in the IDF when he was commander of the 7th Armored Brigade.
Gofman, then only a colonel, went up on stage and lashed out at everyone present, including then-Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot, with blunt words. "A pattern is developing here, and its essence is avoiding the use of ground forces," he said in his rolling, familiar R. "We are ready and we want to fight, but you are not deploying us." The dramatic scene, documented in the film "Eizenkot" on Kan 11, has been preserved as a prophecy that foresaw the failures of October 7.
After finishing his command of the 7th Brigade, Gofman began studies at the National Security College. Two sources familiar with the details reveal that during his studies there, the professional staff considered dismissing him due to "behavior not appropriate for a senior officer," as one puts it. Gofman nonetheless completed the program, was appointed a divisional commander and later commander of the National Ground Forces Training Center. According to a former officer who knows him closely, "At that stage his career got a bit stuck. He didn't see himself advancing to the rank of major general." At some point, it now emerges, Gofman even considered transferring to serve as a police commander and raised with various people the possibility that he would discuss the matter with National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir.
October 7 changed everything. After being wounded, Gofman looked for where he could contribute. After a chance meeting with the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories commander at the time, Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian, Gofman joined him as chief of staff. "When he entered the role, he sat down and read dozens of books," says a source who was close to him at the time. "He studied day and night."
"Gofman is the most thoughtful, initiative-taking and attentive officer I met during the war," says another officer who worked closely with him in the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories. "A man without pose, without honor-guard manners, who truly wants to hear the professionals and the field people. To deal with the civilian issue in the Strip, he read things the Americans did in Mosul and the Russians did in Syria, and when he felt stuck he went to speak with people outside the system who brought him ideas." One of those people, we have learned, is Prof. David Passig, who specializes in futures research and trend forecasting.
A "dialysis" process
After joining the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, Gofman participated in a thinking forum that included, among others, two reserve intelligence officers, Liran Tankman and Yotam Hacohen. In those days, the two developed ideas for what they called "the civilian campaign against Hamas." Hamas is a terrorist organization. One of their ideas can be likened to a "dialysis" process: Tankman and Hacohen proposed evacuating areas in Gaza of Palestinian civilians, clearing them of terrorist infrastructure, and then returning a "screened" population that would benefit from significant humanitarian aid. In this way, they hoped to sever Hamas from its main oxygen pipeline, the Gazan population.
When Gofman, in his new role, heard about the idea, he seized on it eagerly. For long hours he sat with Tankman and Hacohen's thinking forum at the Coordinator's headquarters on the ninth floor of the Defense Ministry building in the Kirya complex in Tel Aviv, to refine the initiative down to its smallest details.
The "dialysis" idea continued to circulate in IDF corridors for several months but was not implemented. Only in early 2025 was it decided to adopt one of its offshoots and establish the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, through which Israel would distribute humanitarian aid to Gaza's population while bypassing other countries and international organizations. Gofman, by then the prime minister's military secretary and someone familiar with the people behind the idea, played a central role in establishing the foundation and pushed for it. An investigation published in Haaretz claimed he did so behind the backs of the IDF and the Defense Ministry.
"In the case of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, as happened in the Uri Elmakayes affair, once Gofman gained a position of power he did many things without staff work, without involving professional bodies and without thinking things through," says a person who once commanded him. "It's a method that is very convenient for Netanyahu in certain cases, as we saw, for example, in the submarine affair."
Israel's humanitarian aid project, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, will not be remembered as a great success. The initiative failed to implement IDF policy in areas it had taken over and drew harsh international criticism.
"The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation project, like the Uri Elmakayes affair, are two events that sit in the Mossad's vicinity," says a veteran intelligence figure who knows the Prime Minister's Office from the inside as well. "This is covert, sensitive activity carried out beyond the border and closely tied to diplomacy and international sensitivities. In that arena, Gofman has proven at least twice that he behaves like a bull in a china shop. I hope he learned the lesson and that as Mossad chief he will act differently."
Responses
The Prime Minister's Office said: "The claim regarding the presence or involvement of the prime minister's wife in the process of appointing Maj. Gen. Gofman as military secretary is an absolute lie. We firmly reject the smears raised by anonymous sources against Maj. Gen. Gofman, a highly decorated, bold and creative officer who carries out his duties in a manner worthy of praise for Israel's security. The prime minister is confident he will do the same as the next head of the Mossad."
The IDF Spokesperson chose not to respond.

U.S. allies at NATO focus on Europe as the Trump administration steps back

2026-02-12T11:17:45Z
BRUSSELS (AP) — European allies at NATO on Thursday brushed aside concerns that the United States has stepped back from its leadership role of the world’s biggest
security organization
, leaving them and Canada to do the lion’s share of defending Europe.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth did not attend Thursday’s gathering of defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels. His no-show came after Secretary of State Marco Rubio
skipped the last meeting
of NATO foreign ministers in December.
It’s rare for members of a U.S. administration to miss a meeting of the organization’s top decision-making body, the North Atlantic Council, at the level of ministers, let alone two meetings in a row. Under Secretary of Defense Elbridge Colby was sent in Hegseth’s place.
“Sadly for him, he is missing a good party,” Icelandic Foreign Minister Þorgerður Katrín Gunnarsdóttir told reporters. “Of course, it’s always better that the ministers attend here, but I would not describe it as a bad signal.”
“I’m not disappointed,” German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said. “Each of us has a full agenda. And one time the American defense minister is here, and one time not, so it’s his decision and his duties he has to fulfill.”
How times have changed
When asked what NATO’s purpose was in its infancy in 1949, NATO’s first secretary-general, the British general and diplomat Lord Hastings Ismay, was reputed to have replied: “To keep the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down.”
Nowadays, Germany is stepping up. After Russia invaded Ukraine four years ago, it vowed to spend 100 billion euros ($118 billion)
to modernize
its armed forces in coming years.
A big part of NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte’s job is to keep the Americans in.
“They have to take care of the whole world. This is the United States,” Rutte told reporters before chairing the meeting. “I totally accept it, agree with it.”
“They have always consistently pleaded for Europe doing more, Canada doing more, taking more care of the defense of NATO territory, of course in conjunction with the United States,” he said.
That means more European spending on conventional weapons and defense, while the U.S. guarantees NATO’s nuclear deterrent.
But doubts linger, and surprises from the Trump administration cannot be ruled out. Allies still wonder whether
more U.S. troops
will be withdrawn from Europe.
“What for me is the most important is the no-surprise policy that has been agreed between the NATO secretary-general and the U.S.,” Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans said.
Stepping back
Publicly at least, the Trump administration is doing much less at NATO. A year ago, Hegseth warned that America’s
security priorities
lie elsewhere and that Europe would have to look after itself, and Ukraine in its battle against Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Supplies of U.S. guns and money that were sent to Ukraine by the previous administration of President Joe Biden have dried up under Trump. European allies and Canada are obliged to
buy weapons
from the United States to donate now.
Western backers of Ukraine were also meeting at NATO on Thursday to drum up more military support. A scheme proudly championed by the Pentagon under Biden, the
Ukraine Defense Contact Group
is now chaired by the U.K. and Germany.
U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey announced that Britain would provide “an extra half a billion pounds ($682 million) in urgent air defense to Ukraine. This is Britain being a force for good in the world, building a new deal for European security within NATO.”
Sweden also intends to fund the purchase of more American weapons. The Netherlands will send more flight simulators to help Ukrainian fighter pilots train to fly F-16 jets.
Arctic Sentry
The one “deliverable” from Thursday’s meeting was the announcement that NATO would launch
Arctic Sentry
, its response to U.S. security concerns in the high north, and an attempt to dissuade Trump from trying to seize Greenland.
It’s ostensibly aimed at countering Russian and Chinese activities or influence in the Arctic region.
But Arctic Sentry is essentially a rebranding exercise. National drills already underway in the region, like those run by Denmark and Norway, will be brought under the NATO umbrella and overseen by the organization’s military chief.
It is not a long-term NATO operation or mission.
Denmark, France, Germany will take part in the “military activities” happening under Arctic Sentry, but they have not said in what way. Finland and Sweden are likely to get involved. Belgium is considering what role it might play.
It remains unclear what role, if any, the United States will take.
“It can’t just be more from the United States,” U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said ahead of Thursday’s meeting. “We need capable allies that are ready and strong, that can bring assets to all of these areas of our collective security.”
Trump’s
renewed threats
last month to annex Greenland — a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark — have deeply shaken the rest of the alliance. NATO’s primary role is to defend the territory of its 32 member states, not to undermine it.
European allies and Canada hope that Arctic Sentry and ongoing talks between the Trump administration, Denmark and Greenland will allow NATO to move on from the dispute and focus on Europe’s real security priority,
Russia’s war
on Ukraine.
Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken said the Arctic security arrangement at least means that “we stop having some food fights over the Atlantic.”
“I think that the Greenland saga was not the best moment of NATO (over) the last 76 years,” he told reporters. “It was a crisis that was not needed.”

France calls on UN rights rapporteur Albanese to resign
2026-02-12 13:18:32 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/france-calls-un-rights-rapporteur-albanese-resign

France is calling for the resignation of the
UN special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories
over comments she made allegedly targeting Israel at a conference, the foreign minister said on Wednesday.
"France unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks made by Ms Francesca Albanese, which are directed not at the Israeli government, whose policies may be criticised, but at Israel as a people and as a nation, which is absolutely unacceptable," Jean-Noel Barrot told French lawmakers.
Speaking via videoconference at a forum on Saturday in Doha organised by the
Al Jazeera
network, Albanese referred to a "common enemy" that enabled the "genocide" in Gaza.
"The fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support," she said.
"We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy," she continued.
On Wednesday,
Albanese
defended herself in an interview with TV channel
France 24
recorded before Barrot's statement, denouncing what she called "completely false accusations" and "manipulation" of her words.
"I have never, ever, ever said 'Israel is the common enemy of humanity'," she said.
But Barrot said Albanese's comments added "to a long list of scandalous positions", accusing the Italian rights expert of "justifying" the 7 October, 2023 attacks against Israel and "comparing Israel to the Third Reich".
"She is a political activist who stirs up hate speech that does a disservice to the cause of the Palestinian people," he said, responding to a question from Carole Yadan, a lawmaker from the presidential camp.
Yadan was among 20 other deputies a day earlier to warn Barrot in a letter that Albanese should be "stripped of any UN mandate with immediate effect" following her remarks.
France is one of the UN Security Council's five permanent members.

Germany followed suit, with its foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, calling for the official to quit.
"I respect the UN system of independent rapporteurs. However, Ms Albanese has made numerous inappropriate remarks in the past. I condemn her recent statements about Israel. She is untenable in her position," Wadephul wrote on X.

Shershen SAM System: Ukraine Develops Multi-Caliber Air Defense Project
2026-02-12 13:16:08 GMT
https://militarnyi.com/en/news/shershen-sam-ukraine-air-defense-project/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=shershen-sam-ukraine-air-defense-project

The Ukrainian Shershen multi-caliber surface-to-air missile system was presented at the World Defense Show 2026, an exhibition taking place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Militarnyi’s correspondent reports on this.
Radionix, a member of the National Association of Defense Industry of Ukraine (
NAUDI
), is the main developer and integrator of solutions.
The Shershen anti-aircraft missile system has been tested on five types of missiles. These include Soviet, foreign-made, and promising Ukrainian-made missiles.
“This eliminates dependence on a single supplier, because they operate in a competitive environment and want to tie the customer to themselves for decades. And then a situation arises where, hypothetically, there are launchers, but no missiles, and the volume of missile production is, first, small, and second, they are becoming more and more expensive every year,” NAUDI Director Serhiy Honcharov shared.

Composition of the Shershen SAM system
The Shershen surface-to-air missile system generally consists of:
a radar station control point,
launchers,
launch and reloading vehicles,
transport and reloading vehicles
Model of the Shershen SAM launcher in its deployed position. Photo credits: Militarnyi
The launcher is similar to the Israeli Barak SAM system, where the launch unit is removed from the vehicle using a “multilift” system and left on the ground as a separate autonomous object.
The system is not tied to a specific radar station.
“The radar can be adapted to the system according to the customer’s wishes. That is, there is no strict requirement that only Thales, HENSOLDT, Teledyne, Girafe, or another radar be used. In other words, everything can be adapted, and the control system is very flexible and at least three times cheaper than the global one,” Serhii Honcharov noted regarding the possibility of integrating various radars into the system.
The Shershen air defense system can integrate with the
Krechet system
, which receives information from other radars and air target detection sources.

The technical characteristics of the engagement range depend on the specific missile that the system will use. For example, the mock-up of the launcher in transport position shows R-27 missiles, while the R-27ET1 version with a thermal homing head is used on the
Indian Samar-2 air defense system
, where the air target engagement range does not exceed 20 kilometers.
In terms of missile capabilities, the system is short-range, similar to the German IRIS-T SLM or the Norwegian-American NASAMS.

The IDF Persian-language spokesperson published an unusual message on X on Thursday, directly calling on Iranian citizens to make contact with the IDF or the Mossad via their official social media platforms.
In the statement, the Persian-language account wrote: "We ask the patriotic Iranian people to act only in accordance with our official methods of communication and to contact us regarding any cooperation. The pages and links included in this post are the only official and authentic accounts."
The message follows recent reports alleging Israeli contact with protesters in Iran, as well as online posts encouraging individuals to reach out to specific accounts. According to those reports, various social media approaches were attributed to Israeli entities.
In the past, during periods of protest and in the lead-up to Operation Rising Lion, there were claims of Israeli activity on Iranian soil and alleged contact with regime opponents.

Ukrainian Athlete Disqualified From Olympics Over Helmet Depicting War Dead: ‘The Price of Our Dignity’
2026-02-12 13:02:58 GMT
https://time.com/7377960/vladyslav-heraskevych-helmet-disqualified-skeleton-athlete-winter-olympics-2026/

The International Olympic Committee wants nothing more than to keep political activism, protests, and geopolitics out of the Winter Games spotlight. We should all be celebrating the unifying power of sport, organizers will tell you: admire the exploits of
Jordan Stolz
,
Ilia Malinin
, and
Breezy Johnson
.
But as we approach almost a week into the Milano Cortina competition, the IOC has all but ensured that a political controversy will linger, arguably thanks to its own decision making.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
On Thursday morning in Milan, the IOC announced it had withdrawn the accreditation of
Ukrainian skeleton pilot Vladyslav Heraskevych
, in effect banning him from taking part in the Olympics due to his insistence of wearing a helmet depicting the images of Ukrainian athletes slain since
Russia invaded his home country in 2022
. According to an IOC statement, the organization’s president, Kirsty Coventry, met face-to-face with Heraskevych at the sliding center in Cortina on Thursday morning, in an attempt to convince him to leave his helmet behind. The IOC says it offered the athlete alternative ways to outwardly display his grief, such as by wearing a black armband or ribbon. When Heraskevych wouldn’t relent, the skeleton heats proceeded without him.
Reacting to his disqualification,
Heraskevych
, a medal contender, told reporters at the track: “It’s hard to say or put into words. It’s emptiness … In Ukraine now, we also have a lot of tears.” The athlete added that he didn’t want to downplay Coventry’s feelings, but doesn’t believe he violated any rules.
“This is the price of our dignity,”
Heraskevych
said via social media,
alongside an image of himself wearing the much-discussed helmet.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky offered his support to the athlete, calling the IOC’s decision “
morally appalling
.”
At issue was Heraskevych’s alleged violation of the
IOC’s Guidelines For Athlete Expression,
particularly rule 50.2 of the Olympic Charter which states that “no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.”
The IOC has said it worked with more than 3,000 athletes to refine its political expression guidelines in 2021, and notes that Heraskevych was free to make statements on the war and express grief through his own social media channels, and in interviews with the press at the venue before and after his runs.
But Heraskevych wanted to do something more visual.
The IOC knows better than anyone the value, and influence, of images broadcast worldwide. Companies pay the IOC
billions
for these rights.
“No one—no one, especially me—is disagreeing with the messaging,” Coventry
said in a statement.
“The messaging is a powerful message. It’s a message of remembrance. It’s a message of memory. It’s not about the messaging; it’s literally about the rules and the regulations. In this case—the field of play—we have to be able to keep a safe environment for everyone. And sadly, that just means no messaging is allowed.”
The sad irony here—and the reason why the IOC’s refusal to make an exception in extraordinary circumstances can arguably be criticized—is that Olympic organizers have taken action against Russian aggression, as Heraskevych is trying to do here. All Russian teams are banned from the Milano Cortina Games. Its men’s hockey team, for example, had medal hopes. A few Russian athletes are competing in individual sports, under the “
Neutral Individual Athletes
” category. As such, they must meet stringent requirements, including showing no support for the invasion.
Ukrainian athletes here received a rousing ovation in Milan at the opening ceremony, trailing only the host country in vocal crowd support. Sympathy and admiration for Ukraine’s athletes, who have continued to compete over the past four years through trying circumstances back home, abounds throughout Italy and the world.
It begs the question: How much outrage would there have been over the skeleton helmet, had
Heraskevych
been allowed to compete?

Heard it on the grapevine: Polish wine’s quiet renaissance
2026-02-12 13:00:13 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/food/2026/feb/12/polish-wines-quiet-renaissance

Once thought of only for vodka and lager, Poland is in the midst of a wine-making revival that’s infiltrating restaurant lists, bars and independent suppliers
Swap the staid stereotypes of Żubrówka vodka and Żywiec lager for vineyards and vintages, because Poland is in the throes of a viticultural renaissance, the likes of which hasn’t been seen for centuries. On a road trip tracing Poland’s best terroirs back in the summer of 2023, I met winemakers going against the grain, unshackled by tradition and producing unpretentious, expressive pours that more than merit a place on your dining table.
Lately, Polish wines have been cropping up all over bar and restaurant lists: Niemczańska’s chardonnay at London’s most emblematic Polish restaurant, the borscht-fronted
Daquise
in South Kensington, say, while chic bar
Spry
in Edinburgh has started stocking my favourite producers, Dom Bliskowice, Kamil Barczentewicz and Nizio.
But you won’t find bottles nestling between the neat rows of
kabanos
sausages of your local
Polski sklep
, nor lining the supermarket shelves. Or not just yet, anyway.

We can move beyond the capitalist model and save the climate – here are the first three steps | Jason Hickel and Yanis Varoufakis
2026-02-12 13:00:13 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2026/feb/12/capitalist-model-climate-growth-capitalism-species-humanity

Capitalism cares about our species’ prospects as much as a wolf cares about a lamb’s. But democratise our economy and a better world is within our grasp
We have an urgent responsibility. Our existing economic system is incapable of addressing the social and ecological crises we face in the 21st century. When we look around we see an extraordinary paradox. On the one hand, we have access to remarkable new technologies and a collective capacity to produce more food, more stuff than we need or that the planet can afford. Yet at the same time, millions of people suffer in conditions of severe deprivation.
What explains this paradox? Capitalism. By capitalism we do not mean markets, trade and entrepreneurship, which have been around for thousands of years before the rise of capitalism. By capitalism we mean something very odd and very specific: an economic system
that boils down to a dictatorship run by the tiny minority who control capital – the big banks, the major corporations and the 1% who own the majority of investible assets. Even if we live in a democracy and have a choice in our political system, our choices never seem to change the economic system. Capitalists are the ones who determine what to produce, how to use our labour and who gets to benefit. The rest of us – the people who are actually
doing
the production – do not get a say.

Mit über 108 Milliarden Euro Wehretat erlebt Deutschland einen historischen Wendepunkt in der Verteidigungspolitik. Für Kanzler Friedrich Merz gehören Wirtschaftswende, Wettbewerbsfähigkeit und Rüstung zusammen. Aber kommt die „Zeitenwende“ auch in der Realwirtschaft an? Wo bremsen Bürokratie, europäische Konflikte und politische Kontrolle? In dieser Premierenfolge analysieren Joana Lehner und Jürgen Klöckner die drei größten Probleme für die Rüstungsindustrie.
Im Policy-Talk ist Sven Kruck zu Gast. Er ist der Co-CEO von Deutschlands erfolgreichstem Drohnenhersteller Quantum Systems. Kruck spricht darüber, wie Rüstungsgeschäfte eingefädelt werden, zum Beispiel jetzt auf der Münchner Sicherheitskonferenz. Er erklärt, wie er den Wettbewerb mit den etablierten Konzernen wie Airbus oder Rheinmetall erlebt. Außerdem ordnet er ein, warum höhere Verteidigungsausgaben noch keine strategische Klarheit bedeuten.
Und: Chris Lunday, der für POLITICO über Sicherheits- und Verteidigungspolitik berichtet, gibt Einblicke darin, welche persönliche Rolle Verteidigungsminister Boris Pistorius bei Rüstungsdeals spielt.

Bonta sues to block Trump funding threat over student ‘forced outing’ law
2026-02-12 13:00:00 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/bonta-sues-to-block-trump-funding-threat-over-student-forced-outing-law-00777571

California Attorney General Rob Bonta is suing the Trump administration in an effort to preemptively block it from pulling federal funding over a state law regarding how schools notify parents about a student’s gender identity.
The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in the Northern District of California, claims the Trump administration’s threat last month to withhold education funds creates an “imminent risk of irreparable harm” to the state. It also argues that the administration does not have authority to “impose new conditions” on California to receive the money.
The state receives $4.9 billion a year for schools from the federal government,
according to the filing
. Bonta, who is seeking a temporary restraining order to block the threatened funding cut, said in a statement that the Department of Education is trying to “intimidate” state officials under the guise of enforcing federal law.
“If this funding were disrupted, children in California would suffer irreparable, lifelong harms to their intellectual and personal development,” the lawsuit states.
At issue is a California law that aims to prevent forced outings of students by barring school districts from requiring that staff share information with parents about their child’s gender identity. Last month, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon
said a federal investigation
determined state officials “egregiously abused” their authority and that the law had the effect of pressuring local school districts to keep quiet about transgender students. McMahon said the state could resolve the alleged violations by directing districts to make parents aware of the “gender support plans” they have for students and to clarify for district officials that the state law, AB 1955, does not override federal law.
State education officials have maintained that the state is in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a federal law that gives parents the right to inspect their child's school records. They
wrote again in a letter
to school districts on Wednesday that AB 1955 “does not contradict parents' rights to request to inspect and review their student's education records under FERPA, even if they contain information related to a student's sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression.”
A date for a hearing on the restraining order has not been set.

Russia throttles Telegram, and its own troops say targeting now takes hours instead of minutes
2026-02-12 12:57:28 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/russia-throttles-telegram-and-its-own-troops-say-targeting-now-takes-hours-instead-of-minutes/

Russia's throttling of Telegram is disrupting its own military's battlefield coordination, with occupying forces warning that intelligence relay times have ballooned from minutes to hours, Russian milbloggers said. The slowdown compounds existing communication problems after Russian troops recently access to Starlink internet — which also cut off their use of Discord, since they relied on Starlink to bypass Russia's own block of the platform —stripping away yet another pillar of the communication infrastructure their frontline operations depend on.
As Russia's full-scale war against Ukraine nears its fifth year, the Kremlin's
expanding internet censorship
is colliding with its military's deep dependence on platforms it cannot fully control for basic battlefield functions — a structural vulnerability that no state-controlled app can quickly fix.
Drone intelligence goes stale before it reaches gunners
A Russian military blogger described a concrete scenario
showing how the Telegram throttling wrecks their fire-response chain
,
Militarnyi
reports. A reconnaissance drone spots a moving target and relays the data to operational officers within a minute. Without Telegram, that same information must travel through internal military chain of command and control — first to a unit commander, then to an intelligence command post, then onward to other units for fire missions, and back again through the same chain.
"In the best case, information will take several hours to transmit instead of 1-2 minutes via Telegram,"
the Russian milbloggers complain, according to Militarnyi.
The problem is not just speed. Reconnaissance data loses relevance within 10-15 minutes, Russian forces say, rendering fire strikes pointless by the time orders reach the gunners. With Telegram, operational officers communicated directly, and response to a target took mere seconds.
A rollback "to the beginning of the war"
Russian Telegram channel Arkhangel Spetsnaza
warned
that the throttling could destroy established communication channels. Russian users began reporting widespread Telegram disruptions on 9 February. The Kremlin is using the restrictions to push citizens toward MAX, a state-controlled messaging app.

Russia used Starlink in strike drones that reached Kyiv. SpaceX’s response collapsed entire command systemic
The state-induced issues with Telegram compounds the earlier
Starlink shutdown
for the Russian forces on 5 February, who had been illegally using the satellite internet network in Ukraine. Without Starlink-provided internet at frontline positions, intelligence transmission had
already slowed
. Telegram's throttling adds another layer of delay at the command level.
"
To a significant degree, this will roll us back several years — approximately to the beginning of the war
. Alternative methods are already being developed, but restoring effective coordination will take a long time,
" the Russians stated.
Russian forces have built their frontline communication system largely on platforms beyond the Kremlin's control. Starlink, an American satellite system, provided internet between headquarters at the front. Discord — another American platform Russia officially blocked in 2024 — carried video feeds and real-time coordination. And Telegram, though created by Russian-born Pavel Durov, operates allegedly outside Russia's jurisdiction. The Russian military ran all three.
Kremlin denies reality, milbloggers push back
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated on 11 February that he "cannot imagine" Russian forces use Telegram or other messenger platforms for frontline communications
,
ISW
reports. State Duma Defense Committee Chairperson Andrei Kartapolov similarly claimed Russian forces "minimally" use Telegram during combat operations.
Russian milbloggers accused both officials of lying or not understanding how the military actually operates. One questioned whether Kartapolov receives "distorted" reports about the frontline situation, ISW notes.
The milbloggers had already complained about Roskomnadzor's throttling on 9 and 10 February, warning it would have serious implications for Russian command and control
. The Kremlin's attempt to respond only triggered further criticism.
"
The milbloggers’ widespread criticisms highlight how the Kremlin is trying to balance its longer-term censorship objectives, including a possible full block on Telegram in the future, with the need to avoid domestic backlash,
" ISW wrote.
The loss of Starlink, Discord, and now degraded Telegram exposes a fundamental weakness in
Russian command and control
: an army that built its modern coordination on platforms it neither owns nor can replace.

Norwegian police search homes of ex-PM Jagland in Epstein probe
2026-02-12 12:57:09 GMT
https://www.reuters.com/world/norwegian-police-search-homes-ex-pm-jagland-epstein-probe-2026-02-12/

Summary
Jagland accused of aggravated corruption, denies visiting Epstein's island
Investigation follows release of Epstein-related files implicating European figures
Jagland welcomes investigation, wants the matter to be clarified
OSLO, Feb 12 (Reuters) - Norwegian police searched the homes of former prime minister Thorbjoern Jagland on Thursday, his lawyer said, as part of
an ongoing investigation
into ties between prominent Norwegians and late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Images circulated by Norwegian dailies VG, Dagbladet, Dagens Naeringsliv and Aftenposten showed investigators carrying cardboard boxes into Jagland's Oslo residence.

here.
The raid came
a day after
the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights watchdog, which Jagland led from 2009 to 2019, lifted his diplomatic immunity.
"Oekokrim is currently conducting searches of Thorbjoern Jagland's residence and recreational properties. This was expected and is a standard part of an investigation of this nature," Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet said in a statement.
Jagland is now accused of aggravated corruption, his lawyer added, under Norway's legal code that precedes formal charging and allows a suspect to get a lawyer and the police to arrest a suspect at some point.
In Norway, formal charges are brought against someone much later in the legal process, sometimes only weeks before a court case begins.
"This does not represent any real change in the substance of the case, but is a legal consequence of the investigative methods used by the police," said Brosveet.
Oekokrim did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Last week, Oekokrim said it had opened an investigation into Jagland, who is also a former foreign minister and ex-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, on suspicion of aggravated corruption.
"I am very glad that the matter is being clarified," Jagland was quoted as saying by Aftenposten on Thursday.
JAGLAND WANTS CASE 'THOROUGHLY CLARIFIED'
"Jagland wishes to contribute to ensuring that the case is thoroughly clarified, and the next step is that he will appear for questioning by Oekokrim – as he himself has stated he wants," Brosveet said. "We will adhere to the process and continue to fully cooperate with the authorities."
The decision to investigate was based on information revealed by newly released files related to Epstein, a financier and convicted U.S. sex offender who died in prison in 2019.
The files indicate, among other things, that Jagland and Epstein's assistants made detailed plans in 2014 for Jagland, his wife, two children and his son's girlfriend to visit Epstein in Palm Beach, Florida, and the Caribbean island that he owned.
Jagland has denied ever visiting Epstein's private island.
The former premier has not been charged with any crime but the investigation will seek to uncover whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his official position, police have said.
In a 2014 email, Jagland sought Epstein's help in financing an apartment in Oslo.
Emails from 2018 show Epstein asking Jagland to arrange for him to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and saying he had insights to offer President Vladimir Putin. Jagland promised to bring it up with Lavrov's assistant.
The U.S. Justice Department's release of millions of internal documents related to Epstein has exposed his ties to a
range of European figures
in business, academia, government and royalty.

Israel, 'Blackwater' played key role in Congo town's recapture
2026-02-12 12:56:45 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-blackwater-played-key-role-congo-towns-recapture

Blackwater founder
Erik Prince
deployed a private security force to operate drones and help the Democratic Republic of Congo's army secure the strategic city of Uvira against Rwanda-backed rebels, four people briefed on the mission said, with the Israeli advisors also playing a role in the campaign.
The
AFC/M23 rebels
briefly seized the city on the border with Burundi in December - a major blow to ongoing US and Qatar-backed peace negotiations. They withdrew after Washington threatened to retaliate.
Prince, a supporter of US President Donald Trump and who founded the now defunct private security firm
Blackwater
, had been hired by the government in Kinshasa to help secure and improve tax revenue collection from Congo's vast mineral reserves.
However, the operation to help elite forces recapture
Uvira
from AFC/M23 rebels is the first known instance of the now-defunct Prince's private security forces on the frontline in Congo, widening his role in the decades-long conflict.
A spokesperson for Prince declined to comment. The Congolese presidency and a local army spokesperson did not respond to queries.
US offers help in exchange for minerals access
One source, a senior security official in Congo, said the presence of US-linked contractors would likely deter AFC/M23 forces, which may be unwilling to risk direct confrontation with Prince's personnel.
The US has offered Congo support, brokering an end to the
conflict
in return for access to the nation's critical mineral resources.
While it is not clear whether the involvement of Prince on Congo's frontlines was endorsed by Washington, the operation to help the Kinshasa government retake Uvira followed US calls for the rebels to withdraw.
The US State Department said it did not hold any contracts with Prince or any of his companies.
The Congolese security official said the operation is "in line with the minerals-for-security deal".
Prince's team in Congo deployed to Uvira at Kinshasa's request, one of the sources said, to bolster their efforts at a critical time. The team has since withdrawn and returned to its primary mission, which is improving revenue collection from mining.
"They needed help recapturing Uvira and pulled in every resource they could. Focus is back on the tax police project now," said the person briefed on the operation. Another source said Prince's team may continue to deploy to the frontline when requested by Kinshasa.
One of the sources said Prince's contractors provided drone support to Congolese special operations forces and the army against M23 rebels in Uvira and the South Kivu highlands. The sources declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Israelis in Congo with a training mandate
Prince's contractors operated in coordination with
Israeli advisers
who were involved in training two Congolese special forces battalions on day and night operations, according to a fifth source briefed on the operation.
"Their mandate (the Israelis) is training only," one of them said, without elaborating further on why the Israelis had joined the operation. The Israeli embassy in Luanda, which covers Congo, and the Israeli Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Fighting in the decades-long conflict flared early last year, with M23 fighters making rapid gains in the east, which is rich in tantalum, gold, lithium and other minerals.
The
United Nations
and Western powers say Rwanda backs M23, even exercising command and control over the group, though Rwanda denies this.
Rwanda and Congo signed a US-brokered peace agreement in June last year. However, the accord did not involve the AFC/M23. Congo's conflict is rooted in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, when remnants of a Hutu militia that slaughtered over a million mostly Tutsi people fled across the border, chased by Tutsi-led Rwandan forces. Rwanda denies having troops in Congo.

Republicans’ edge on immigration shrinks as independents balk at Trump’s tactics, AP-NORC poll shows

2026-02-12T12:05:08Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — About 6 in 10 U.S. adults say President Donald Trump has “gone too far” in sending federal immigration agents into American cities, according to a new AP-NORC poll that suggests political independents are increasingly uncomfortable with his tactics.
Views of Trump’s handling of immigration — which fell over the course of his first year — remained steady over the past month, with about 4 in 10 saying they approve of the president’s approach. But the poll from
The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research
also found that the Republican Party’s advantage on Trump’s signature political issue has shrunk since October.
About 3 in 10 U.S. adults trust Republicans to do a better job handling immigration, while a similar share say the same of Democrats. An additional 3 in 10, roughly, don’t think either party would do a better job handling the issue, and about 1 in 10 say both parties would handle it equally well.
The Republican president’s core supporters remain overwhelmingly supportive of Trump’s immigration tactics. But there are signs that more independents think he’s going too far.
“I am glad that immigrants aren’t just flooding across the border, but what he’s doing now in our cities, pitting the military against our people, these are gestapo tactics,” said independent Brenda Shaw, a 65-year-old human resources manager from South Haven, Michigan. “They’re shooting U.S. citizens in the face and in the back.”
The new polling comes as the nation watches the human impact of Trump’s crackdown in Minneapolis, where thousands of heavily armed masked agents have descended upon the city to find and remove immigrants in the country illegally.
There have also been numerous violent clashes with protesters, including two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents in recent weeks. About 6 in 10 Americans believe that Trump has “gone too far” when using federal law enforcement at public protests in U.S. cities, the poll found.
Republicans stay behind Trump on immigration
While about 9 in 10 Democrats and about 7 in 10 independents say Trump has “gone too far” in sending federal immigration agents into U.S. cities and using federal law enforcement at public protests, only about one-quarter of Republicans agree.
According to the new survey, about half of Republicans say that Trump’s actions have been “about right,” while about one-quarter of Republicans say he hasn’t gone far enough. Their support for the president hasn’t wavered despite the chaos in Minneapolis.
Teviss Crawford, a 20-year-old student from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said he’s pleased with Trump’s leadership on immigration, although he wishes the president could find a way to deport more immigrants who are in the country illegally.
“I don’t think the deportations have been enough, to be honest. I think it’s much too lax,” he said of Trump’s crackdown. “If you crossed into our country illegally, it’s just not right. You’re taking things away from people who were born here.”
Crawford added that Trump “should be focusing on violent criminals, but the violent criminals are probably harder to find.”
Independents largely disapprove of the current immigration enforcement approach
Despite their strong support for Trump, Republicans are increasingly alone in supporting Trump on his immigration enforcement tactics.
Trump’s approval on immigration appears to have fallen among independents since last spring, from 37% in March 2025 to 23% in the new poll. There is greater variability in surveying small groups, like independents, which creates more uncertainty about the magnitude of changes. About 6 in 10 independents now say Trump has “gone too far” in deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, an apparent increase from 46% in an AP-NORC poll in April.
Most U.S. adults, including independents, have an unfavorable view of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, commonly referred to as ICE. Overall, only about 3 in 10 U.S. adults have a favorable view of the agency, the AP-NORC poll found.
There is an large partisan gap, with independents much closer to Democrats than Republicans. Only about 1 in 10 Democrats and roughly 2 in 10 independents have a favorable view of ICE, compared to about 7 in 10 Republicans.
“Having the border shut, that’s OK. But what Trump is doing with ICE and Homeland Security? You don’t go yanking people out of cars. You don’t go shooting people,” said independent Rick Kinnett, a 60-year-old Navy veteran from Crawfordsville, Indiana.
“I spent eight years in the military. This is not what I signed up for,” he said. “This is not what we’re supposed to do. This is not constitutional.”
Trump’s weak numbers hold steady
Trump’s approval on immigration has not moved since January despite a month of immigration-related turmoil.
About 38% of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of immigration more broadly, in line with an
January AP-NORC poll
conducted just after the death of Renee Good, the first U.S. citizen in Minnesota killed by federal agents.
The president’s overall approval rating has declined slightly since the beginning of his second term and remains low.
Overall, 36% of U.S. adults say they approve of the way Trump is handling the presidency. His approval ratings on the economy and foreign policy are similar to his overall approval and functionally unchanged from January.
Historically, such numbers would push members of a president’s party to distance themselves from him — especially heading into a midterm election season. However, Trump’s allies in Washington and in state capitals across the nation remain overwhelmingly united behind him, reflecting consistently strong support from Republicans in the polls.
But Trump’s immigration approach seems to be a particularly sore spot for independents. While he appears to have slid with independents on immigration, Trump’s approval on the economy — the other signature issue where he’s recently been criticized for failing to deliver on campaign promises — is similar to where it was last spring.
And the narrowing of Republicans’ advantage on immigration is a warning sign for Trump’s party. In October, 39% of U.S. adults said they trusted the Republicans to better handle immigration, while 26% said that about the Democrats, giving the GOP a 13-point edge. In the new poll, the difference between the parties is only 4 points.
“What he’s doing with ICE is the worst thing right now. I would say the economy is the second worst thing,” said Shaw, the human resources manager from Michigan. “I’m getting ready to retire and I’m wondering how I’m going to make it.”
“But I’m blessed,” she added. “I don’t have to hide in the basement because my skin is brown.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,156 adults was conducted Feb. 5-8 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.

Five killed in Gaza, as Israel pounds Khan Younis, Jabalia camp
2026-02-12 12:50:14 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/five-killed-gaza-israel-pounds-khan-younis-jabalia-camp

Israeli
aircraft and artillery have targeted Khan Younis in the southern
Gaza Strip
and the Jabalia refugee camp in the north, in another breach of the ceasefire covering the enclave.
Israeli forces destroyed the remaining schools operated by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) in Jabalia refugee camp after shelling the area.
A Palestinian child was also
shot
in the back while sleeping in a tent in the al-Maslakh area. Israeli troops have repeatedly opened fire on areas not under their control, often with indiscriminate gunfire.
At least five Palestinians were killed and four injured in Israeli attacks over the past 24 hours, Gaza’s health ministry said.
The UN has begun clearing waste from the Fras Market in Gaza City, where rubbish had accumulated to around 300,000 cubic metres, reaching heights of 13 metres, according to Alessandro Mrakic, head of the UN Development Programme.
The UNDP plans to transfer the waste to a new 75,000-square-metre site to enable daily collection, Mrakic told
Reuters
.
Hamas
said it would support the deployment of Indonesian troops to Gaza as part of a proposed "International Stabilisation Force", with spokesperson Hazem Qasem stating that any deployment must be strictly for peacekeeping purposes.
Osama Hamdan, another Hamas official, denied that the group had received any formal disarmament proposals from mediators, reiterating that "resistance is a right as long as the [Israeli] occupation continues".
Palestinians continue to enter and leave Gaza in limited numbers after the Rafah crossing reopened last week, mostly for medical treatment abroad.
Gaza’s government media office said only 488 people have
used the crossing
since its reopening, including 275 who departed and 213 who returned.
In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces stormed the home of Musab Dweiyat in Sur Baher, East Jerusalem, days after his release from prison, according to the Palestinian news agency
Wafa
.
Forces also raided the Wadi Qaddum neighbourhood of Silwan, while Israeli settlers entered the town of al-Eizariya south of Jerusalem.
The raids follow
demolitions
carried out by Israeli forces in the Wadi al-Qarashiya area of Yatta and in Beit Ummar north of Hebron, while settlers forced 15 families to flee their homes near Jericho.
The latest incursions come amid backlash over new Israeli regulations governing land purchases in the occupied West Bank, which critics say further entrench
annexation
. The UN, EU, Germany, the UK and Canada have condemned the move.

UN agency begins clearing huge Gaza City waste dump
2026-02-12 12:49:29 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/un-agency-begins-clearing-huge-gaza-city-waste-dump

The
United Nations Development Programme
began clearing a huge wartime garbage dump on Wednesday that has swallowed one of Gaza City's oldest commercial districts and is an environmental and health risk.
Alessandro Mrakic, head of the UNDP Gaza Office, said work had started to remove the
solid-waste
mound that has overtaken the once busy Fras Market in the Palestinian enclave's main city.
He put the volume of the dump at more than 300,000 cubic metres (390,000 cubic yards) and 13 metres (14 yards) high.
It formed after municipal crews were blocked from reaching Gaza's main landfill in the Juhr al-Dik area, adjacent to the border with Israel, when the Gaza war began in October 2023.
The area in Juhr al-Dik is now under full Israeli control.
Over the next six months, UNDP plans to transfer the waste to a new temporary site prepared in the Abu Jarad area south of Gaza City and built to meet environmental standards.
The site covers 75,000 square metres and will also accommodate daily collection, Mrakic said in a statement sent to
Reuters
. The project is funded by the Humanitarian Fund and the European Union's Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations.
Some Palestinians sifted through the garbage, looking for things to take away, but there was relief that the market space would eventually be cleared.
"It needs to be moved to a site with a complex of old waste, far away from people. There's no other solution. What will this cause? It will cause us gases, it will cause us diseases, it will cause us germs," elderly Gazan Abu Issa said near the site.
The
Gaza Municipality
confirmed the start of the relocation effort in collaboration with the UNDP, calling it an urgent step to contain a worsening solid-waste crisis after about 350,000 cubic metres of rubbish accumulated in the heart of the city.
'A symbol of the war'
Fras Market, an historic quarter that before the war served nearly 600,000 residents with items ranging from food to clothes and household tools, has been buried under garbage for more than a year.
Amjad al-Shawa, head of the Palestinian NGOs Network and a liaison with UN and international agencies, said the dump had fuelled "serious health and environmental problems and the spread of insects and illnesses."
"It is a symbol of the war that continued for two years," he told Reuters. "Its removal may give people a sense of hope that the ceasefire (agreed last October) is moving forward."
Shawa said the waste would be transported to a transitional site near the former Netzarim settlement in central Gaza until Israeli forces withdraw from eastern areas and municipal access to the permanent landfills can be restored.
UNDP said it had collected more than 570,000 tons of solid waste across Gaza since the offensive began as part of its emergency response to avert a further deterioration in
public health
conditions.
The ‎number of temporary dumpsites has decreased from 141 to 56 as part of efforts in 2024-25 to remove smaller dumping sites, a UNDP report last December said.
"However, only 10 to 12 of these temporary dumping sites are accessible and operational, and ‎Gaza's two main sanitary landfills remain inaccessible. The environmental and public health risks ‎remain critical," it added.

No decision yet after cancelling Project Lily vessel
2026-02-12 12:48:36 GMT
https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/no-decision-yet-after-cancelling-project-lily-vessel/

The Ministry of Defence is considering whether to launch a replacement competition for an uncrewed surface vessel capability after formally terminating procurement activity under Project Lily.
In a written parliamentary answer published on 11 February, Defence Minister Luke Pollard responded to a question from Conservative MP James Cartlidge on whether a new competition would be started to replace the programme.
Pollard said Project Lily had been intended to deliver an uncrewed surface vessel and an associated remote operations centre capability, but confirmed the programme had now been cancelled.
He stated:
“Project Lily related to a proposed procurement to deliver an uncrewed surface vessel and associated remote operations centre capability.”
Pollard added:
“Project Lily was cancelled following a decision to consider alternative internal options to meet this requirement.”
He said the Ministry was still considering what approach to take next, including whether a replacement competition would be pursued.
“The decision on whether to pursue a replacement competition or an alternative approach is under consideration in line with procurement rules.”
He added that if any future procurement was required, it would be announced through standard channels.
“Should any future procurement be required, details of the opportunity will be published in the usual way via the Defence Sourcing Portal.”
The response follows earlier UK Defence Journal reporting that the MoD had formally terminated plans to procure an uncrewed surface vessel under Project Lily, ending a programme expected to deliver a contractor-supported autonomous maritime platform for global operations. A termination notice published by Defence Equipment and Support confirmed that the contract would not be signed and that the procurement was no longer going ahead, with the decision taken on 16 January 2026.
Project Lily had previously been trailed in a procurement pipeline notice issued in May 2025 under the Procurement Act 2023. That notice outlined plans to acquire a single commercial off-the-shelf uncrewed surface vessel, alongside a dedicated Remote Operations Centre, intended to support year-round operations in open ocean environments. The estimated value of the programme was £27.3 million including VAT, with a planned contract duration of four years from January 2026 to January 2030.
The proposed capability was intended to support military data-gathering tasks, with a particular focus on hydrographic and oceanographic activity. Early documentation suggested the vessel would initially operate under a Government Owned, Commercially Operated model for two years, before transitioning to Government Owned, Government Operated status with continued commercial support.
No explanation beyond “procurement no longer going ahead” was provided in the termination notice, and the MoD has not yet set out whether elements of the requirement may be revisited in revised form or absorbed into other programmes.

Every February – or occasionally March – I get together with two friends to gorge on pancakes; I provide the pan, Caro does the cocktails and poor old Harry is invariably the chef because she never fails, even three ciders in. With two half-Frenchies in the room, we always start with
buckwheat galettes
, usually served

with gruyère, ham and a fried egg (though the more we eat, the more adventurous the combinations become). Then we move on to softer, thicker
British sweet pancakes
with lemon juice and crunchy demerara sugar to finish. We rarely manage to meet on Shrove Tuesday itself, but apart from the year I went vegan for Lent, that’s no problem. After all, any cold, dark evening is improved by a pancake party.
I suspect we’re not alone in sticking with the classics, so I’m not going to suggest too many alternatives, but, given that pancakes are not just for the 47th day before Easter, I do like the sound of Nigel Slater’s ones

22,000 Palestinians detained in West Bank since Gaza war start
2026-02-12 12:37:07 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/22000-palestinians-detained-west-bank-gaza-war-start

Israeli forces
have detained around 22,000 Palestinians in the
occupied West Bank
, including East Jerusalem, since the start of Israel's genocidal
war in Gaza in October 2023
, according to the
Palestinian Prisoners' Club.
The figure includes
those who remain behind bars as well as those later released, marking an unprecedented surge in arrests over just two and a half years.
The number does not include thousands detained in Gaza or arrests of Palestinian citizens of Israel.
In a statement on Thursday, the Ramallah-based rights organisation said arrest raids were continuing at a worringly "escalating pace".
At least 40 Palestinians were detained between Wednesday evening and Thursday morning alone, including four women and a child, as well as former prisoners.
The group accused Israeli forces of carrying out "unprecedented crimes and violations" during arrest operations, including severe beatings, systematic intimidation of detainees and their families, widespread destruction of homes, and the confiscation of vehicles, cash and gold jewellery.
It said infrastructure has been damaged, family homes demolished, and relatives "taken hostage" in a bid to pressure prisoners.
The Palestinian Prisoners' Club (PPC) said that some detainees were used as human shields and that several field executions had been carried out during raids.
These arrests were being used as "cover" to expand illegal Jewish settlements across the West Bank, the group warned.
Thousands have been subjected to sweeping field interrogations since the beginning of the Gaza war, with abuses committed by Israeli soldiers during interrogations comparable to torture inflicted on prisoners in formal detention centres.
The PPC said Israel's policy of daily mass arrests is one of its most entrenched colonial tools, historically used to suppress Palestinian political life and collective resistance.
Despite a ceasefire agreement in Gaza, the group said the arrest campaign had escalated, arguing that Israel's broader assault across Palestinian territories remains ongoing.
In a report last month,
Israeli rights group B'Tselem described
some Israeli prisons as operating as "torture camps", documenting sexual, physical and psychological abuse, deliberate starvation and denial of medical care.
At least 84 Palestinian detainees have died in Israeli custody since October 2023, according to
B'Tselem.

NATO chief Rutte defends US role on Ukraine, says Washington is doing “exactly what we need”

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte rejected suggestions that the United States is not putting enough pressure on Russia to end its aggression against Ukraine, speaking to journalists before a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels on 12 February.
When asked about alleged insufficient pressure from Washington on Moscow, Rutte called such accusations unfair.
"The very premise of the question is unfair. The US is putting various pressure on Russia, as the Europeans are doing – through sanction packages... Look at what's happening with Lukoil, Rosneft and others," Rutte said, according to
Ukinform
. He said that the US continues to provide Ukraine with critically important weapons through the PURL initiative.
Addressing the presence of US Deputy Defense Secretary Elbridge Colby at the meeting, Rutte pointed out that this official has consistently advocated for strengthening the defense capabilities of European allies.
The Secretary General also emphasized Washington's leading role in peace initiatives.
"There is only one country, the most powerful nation on Earth, the US, that can do this under President Trump's leadership, break the deadlock with Putin, start a peace process," Rutte said, adding that the US is doing "exactly what we need when it comes to Ukraine."
Rutte highlighted what he called "good news" from British Defense Minister John Healey, who announced £500 million for air defense through both bilateral aid and the PURL program.
"The Ukrainians are unwavering, they are fighting, but missiles continue to hit their civilian infrastructure and civilians," Rutte said.
He noted that the overall trend in NATO shows European allies and Canada are increasing their support: "More billions for defense, ramping up the defense industrial base, supporting Ukraine's resilience."
According to Ukrinform, the NATO defense ministers meeting at Alliance headquarters in Brussels on 12 February includes a Ukraine-NATO Council session and a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, jointly chaired by the UK and Germany.

Zelenskyy: 13 Russians at Olympics deserve to be disqualified, not Ukraine's Heraskevych
2026-02-12 12:32:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020696/

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has criticised the decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych, who had planned to compete in a helmet featuring portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed by Russian forces.
Source:
Zelenskyy on
X (Twitter)
Quote:
"
Sport shouldn't mean amnesia, and the Olympic movement should help stop wars, not play into the hands of aggressors. Unfortunately, the decision of the International Olympic Committee to disqualify Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says otherwise. This is certainly not about the principles of Olympism, which are founded on fairness and the support of peace.
I thank our athlete for his clear stance. His helmet, bearing the portraits of fallen Ukrainian athletes, is about honour and remembrance. It is a reminder to the whole world of what Russian aggression is and the cost of fighting for independence. And in this, no rule has been broken."
Details:
Zelenskyy pointed out that despite calls for a ceasefire during the Winter Olympic Games, Russia continues to increase its missile and drone attacks on Ukraine.
Quote:
"
660 Ukrainian athletes and coaches have been killed by Russia since the full-scale invasion began. Hundreds of our athletes will never again be able to take part in the Olympic Games or any other international competitions. And yet, 13 Russians are currently in Italy competing at the Olympics.
They compete under 'neutral' flags at the Games, while in real life publicly supporting Russian aggression against Ukraine and the occupation of our territories. And they are the ones who deserve disqualification.
"
Background:
Heraskevych will not be able to compete at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games due to
his disqualification by the IOC
.
The 27-year-old athlete from Kyiv was barred from the competition after wearing his "
remembrance helmet
" during training sessions.

German parliament says speaker has visited Gaza
2026-02-12 12:24:54 GMT

The speaker of Germany's lower house of parliament briefly visited the Israeli-controlled part of the
Gaza Strip
on Thursday, the body told
AFP
.
Julia Kloeckner spent "about an hour in the part of Gaza controlled by Israeli army forces", parliament said in response to an
AFP
query, becoming the first German official to visit the territory since the outbreak of the genocidal war in October 2023.
Since the start of the offensive, Israel has drastically
restricted access
to the densely populated coastal strip.
Kloeckner welcomed that "Israel has made it possible, with me, for the first time, for a parliamentary observer to access the Gaza Strip", in comments to German public broadcaster
ZDFHeute
.
She called on Israel to "pursue this path of opening".
The German foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment from
AFP
.
Germany has been one of Israel's
staunchest supporters
as the European power seeks to atone for the legacy of the Holocaust.
But in recent months, Chancellor
Friedrich Merz
has occasionally delivered sharp critiques of Israeli policy as German public opinion turns against Israel's actions in Gaza.
In August, Germany imposed a partial
arms embargo
on Israel.
The embargo was lifted in November, after the announcement of what has proved to be a fragile ceasefire for Gaza.
Merz
visited
Israel in December and reaffirmed Germany's support.
But in a sign of lingering tension, Germany's foreign ministry on Wednesday criticised Israeli plans to tighten control over the occupied West Bank as a step toward "de facto annexation".

Rutte says Trump has ‘a big point’ on Arctic security
2026-02-12 12:24:28 GMT
https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/rutte-says-trump-has-a-big-point-on-arctic-security/

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has said US President Donald Trump has “a big point” on Arctic security, as NATO launched a new initiative aimed at increasing coordination and vigilance in the High North amid growing Russian and Chinese activity.
Speaking at NATO Headquarters in Brussels ahead of the Defence Ministers meeting on 12 February, Rutte confirmed NATO had launched “Arctic Sentry” just hours before the press conference, describing it as a major step in bringing Allied activity in the region under a single operational approach. Asked whether Arctic Sentry was linked to Trump’s repeated focus on Greenland and Arctic sea routes, Rutte said the US President’s concerns were justified and should be taken seriously.
“It’s important that we collectively understand that he has a big point here, and that he is very clear on Arctic security and risks of the opening sea lanes we see there,”
Rutte said.
He warned that the opening of Arctic sea lanes would increase the presence and activity of both Russia and China, and said NATO could not afford to be complacent.
“The Russians and the Chinese will become increasingly more active there, and therefore we have to be very watchful and not naive,”
he added.
Rutte said Arctic Sentry was one of several workstreams discussed following his meeting with Trump in Davos, and described it as a concrete result of that strategic direction.
“This is one, making sure that NATO collectively will take more responsibility for the protection of the Arctic. And Arctic Sentry is a clear result of that,”
he said.
He confirmed that NATO would coordinate Arctic activities under Supreme Allied Commander Europe, with responsibility delegated to Joint Force Command Norfolk, and said the initiative would draw on Allied Command Transformation to incorporate emerging technologies and identify capability gaps. While he declined to go into further operational detail, Rutte said the approach was similar to NATO’s existing “Baltic Sentry” and “Eastern Sentry” initiatives, designed to improve coordination and readiness across sensitive regions.

Netherlands to transfer F-16 simulators to Ukraine for pilot training
2026-02-12 12:24:19 GMT
https://euromaidanpress.com/2026/02/12/netherlands-to-transfer-f-16-simulators-to-ukraine-for-pilot-training/

The Netherlands will soon deliver F-16 fighter jet simulators to Ukraine for pilot training, Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans
announced
in Brussels while responding to journalists' questions.
Brekelmans emphasized that Ukraine faces an extremely difficult winter.
"Over the past few weeks, the Netherlands has provided hundreds of millions of euros in aid in the form of drones and ammunition. Today, I can also announce that we will transfer F-16 simulators as we continue to assist Ukraine in operating these aircraft,"
says Brekelmans.
The Dutch official declined to provide specifics, noting that such details constitute valuable information for Russia as well. He added that long-term support levels will be maintained at the volumes provided in recent years and will be incorporated into the new government's budget. "So we can assure our allies and partners that we support Ukraine not only today and tomorrow, but also in the long term," Brekelmans said.
Denmark, together with the Netherlands, Norway and other allies, established the F-16 fighter jet aviation coalition for Ukraine, which includes aircraft deliveries as well as training for Ukrainian pilots and technicians. Denmark began training eight Ukrainian pilots on F-16s in August 2023.
Part of Denmark's F-16 fleet has already arrived in Ukraine, with additional batches scheduled to arrive gradually, according to available information. The United States has signed a contract for repair and maintenance of Ukrainian F-16 fighters in Belgium, valid through 2029.
Ukrainian military officials and partners stress that these aircraft significantly enhance Ukraine's ability to defend its airspace and perform more complex aerial missions.

KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russia launched a barrage of ballistic missiles and drones at Ukrainian cities in overnight attacks, officials reported on Thursday as Ukrainian President
Volodymyr Zelenskyy
said Moscow was “hesitating” about another round of
U.S.-brokered talks
on stopping the fighting.
Washington has proposed further negotiations next week
between Russian and Ukrainian delegations
in Miami or Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, which was the location of the last meeting, Zelenskyy said late Wednesday.
Ukraine “immediately confirmed” it would attend, he said. “So far, as I understand it, Russia is hesitating,” Zelenskyy told reporters in a messaging app interview late Wednesday.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that another round of talks was expected “soon” but gave no further details.
American officials made no comment on the possibility of further talks as part of a yearlong peace effort by the Trump administration. Zelenskyy said last week that the United States has given Ukraine and Russia a
June deadline to reach a deal
.
But with
Russia’s invasion of its neighbor
marking its fourth anniversary later this month, disagreements between Moscow and Kyiv over key issues have held up a comprehensive settlement. The issues include who keeps the Ukrainian land that Russia’s army has so far occupied, especially in the eastern Donbas industrial heartland, and Moscow’s demands for Kyiv to surrender more territory.
Ukraine wants
Western-backed security guarantees
, including a date for joining the European Union, and a postwar reconstruction package in place before it can contemplate signing a
proposed 20-point settlement
, Zelenskyy said.
Russia hammers civilian areas
Russia has meanwhile continued to
pound Ukrainian civilian areas
, including residential areas and the
power grid
, and Moscow has not responded to a U.S. proposal for an “energy ceasefire” that would also halt Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian oil facilities, Zelenskyy said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, urged Russia to stop hitting electricity infrastructure, reminding Moscow in a statement that targeting civilian infrastructure is prohibited under international humanitarian law.
Overnight from Wednesday to Thursday, Russia fired 219 long-range strike drones, 24 ballistic missiles and a guided aircraft missile at Ukraine, according to the Ukrainian air force.
The main targets were the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, the second-largest city of Kharkiv, Dnipro in central Ukraine, and the southern port city of Odesa, the air force said — all cities that have come under relentless bombardment.
In Dnipro, Russian strikes injured four people, including a 4-year-old girl and a newborn boy, regional head Oleksandr Hanzha wrote on Telegram.
In Kyiv, several residential buildings were damaged, and two people were injured, according to the city administration.
In Odesa, one person was injured as a residential high-rise was partially destroyed and a market and a supermarket caught fire, regional head Oleksandr Hanzha wrote on Telegram.
Temperatures have moved above freezing point in Kyiv, but it is still bitterly cold in the city.
Oleksii Kuleba, Deputy Prime Minister for the Restoration of Ukraine, said 2,600 buildings were left without heating after the Kyiv attack in addition to 1,100 buildings in the capital that already were without heating due to previous attacks.
In Odesa, nearly 300,000 residents were left without running water, Kuleba said, while in Dnipro the central heating system stopped working for some 10,000 people.
Ukraine strikes Russian oil and equipment
Ukraine has hit back at Russia with long-range strikes on military targets and oil refineries that generate a large slice of Russia’s income.
Ukraine’s General Staff said Thursday that one of its domestically produced,
long-range “Flamingo” missiles
hit one of the Russian military’s biggest storage sites for missiles, ammunition and explosives in the Volgograd region and caused major explosions.
Separately, Ukrainian forces also hit and started a fire at the Michurinsk Progress Plant in Russia’s Tambov region, a defense enterprise producing high-technology equipment for aviation and missile systems, the General Staff said.
Ukraine’s military also confirmed it damaged the Volgograd oil refinery in a strike the previous day.

Telegram Slowdown in Russia Disrupts Coordination of Russian Forces
2026-02-12 12:21:16 GMT
https://militarnyi.com/en/news/telegram-slowdown-disrupts-coordination/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=telegram-slowdown-disrupts-coordination

The slowdown of Telegram in Russia has worsened coordination between Russian military units.
The Russian invaders’
Arkhangel Spetsnaza
Telegram channel stated that the messenger slowdown could disrupt established communication channels.
Since February 9, Russian users have been actively reporting outages and disruptions in Telegram’s operation.
The Russian authorities are using restrictions on Telegram to try to force citizens to switch to the state-controlled MAX app.
Amid the
lack of Starlink internet access
at the invaders’ positions, intelligence transmission has already slowed. The lack of reliable access to Telegram will further complicate the situation, causing additional delays at the command level.

As an example, Russian troops describe the following scenario: a drone spots enemy movement and sends the information to operations officers within a minute. Without Telegram, the data must then be passed through internal communication channels to the unit commander and from there to the intelligence command post. The information is subsequently forwarded to other units to carry out a strike, and then the response is relayed back to the crew through the same chain.
“In the best-case scenario, it will take several hours to pass the information instead of just 1–2 minutes via Telegram,” the invaders complain.
Intelligence data loses its relevance within 10–15 minutes, making a fire strike pointless.
On Telegram, coordination between Russian operations officers occurs directly, and a response to a target can take only seconds.
“This will largely set us back several years, roughly to the beginning of the war. At the same time, alternative methods are already being developed, but restoring effective coordination will take considerable time,” the invaders noted.

To ensure reliable communications, the Russian army relies on foreign technologies. Internet connectivity between the headquarters at the front has often been provided through the American Starlink system.
Video communication and coordination are often conducted via the American messaging platform Discord, while communication between units is primarily organized through Telegram on Chinese smartphones.

Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office verifies more than 19,000 cases of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia
2026-02-12 12:21:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020693/

Ukrainian law enforcement authorities have been verifying information on more than 19,000 cases of the forced transfer of Ukrainian children to Russia. It has been reported that the figure is not final as the analysis continues.
Source:
Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine
Details:
The Prosecutor General's Office said that the deportation of children from territories temporarily occupied by Russian forces is one of the gravest war crimes documented by Ukrainian investigators.
Russia places children with Russian families, including military households, forces them to take Russian citizenship, teaches them under Russian curricula, sends them to "re-education" camps and in some cases issues draft notices to minors.
Quote:
"The materials gathered by the investigation indicate that these actions are of a systematic nature and are followed by measures aimed at changing the children's citizenship, integrating them into a different social environment and assimilating them.
In 2022, to speed up these processes, Russia simplified the procedure with regard to the children transferred from occupied areas of Ukraine to acquire Russian citizenship."
More details:
The Prosecutor General's Office describes the actions as a violation of international humanitarian law and a deliberate attempt to erase children's national identity and their ties to Ukraine
.
Quote from the Deputy Prosecutor General Viktor Lohachov:
"We are documenting not abstract figures but the individual stories of children and each established case of their unlawful transfer.
We are building an evidence base for national and international courts, working to bring back children who have been unlawfully removed and ensuring that everyone involved is held to account, without exception."
More details:
Ukraine has sent evidence of the illegal transfer of Ukrainian children to the International Criminal Court. Criminal proceedings have also been opened at the national level against those involved.
Background:
By September 2025, Russia had
forcibly transferred
almost 11,000 children to 164 camps in Russia and occupied Crimea since the start of the year.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has referred prosecutors to a French diplomat linked to Jeffrey Epstein, who is suspected of passing UN documents to the late convicted financier. The diplomat, Fabrice Aidan, accused of acting as a fixer for Epstein, reportedly provided him with contacts and information. Investigative site Mediapart notes he was also investigated by the FBI in 2013 over child pornography allegations while living in New York.

Susie Dent’s tips and tricks to add muscle to a child’s vocabulary
2026-02-12 12:18:23 GMT
https://www.theguardian.com/education/2026/feb/12/susie-dent-tips-tricks-child-vocabulary

To help combat the impact of screen-time creep, the Countdown word supremo has a few suggestions
Children’s vocabulary shrinking as reading loses out to screen time, says Susie Dent
Children’s vocabulary is shrinking as reading loses out to screen time, the Countdown lexicographer
Susie Dent has suggested
, as she urged families to read, talk and play word games to boost language development.
Dent, who also co-presents Channel 4’s
Secret Genius
with Alan Carr, is fronting a new campaign – working with an unexpected partner, Soreen malt loaf – aimed at boosting children’s vocabulary at snack time.
Reading.
Listening to audiobooks.
Sharing word stories and routinely going to the dictionary to find out where words come from.
Playing word games and puzzles, in print, online, with board games, or in the car.
Having conversations while doing active tasks with your child such as cooking or walking.
Asking your child to invent a new word, or to share the latest slang in their class.
Learn another language.
kerfuffle
One of Soreen’s choices, kerfuffle is from Scots that describes a commotion or fuss. Children love it because of its sound, but it also adds a touch of humour to an otherwise tricky situation.
mellifluous
Not only does this word have a pleasing sound, fulfilling the very quality it describes, but its etymology is also gorgeous – mellifluous comes from the Latin for flowing like honey.
thrill
I chose this one because of its secret life. Something thrilling today is always positive, but in its earliest incarnation, to thrill meant to pierce someone with a sword rather than with excitement. The literal meaning of thrill was a hole, which is why our nostrils began as our nose-thrills, or nose holes.
apricity
This is one of the many words in the Oxford English Dictionary that were recorded only once before fading away like a linguistic mayfly. Apricity, from 1623, means the warmth of the sun on a winter’s day. The word is as beautiful as the sensation it describes.
susurrus
Say this word out loud and you will know its meaning instantly. Susurrus comes from the Latin for whispering and describes the rustling of leaves in a summer breeze.
bags of mystery
This Victorian nickname for sausages always makes me smile. It was inspired by the fact that you can never quite know what’s in them.
snerdle
English has a vast lexicon for snuggling, from nuddling, neezling and snoozling to snuggening, croodling and snerdling. Each of them expresses the act of lying quietly beneath the covers. Mind you, if you lie there a little bit too long, you could be accused of hurkle-durkling, old Scots for staying in bed long after it’s time to get up.
splendiferous
Another of Soreen’s picks, this word has a distinct touch of Mary Poppins about it. In the middle ages it meant simply resplendent, but since the 19th century it has been a humorous description of anything considered rather magnificent.
ruthful
The historical dictionary is full of lost positives – words whose negative siblings are alive and well while their parents have faded away. As well as being gormless, inept, unkempt, uncouth and disconsolate, you could in the past be full of gorm, ept, kempt, couth, and consolate. Best of all is surely ruthful, the counterpart to ruthless which means full of compassion.
muscle
Another word with a hidden backstory, and this one often makes children laugh. In ancient times, athletes would exercise in the buff in order to show off their rippling muscles (the words gym and gymnasium go back to the Greek for exercise naked). To the Roman imagination, when an athlete flexed their biceps, it looked as though a little mouse was scuttling beneath their skin. Our word muscle consequently comes from the Latin
musculus
, little mouse.

IOC restores disqualified Ukrainian skeleton racer Heraskevych's accreditation for 2026 Winter Olympics
2026-02-12 12:18:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020692/

Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych has been allowed to remain at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games, although he is banned from competing.
Source:
the
website
of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)
Details:
Following a "
very respectful conversation"
with Heraskevych, IOC President Kirsty Coventry asked the chair of the IOC Disciplinary Commission to review the decision to revoke the athlete's accreditation. The chair granted the request.
Heraskevych therefore retains the right to remain at the Games as an accredited person, although he is not permitted to compete.
Background:
On 9 February, the IOC banned Heraskevych from competing in a
helmet featuring portraits of Ukrainian athletes
killed during the war. The IOC suggested that he wear a black armband as an
alternative
. The Ukrainian athlete responded that in spite of the ban, he planned to compete wearing the helmet.
On the morning of 12 February,
Heraskevych was disqualified
from the competition. The IOC said the decision was due to his refusal to adhere to the IOC's guidelines on athlete expression.
Commenting on Heraskevych's disqualification
from
the 2026 Games, IOC President Kirsty Coventry said she had nothing against the message the Ukrainian skeleton athlete wished to convey, but stressed that she must maintain a "
safe environment
" for all.
Heraskevych had asked the IOC to allow him to compete wearing the "helmet of remembrance" before the start of the competition, but his request was not listened to.
The Ukrainian athlete commented on his disqualification, saying: "
Today we paid the price for our dignity
."

Ukrainian drone strike on oil refinery in Russia's Komi sets new record for range

https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020689/

The Security Service of Ukraine (SSU) and other units from Ukraine's defence forces struck the Ukhta oil refinery in Russia's Komi Republic – 1,750 km from the Ukrainian border – on 12 February.
Source:
General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine on
Facebook
; an Ukrainska Pravda source in the SSU
Details:
Early reports suggest that a fire broke out at the refinery's crude distillation unit and visbreaking unit following the strike. The visbreaking unit is designed to reduce the viscosity of feedstock to produce marketable fuel oil and additional light fractions such as petrol and gasoil.
The refinery, which is part of Russian oil giant Lukoil's corporate structure, processes about 4.2 million tonnes of oil a year. Its main products include motor petrol and straight-run petrol, diesel fuel, fuel oil and vacuum gasoil.
The refinery is involved in supplying Russia's armed forces.
A source in the SSU told Ukrainska Pravda that the operation has set a new range record for Ukrainian drones.
Background:
Russian authorities reported on 12 January that drones had attacked the Progress military plant in Michurinsk, Tambov Oblast, and an
oil refinery in Ukhta

UK develops options for future ice patrol ship capability
2026-02-12 12:05:51 GMT
https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/uk-develops-options-for-future-ice-patrol-ship-capability/

The Ministry of Defence has said it is developing options for a future Ice Patrol Ship capability, following questions about command arrangements and cost contributions for a shared ice cutter role in the British Antarctic Territory.
In a written response to Reform UK MP Andrew Rosindell, Defence Minister Luke Pollard said the UK remains committed to supporting its interests in the Antarctic, with HMS
Protector
continuing to deploy routinely to the Antarctic Peninsula in support of the UK’s responsibilities under the Antarctic Treaty and the British Antarctic Territory.
Pollard said:
“To deliver the vision of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR), we are developing options through the Defence Investment Plan for future Ice Patrol Ship capability.”
He added that the work would take account of both Antarctic and Arctic requirements, noting the Strategic Defence Review identified the Arctic as an area of growing competition.
“These options will consider requirements for the Antarctic, but also encompass the requirements for Arctic capabilities which the SDR identified as a region of increasing competition.”
He also said that the options being developed will include both cost and command factors, but did not provide further detail on how any shared ice cutter arrangement would be structured.

Pro-Israel US lawmaker Brian Mast warns Syria over SDF clashes
2026-02-12 12:03:35 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/pro-israel-us-lawmaker-brian-mast-warns-syria-over-sdf-clashes

US Congressman Brian Mast
, who chairs the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, appeared to issue a warning to the Syrian government on Tuesday, saying that there were “too many incidents of security and violence against religious and ethnic minorities”.
Mast added at a congressional hearing that recent fighting between Syrian government troops and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, whom he called “our long-standing counterterrorism partner”, was “unacceptable”, saying that the US’s Centcom command
had to move 7000 detained Islamic State militants
from formerly SDF-run facilities in Syria to neighbouring Iraq.
Mast also expressed concerns about
Russia’s continued military presence in Syria
, saying that it was “definitely an issue to contend with”.
He also noted Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa’s previous links to Al-Qaeda. Sharaa’s now-dissolved Hay’at Tahrir Al-Sham militia severed all ties with Al-Qaeda in 2017. Since assuming the Syrian presidency after the fall of longtime dictator Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, he has tried to present a more moderate and inclusive face.
Sharaa met with Mast,
a Republican who is noted for his staunchly pro-Israel positions
, when he visited the US in November last year, in an effort to get crippling US sanctions passed under the Caesar Act in 2020 removed.
The US Congress
removed Caesar Act sanctions
the following month. Syria also joined the US-led international coalition against the Islamic State in November.
However, at the Congressional hearing, Mast said that Sharaa “does not have a blank check” from the US.
“The United States is not satisfied with the progress that he has made yet, and views many of his actions as steps backwards,” Mast said.
He said that “recent actions against Druze, Kurds and Alawites are all steps in the wrong direction”.
Since the fall of Assad, a member of Syria’s Alawite minority, in December 2024, sectarian violence has broken out on several occasions.
In March 2025, remnants of the Assad regime launched an insurgency is Syria’s Alawite coastal heartland, killing scores of members of the security forces.
Government forces and allied militias intervened but also committed crimes against Alawite civilians, killing hundreds. Syria has begun public trials for some of those involved in the abuses.
Sectarian violence also broke out in the Druze-majority province of Suweida last July, with hundreds of people killed, and government forces also implicated in crimes against civilians. The province is now under the control of Israeli-backed local Druze militias opposed to the Syrian government.
Last month, an integration agreement between the Kurdish-led SDF and the Syrian government also broke down, leading to clashes between government forces and the SDF, which saw most of the Arab-majority areas once held by the group taken over by the government.
A new ceasefire deal is in place now, amid renewed steps to integrate SDF fighters into the government.
Mast’s remarks came amid reports that the US is reducing its military presence in Syria. On Wednesday,
US troops reportedly evacuated the Tanf airbase
, near the border tri-point between Jordan, Iraq, and Syria, an area where they have long had a military presence.
Also on Wednesday, the UN warned that Sharaa and Syrian foreign minister Asaad Al-Shaibani and interior minister Anas Khattab had been
the targets of five assassination attempts
the previous year, most of them by groups affiliated with the Islamic State.

German defence minister says agreeing on EU accession date for Ukraine is realistic
2026-02-12 12:03:00 GMT
https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020688/

German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has said it is realistic to agree on a specific date for Ukraine's accession to the European Union, but stressed that this would require negotiations and separate preparatory work.
Source:
Pistorius at a briefing ahead of a meeting of NATO defence ministers, as reported by European Pravda
Details:
Pistorius was asked to respond to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent assertion that Ukraine needs a date to be set for its EU accession since EU membership is part of the security guarantees.
Pistorius said he thinks it is realistic to agree on a date: "A specific date is always possible."
He cautioned, however, that determining the date would require separate work.
Quote:
"What should it be? This has to be negotiated. It's not something that can be decided in the heat of the moment."
Details:
Pistorius's comments are the first indication from the German government that this demand from Ukraine is considered acceptable.

This week, Zelenskyy stated again that Ukraine needs a specific date for EU accession to be defined within
the
peace negotiations.

Iran sacks local TV boss after anti-Khamenei 'slip'
2026-02-12 12:02:29 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-sacks-local-tv-boss-after-anti-khamenei-slip

Iranian authorities have dismissed a provincial television director after a reporter appeared to call for the death of the country's
supreme leader
.
The incident happened during Wednesday's live broadcast of the 47th anniversary of the
Iranian Revolution
in the southeastern Sistan-Baluchistan province.
During the live feed, the reporter Musab Rasoulizad was describing the turnout at the rallies, and repeating chants heard in the crowd, such as "Allahu Akbar", God is Great.
He then said "Marg bar Khamenei" (Death to Khamenei), rather than one of the chants typically heard at government-organised rallies, which include "Death to America" and "Death to Israel".
"The broadcast director of
Hamoun
provincial TV channel has been dismissed following an error that occurred on the provincial network," state television said on Wednesday.
"The transmission operator and broadcast supervisor were suspended. Other staff found at fault were also referred to the disciplinary committee."
It added that the decision was made to "maintain professional discipline and safeguard the media's reputation".
In a later video, Rasoulizad appeared to apologise for what he called a "slip of the tongue and a blunder which was broadcast and became a pretext for anti-revolutionaries".
Wednesday's rallies took place weeks after mass
anti-government protests
in Iran, which erupted late December against the rising cost of living, and peaked last month.
Tehran has acknowledged that more than 3,000 people died during the unrest, including members of the security forces and innocent bystanders, and attributed the violence to "terrorist acts".
Iranian authorities said the protests began as peaceful demonstrations before turning into "foreign-instigated riots" involving
killings
and vandalism.
International organisations have put the toll far higher.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) says 7,002 people, including 6,506 protesters, were killed during protests, however the toll is expected to be much higher.

Ukrainian intelligence officers discover bodies of two Nigerians killed in meat-grinder assault in Luhansk Oblast

https://www.pravda.com.ua/eng/news/2026/02/12/8020686/

Defence Intelligence of Ukraine has reported that the bodies of two Nigerian citizens who fought for Russia have been discovered in Ukraine's Luhansk Oblast.
Source:
Defence Intelligence of Ukraine (DIU) on
Facebook
Details:
The men have been identified as Hamzat Kazeen Kolawole, 42, and Mbah Stephen Udoka, 37.
Both served with the 423rd Guards Motor Rifle Regiment (military unit No. 91701) of the 4th Kantemirovskaya Guards Tank Division of the Russian Armed Forces.
Documents found at the scene indicate that they signed contracts with Russia's Armed Forces in the second half of 2025 – Kolawole on 29 August and Udoka on 28 September.
Udoka received no training. On 3 October, five days after signing the contract, he was assigned to a unit and sent the same day to temporarily Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine.
No documents were found confirming that Kolawole had received military training, but it is highly likely he did not. He is survived by his wife and three children in Nigeria.
Both the Nigerian citizens were killed in late November during an attempt to assault Ukrainian positions in Luhansk Oblast. They did not enter a firefight as both were killed by a drone strike.
Quote from DIU:
"Defence Intelligence of Ukraine warns foreign nationals against travelling to Russia and taking any job in the territory of the aggressor state. If you go to Russia you have a real chance of ending up in a 'suicide' assault unit and ultimately rotting in Ukrainian soil."

NATO: Russia’s modest gains come at staggering human cost
2026-02-12 11:45:59 GMT
https://ukdefencejournal.org.uk/nato-russias-modest-gains-come-at-staggering-human-cost/

Russian forces are making only incremental advances in Ukraine, with no decisive battlefield breakthroughs, while sustaining losses that a senior NATO official described as unprecedented in modern European warfare.
Speaking to journalists at NATO Headquarters, the official said bad weather and favourable Russian force ratios had likely contributed to “modest” gains over the past month, but argued Moscow’s progress remained tactical and constrained by force quality and logistics.
“Their operational effectiveness is constrained by manpower quality, by logistic strain and adaptation by the opposing forces, which have produced localized gains with no decisive battlefield breakthroughs,”
the senior NATO official said.
The official said Russia had continued to make incremental gains on the Pokrovsk, Vuhledar and Zaporizhzhia axes, while pushing toward Sloviansk and Kramatorsk from multiple directions, but stressed that Ukrainian activity had also reversed some positions in recent days.
“In recent days, we’ve seen Ukrainian forces take back some settlements there as well,”
the official said, adding that Kyiv had carried out clearance operations in Kupiansk, even as Russian infiltration attempts persisted.
Despite Moscow’s continued pressure through UAVs, artillery and what the official called “attritional tactics”, the senior NATO official said Ukraine’s defences were not expected to collapse this year.
“Despite Ukrainian limited reserves and thin defenses, the total collapse of Ukrainian defenses remains unlikely anytime this year,”
the official said.
The briefing’s most striking claims centred on casualties. The senior NATO official said Russia had suffered
“almost 400,000 dead and wounded in 2025 alone,”
and estimated total Russian killed and wounded since the start of the full-scale invasion at around 1.3 million.
Moscow continues to sacrifice more men and women than in any European conflict since the Second World War, the official said, arguing those losses were being absorbed without Russia achieving its strategic objectives. The official also accused Russia of inflating its battlefield narrative, saying Moscow was constructing an information environment designed to portray Ukrainian defeat as inevitable, often presenting the capture of small villages as major victories to shape negotiations.
“Small, remote villages… do not equate to strategic breakthroughs that would achieve Russia’s goal of preemptive Ukrainian capitulation anytime soon,”
the senior NATO official said.
Looking ahead, the official said the most likely scenario remained continued attritional warfare, with Russia retaining an advantage on the ground but making advances that were primarily tactical and concentrated in less well-defended areas.

Air Canada has lost a court appeal against a CHF144,000 fine for transporting nine passengers to Zurich without valid Swiss entry documents. + Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox Air Canada has been sanctioned several times by the State Secretariat for Migration (SEM) since 2015 for transporting people to Switzerland who lacked the necessary "Inadmissible Passengers" (INADs) travel documents. While the first violation resulted in a warning, the SEM has subsequently imposed fines of CHF4,000 per passenger on several occasions. In 2018, Air Canada transported 14 who displayed suicide risk. Due to the repeated offenses, a penalty of CHF16,000 per person was imposed, totaling CHF224,000. This decision was not appealed. However, the airline ultimately filed an appeal against the SEM penalty of CHF144,000 for nine suicide risk individuals in the first half of 2019.

Four goals set in obesity action plan
2026-02-12 11:33:38 GMT
https://www.ruv.is/english/2026-02-12-four-goals-set-in-obesity-action-plan-466772/

Alma Möller, Minister of Health, has presented a proposal for a parliamentary resolution on draft plans for an action programme on obesity in Iceland to be worked on over the next five years.
Four goals are described in what is intended to become the future vision of health services in response to obesity.
One is to strengthen prevention and reduce the incidence and development of obesity, especially among young people. This includes working against negative attitudes and prejudice.
The aim is that obesity among children will no longer be highest in the Nordic countries, to treat obesity in the same way as other chronic diseases and to offer diverse and professional treatment options.
The explanatory notes with the proposal state that 59% of Icelanders are overweight or living with obesity and 26% of children.
22% of adults are living with obesity - and 7% of children.
The prevalence of obesity is described as one of the biggest public health challenges of modern times, as the number of cases has increased rapidly in recent decades.
The four goals
Strengthening prevention, with an emphasis on reducing the incidence of obesity and preventing the development of severe obesity, especially among young people. Work will also be carried out against negative attitudes and prejudice.
The prevalence of obesity among children will no longer be highest in the Nordic countries.
Obesity will be treated in the same way as other chronic diseases, with assessment, formal diagnosis and access to long term treatment and rehabilitation based on evidence based methods.
Diverse and professional treatment options will be accessible to those who need health services because of the disease.

At least 21 drown in Nile boat sinking in Sudan
2026-02-12 11:32:32 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/least-21-drown-nile-boat-sinking-sudan

At least 21 people drowned when a boat sank in the
Nile River
in northern Sudan, according to the local state government and eyewitnesses interviewed by
AFP
.
River Nile State said Thursday that 21 bodies had been recovered after the accident, listed their names and warned that some passengers were still missing.
The boat was crossing the river between the villages of Tayba al-Khawad and Deim al-Qarai, according to the local government's statement.
The statement did not explain the cause of the accident.
Eyewitnesses told
AFP
the boat was carrying 30 people.
The
Sudanese Doctors Network
said in a statement that six of the boat's passengers survived.
The group said the incident exposes "the fragility of river transport and the absence of basic safety requirements, as well as the complete absence of local authorities and civil defence rescue teams in the early hours of the incident".
Many Sudanese rely on river transport via single-engine boats captained by solo operators.
The country's infrastructure has been collapsing due to a war that has been ongoing for nearly three years.
The war has
divided
the country between the army and its enemy, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, with road closures and a severe deterioration in public services and medical and educational infrastructure.

Dawson’s Creek Cast and Others Pay Tribute to James Van Der Beek
2026-02-12 11:30:00 GMT
https://time.com/7377940/james-van-der-beek-death-dawsons-creek-tributes-cancer-fundraiser/

The death of actor James Van Der Beek, best known for starring in ’90s teen drama
Dawson’s Creek
, at age 48 has prompted an outpouring of tributes and condolences from Hollywood and beyond, as well as a fundraising effort for Van Der Beek’s family to help deal with the financial stress from his years of cancer treatment.
“Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning,” a
post on
Van Der Beek’s
verified Instagram account
, which also tagged his wife Kimberly, announced Wednesday. “He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace. There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity, and the sacredness of time. Those days will come. For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend.”
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
Van Der Beek
announced in November 2024
that he was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer in August 2023, telling
People
magazine at the time that he had been “privately dealing” and was “taking steps” to resolve it with family. Among the ways Van Der Beek tried to offset expensive treatment costs was
to sell memorabilia
.
In the wake of his death, Van Der Beek’s Instagram stories shared a link to a
GoFundMe page
, seeking donations for his wife and their six children. The fundraiser page says that the costs of Van Der Beek’s medical care and the extended fight against his cancer “have left the family out of funds” and that after his death, his wife and children “are facing an uncertain future.”
Within 24 hours of the fundraiser’s posting, more than 20,000 people donated, bringing the proceeds to over $1 million and growing. Van Der Beek’s wife Kimberly
thanked
those who supported their family, saying in an Instagram story that her friends created the link to support her and her children. She added: “With gratitude and a broken heart.”
Dawson’s Creek
Van Der Beek, who was born in Cheshire, Conn., in 1977
and is the eldest of three children, started his acting career in theater, making an
off-Broadway debut in 1993
. He went on to have roles in the 1995 film
Angus
and the 1996 film
I Love You, I Love You Not
, as well as a few TV appearances.
But it was the WB show
Dawson’s
Creek
, which premiered in 1998,
that catapulted Van Der Beek to stardom. He played the soft-eyed teen film buff Dawson Leery. In
a 2013 interview with Larry King
, Van Der Beek recalled how he auditioned for the role and how he almost didn’t get cast because of misgivings from executives, but “Kevin Williamson, who created the show, had to put his foot down and say, ‘Listen, I created this guy, I know this guy. This kid is this guy.’”
The show, which ran for six seasons, became a
cornerstone of American teen television
and is considered a
pioneer
in the genre.
Many of Van Der Beek’s co-stars from the show have since expressed their grief at his passing.
Katie Holmes, who played Dawson’s love interest Joey Potter,
posted a handwritten letter
to Van Der Beek on Instagram. “Thank you,” it began. “To share space with your imagination is sacred—breathing the same air in the land of make believe and trusting that each others’ hearts are safe in their expression…” She also extended a message to Van Der Beek’s wife Kimberly and his children: “We are here for you always, and will always be there to shower you with love and compassion.”
Mary-Margaret Humes, who played Dawson’s mother Gale, shared photos with Van Der Beek on Instagram and recalled that she spoke to him just days before his death. “James, my gracious warrior, you fought a hard battle against all odds with such quiet strength and dignity. I will always love and admire you for that,” she
posted
. “Our last conversations … merely a few days ago … are forever sitting softly in my heart for safe keeping.”
Busy Philipps, who portrayed Joey’s college roommate Audrey Liddell in the show,
posted on Instagram
that Van Der Beek was “one in a billion” and that she was “profoundly heartbroken” for his family: “I am just so so sad. He was my friend and i loved him and i’m so grateful for our friendship all these years.”
Chad Michael Murray, who appeared in several episodes of
Dawson’s Creek
, called Van Der Beek “a giant” whose “words, art and humanity inspired all of us.” Kerr Smith, who played Jack McPhee in the show, described Van Der Beek as a “brother” whom he’ll miss deeply.
The show’s official Instagram account also
paid tribute
to its star and acknowledged his character’s impact on American TV: “We are deeply saddened by the passing of James Van Der Beek. His iconic portrayal of Dawson Leery helped define a generation of television for fans and continues to resonate with audiences today.”
An American pop culture icon
Dawson’s Creek
helped cement Van Der Beek’s status as a teen icon and opened up more opportunities for him. Van Der Beek’s fame only grew when he starred in
Varsity Blues
(1999),
Texas Rangers
(2001) and
The Rules of Attraction
(2002).
Several of his contemporaries extended their condolences. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who played Buffy in the 1997 horror drama series
Buffy the Vampire Slayer
,
posted in her Instagram stories
a photo with Van Der Beek and wrote that he was “one of the good guys” whose death was “a true loss.” Melissa Joan Hart of
Sabrina the Teenage Witch
fame
posted on Instagram
a photo of her and Van Der Beek sharing the screen on the ‘90s Nickelodeon sitcom
Clarissa Explains It All
: “He was truly a nice guy, a great father, wonderful actor and will always be my first on screen kiss when he guest starred on
#ClarissaExplainsItAll
. Gone way too soon but it seems like he put up one hell of a fight.”
Austin Nichols, who had scenes with Van Der Beek in TV series
One Tree Hill
, posted on Instagram that Van Der Beek “represented something to aspire to.”
Filmmaker Kevin Smith, who directed Van Der Beek in the 2001 movie
Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back
and its 2019 sequel, recalled how the actor was even open to playing a cartoonish version of himself. “James was simply too young to die,” he wrote. “James didn’t just lend us his name and celebrity, he came to PLAY, making memorable moments in forgettable films. One of the best things you can do for a person is dream their dreams with or for them – so I’ll always remember #jamesvanderbeek as the generous, funny, warm, self-effacing superstar who twice helped me make my dreams come true, 18 years apart.”
From 2012 to 2013, Van Der Beek played a fictionalized version of himself on the ABC sitcom
Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23
, where he starred alongside Krysten Ritter. Ritter posted photos of her and Van Der Beek on her
Instagram stories
, where she called the late actor a “beautiful human inside and out” and “pure magic.”
In 2017, Van Der Beek wrote, co-produced, and starred in
What Would Diplo Do?
, a miniseries in which he portrayed DJ and music producer Diplo. Critics
lauded the show
, particularly Van Der Beek’s performance.
Dancing With the Stars
In
Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23,
Van Der Beek’s fictional self joined
Dancing With the Stars
. Five years after the sitcom ended, the real Van Der Beek followed suit, joining the dance reality competition’s 28th season.
Host Alfonso Ribeiro, who is a godfather to Van Der Beek’s daughter, dedicated
an Instagram post
to the late actor: “He was my true friend brother and life guide. I was with him through this horrible journey to beat cancer. His family and friends went on this roller coaster ride. The highs when it looked like he had it beat to the breaking lows of it coming back.”
“I love you James and know I have a guardian angel watching over me,” Ribeiro added. “Being able to say goodbye this weekend will always live with me.”
Italian choreographer Bruno Tonioli, one of
Dancing With the Stars’
judges, described Van Der Beek in
an Instagram post
as “a true gentleman and the ultimate professional.”
Julianne Hough, another host of the show,
posted on her Instagram stories
: “James, you created a legacy of love and light. Wrapping your beautiful family in love and protection.”
Emma Slater, who was Van Der Beek’s dance partner in the show,
wrote
on Instagram that the actor was her “big brother” and thanked him for his positive influence on her life. “It started with being dance partners and I was beyond excited to be dancing with you, and it continued into the deepest of friendships,” Slater wrote. “I’m lucky to have known the man that you are. You have done so much, helped so many people. You’ll be forever in my heart.”
Slater
shared a video
of the two of them dancing his wife Kimberly’s favorite dance, the samba. “He loved to dance!” she wrote. “And I know he’s still dancing.”

Iran says Israel seeks to derail talks as US deploys more forces
2026-02-12 11:25:18 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-says-israel-seeks-derail-talks-us-deploys-more-forces

Iran has accused
Israel
of trying to sabotage fragile negotiations with the US over Tehran's nuclear programme, following Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
's visit to Washington on Wednesday.
Iran's security chief Ali Larijani said Israel had been "fabricating pretexts" to derail
the negotiations
, after reports that Tehran had engaged in talks with Israeli officials.
"Israel has inserted itself into this process with the intent of undermining and sabotaging these negotiations," Larijani said during a visit to Qatar on Wednesday.
“Our negotiations are exclusively with the United States – we are not engaged in any talks with Israel,” he said
During his trip to Doha, Larijani also met Hamas leadership council head Mohammed Darwish to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and rising Iran-US tensions, according to a Hamas statement.
The Supreme National Security Council official added that Israel's strategy was "to destabilise the region".
Reports suggest Netanyahu urged a tougher line on Iran, pressing Washington to include Tehran’s ballistic missile arsenal in any agreement.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington on Wednesday for talks with
President Donald Trump
focused on negotiations with Tehran, in what appears to be a direct attempt to steer the US administration away from its current course.
In an interview with
The New Arab'
s Arabic language edition, Iranian Defence Council chief Ali Shamkhani said Tehran's missile
programme was "non-negotiable"
and a "red line", with reports that Israel wants this issue on the table during the US-Iran talks.
He said Iran's missile capabilities form part of its "defensive deterrent system", particularly after last June's joint Israeli-American bombing campaign against Iranian targets.
Responding to Netanyahu's comments, Trump wrote on
Truth Social
that "nothing definitive" had been reached, apart from his insistence that negotiations with Iran continue "to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated".
Iran and the US held a
first round of indirect
​​​​​​talks in Oman last week, despite clear differences over the scope of any agreement. Larijani said a second round was being planned, though no date had been set.
The
threat of US strikes
remains in the background. If no deal is reached, Trump warned: "We will just have to see what the outcome will be", referencing last year's US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.
The US military build-up in the region is continuing, with Trump signalling on Wednesday that a second aircraft carrier could be deployed to the Gulf.
According to
The

Netanyahu wants to 'kill' the Palestinian eagle passport emblem
2026-02-12 11:16:51 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/netanyahu-wants-kill-palestinian-eagle-passport-emblem

On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu
issued a controversial move targeting
Palestinian national
symbols by replacing the Palestinian eagle emblem on passports with a "Peace Council" stamp and subsequently igniting concerns over the erasure of Palestinian identity and sovereignty.
In statements earlier in January, Netanyahu described the Palestinian staff at the Rafah border crossing as "mere stampers of passports," signalling his aim to limit any visible authority or symbolic presence of the Palestinian Authority (PA) in Gaza—even at crossings used daily by Palestinians.
On 2 February, the Palestinian side of the
Rafah
crossing reopened on a very limited basis under strict restrictions.
Management of the Palestinian side is officially handled by a European civilian border mission, while Palestinian staff affiliated with the PA process passports.
Despite this,
Netanyahu
insists on controlling symbolic elements, viewing even the passport stamp as a challenge to Israeli authority.
Speaking separately to
The New Arab
, Palestinians argue that replacing the eagle with the Peace Council seal is seen as an attempt to erase national identity and undermine the PA's symbolic authority, a move aimed ultimately at curtailing Palestinian sovereignty in
Gaza
.
What is the Palestinian eagle?
The Palestinian eagle, or "Eagle of Saladin", appears on Palestinian passports and official documents. The golden eagle carries a shield in the colours of the Palestinian flag, red, green, white, and black, and symbolises strength, pride, and national identity.
Its roots trace back to Saladin's era, linking it to broader Arab heritage. For Palestinians, tampering with the eagle is more than an administrative decision; it challenges the essence of national identity.
The PA formally adopted the emblem after Palestine obtained observer state status at the United Nations in 2012.
It represents both partial international recognition and a tangible affirmation of Palestinian sovereignty.
Palestinian analysts argue that removing it is not a cosmetic change; it aims to weaken the symbolic connection between the Palestinian people and their right to statehood.
For Palestinians, the emblem embodies resilience, continuity of rights, and a connection to Arab and Islamic history, making even a passport stamp politically charged.
Israel's measures at Rafah reflect a broader strategy of symbolic control over
Palestinians
. While Palestinian employees stamp passports, Israel does not recognise their authority and strictly limits the display of Palestinian symbols.
The use of Palestinian staff allows Israel to maintain operational control while projecting a minimal Palestinian presence.
These policies are part of a broader framework that includes restricting crossings, limiting aid, and monitoring Palestinian movement.
Replacing the eagle with the
Peace Council
stamp is not mere bureaucracy—it is a symbolic step intended to erase the PA's authority in Gaza, consolidating Israeli control over both borders and national symbols, according to Ased Yassin, a Gaza-based political analyst.
"The issue goes beyond a mere logo or stamp on a passport. Israel is pursuing a comprehensive strategy to impose symbolic control over Palestinians and weaken the PA's presence in
Gaza
," Yassin told
TNA
.
"Unfortunately, the international silence, Arab inaction, and US indifference have allowed Israel the space to implement these policies gradually," Yassin said.
Yassin added that a unified Palestinian stance could force the international community to respond more effectively.
Steadfastness vs symbolic erasure
Mustafa Ibrahim, a Palestinian analyst from
Gaza
, sees the removal of the Palestinian eagle as an effort to strip the coastal enclave of any form of Palestinian sovereignty and sever ties with the PA.
"Israel wants to reinforce its symbolic control over Gaza and emphasise that the Palestinian authority remains confined within strict limits," he told
TNA
.
Ahed Farwana, another analyst in
Gaza
, argued that Netanyahu's policies aim to deepen the separation between Gaza and the occupied West Bank.
He told
TNA
that Israel relies on US support to carry out these measures and warned that without strong international pressure, Israel will continue erasing Palestinian symbols.
"Border crossings and travel documents have become arenas in the struggle over Palestinian identity," he said.
Analysts agree that Israeli measures against the Palestinian eagle go beyond formality and are part of a coordinated strategy to control crossings, limit aid, and restrict Palestinian symbols in Gaza. The passport emblem is central to the struggle over identity and statehood.
For Palestinians, the eagle reflects history, resilience, and national rights. It connects citizens to their Arab and Islamic heritage and represents resistance against erasure.
Attempts to remove it reveal the ongoing conflict between
Palestinian
identity and Israeli policies seeking to undermine it.
Border crossings and travel documents have become part of this symbolic and political struggle, a reminder of the broader fight over sovereignty and recognition.

Is Wiz's mega-exit in jeopardy?
2026-02-12 11:15:28 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/is-wizs-mega-exit-in-jeopardy/

The lawsuit filed by Raftt against Wiz is far from an ordinary business dispute. According to the statement of claim, it outlines an extraordinary narrative: a calculated, cynical, and conspiratorial move where the founders of a young startup and a major unicorn allegedly joined forces to transfer a team and technology from one company to another — without paying any consideration to the company itself or its investors.
Even if the court ultimately rules otherwise, the lawsuit offers a rare glimpse into a less glamorous side of the high-tech industry. It depicts a world where, behind polished PR photos, firm handshakes and stories of newly minted millionaires biking to work, there are at times bitter power struggles, founders who turned their backs on those who believed in them, and allegedly an arrogant unicorn that betrayed the very values on which the "Startup Nation" narrative is built.
Who is the plaintiff?
The official plaintiff is Raftt. From a business standpoint, very little remains of the company. Its founders and employees have departed, it has no ongoing commercial operations, and it is effectively an empty corporate shell. In practice, the driving force behind the lawsuit is Raftt's investors - those who believed in the founders' vision at the outset, invested millions of dollars at high risk, and ultimately found themselves without any return on their investment.
Raftt was founded in 2020 by Gahl Saraf and Roy Iarchy with the goal of developing advanced tools for the developer ecosystem. Early on, it successfully raised approximately $5 million from Aleph and Cardumen at a $16 million valuation - an unusually high valuation for a seed round.
In its early years, everything appeared promising. The company grew, the product advanced, and it even had customers and revenue. Toward the end of 2023, as its cash reserves dwindled, Raftt reached a familiar crossroads for young startups: raise additional capital, pursue a sale to a larger company, or shut down. On paper, Raftt seemed to hold strong cards. The founders were optimistic and reported to investors that discussions were underway with major names such as Microsoft, Amazon, and ironicall,- even Google.
Then, unexpectedly, the founders informed investors that negotiations had not materialized, that the company had run out of funds, and that it would cease operations. At the same time, they announced they would be joining Wiz. From the investors' perspective, it appeared to be another painful but familiar episode in the startup world - a young company that failed to survive long enough to reach an exit.
Following the departure of the founders and team, investors were left with a single remaining asset: Raftt's intellectual property. It was meant to be the only possible avenue to recover at least a fraction of the capital invested and the risk assumed. Then, according to the lawsuit, investors discovered that even this final asset was no longer truly theirs. Allegedly, Raftt's intellectual property had effectively transferred, together with the founders and employees, directly into Wiz's products.
Who are the defendants?
At the heart of the case are Raftt's two founders, Gahl Saraf and Roy Iarchy. The two first met during their military service in elite intelligence units and later pursued impressive careers in technology. When they founded Raftt, they were widely seen as a particularly promising entrepreneurial duo - precisely the type of profile venture capital investors seeks.
Trust between them and the investors was strong. The founders were given free rein to manage the company, build the team, and lead product development. However, according to the statement of claim, that trust fractured at the most critical moment in the company's life. While investors were presented with a narrative that the company was searching for a buyer or new investor, the lawsuit alleges that intensive discussions were taking place behind the scenes with Wiz - aimed at transferring Raftt's entire team as a single organic unit.
Wiz is not portrayed in the lawsuit as an innocent third party, but as a key defendant. The claim alleges that the company was an active participant throughout the process: holding direct discussions with the founders without the investors' knowledge, shaping a framework for the transfer of employees, and paying the founders substantial personal compensation.
"The conspiracy"
What stands out in the statement of claim is the picture it paints. Not a typical business dispute, but a concealed and deliberate maneuver. According to Raftt's version of events, the alleged motive was straightforward: the founders' desire to join Wiz together with the entire team and the underlying technology, but to do so outside the framework of a formal acquisition, so that no consideration would be paid to the company and its investors, but instead flow directly to them.
The lawsuit alleges that while the founders were updating the board that they were working to save the company, intensive parallel negotiations were taking place with Wiz behind the investors' backs. According to the statement of claim, Wiz paid founders and employees personal compensation package amounting to approximately $15 million in cash and options, sums that were not fully disclosed to the board, while the company itself received no consideration.
A particularly troubling dimension of the lawsuit concerns the issue of evidence. According to the allegations, after investors began raising questions about the circumstances surrounding the move to Wiz, one of Raftt's founders, Gahl Saraf, accessed the company's servers and deleted hundreds of emails related to the discussions held with Wiz. Those messages, as the lawsuit asserts, were later recovered from backup systems and allegedly reveal detailed coordination that took place behind the board's and investors' backs.
The alleged deletion attempt is portrayed in the statement of claim as a deliberate effort to destroy evidence - a move that, if proven, could carry not only serious civil consequences but potentially criminal implications. For the plaintiffs, it is one of the strongest indicators that this was not an innocent business misjudgment, but a calculated attempt to conceal the true nature of the transaction.
The "smoking gun"
If there is one element in the affair that places the defendants in an especially uncomfortable position, it is the public celebrations. In December 2023, immediately after Raftt's employees joined Wiz, the company began issuing official statements about the "acquisition of Raftt." Festive headlines appeared in the media, interviews with senior executives, social media posts, and reports of a deal worth tens of millions of dollars.
Externally, it appeared to be another glossy exit - a young company absorbed into a successful Israeli unicorn. Yet, according to the statement of claim, while the public was told of a "strategic acquisition," Raftt's investors were told an entirely different story: that the company was shutting down without any consideration.
And that is precisely what makes this chapter so problematic for Wiz and the founders. When investors at the time asked why the move was being described in the media as an acquisition, the founders reportedly dismissed it as nothing more than "marketing bravado" - loose phrasing intended to cast Raftt's closure in a positive light.That explanation, however, raises significant questions. Why would a company of Wiz's scale, with an established legal apparatus, repeatedly use the term "acquisition" if no such transaction had in fact taken place?
The contradiction between the public celebration and what was conveyed to investors is one of the central pillars of the lawsuit and, according to Raftt, lays bare the true character of the move.
The heart of the lawsuit
At the core of the dispute lies the question of what became of Raftt's technology and whether it ultimately found its way into Wiz's new flagship product.
Raftt developed an advanced platform for the developer ecosystem, designed to enable real-time code testing within virtual cloud environments, rather than through slow and cumbersome validation processes. In simple terms, it was a system aimed at dramatically streamlining developers' workflows, enables rapid collaboration and identifying issues at early stages.
Wiz, by contrast, built its reputation as a cloud security company. Yet in September 2024 - less than a year after Raftt's entire team joined the company - Wiz launched a new product called Wiz Code, aimed at developers and offering advanced code analysis within development environments.
According to the lawsuit, Wiz Code performs functions substantially similar to the capabilities developed by Raftt: code scanning and mapping, real-time issue detection, and deep integration into developer workflows. Raftt contends that the short time span between the team's transition (December 2023) and the product launch (September 2024) indicates that the new product was built on technology brought in from outside, rather than developed from scratch within Wiz.
This is a complex allegation to prove, as it would require in-depth technological comparisons. However, if proven, the implications could be far-reaching: not only significant financial damages, but also a tangible threat to one of Wiz's core products.
The Patent
In May 2024, just months after Raftt's team moved to Wiz, Wiz filed a U.S. patent application listing Saraf and Iarchy as inventors alongside additional engineers who had worked at the company. According to the lawsuit, the substance of the patent describes precisely the type of capabilities on which Raftt's platform was based - a system for analyzing code within cloud environments, identifying issues in real time, and providing insights to developers. From Raftt's perspective, this constitutes a written evidence that technology developed within its walls is now being presented as Wiz's intellectual property.
The timeline also raises questions. The team transfer in December 2023, a patent application filed in May 2024, and Wiz Code is launched in September 2024. For the plaintiffs, this sequence is far from coincidental.
The legal significance of patent carries particular weight in this context. Unlike general allegations of "product similarity," a patent is a formal and detailed document asserting ownership over specific technology. As such, Raftt argues that its very existence constitutes direct evidence that the technology was, in effect, transferred to Wiz.
These allegations are further reinforced, the lawsuit argues, by public statements from Wiz own senior executives. and the company's co-founder and CTO, Ami Luttwak, said in an interview with Geektime: "This is a strategic acquisition… Wiz's goal is to take Raftt's existing knowledge and product and, within a few months, turn it into a product Wiz can offer." From the plaintiffs' perspective, such remarks amount to an almost explicit acknowledgment that Raftt's technology served as the foundation for the development of Wiz Code.
Another point emphasized in the lawsuit concerns timing. Patent applications are published to the public only 18 months after filing. This means that Raftt's investors were, for a significant period, unaware that a formal document existed asserting Wiz's ownership over technology they contend belonged to them.
For Raftt, this marked a moment described as a "delayed discovery." While attempting to sell the intellectual property that remained in their hands, investors allegedly realized that, according to the patent filings, the technology was already being presented as the asset of another company. If proven, the consequences could extend far beyond monetary damages, raising fundamental questions about ownership rights in Wiz Code and perhaps even Wiz's right to continue marketing it.
Wiz Code is not a marginal feature in Wiz's portfolio. It is one of the company's flagship products, and the lawsuit may argue that its launch in 2024 was a key driver behind Wiz's valuation surge - from Google's initial $23 billion offer to the final $32 billion transaction.
A shadow over one of Israel's greatest high-tech success story
Ultimately, Raftt path to a legal victory will not be straightforward. In court, it will need to prove two key claims: first, that the move to Wiz was in fact a disguised transaction conducted behind investors' backs; and second, that Wiz Code is materially based on the intellectual property Raftt developed. Establishing such claim, especially in the technology sector, is complex and requires in-depth analysis and unequivocal evidence.
Wiz, for its part, was quick to respond, characterizing the lawsuit as opportunistic and driven by envy of its success. The statement of claim, however, lays out a far more detailed account: documents, quotes, timelines, and a patent application that together raise substantive questions.
In court, broad assertions of jealousy will not suffice. The company will be required to provide concrete and well-supported answers. Should the allegations ultimately be proven, the case could cast a heavy shadow over one of the most celebrated success stories in Israeli high-tech — and over the individuals behind it, who in recent years, become near cultural icons.

Gaza children face death as Israel restricts Rafah medical exits
2026-02-12 11:06:36 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/features/gaza-children-face-death-israel-restricts-rafah-medical-exits

Despite the reopening of the Rafah crossing on Gaza's southern border with Egypt on Monday, 2 February, medical cases allowed to leave the Strip remain hugely disproportionate to the scale of the health catastrophe.
Only a few dozen sick and wounded Palestinians were permitted to leave, while others, including thousands of children suffering from chronic diseases or requiring urgent surgical procedures, have been stuck in Gaza as their conditions deteriorate amid severe shortages in medicine and medical equipment.
The crossing has largely been closed since the Gaza side was captured by Israel in May 2024, but was supposed to reopen in the first phase of the October ceasefire plan.
So far, around
180 Palestinians
have left the Gaza Strip since the limited reopening, according to officials in the territory. According to the
WHO
, more than 18,500 patients in Gaza still require specialised medical care that is no longer available in the Strip, including people suffering from heavy trauma wounds, cancer and chronic diseases such as diabetes.
A 2025 report by
Save the Children
stated that more than 20,000 Palestinian children have been killed and at least 39,000 injured by Israeli forces, some requiring life-saving treatments and surgery.
Famine was also officially confirmed in Gaza, where children "are dying from malnutrition and other preventable causes."
Dr Mahmoud Al-Sheikh Ali, an internal medicine consultant and head of the internal medicine unit at the Gaza European Hospital, reiterates that the health system in Gaza is in a state of "complete collapse," noting that travelling abroad for treatment remains almost impossible for the majority of cases.
Dr Al-Sheikh Ali explains that before the crossing was recently reopened, travel was effectively forbidden except for a very limited number of cases, 50-100 cases per month.
"In October, only two groups were allowed to travel," he recalls, "the first included 41 cases, and the second 49 cases, despite the fact that we issue no less than 10 medical transfers for children's treatment abroad every day. There are at least 6,000 critical cases in need of urgent evacuation."
With limited permission to cross over to Egypt, the lives of thousands of children are suspended by an exit decision that may arrive too late.
Urgent care required
"My son Ali's body is always swollen," says Khitam Al-Yaziji, mother of five. Her 10-year-old son can't walk and is losing his hair, Khitam tells
The New Arab
.
"Three of the medicines he needs are not available anywhere in Gaza.”
Ali's ordeal began in June 2025, when his family was displaced in Al-Shati camp. "There was heavy bombardment," Khitam recalls, "and we ran."
Ali fell on a large rock and was hurt near his kidney. "He was in a lot of pain, and it turned out that he had a cyst."
Ali spent 12 days at the hospital, where the CT scan was broken, and he was misdiagnosed and given the wrong treatment, which deteriorated his condition. Eventually, the family learned that his condition was related to a thyroid gland disorder.
Despite receiving an urgent medical transfer request for treatment abroad, the family has yet to hear back from the Ministry of Health or the World Health Organization.
Five-year-old Yazan Musleh's paternal grandmother tells a similar story, her voice trembling as she sees him hanging between life and death.
"We were displaced in the Ministry of Labour building on 5 September," she recalls. "At 1 am, the building was bombed. My son, his wife and my other grandson were martyred. Only Yazan survived."
She describes how shrapnel entered his head from the front and exited from the back. "He spent 61 days at the hospital," she says, adding that he doesn't move, speak, or recognise anyone.
At Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, Yazan underwent two surgeries, but his condition did not improve. "He can't move his hands and feet, and he can only see with one eye," she says.
Less than a month ago, however, Yazan was allowed to travel to Jordan for treatment, accompanied by his maternal grandmother, who says he is improving gradually.
Fragile health system
Dr Al-Sheikh Ali says that the health system in Gaza was fragile even before the war, but today it is completely dilapidated.
"Patients with blood disease, complex heart disease, and immune diseases have no access to treatments in Gaza,” says Dr Al-Sheikh Ali, "so they require transfers for treatment abroad because most hospitals are out of service. The situation is catastrophic."
The Ministry of Health has recorded 970 patient deaths, including 300 children, who had already obtained a transfer request, but died because they were not allowed to travel, according to Dr Al-Sheikh Ali.
"These people could have been saved," he says.
The clinical burden on hospitals has increased by 400%, Dr Al-Sheikh Ali adds.
"Nasser Hospital has a capacity of 300 beds, but now serves 1,500 beds," he explains. "Operating rooms are occupied non-stop, doctors, nurses and staff are exhausted, and some radiology and laboratory units function with limited capacity, while other units no longer exist."
Timely treatment is a key element in saving lives, he adds.
"There was a patient who needed heart surgery within two months, but because he was not allowed to travel, his condition became chronic," says Dr Al-Sheikh Ali, noting the endless stream of appeals from families to save their children.
"But travel is in the hands of the occupation, and despite the so-called ceasefire, the existing healthcare crisis remains as it is; nothing has changed."
Lawyer and rights advocate Abdullah Sharshara says that what Gaza's wounded children are being subjected to is "a flagrant violation of basic human rights."
"Children's right to healthcare and protection is enshrined in basic international conventions, such as the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
, and Article 24 of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child
," says Abdullah, noting that depriving children of treatment constitutes discrimination against the most vulnerable groups in society.
"Preventing children from accessing medical care is a violation of the right to life, as stipulated in Article 6 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR), and of the right to health according to Article 12 of the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(ICESCR)," he adds.
"These conditions can lead to death or permanent disability, and are a serious breach of international obligations," says Abdullah, emphasising that the occupation is legally responsible for the protection of children.
"Article 27 of the Fourth Convention stipulates the protection of civilians, and Article 56 obliges the occupation to ensure public health care for them," he adds.
"The Convention on the Rights of the Child also emphasises the necessity of protecting children during armed conflicts and providing urgent medical treatment."
"Withholding treatment from children is a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law and child protection rules," says Abdullah.
"If it leads to death or deliberate permanent harm, it is considered a war crime."

IDF personnel charged with betting on Polymarket using classified intel
2026-02-12 11:02:15 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/idf-personnel-charged-with-betting-on-polymarket-using-classified-intel/

An Israeli civilian and an IDF reservist have been indicted for allegedly using classified military information to place online bets on upcoming military operations, the Tel Aviv District Court allowed for publication on Thursday.
The indictment, filed following a joint investigation by the Shin Bet security agency and Israel Police, accuses the two of placing bets on the prediction market platform
Polymarket
regarding the occurrence of Israeli military operations. According to prosecutors, the reservist had access to classified information as part of his military duties and shared it with the civilian, enabling the pair to make informed wagers.
Several suspects, including additional reservists, were arrested in the case. Authorities said the suspects allegedly exploited sensitive information they were exposed to during their military service in order to profit from bets placed online.
At the conclusion of the investigation, the State Attorney's Office decided to file criminal charges against the two, including serious security offenses as well as bribery and obstruction of justice.
The probe was conducted jointly by the Shin Bet and the Lahav 433 national crime unit, which operates in cooperation with the Defense Ministry's security department and Israel Police. The investigation also involved the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division and the IDF Information Security Department, and was accompanied by the State Attorney's Office Cyber Department.
According to the indictment, the two placed bets on Polymarket specifically concerning military operations. The reservist was exposed to the internal information through his military role, which formed the basis for their wagers.
It was reported Wednesday that investigators are also examining suspected involvement by additional officials within the defense establishment, raising serious questions about information security and the potential misuse of classified material.
What is Polymarket?
Polymarket is a prediction market platform that allows users to bet on more than 10,000 questions across dozens of categories. Unlike traditional gambling websites, it operates more like a stock exchange: the odds fluctuate continuously, and users can buy and sell positions at any time, even before the underlying question has been resolved.
The logic underpinning Polymarket is the gap between opinion and action. For example, in an election poll, respondents may be influenced by beliefs, ideology, identity and even hope when asked whom they plan to vote for. Those considerations often shift when real money is involved. When funds are on the line, the central question becomes which outcome is most likely to occur.

The Weapons of Mass Destruction AI Security Gap
2026-02-12 11:00:00 GMT
https://time.com/7373405/weapons-of-mass-destruction-ai-security-gap/

In 2023, former UN weapons inspector and scientist Rocco Casagrande arrived at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the West Wing of the White House, carrying a small, sealed container. Inside were a dozen test tubes containing ingredients that, if properly assembled, could cause a deadly pandemic.
According to Casagrande, an AI chatbot had not only provided him with the lethal recipe; it also offered ideas about how to pick the best weather conditions and targets for an attack. There to brief government officials on AI-enabled pandemic risks, Casagrande’s prop sent a powerful
message
to security officials about how rapidly AI had collapsed the barriers to engineering devastating
bioweapons
.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
The barriers to engineering a pandemic have been lowered, and policymakers have
taken note
.
America’s AI Action Plan
proposes defensive measures, and the
UK’s 2025 Strategic Defence Review
prioritizes chemical and biological defense.
Likely driven by both genuine concern and the risk of legal liability, frontier AI companies have also shown leadership, reflected in the
Frontier AI Safety Commitments
at the Seoul Summit. These companies have publicly committed to mitigating risks across the chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosives (CBRNe) spectrum.
Yet, despite these steps, an alarming security gap remains. While it is good that companies are focusing on pandemics, the ecosystem is overly focused on a single “lone wolf virus terrorist” model as the most serious threat. Significantly less attention is being paid to all other risk scenarios. The focus on individual actors leaves state-based and terrorist group threats dangerously under-examined.
Furthermore, pandemic virus risks are not an adequate proxy for other threats. The technical steps for developing improvised explosives, non-transmissible biological agents, and chemical weapons are distinct from transmissible biological ones. Building and deploying a chemical weapon like Sarin, for example, as opposed to a virus, involves an entirely different set of technical steps. For this reason, we need distinct AI safety tests.
Yet, on their own, these “lesser” threats could still kill many, devastate communities, and sow chaos across countries. We are in danger of creating a safety system that fixates on guarding against the next pandemic while leaving the door wide open to other forms of terror.
Concerningly, we have seen major AI labs
backtracking
on safety commitments, likely in part because they lack the classified data to fulfill them. For instance, while some AI companies publish tests on whether their models can help cause a pandemic, they do not detail whether those same models could aid in chemical or improvised explosive attacks.
This omission is dangerous. Advanced AI can not only help individuals build weapons; it can also help them bypass export controls and hide their tracks, allowing anyone to circumvent international guardrails without detection. Crucially, this creates a blind spot that leaves us all vulnerable to the very pandemics we fear most. A rogue actor exploring the use of AI for a chemical or explosive attack today may be rehearsing for a biological attack tomorrow.
If our safety systems are designed to only flash red for the apocalypse, we will miss the warning signals leading up to it.
We need a broader categorization of risks, informed by experts. A fundamental rebalancing is required to also address more probable AI-enabled threats, not just the most apocalyptic ones. Frontier companies and the community of institutions advising them can’t solve this alone—they lack the classified intelligence to inform a clearer understanding of state and non-state threats, and the government mechanisms and international relations needed to create the laws, structures, and partnerships necessary to tackle the challenge. Governments, conversely, lack the full understanding of AI capabilities and proprietary knowledge, as well as essential suspicious user behavior data. A dangerous silence results from these silos.
Public-private partnerships should be designed for national security. Such partnerships would merge the classified intelligence of the state with the proprietary data of tech firms and third parties, bringing together cross-cleared personnel to spot threats that no side can see alone. This will require a level of innovation beyond anything attempted before, but the benefits would be immense.
Indeed, history teaches us that diplomacy and policy can save lives. Roughly half a century ago, world leaders attended the
Biological Weapons Convention
and signed a disarmament treaty prohibiting the development of biological and toxin weapons. And last year was the centenary of the
Geneva Protocol
, which banned the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflicts. They both represent collective agreements about the fundamental inhumanity of using these weapons and our shared responsibility for ensuring they are prevented
A century ago, those who understood the devastating potential of new technologies realized the need to take determined action across a full range of foreseeable threats.
In a radically different age, we need that same determination again—and we need it before it is too late.

Florida lawmakers’ results midway through DeSantis’ last session: Not much
2026-02-12 10:55:00 GMT
https://www.politico.com/news/2026/02/12/florida-lawmakers-results-midway-through-desantis-last-session-not-much-00775944

TALLAHASSEE, Florida — Florida’s GOP-dominated Legislature had goals and dreams of conservative moves that would cap off Gov. Ron DeSantis’ last year in office. Instead, lawmakers are stumbling into the midway point of their annual session.
And it’s not clear what — if anything of substance — will actually pass this year.
There’s been no serious movement on a property tax overhaul, despite a persistent push from DeSantis. The governor’s own bid to put guardrails on artificial intelligence
appears to be in serious jeopardy
. Top priorities of legislative leaders have moved in one chamber but not the other.
It’s a startling turnaround from those previous sessions when DeSantis was at his political zenith and legislators slammed through a long line of measures designed to appeal to conservative voters. That’s been replaced with shrugs and maybes from many top lawmakers about what can be accomplished this year.
Normally in election years, GOP lawmakers work in tandem with the governor on everything from a please-everyone budget to signature legislative achievements that can be touted on the campaign trail. That may not be the case this time around.
Legislators from both parties acknowledge a great deal of remaining uncertainty with 30 days left in the 60-day regular session.
“Does this even look remotely scripted to you?” said state Rep. Lawrence McClure, a Dover Republican and House budget chief. “Hence why I can’t tell you how it’s going to end. It’s not scripted. You want the ending to a movie I’ve never seen. I didn’t write the production. I have no idea. The process is going to work itself out, right?”
Added state Sen. Jennifer Bradley, a Republican from Fleming Island: “There’s a lot of big unanswered questions that we usually have some answers on before this point.”
Nearly 1,800 bills and proposed constitutional amendments have been filed so far for the 2026 session. Only two bills have passed the Legislature so far.
The lackluster pace and seeming lack of direction has several sources. DeSantis, who is term limited and has seen his clout wane after his unsuccessful bid for president, has undercut much of the need for any urgency.
He ordered a special session on redistricting
for late April — even though House Speaker Daniel Perez initially said it would be “irresponsible” to wait until then.
For the past year, DeSantis has hammered home the need to come up with a property tax overhaul and at one point pledged to end property taxes for Floridians who own their own home. But while he promised last year
to roll out his own detailed plan on property taxes
, he has yet to release anything. DeSantis has also suggested that property taxes may require their own dedicated special session.
Senate President Ben Albritton could not say this week if property taxes would even tackled during the regular session and instead just said, “We’re still looking very closely at this.”
Another factor adding to the seeming malaise: ongoing tensions between House and Senate leaders. Last year, an impasse over budget and taxes
forced the session into overtime
. At the same time,
DeSantis has repeatedly bashed House Republicans
but has forged an alliance with Albritton, creating a 2-on-1 dynamic.
“Anything that requires a lot of engagement by the leadership of the House and Senate to work out is not going to pass,” predicted one veteran Republican lobbyist who was granted anonymity to speak candidly. “There’s just not a lot of bandwidth given the personalities.”
The Legislature, of course, has not been completely idle for its first month of session. They have waded into various policy disputes that have pitted well-heeled special interests against each other, ranging from land development regulations to shielding a gun manufacturer from lawsuits. There have also been new bills dealing with gender identity, race and immigration that have generated fierce debate.
State Rep. Christine Hunschofsky, a Democrat from Parkland, said people in her district are asking her about property insurance and property taxes.
“I tell them bills have been filed but they aren’t moving,” she said.
Albritton told reporters last week that he saw no need to make any additional changes on property insurance and cited the laws passed earlier this decade that placed limits on lawsuits against insurers. He and other Republicans contend that these changes have stabilized the market and that rates are starting to trickle downward.
Lawmakers have one big task that they are supposed to accomplish over the next month: a new state budget for the next fiscal year that starts in July. DeSantis has already offered up his own spending suggestions, but it’s not clear how much buy-in he will get from lawmakers on some of them.
Budget negotiators must also decide whether Florida should mirror federal tax cuts adopted by Congress last year. That could take anywhere from $1.5 billion to $3.5 billion out of the state’s main budget account.
State Sen. Ed Hooper, the chamber’s budget chief, remains optimistic that the House and Senate will avoid the drawn-out and at-times bitter budget stalemate of last year.
“To me, it’s better than last session by far,” Hooper said. “I think it’s going to be OK.”
State Rep. Fiona McFarland, a Sarasota Republican, also gave an upbeat assessment about the final month.
“I don’t know if this is the year for transformative government, but we’re still going to get some very good work done,” McFarland said.

Deaths in Iran's crackdown on protests reach at least 7,000
2026-02-12 10:42:48 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/deaths-irans-crackdown-protests-reach-least-7000

The death toll from a crackdown over Iran's
nationwide protests
last month has reached at least 7,002 people killed, with many more still feared dead, activists said Thursday.
The
slow rise
in the number of dead from the demonstrations adds to the overall tensions facing Iran, both inside the country and abroad, as it tries to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program.
A second round of talks remains up in the air as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
pressed his case
directly with US President Donald Trump to intensify his demands on Tehran in the negotiations.
"There was nothing definitive reached other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated. If it can, I let the Prime Minister know that will be a preference," Trump wrote afterwards on his TruthSocial website.
"Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal, and they were hit....That did not work well for them. Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible."
Meanwhile, Iran at home faces still-simmering anger over its
wide-ranging suppression
of all dissent in the Islamic Republic. That rage may intensify in the coming days as families of the dead begin marking the traditional 40-day mourning for their loved ones.
Activists' death toll slowly rises
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which offered the latest figures, has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in Iran to verify deaths.
The slow rise in the
death toll
has come as the agency slowly is able to cross-check information, as communication remains difficult with those inside the Islamic Republic.
Iran's government offered its only death toll on 21 January, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran's theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
The
Associated Press
has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given that authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.
The rise in the death toll comes as Iran tries to
negotiate
with the United States over its nuclear program.

Russia targets WhatsApp as it pushes homegrown messenger app
2026-02-12 10:38:22 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/russia-targets-whatsapp-and-telegram-pushes-homegrown-app/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

Social media platform WhatsApp on Thursday accused Russian authorities of trying to block the service as part of an effort to exert more control over the country’s internet sphere.
“The Russian government attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive people to a state-owned surveillance app,” WhatsApp said in a
statement on X
.
“Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia,” the Meta-owned company said.
The move against WhatsApp follows reports of renewed difficulties with Telegram, the most popular messaging platform in Russia, after media watchdog Roskomnadzor
announced new restrictions
against the company earlier this week.
Roskomnadzor last year
accused Telegram and WhatsApp
of violating Russian law by
facilitating terrorists and scammers
.
Following its all-out invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia
banned as “extremist”
Facebook and Instagram, which also are owned by Meta.
In a post earlier this week, Telegram founder Pavel Durov accused the Russian authorities of trying to “force its citizens to
switch to a state-controlled app
built for surveillance and political censorship.”
The Kremlin has promoted the home-grown messenger service Max as an alternative to foreign platforms. But internet experts have
criticized
the Russian app for providing a backdoor to Moscow’s security services in what they see as an attempt by the Kremlin to secure further control over Russians’ private lives.
For now, WhatsApp and other banned services remain accessible to tech-savvy Russians who use a virtual private network (VPN) to bypass online restrictions. But authorities are increasingly trying to shut down that option as well, introducing fines for VPN providers and blocking specific workarounds.
Asked whether WhatsApp would be allowed to remain in Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Tuesday said it depended on whether Meta “would enter into dialogue with the Russian authorities.”
“If the corporation sticks to an uncompromising position and, I would say, shows itself unready to align with Russian legislation, then there is no chance,” Peskov
told state news agency TASS
.

Drones are increasingly dominating the Sudan war
2026-02-12 10:37:21 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/drones-are-increasingly-dominating-sudan-war

Drones have reshaped the battlefield in
Sudan
since the country dissolved into an all-out war three years ago.
Both the paramilitary
Rapid Support Forces
(RSF) and the regular army, known as the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), are increasingly using long and short-range drones to target major supply lines, food markets, hospitals, power stations and military bases.
One of the latest incidents occurred on 7 February when Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces launched a suicide drone at a vehicle that
killed 24 passengers
in the strategic province of North Kordofan.
Eight women and children
were among the dead.
The passengers had escaped a nearby village and were trying to reach a safer area before they were hit, according to the Sudan Doctors' Network, a local monitor.
The attack was among a barrage of suicide drones the RSF launched at civilian targets—including hospitals and UN convoys—over the weekend, drawing sharp condemnation from rights groups, regional states and diplomats.
The drone strikes occurred shortly after SAF broke the RSF's siege of two key cities in South Kordofan.
"The RSF tends to launch a barrage of drones to relieve pressure on their fighters when they lose control or withdraw from a key area," said a local relief worker, who requested anonymity due to the tense security environment.
Collateral damage
Sudan's drone warfare epitomises the internationalisation of the conflict, which has seen rival regional powers pour in weapons to back their preferred client.
The UAE—despite repeated denials—has shipped Chinese artillery, mercenaries and drones to the violent paramilitary, according to
US intelligence assessments
,
UN experts
and
rights groups
.
SAF primarily receives weapons—including plenty of drones—from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Iran.
The indiscriminate use of drones is exacerbating what the UN has
described as the largest humanitarian catastrophe
in the world by most metrics.
Tens of thousands of people have been killed, while more than 13 million have been uprooted from their homes. In addition, the war has caused food scarcity and mass hunger across the country.
The persistent threat of drones is now compounding the suffering and terror.
"Civilians are collateral, and to add insult to injury, getting justice for [strikes against innocent people] will get even harder [than it already is]," said Hager Ali, who closely follows the flow of weapons into Sudan as a researcher with the German Institute for Global and Area Studies.
She explained that there is no legal framework to regulate the use of more automated drones, which helps belligerents evade accountability because such weapons operate with a degree of independence, reducing the need for remote control.
Drones are also less costly—in terms of money and personnel—than conventional aircraft. Early in the war, SAF's old Russian-made aircraft were easy to spot and take down, so multi-use drones and loitering munitions were quickly procured to replace them, said Ali.
The RSF, she added, quickly accrued drones to counter
SAF's
air fleet.
"The use of drones is a natural evolution in the war. Each is adapting to the combat environment and trying to get an edge over the other," she told
TNA
.
Growing supply
As the war drags on, drones are multiplying on the battlefield each week, according to open-source experts and news reports.
The New York Times
recently uncovered a
clandestine drone operation
in Egypt's western desert region.
The base includes multiple hangars storing Turkish-made Akinci drones, a devastating weapon that has more range and holds three times more bombs than its predecessor: the Bayraktar TB2.
The drones are disrupting a vital RSF supply route which links its stronghold in Darfur to the Libyan town of Kufra, controlled by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Arab Army (LNAA).
However, SAF drones are also causing significant collateral damage, particularly their short-range suicide drones.
On 5 February, local monitors reported that a munition hit a market in the Abiey region of Southwest Kordofan, near the border with South Sudan. The
strike killed 12 people
and burned numerous shops.
"SAF has been targeting markets since the beginning of the war… but its method of doing so has changed [from using aircraft] …to relying on cheap, one-way drones, also called 'loitering munitions'," according to an
analysis by Sudan War Monitor
, a website that uses open-source methods to track battlefield dynamics.
Army spokesperson, Nabil Abdullah, did not comment on the incident in Abiey when contacted by
TNA
.
Meanwhile, the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab, which uses satellite imagery to track developments in Sudan, spotted dozens of RSF drone launchers in the capital of South Darfur, Nyala.
The Executive Director of the lab, Nathaniel Raymond, told
TNA
that his team spotted at least 86 drone launchers in two locations in the city.
"They are just sitting there in groves, about eight kilometres apart," he said.
Offence to defence
Despite the RSF's growing drone fleet, the group seems to be on the back foot, said Raymond.
He told
TNA
that SAF and its backers are using air cover to help their infantry advance on the ground in the Kordofan region. SAF owes its recent success to their ability to disrupt the RSF's supply lines into Darfur.
However, the RSF has recently opened a new front in Blue Nile State, a region bordering Ethiopia and
South Sudan
.
A
recent investigation by Reuters
found that the paramilitary and their ally, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement - North (SPLM-N), are likely operating out of a training base in Ethiopia's lawless Benishangul Gumuz region.
Raymond believes that the RSF's new front aims to divert SAF's attention in the Kordofan region, perhaps just long enough for the rainy season to arrive in May.
The rainy season often causes flooding and wetlands, which force ground offensives to halt. Yet, civilians believe that RSF drone attacks could pick up during this period.
One local relief worker, who requested anonymity due to the tense security environment, told
TNA
that the RSF already fires a barrage of drones at North Kordofan's capital of el-Obeid every Friday morning.
El-Obeid has absorbed tens of thousands of displaced people from surrounding regions, with many living in open-air camps, according to UN agencies and local relief workers.
After the RSF committed mass killings while capturing North Darfur's capital of el-Fasher in October 2025, the local relief worker said many people in el-Obeid feared they would be next.
But now, he said, people seem a little calmer now that the RSF has been pushed a little.
"The
drones
are making life difficult for civilians… but at least many people consider el-Obeid to be more secure than before," he told
TNA
.

How France Skated Through Scandal to Edge Out Team USA for Ice Dance Gold
2026-02-12 10:30:00 GMT
https://time.com/7377928/milan-olympics-ice-dance-france-fournier-beaudry-cizeron-chock-bates/

At their fourth Olympics,
Madison Chock and Evan Bates
finally have an Olympic medal in ice dance.
It’s not the gold the U.S. duo was hoping for, but a silver, 1.43 points behind gold medalists Laurence Fournier Beaudry and Guillaume Cizeron of France. Canada’s Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier earned bronze, also their first Olympic medal in their third Games together.
[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]
The podium was full of surprises, as Great Britain’s Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson, current world bronze medalists who were expected to be in the mix, finished in seventh after Fear faltered when performing the synchronized twizzles, or pirouettes on the ice, and received a lower level for her sequence than Gibson.
Read More:
Madison Chock, Evan Bates, and the Very Risky Skirt
Gilles and Poirier were mesmerizing in a program themed after Vincent Van Gogh’s
Starry Night
and
Sunflowers
paintings. Gilles, a cancer survivor, trained for Milan while undergoing treatment for early-stage ovarian cancer, and she dedicated her journey to her mother, who supported her skating career and passed away from glioblastoma in 2018. Always the bridesmaid at the Olympics, the couple finally have their Olympic medal.
While there was certainly drama on the ice with the closeness of the results, there was an equally intense story building off the ice around the French team, whom U.S. figure skater and commentator
Adam Rippon
described as having “sinister energy” in the Netflix documentary
Glitter & Gold
that presciently chronicled the journey of the three teams.
Just before the Olympics, Cizeron’s former partner, Gabriella Papadakis, with whom he won gold at the 2022 Olympics, released her memoir,
So As Not to Disappear
, detailing what she describes as domineering and controlling behavior by Cizeron, to the point that she was terrified of being alone with him. Cizeron denied the reports, calling them a “smear campaign” and saying that the book “contains false information, attributing to me, among other things, statements I have never made which I consider serious.”
Papadakis was scheduled to join NBC as a skating analyst in Milan but was removed from the job following the release of the book. “Her new book creates a clear conflict of interest,” an NBC spokesperson said in a statement. “Our responsibility is to deliver coverage that our audience can trust to be free of bias—whether actual or perceived—and we regret that is no longer possible given the circumstances.”
Papadakis retired from competitive skating in 2024—and left her training facility, the
Ice Academy of Montreal
—in part, she says, because of the uncomfortable environment at the school. Contributing to that was Fournier Beaudry’s former partner, and still boyfriend, Nikolaj Sorensen; the couple competed for Canada and also trained at the Montreal facility.

‘Quad God’ Ilia Malinin Leads in Men’s Skating Short Program
Sorensen was suspended from the sport in 2024 by Skate Canada after Canada’s Office of the Sport Integrity Commissioner investigated him for alleged sexual assault involving a U.S. coach and former figure skater. Sorensen denied the allegation and appealed the suspension, which was overturned on jurisdictional grounds in 2025, though an arbitration board has decided the legal decision should be further reviewed. Fournier Beaudry had already begun her new partnership with Cizeron, representing France, after receiving French citizenship several months ago.
Still, Fournier Beaudry has remained by Sorensen’s side, and in the documentary she said the ban ended both their careers. “I know my boyfriend 100%. I know him. And we [stood] strong together,” she said. Asked in Milan about her support of her boyfriend, Fournier Beaudry declined to respond, saying only that she had said everything she wanted to say on the topic.
French journalists reported that Sorensen was spotted in the Milano Ice Skating Arena to watch Fournier Beaudry, adding to the tension between the French and Americans.
When asked after the competition about the controversies surrounding their ex-partners, Cizeron said, “From the beginning we tried to create a bubble where we really supported each other through everything. We’ve been through some incredibly hard moments. But the love we have for each other and for the sport brought us through. It helped us refocus on enjoying those moments together, because they don’t last forever and we didn’t want that taken away from us.”
Chock couldn’t hold back the tears as she admitted winning silver was a “bittersweet feeling. At the moment, we have so much to be proud of, we’ve had the most incredible career, 15 years on the ice together, the first Olympics as a married couple, and we delivered four of the best performances this week,” she said, referring to the short and free programs she and Bates skated in the ice dance event as well as the short and free programs they skated in the
team event, where they and their teammates won gold
. But it was the gold in ice dance that has been the North Star of their career, and she couldn’t contain her emotions realizing that that gold remained elusive. She choked up as she talked about the support they have received throughout their career from family and friends. “We are really proud … and grateful to our coaches and our families. They came all this way and have supported us through it all,” she said. “It means so much to us to be a part of this sport, and to have contributed years of work and creativity to hopefully inspire the next generation of skaters.”
The fight for gold and silver actually began before the opening ceremony in Milan, in the first round of that team event. In the rhythm dance, Chock and Bates outscored the French team by 1.08 points. In that competition, the judges gave Chock and Bates the highest level, 4, in all of their technical elements, while Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron received a level 3 for one of theirs, which earned them fewer points.
Once the individual skating events began, the circumstances reversed, and in the rhythm dance portion on Feb. 9, Chock and Bates received a level 3 for their pattern step sequence, while the judges awarded Fournier Beaudy and Cizeron a level 4 for that element.
And to make things even more complicated, the two teams train together at the Ice Academy of Montreal, sharing coaches Marie-France Dubreuil, Patrice Lauzon, and Romain Hagenauer. After the team event, Hagenauer said he and Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron worked to clean up the sequence that resulted in the lower level, which paid off when they competed it again in the individual event. The French finished 0.46 points ahead of the Americans after that first portion of the competition, a difference Chock and Bates thought they could easily make up in the free program.
In that segment, however, the scoring was also close. Chock and Bates skated first, ticking off their elements with the same precision they had in the team event, taking full advantage of the drama embedded in their matador-inspired routine. “We felt like we skated a winning performance,” said Bates.
Fournier Beaudry and Cizeron then took to the ice their more lyrical and abstract program set to the soundtrack from
The Whale
, with choreography meant to mimic the ebb and flow and constant movement of water. They outscored Chock and Bates in both technical elements, which focus on specific skating skills, as well as components, which reflect how the couple composed their program, presented it, and executed the elements.
In ice dance, which doesn’t have the eye-catching jumps or spins that singles skating does, it’s all about the precision of the skaters’ edges and the complexity of how their blades move across the ice, especially during step sequences, where they must follow specific criteria about which edges they need to achieve and how long they need to hold them.
Chock seemed in shock by the reality of not winning the gold; when the silver medals were placed around their necks, neither she nor Bates looked at them, and Chock stared stoically ahead throughout the ceremony. Neither commented on what their future holds, but being in their 30s, it’s reasonable to think they saw this as their last Olympics and were hoping to end on a more positive note.
“I feel like in life sometimes,” Bates reflected, “you do everything right and it doesn’t go your way, and that’s life, that’s sport—it’s a subjective sport, it’s a judged sport. But one factor that is indisputable is we delivered our best. We skated our best. And the rest is not up to us.”
Whether Chock and Bates decide to keep competing, the next generation of U.S. ice dancers is already showing promise. Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko finished 11th at their first Games. And U.S. silver medalists Emelia Zingas and Vadym Kolesnik finished fifth in their first Olympics, skating impressive programs that seemed to catch the attention of the judges. “If you told me one year ago today I’d be top five at the Olympics, I would have said it’s a lie,” said Zingas. “It was the most emotion that I’ve given on the ice so far this season, and it just felt magical.”

Indian unions and farmers stage a nationwide strike over interim trade deal with US

2026-02-12T09:50:38Z
NEW DELHI (AP) — A coalition of major trade unions and farmers’ groups in India mounted a nationwide strike Thursday to protest an interim
trade deal
with the United States, saying the agreement undermines the interests of farmers, small businesses and workers.
In Parliament, lawmakers from
opposition political parties
demanded that the government scrap the trade deal and criticized Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the slogan “Narendra Modi, surrender Modi.”
The one-day strike partially disrupted public services and manufacturing activities, highlighting resistance to the reform agenda set by Modi, leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and underscoring the political risks of pushing market-oriented policies ahead of key state elections later this year.
A union leader said the trade deal with Washington opens the Indian market to subsidized agricultural products, threatening the livelihoods of millions of small farmers.
“Cheap American farm produce will be dumped in India, making it difficult for our farmers and small businesses to compete,” said Amarjeet Kaur, general secretary of All India Trade Union Congress, a prominent union that took part in the strike.
The government in New Delhi has defended the interim trade pact as a step toward expanding exports, attracting investments and strengthening strategic ties with the U.S. The interests of farmers in the agriculture and dairy sectors were protected, Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said recently.
India and the U.S. this month announced they were moving closer to a formal trade pact, releasing an
interim framework
that would lower tariffs and deepen economic ties.
A fact sheet issued by the White House shows reciprocal tariff on Indian goods decreasing from 25% to 18%, while an additional 25% penalty tariff for India’s purchase of Russian oil will be dropped.
In return, India will stop buying Russian oil and purchase $500 billion worth of U.S. goods, including energy, while cutting taxes and non-tariff barriers.
The protesters in India also opposed Modi’s efforts to
privatize
state-run companies and implement new
labor codes
, calling the sweeping changes “deceptive fraud” against workers.
Indian officials have argued that labor reforms were needed to boost efficiency and create jobs in the long run.

China issues new rules to curb auto price war after January passenger car sales drop 20%

2026-02-12T09:11:16Z
HONG KONG (AP) — China moved Thursday to curb a fierce price war among automakers that has caused massive losses for the industry, after passenger car sales dropped nearly 20% in January from the year before, the fastest pace in almost two years.
The State Administration for Market Regulation released guidelines for manufacturers, dealers and parts suppliers aimed at preventing a race-to-the-bottom price war.
They forbid automakers from setting prices below the cost of production to “squeeze out competitors or monopolize the market.” Violators may face “significant legal risks,” the regulator warned.
The rules also target deceptive pricing strategies and price fixing between parts suppliers and auto manufacturers.
Passenger car sales in China fell 19.5% in January from a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That was the biggest percentage drop since February 2024.
The 1.4 million passenger cars sold in January compared with 2.2 million units sold in December, CAAM said.
Weakening demand reflects a reluctance of cash-strapped buyers to splash out on
big purchases
. Sales also have suffered from a cut in tax exemptions for EV purchases, coupled with uncertainties over whether trade-in subsidies for EV purchases will continue after some regions
phased them out
, auto analysts said.
The
aggressive price war
in China’s auto sector has caused an estimated loss of 471 billion yuan ($68 billion) in output value across the whole industry in the past three years, Li Yanwei, a member of the China Automobile Dealers Association, wrote recently.
Analysts expect domestic demand to dip this year. S&P has forecast sales of light vehicles, including passenger cars, in China will fall up to 3% in 2026.
However, Chinese automakers are gaining ground in global markets. China’s exports of passenger cars jumped 49% year-on-year to 589,000 in January.
“We don’t foresee a loss in momentum for the Chinese auto industry this year,” said Claire Yuan, director of corporate ratings for China autos at S&P Global Ratings.
Chinese automakers like
BYD
— which overtook Tesla as the world’s top electric vehicle maker — are targeting markets in Europe and Latin America as they confront intense competition in both prices and lineups at home due to oversupply.
Analysts at Citi expect China’s car exports could jump 19% this year driven by exports of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids.
Last month, Canada
agreed to cut its hefty 100% tariff
on China-made EV imports in a move welcomed by Chinese carmakers. China also recently
reached a deal
with the European Union that could allow more of its EVs to enter the European market.
BYD, China’s largest carmaker, targets around 1.3 million of overseas car sales in 2026, up from the 1.05 million last year. Other major Chinese automakers have also set ambitious sales targets with a focus on exports.

Spy agency says Kim Jong Un’s daughter is close to being designated North Korea’s future leader

2026-02-12T09:24:19Z
SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday that it believes the
teenage daughter
of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is close to being designated as the country’s future leader as he moves to extend the family dynasty to a fourth generation.
The assessment by the National Intelligence Service comes as North Korea is preparing to hold its
biggest political conference
later this month, where Kim is expected to outline his major policy goals for the next five years and take steps to tighten his authoritarian grip.
In a closed-door briefing, NIS officials said they are closely monitoring whether Kim’s daughter — believed to be named Kim Ju Ae and around 13 years old — appears with him before thousands of delegates at the upcoming Workers’ Party Congress, said lawmaker Lee Seong Kweun, who attended the meeting.
First appearing in public at a
long-range missile test
in November 2022, Kim Ju Ae has since accompanied her father to an increasing number of events, including weapons tests, military parades and factory openings. She traveled with him to Beijing last September for Kim’s first
summit with Chinese leader Xi Jinping
in six years on the sidelines of a World War II event.
Speculation about her political future intensified last month when she joined her parents on a New Year’s Day visit to Pyongyang’s Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, a sacred family mausoleum displaying the embalmed bodies of her late grandfather and great-grandfather, the country’s first- and second-generation leaders. Some experts saw the visit as the clearest sign yet that she’s positioned to be the heir to her 42-year-old father.
South Korean officials
initially expressed doubt
that she could be chosen as a North Korean leader, citing the country’s deeply conservative culture and tradition of male-dominated leadership. But her increasingly prominent appearances in state media have prompted a reassessment.
In its
previous assessment
of Kim Ju Ae’s status in September, the NIS told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un’s decision to bring her along on his trip to China was likely part of an effort to build a “narrative” possibly paving the way for her succession.
“In the past, (NIS) described Kim Ju Ae as being in the midst of ‘successor training.’ What was notable today is that they used the term ‘successor-designate stage,’ a shift that’s quite significant,” Lee said.
According to Lee, the agency cited her growing presence at high-profile military events, her inclusion in the family visit to Kumsusan, and signs that Kim Jong Un was beginning to seek her input on certain policy matters.
Not much is known about Kim’s daughter
Despite her increased visibility in propaganda, North Korean state media have never published the name of Kim Jong Un’s daughter, only referring to her as his “respected” or “most beloved” child.
The belief that she is named Kim Ju Ae is based on an account by former NBA star Dennis Rodman, in which he recalled holding Kim Jong Un’s baby daughter during a
trip to Pyongyang
in 2013. South Korean intelligence officials believe she was born sometime that year.
In 2023, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un and his wife also likely have an
older son and a younger third child
whose gender is unknown.
Since its foundation in 1948, North Korea has been ruled by male members of the Kim family, beginning with the country’s founder Kim Il Sung and followed by his son,
Kim Jong Il.
Kim Jong Un was just 26 when he was officially named heir during a 2010 party conference, two years after Kim Jong Il suffered a debilitating stroke. Following his father’s death in December 2011, he was abruptly thrust into the throne with relatively little preparation.
Some analysts suggest that Kim Jong Un’s decision to debut his daughter early possibly reflects his own experience of being rushed into power.
Party congress may offer hints toward succession plans
Kim Ju Ae’s first known visit to Kumsusan last month was also her father’s first visit to the site in three years. Given the palace’s status as a key symbol of the Kim family rule, the trip should be seen as a symbolic gesture by Kim Jong Un to present his daughter as his heir before his grandfather and father as he prepares for the major ruling party congress, said Cheong Seong-Chang, a senior analyst at South Korea’s Sejong Institute.
The Workers’ Party congress in late February, last held in 2016 and 2021, could provide a stage for Kim Jong Un to formalize his succession plans, possibly by giving his daughter the party’s first secretary post, its No. 2 job, although such a decision might not be immediately disclosed to the outside world, Cheong said.
Other analysts question whether she would receive such a high-profile post or any formal party role, given that party rules require members to be at least 18.
If Kim Jong Un does use the party congress to cement his daughter as successor, the signs would be more subtle, said Koh Yu-hwan, former president of South Korea’s Institute of National Unification.
For example, the party may issue self-praise about how North Korea has survived longer than most other Communist states and credit that to how the country established a “successful inheritance of the revolution,” he said.
“If you see comments like that, it would be reasonable to think that Ju Ae has been cemented,” as heir, Koh said.
KIM TONG-HYUNG
Kim has been covering the Koreas for the AP since 2014. He has published widely read stories on North Korea’s nuclear ambitions, the dark side of South Korea’s economic rise and international adoptions of Korean children.

Berlinale 2026: MENA cinema shines as Morocco takes focus
2026-02-12 10:16:58 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/features/berlinale-2026-mena-cinema-shines-morocco-takes-focus

The Middle East and North Africa will once again register a strong presence at the
Berlin International Film Festival
(February 12-22), with 14 feature and six short productions and co-productions from the region selected across various sections, including the Main Competition and the competitive Perspectives, as well as the audience favourite Panorama, the aesthetically attuned Forum, Generation, dedicated to young filmmakers and audiences, and the respectable Berlinale Classics.
Yet, similar to
Cannes
, the majority of the contemporary features – 10 out of 14 – are European productions, among which four are supported by German funding.
This once again confirms the patronising attitude of major festivals toward small and less subsidised cinematographies: in order to fall into their selections, most MENA filmmakers are expected to subject themselves to external rules, while these international forums appear incapable or simply unwilling to discover truly authentic cinematic approaches born in native lands, the ones not being monitored by Western producers and mentors.
Notably, the feature film selection carefully considers gender parity, with seven films directed by women and the other seven by men, while, on the other hand, established auteurs appear alongside filmmakers working under censorship, surveillance, or forced displacement, underscoring both the resilience of the region's cinema and the constraints under which it continues to flourish.
Morocco in focus at the European Film Market
Morocco has been named the
Country in Focus
at the Berlin International Film Festival's industry platform, known also as the European Film Market (EFM), placing one of the region's most internationally connected film cultures at the centre of Berlinale's industry platform.
Long positioned as a bridge between Africa, the Arab world and Europe, Morocco combines a robust national cinema with an infrastructure attractive to global productions, including diverse locations, a 30 percent cash rebate and multiple co-production treaties.
Initiatives such as the
Ateliers de l'Atlas
have further strengthened the country's role in supporting emerging Moroccan and regional filmmakers.
Festival Director
Tricia Tuttle
highlighted the significance of this focus, not without a nuance of exoticising in her tone, by noting that "Moroccan voices bring distinctive perspectives to the Berlinale and to festivals worldwide, drawing on deep cultural roots while speaking to contemporary issues with originality and power."
Mohammad-Reda Benjelloun
, Director of the Centre Cinématographique Marocain (CCM), adds: "A land of history and storytellers. With its natural landscapes, skilled professionals, and vibrant energy, the Kingdom of Morocco holds a prominent place on the world cinema map. Being the country in focus in Berlin is a testament to how culture and coexistence nurture an art form and a language that have become truly universal: cinema."
While the spotlight signals international recognition of Morocco's cinematic ecosystem, it also reflects broader questions about authorship, equity, and visibility within transnational production models that are still largely shaped by European oversight, clearly emphasising the country's dependence on the Western industry.
Alongside the 14 feature films, the Berlinale will screen four new short MENA works, including
Fruits of Despair
by Nima Nassaj (Iran),
The Weary Hours of Two Lab Assistants
by Burak Çevik (Turkey, Germany, UK, Croatia),
White
by Navroz Shaban (Iraqi Kurdistan Region) and
Gravity
by Dalya Keleş (Turkey).
The broad programme also includes two historical short classics:
Sad Song of Touha
(1972) by Egyptian documentary pioneer
Atteyat Al Abnoudy
and
The Dislocation of Amber
(1975) by Sudanese filmmaker Hussein Shariffe.
Morocco's presence is further highlighted in Berlinale Classics by the restored feature masterpiece
Mirage
by Ahmed Bouanani (1979), which wraps the following more descriptive list of the feature titles:
No Good Men
Shahrbanoo Sadat
| Afghanistan, Germany, France, Norway, Denmark
Opening Film
Set in Kabul shortly before the Taliban's return to power,
No Good Men
follows a television camerawoman balancing career ambition, romance and motherhood in a city on the brink.
Sadat, whose earlier films premiered in Cannes' Directors' Fortnight, continues her long-term exploration of Afghan womanhood under pressure, blending personal vulnerability with political urgency.
In a Whisper
Leyla Bouzid
| Tunisia, France
Competition
Leyla Bouzid returns to the Berlinale Competition with a tender, quietly suspenseful family drama. When Lilia returns to Tunisia from Paris for her uncle's funeral, she is forced to confront family secrets and the life she has kept hidden, including her relationship with another woman.
Moving between intimacy and investigation, the film blends emotional realism with playful formal touches.
Bouzid, whose debut
À peine j'ouvre les yeux
premiered in Venice and became an international success, once again crafts a nuanced intergenerational portrait anchored by a strong ensemble led by
Hiam Abbass
.
Yellow Letters
İlker Çatak | Turkey, Germany, France
Competition
Set against the tightening grip of state repression,
Yellow Letters
follows a celebrated theatre-making couple whose lives unravel after a single incident turns them into political targets.
Forced to relocate from Ankara to Istanbul, economic pressure and ideological compromise strain both their marriage and their bond with their daughter.
Çatak, whose previous
The Teachers' Lounge
earned an Oscar nomination for Best International Feature Film, brings precision and moral clarity to a drama that speaks directly to contemporary Turkey while resonating far beyond it.
Salvation
Emin Alper
| Turkey, France, Netherlands, Greece, Sweden, Saudi Arabia
Competition
In a remote mountain village, the return of an exiled clan reignites an old land feud, drawing religious fervour and political ambition into dangerous alignment.
As visions and power struggles escalate, Emin Alper constructs a tense allegory about faith, authority and collective violence.
A Berlinale regular, Alper once again draws on his background in history to build a moral landscape where belief becomes both refuge and weapon.
Chronicles from the Siege
Abdallah Alkhatib
| Palestine, Algeria, France
Perspectives
Depicting daily life under siege, Alkhatib's debut fiction feature follows an ensemble of ordinary people grappling with hunger, fear and moral exhaustion.
Moments of intimacy and dark humour punctuate the violence, insisting on humanity amid destruction. A former human rights activist, Alkhatib brings documentary urgency to a narrative shaped by lived experience.
Only Rebels Win
Danielle Arbid
| Lebanon, France, Qatar
Panorama
Set in a Beirut teetering on the brink of collapse, Danielle Arbid's latest film follows an unlikely romance between Suzanne, a middle-aged widow, and Osmane, a young undocumented Sudanese man.
As their relationship deepens, social hostility mounts, exposing entrenched racism, classism and moral panic – a plot very much resembling Rainer Werner Fassbinder's 1974 classic
Fear Eats the Soul
.
Arbid, whose work has screened widely at Cannes and beyond, transforms private intimacy into a political act, confronting a society quick to judge yet slow to reckon with its own fractures.
Roya
Mahnaz Mohammadi
| Iran, Germany, Czechia, Luxembourg
Panorama
Shot underground and shaped by lived experience, Roya traces the psychological fragmentation of a political prisoner in Tehran's
Evin Prison
.
Moving fluidly between memory, hallucination and confinement, the film explores how solitary imprisonment reshapes perception and identity.
Mohammadi, an Iranian filmmaker and women's rights activist who has herself been incarcerated, delivers a stark, interior work that resists spectacle in favour of testimony.
Safe Exit
Mohammed Hammad
| Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Qatar, Germany
Panorama
Haunted by witnessing his father's murder as a child, Samaan now works as a security guard in Cairo, numbing himself to the past.
An unexpected friendship with a homeless woman forces buried trauma to resurface. Continuing the social sensitivity of his debut
,
Withered Green
, Mohammed Hammad crafts a restrained urban drama about survival, guilt, and a
fragile connection in a city shaped by violence.
The Other Side of the Sun
Tawfik Sabouni
| Syria, Belgium, France, Saudi Arabia
Panorama
After the
fall of Assad's regime
, filmmaker
Tawfik Sabouni
returns to Saidnaya prison, where he was once detained, accompanied by four fellow survivors.
Through carefully staged re-enactments filmed inside the former prison, this poignant documentary gives form to experiences that language alone cannot contain.
Thus, Sabouni's film becomes both a personal reckoning and a collective memorial to those who did not survive.
Cesarean Weekend
Mohammad Shirvani
| Iran
Forum
Set over a summer gathering by the Caspian Sea,
Cesarean Weekend
observes shifting relationships, masculinity and generational tension through an open, improvisational structure.
Shirvani avoids overt political statements, instead tracing a parallel social reality shaped by affection, silence and bodily presence. His live-direction method creates a cinema of immediacy that resists closure or moral judgment.
The Day of Wrath: Tales from Tripoli
Rania Rafei
| Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Qatar
Forum
Blending family memory, archival footage and political history,
Rania Rafei
maps the upheavals that have shaped Tripoli from independence to the present.
Structured as a cinematic letter to her late father, the film interweaves personal loss with collective disillusionment.
Rafei, a veteran documentary filmmaker, crafts an essayistic portrait of a city oscillating between hope and erasure.
Hear the Yellow
Banu Sıvacı
| Turkey
Forum
Returning to her Anatolian village after years away, Suna becomes obsessed with uncovering the truth behind her sister's death, long buried under communal silence.
Anchored by a powerful central performance and rich visual textures, Banu Sıvacı's second feature confirms the promise of her award-winning debut Güvercin, offering a meditation on grief, denial and female persistence.
Ghost School
Seemab Gul
|  Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Germany
Generation Kplus
When her village school closes amid rumours of possession, ten-year-old Rabia challenges superstition and patriarchy in pursuit of education.
Blending social realism with magical elements, Seemab Gul's debut feature expands on themes explored in her award-winning short Sandstorm, offering a politically sharp story for younger audiences.
Mirage
Ahmed Bouanani
| Morocco (1979)
Berlinale Classics
A foundational work of Moroccan cinema, Mirage returns in a meticulous 4K restoration.
Set during the colonial era, the film follows a villager whose discovery of a bundle of money sets in motion a moral and existential drift through the city of Salé.
Poet and screenwriter Ahmed Bouanani (1938–2011), a key figure in Morocco's modern cinema, made films "the way he wrote poems," and Mirage remains a quietly radical landmark that further underlines Morocco's historical presence at this year's Berlinale.

'Dawson's Creek' star James Van Der Beek dies at 48 following cancer battle
2026-02-12 10:00:23 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/james-van-der-beek-dies-48-colorectal-cancer/

Fans of the 1990s hit series "Dawson's Creek" and the
entertainment
industry were shocked by the death of actor James Van Der Beek, 48, from Stage 3 colorectal cancer diagnosed in November 2024.
Kimberly Van Der Beek, his wife, announced the death through Instagram. "He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace," she stated. "There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come."
She requested privacy for the family, writing, "For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend."
The actor revealed his condition publicly through Instagram on November 3, 2024, according to
CBS News
. "I've been dealing with this privately until now, getting treatment and dialing in my overall health with greater focus than ever before," he disclosed. "Please know that my family and I deeply appreciate all the love and support."
Throughout his illness, Van Der Beek documented his experience on Instagram, frequently acknowledging the unwavering support of his wife and six children.
A GoFundMe campaign supporting Van Der Beek's widow and children exceeded its initial $500,000 target within hours of launching,
The Guardian
reported. Organizers subsequently raised the goal to $1 million.
Van Der Beek achieved widespread fame portraying Dawson Leery – the introspective, earnest aspiring filmmaker at the heart of WB's "Dawson's Creek". The series ran six seasons and became a cornerstone of teen drama television. The role catapulted Van Der Beek to teenage heartthrob status and national celebrity.
"Dawson's Creek" premiered in 1998, set in a Massachusetts seaside town. The show centered on Dawson's relationships with Joey Potter (Katie Holmes), Jen Lindley (Michelle Williams), and Pacey Witter (Joshua Jackson).
Born March 8, 1977, in Cheshire, Connecticut, James David Van Der Beek discovered acting as a child through school plays before making his professional debut in an off-Broadway production of Edward Albee's "Finding the Sun".
While "Dawson's Creek" aired, Van Der Beek landed numerous film roles: He starred as a high school quarterback in 1999's "Varsity Blues", which performed solidly at the box office, and made cameos in "Scary Movie" (2000) and "Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back" (2001).
The series concluded in May 2003 after 128 episodes. Van Der Beek subsequently mixed movie and television work, guest-starring on hot series such as "Criminal Minds", "Ugly Betty", "How I Met Your Mother", "One Tree Hill", and "Law & Order: Criminal Intent".
Hollywood stars paid tribute to Van Der Beek following his death. Co-star Katie Holmes posted a handwritten tribute to Van Der Beek on Instagram, praising his "bravery, compassion, selflessness and strength" along with his "appreciation for life."
"James Van Der Beek was one in a billion and he will be forever missed and I don't know what else to say," co-star Busy Philipps shared her grief. "I am just so so sad," she said.
Reese Witherspoon, who is the executive producer on the "Legally Blonde" prequel "Elle", which will feature Van Der Beek's posthumous performance, wrote on Instagram: "What an extraordinary, talented man who also showed great kindness and grace in every action. Praying all the angels watch over his family during this difficult time."

China delivery firm offers kneeling service to send Lunar New Year greetings for customers

The existential AI threat is here — and some AI leaders are fleeing
2026-02-12 10:00:06 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/ai-openai-agi-xai-doomsday-scenario

Top AI experts at OpenAI, Anthropic and other companies warn of rising dangers of their technology, with some quitting in protest or going public with grave concerns.
Why it matters:
Leading AI models, including Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT, are getting a lot better, a lot faster, and even building new products themselves.
That excites AI optimists — and scares the hell out of several people tasked with policing their safety for society.
Driving the news:
On Monday, an Anthropic researcher announced his departure, in part to
write poetry
about "the place we find ourselves."
An OpenAI researcher also left this week citing
ethical concerns.
Another OpenAI employee, Hieu Pham,
wrote on X
: "I finally feel the existential threat that AI is posing."
Jason Calacanis, tech investor and co-host of the All-In podcast,
wrote on X
: "I've never seen so many technologists state their concerns so strongly, frequently and with such concern as I have with AI."
The biggest talk among the AI crowd Wednesday was entrepreneur
Matt Shumer's post
comparing this moment to the eve of the pandemic. It went mega-viral, gathering 56 million views in 36 hours, as he laid out the risks of AI fundamentally reshaping our jobs and lives.
Reality check:
Most people at these companies remain bullish that they'll be able to steer to technology smartly without societal damage or big job loss. But the companies themselves admit the risk.
Anthropic published a report showing that, while low risk, AI can be used in heinous crimes, including the creation of
chemical weapons
. This so-called "
sabotage report
" looked at the risks of AI without human intervention, purely on its own.
At the same time, OpenAI dismantled its mission alignment team, which was created to ensure AGI (artificial general intelligence) benefits all of humanity, Platformer author Casey Newton
reported Wednesday
.
Between the lines:
While the business and tech worlds are obsessed with this topic, it hardly registers in the White House and Congress.
Threat level:
The latest round of warnings follows evidence that these new models can build complex products themselves and then improve their work without human intervention.
OpenAI's last model helped
train itself.
Anthropic's viral Cowork tool
built itself
, too.
These revelations — in addition to signs that AI threatens big categories of the economy, including software or legal services — prompted a lot of real-time soul-searching.
The bottom line:
The AI disruption is here, and its impact is happening faster and more broadly than many anticipated.

Greenhouse gas emissions will keep falling despite Trump's climate rollback
2026-02-12 10:00:05 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/trump-epa-climate-rollback-emissions-impact

President Trump is trying to pull the rug out from under federal climate regulation. But the U.S. economy may no longer be standing on it.
Why it matters
: The energy transition is well underway and is unlikely to be reversed by Thursday's historic move.
The big picture
: America's emissions are projected to decline substantially even if major climate regulations are repealed, driven by falling renewable energy prices and cleaner natural gas outcompeting dirtier coal.
Driving the news
: The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday is expected to overturn the 2009 "endangerment finding," which determined that
greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare.
The finding sets the foundation for federal regulation of climate pollution under the Clean Air Act.
Issued under President Obama, it reflects the global scientific consensus that greenhouse gases are warming the planet.
Between the lines
: The repeal is legally and symbolically seismic. Its real-world impact may be more muted.
It would likely slow emissions cuts — but not reverse them, according to modeling by the Rhodium Group, a New York-based research firm.
By the numbers:
The firm projects that without big EPA rules underpinned by the finding, U.S. emissions in 2035 would be 26-35% below 2005 levels.
If the rules were intact? A steeper decline of 32-44%.
Reality check
: Neither path comes close to what scientists say is needed to avoid the worst climate impacts.
In its final weeks, the Biden administration
set a target
of cutting emissions at least 61% by 2035 — roughly aligned with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting warming to well below 2°C above preindustrial levels.
Data:
Rhodium Group
; Note: 2030 emissions target set in 2021 during the Biden administration; Chart: Kavya Beheraj/Axios
Flashback
: After years of regulatory whiplash, the finding itself has directly reduced little, if any, emissions since 2009.
Obama-era rules for vehicles, power plants and oil and gas were delayed, challenged or repealed in Trump's first term.
Then-President Biden restarted the process. Trump has now begun unwinding things again.
What they're saying:
"Although the environmental community has viewed the endangerment finding as the holy grail, it has done very little to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," said Jeff Holmstead, a former top EPA official who's
now a partner at the lobbying firm Bracewell, which represents a range of corporate clients.
Yes, but
: The finding's influence likely extended beyond formal rules.
It signaled that federal climate regulation was coming — shaping corporate decisions in ways that are hard to quantify.
"As an energy system modeler
, I can only do what's on my spreadsheet. And there's not something that says, 'turn on U.S. leadership on climate,' " said Ben King, a director at Rhodium who was involved in the analysis.
Zoom out
: Thursday's action marks the most aggressive move yet in nearly two decades of climate policy ping-pong.
And it's reigniting debate about the limits of tackling a decades-long problem through these regulatory swings.
"It does point to the risk
of basing sweeping and really important policy on fragile foundations," said Josh Freed, senior vice president for the climate and energy program at the center-left think tank Third Way.
What we're watching
: Inevitable lawsuits will likely take years to make it to their final destination of the Supreme Court.
"More importantly, the primary drivers for clean energy generation right now are commercial," said David Goldwyn, president of consulting firm Goldwyn Global Strategies.
"There is market demand for fast, clean power, especially for data centers, which face formidable license to operate issues."
The bottom line
: Decades of state and federal policy, plus market shifts, have pushed the economy toward cleaner energy. So far, Trump's rollback isn't enough to turn it around.
Axios' Ben Geman contributed reporting.

A year into Trump's term, voters say Biden was better
2026-02-12 10:00:05 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/trump-polling-approval-biden-democrats

President
Trump
has become so politically toxic that voters now say
Joe Biden
— whose unpopularity forced him into early retirement — did a better job as president, according to three new polls.
Why it matters:
One year in, Trump has squandered virtually every advantage that won him the presidency. The White House has nine months to turn the ship around before a
potential midterm wipeout
for Republicans.
Zoom in:
Three national surveys point to the same alarming trend for a president who's done everything in his power to
erase his predecessor's legacy
.
Harvard CAPS/Harris
(Jan. 28–29):
Mark Penn's polling firm found that 51% of registered voters say Trump is doing a worse job than Biden, compared with 49% who say he's doing better.
Rasmussen Reports
(Feb. 2–4):
The Trump-friendly pollster is fending off MAGA criticism after finding that 48% of likely voters say Biden did a better job as president, compared with 40% who chose Trump. Another 8% said the two presidents have performed "about the same."
YouGov/Economist
(Feb. 6–9):
This survey found that 46% of U.S. adults say Trump is doing a worse job than Biden, compared with 40% who say he's doing better. Another 7% said "about the same."
Between the lines:
In the throes of Biden's 2024 polling collapse, his allies often complained about "
Trump amnesia
" — the notion that voters had collectively memory-holed the chaos of the president's first term.
One year into Trump 2.0, his MAGA movement is making a similar case — that Americans are discounting how much Trump has done to curb the record border crossings and inflation of the Biden years.
"Nearly 80 million Americans gave President Trump a resounding Election Day mandate to end Joe Biden's economic disaster and immigration crisis," White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement.
"The Trump administration remains laser-focused on continuing to cool inflation, accelerate economic growth, secure our border, and mass deport criminal illegal aliens."
Zoom out:
But even under the hood of Trump's polling, the silver linings are disappearing.
His signature issues are now liabilities: 49% of adults "strongly disapprove" of how Trump has handled border security and immigration, according to a
new NBC News poll
.
Trump's net approval on the economy (-18) is 26 points lower than it was at this point in his first term — and 53 points lower among independents, according to CNN polling analyst
Harry Enten
.
Young voters have cratered: The YouGov/Economist poll found Trump at -42 net approval among 18–29 year-olds — a 51-point swing from +9 at the start of his presidency.
What they're saying:
"If you know anything about Donald Trump, you know that he built his two presidential victories on winning voters [who are] without a college degree," Enten said.
"Well, Donald Trump's base with non-college voters is absolutely collapsing."
Reality check:
Don't mistake this for Biden nostalgia.
At least nine
Biden administration alumni
are running for Congress or governor. Few are mentioning the president they served under in campaign materials.
A blue wave is not inevitable: Republicans have a massive cash advantage heading into the midterms, swamping Democrats to the tune of $550 million, according to the
New York Times
.
The bottom line:
Gallup reports
American optimism about the future has fallen to its lowest level in nearly two decades, with just 59.2% expecting high-quality lives five years from now.

Protests erupted in Buenos Aires as thousands, including unions, gathered outside Congress against a labour reform bill championed by President Javier Milei. Clashes broke out when demonstrators approached the building, with police using tear gas and water cannons after objects were thrown. The bill aims to deregulate the labour market by making hiring and firing easier and limiting benefits and strike rights, measures unions say would weaken worker protections.

Nearly a fifth of claimants who lost unemployment benefits in January after 20 years of unemployment are back at work

New figures from the Flemish employment service, the VDAB, show that 17 per cent of people who lost their unemployment benefits in January and February have found work once again. People who have been unemployed for 20 years or more now no longer qualify for unemployment benefit. Unemployment benefits are being limited to two years, but benefits to existing claimants are being removed gradually. Among the group of young people who lost their employment integration benefit in the first months of this year, as many as 32 per cent have now found a job.

Results are expected on Friday, as FRANCE 24's Navodita Kumari explains.

Commission wrong to give Hungary €10B, says EU top court adviser
2026-02-12 09:47:11 GMT
https://www.politico.eu/article/commission-should-not-have-given-hungary-e10b-says-eu-top-court-adviser/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication

STRASBOURG —  The European Commission should reverse its decision to release €10 billion to Hungary in 2023,
according to a senior legal adviser to Europe’s top court.
The Court of Justice of the EU is examining a claim by the European Parliament that the Commission breached its own rules when it unfroze funding for Hungary in December 2023 — money that had been withheld over rule-of-law concerns.
MEPs accuse the Commission of political expediency, arguing that the decision came on the eve of a crucial summit of EU leaders at which the bloc was desperate for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to cooperate on sending aid to Ukraine.
The legal opinion by Advocate-General Tamara Ćapeta — to annul the Commission’s decision to unfreeze the funds — will guide the judges on their final ruling, which will be delivered in a few months. Advocates-general are not judges but legal advisers who help the court in complicated or unprecedented cases.
The opinion lands at a sensitive time, with Orbán trailing in the polls ahead of an April election in Hungary. EU leaders have for several months steadfastly avoided cracking down on Budapest or saying anything overly critical about the prime minister, with the understanding in the Commission and among diplomats that any pressure on Orbán would be spun into campaign material. The legal opinion is “not what we needed” this close to the ballot, said an EU diplomat, granted anonymity to speak freely.
In a statement to POLITICO, a spokesperson for the Commission said: “We consider that the Commission decision at issue was based on a thorough assessment, in particular of the reforms undertaken by Hungary to remedy the shortcomings of the judicial system that the Commission had identified. Furthermore, the Commission decision clearly stated the reasons why the Commission considered that those reforms remedied those shortcomings.”
Orbán did not comment on the ruling as he arrived for a summit of EU leaders in the Belgian countryside. His political director, Bálazs Orbán, said the opinion stemmed from Hungary’s opposition to Ukraine joining the EU. “The moment a member state steps off the European elite script, the legal machinery whirs into action,” he said.
The Court has been working on the case since March 2024 when Parliament filed the suit.
In-depth assessment
Ćapeta’s opinion
says
the Commission “incorrectly” applied its own rule-of-law requirements when it handed over the funds before the Hungarian government’s reforms had been fully applied.
She also said the Commission failed to conduct “a proper assessment of the reforms relating to the independence” of the Hungarian Supreme Court and the appointment of members to the Hungarian Constitutional Court — two key issues that the Parliament said the Commission had not properly addressed.
The advocate-general also slammed the Commission for a lack of transparency, saying it failed to provide proper arguments for the decision to unfreeze the funds. “The Commission owes an explanation not only to Hungary, but to the EU citizens at large,” reads a
statement
from the court.
However, the advocate-general did not back the Parliament’s allegations that the Commission abused its powers.
Ćapeta argued that, in the Commission’s assessment to unfreeze the funds, it failed to take into account the
controversial Sovereignty Protection Law
in the Hungarian parliament. In a separate legal opinion issued on Thursday, the Court found that the law breaches EU law, as it hampers “several fundamental freedoms,” according to a statement.
Get the money back
René Repasi, a German MEP and EU law professor at Erasmus University Rotterdam and the University of Geneva, said an annulment would mean the Commission should “request the money back.”
“If Hungary does not pay back, the Commission can lower other disbursements, which Hungary is entitled to receive, by the amount Hungary is obliged to pay back,” Repasi said.
When it comes, the court’s ruling will establish a precedent regarding the extent of the Commission’s discretion when assessing rule-of-law violations by EU countries, especially in the context of the Common Provisions Regulation, which sets strict conditions relating to fundamental rights and judicial independence for the disbursement of EU funds.
The Commission defended itself
during a hearing in October 2025
, saying that specific pre-established technical “milestones” on addressing judicial independence concerns had been formally met by Budapest, and therefore, the Commission had to release the funds.
But the advocate-general’s opinion sides with the Parliament’s lawyers’ argument that the Commission should have taken a broader view of systemic rule-of-law deficiencies in Hungary and that it incorrectly assessed the fulfillment of judicial reform targets.
Green MEP Daniel Freund said the advocate-general’s opinion “was a stinging rebuke to the Commission. Should the court follow this reasoning in its final ruling, it would mark a victory for the rule of law in Europe.”
He added that the opinion “confirms what the European Parliament has long denounced: The release of €10 billion to the Hungarian government was illegal and politically motivated. By acting as it did, the Commission has gambled away its own credibility.”
“EU funds must only be disbursed when the recipient upholds the law, European values, and the rule of law. We expect the European Commission to adhere to these principles in the future. It must stop allowing itself to be manipulated by autocrats like Viktor Orbán,” Freund said.
This story has been updated. Zoya Sheftalovich and Gabriel Gavin contributed reporting.

Bangladesh votes in landmark polls after deadly uprising
2026-02-12 09:34:22 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/bangladesh-votes-landmark-polls-after-deadly-uprising

Bangladesh
voted Thursday in its first election since a deadly 2024 uprising, as parties crushed under Sheikh Hasina's rule return to the fray with a powerful political heir facing a Jamaat-e-Islami-led coalition.
Queues stretched outside polling stations in the capital, Dhaka, in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or "conspiracies" to derail the vote.
More than 300,000 soldiers and police are deployed countrywide, with UN experts warning ahead of voting of "growing intolerance, threats and attacks", and a "tsunami of disinformation", especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.
"This was my first vote," said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College, who lined up early to avoid the crowds.
"I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive."
Leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman, 60, is confident his
Bangladesh Nationalist Party
(BNP) can regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.
But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country's largest party, Jamaat-e-Islami.
"If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed," the BNP's Rahman said after voting.
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign, and if victorious, the former political prisoner could form the first Islamist-led government in constitutionally secular Bangladesh.
Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it "will do whatever is required" to ensure a fair result.
'Ended the nightmare'
Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead, with some suggesting a knife-edge race.
During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.
Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going "smoothly in a free and fair manner", but warned of a flood of disinformation on social media, especially AI-generated content, "coming from across the border".
He did not give further details, but relations with neighbouring India have soured since the 2024 uprising.
Interim leader
Muhammad Yunus
, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote "will determine the future direction of the country, the character of its democracy, its durability, and the fate of the next generation".
The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina's 15-year rule
ended
with her ouster in August 2024.
His administration has barred her Awami League party from contesting the polls.
Hasina, 78, was
sentenced to death
in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.
Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had "ended the nightmare and begun a new dream."
Referendum
He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one party rule.
The 127 million voters are also voting in a referendum on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.
Counting by hand begins after polls close at 4:30 pm (1030 GMT). Results in past elections trickled in hours later.
The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world's second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.
The BNP's Rahman, whose late parents both led the country, told
AFP
ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.
But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that "the economy has been destroyed".

US willing to accept Iranian uranium enrichment, Turkey says
2026-02-12 09:30:22 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/us-iran-nuclear-deal-turkey-uranium-enrichment-talks/

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in an interview published Thursday in the
Financial Times
that the US and
Iran
are showing flexibility regarding a nuclear agreement. "It is a positive sign that it appears the Americans are willing to accept uranium enrichment in Iran, subject to clear limits that will be set in advance," Fidan said.
Turkey has played a central role in mediating between the US and Iran, which led to the round of negotiations held on Friday in Oman. According to Fidan, "The Iranians understand they need to reach an agreement with the Americans, and the Americans understand that the Iranians have certain red lines. There is no point trying to force them."
In an interview published earlier this week on
CNN Türk
, Fidan said, "Right now, at least, there does not appear to be an immediate threat of war," but added, "We are doing everything we can to prevent disaster." Fidan revealed that Turkey has made clear to Washington that an "all or nothing" approach toward Iran will not yield results, and that Ankara has recommended the Americans focus first on the nuclear issue and not demand Tehran address four issues simultaneously – the missile issue, support for terrorist organizations, treatment of protesters, alongside the nuclear project.
According to him, Iran is prepared to discuss only two issues – the nature of uranium enrichment, and what will be done with uranium enriched to 60%.
Fidan added in the interview with the British newspaper that he estimates Tehran "genuinely wants to reach a real agreement" and will agree to limits on enrichment levels and a strict oversight regime, as it did in the 2015 nuclear deal. However, he warned that expanding the talks to include ballistic missiles "will bring nothing but another war."
Until now, Washington has demanded Iran give up its stockpile of uranium enriched to levels up to 60%, a short distance from the 90% level considered sufficient for producing nuclear weapons. According to estimates, Tehran's stockpile is sufficient, after further enrichment, to produce about ten nuclear bombs. Additionally, the US has demanded that Iran not enrich uranium on its soil.
Publicly, Iran rejects demands to remove the uranium stockpile from the country and demands recognition of what it sees as its right to enrich uranium under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Despite this, the
New York Times
reported during the recent tensions that Iranian National Security Council Secretary Ali Larijani proposed, in a meeting with Putin, transferring the stockpile to Russia, while ideas such as a regional uranium enrichment consortium in which Iran could participate have also emerged.
Fidan's remarks came against the backdrop of the first round of negotiations between the US and Iran, held on Friday in Oman with Omani mediation. Alongside the diplomacy, the US has significantly increased its military presence in the region – the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln is deployed in the Middle East along with warships, air defense systems, and fighter jets.
On Tuesday, President Trump said in an interview with Axios that he is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the region, and on Wednesday, the
Wall Street Journal
reported the Pentagon has ordered a carrier strike group to prepare for deployment. According to the report, the aircraft carrier George H.W. Bush, which is completing exercises off the Virginia coast, may deploy to the region within two weeks. If deployed, this would be the first time in about a year that two American aircraft carriers have operated in the Middle East simultaneously.
On Wednesday, Trump and Netanyahu met at the White House in a meeting that lasted about three hours. After the meeting, Trump wrote on Truth Social that he "insisted negotiations with Iran continue to see if a deal can be completed," but added a threat – "Last time Iran decided it was better not to sign a deal, and it got hit with a 'midnight hammer' – and that did not work out well for it."
Iranian preparations for attack continue
Iran is working to fortify the site adjacent to the nuclear facility at Natanz, also called "Pickaxe Mountain" (Kuh-e Kolang Gaz La), according to a new report by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) published Wednesday. The report is based on satellite images from Monday showing extensive construction activity at the site, including concrete pouring, truck traffic, and use of heavy engineering equipment.
Earlier this month, the institute reported Iran had completed covering the entrances to the tunnel complex in Isfahan as part of its preparations for the possibility of an airstrike or ground forces raid on its nuclear facilities, similar to the pattern observed before the attacks in the June war.
According to the report, Monday's satellite images reveal ongoing fortification work at two of the entrances to the complex. Active traffic of heavy vehicles was observed at the site, including transport trucks, concrete mixers, excavators and cranes. For example, at the western entrance, concrete was poured over the tunnel opening, and at one of the eastern entrances, earth and rocks were pushed and piled above the opening.
During the past month, a reinforced concrete frame was also added above the tunnel opening, designed to bear additional protective layers. According to the report's authors, all these measures are intended to strengthen the tunnel openings and protect them from an airstrike.
The Pickaxe Mountain complex is located about 0.6 miles (1 kilometer) south of the enrichment facility at Natanz, which was the heart of Iran's enrichment program. Construction at the site began in late 2020, and Iran claimed it was intended for establishing a factory to produce advanced centrifuges.
However, the size of the complex and the protection provided by the depth of construction inside the mountain – according to estimates even deeper than Fordow – raised immediate concern among experts that Iran might be planning to conduct additional sensitive activities there, primarily uranium enrichment.
Nevertheless, the report's authors estimate the facility is probably not yet ready for operation, due to the presence of heavy engineering equipment at the site. However, in recent months, smaller vehicles and closed vehicles have also been observed near the entrances, raising the possibility Iran has begun bringing equipment into the tunnels.
It is unclear exactly what Iran plans to do at the facility, and whether it possesses the equipment required for it after the attacks on its nuclear program in the June war. The report's authors also cast doubt on whether the level of infrastructure visible at the site – one ventilation shaft and overhead and underground power lines – is sufficient to support activities such as uranium enrichment.

Scoop: Democrats are eyeing protests at Trump's State of the Union address
2026-02-12 09:30:04 GMT
https://www.axios.com/2026/02/12/trump-state-of-the-union-democrats-protests

Some House Democrats say they plan to defy instructions from House Minority Leader
Hakeem Jeffries
(D-N.Y.) not to protest President Trump during his State of the Union address on Feb. 24.
Why it matters:
Even some top progressives and lawmakers who participated in
demonstrations at Trump's speech last year
acknowledge it wasn't their shining moment.
"Last year didn't really work as envisioned," Rep. Greg Casar (D-Texas), the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told Axios.
Another senior House progressive, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share details of sensitive internal conversations, said "there's just a feeling that it wasn't real effective last time."
Driving the news:
Jeffries told colleagues in a closed-door meeting Wednesday morning to either attend the speech with "silent defiance" or skip it, according to multiple senior Democratic lawmakers and aides.
The Democratic leader was frustrated with last year's disruptions,
chewing out some of the most vocal demonstrators
behind closed doors.
He wasn't the only one: Many moderate and establishment leading House Democrats
scoffed at the behavior
at the time.
One centrist House Democrat fumed to Axios on Wednesday that the disruptions were "completely counterproductive and made us look like children. We should be grown-ups, because [Republicans] are not."
What they're saying:
Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-Mich.) told Axios he plans to attend the speech and that he would "love to show some resistance to what is going on."
"I've done that through
bringing articles of impeachmen
t and I have done my best in committees to protest," he said. "I want to find a way to ... resist, because he needs to know that this is not normal."
Democratic Women's Caucus chair Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) said members will "make sure that our opinions with regards to Trump are understood" and that her group "will be doing a lot of stuff around the State of the Union."
Others said they may walk out mid-speech, with Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) telling Axios: "The only question for me is which of his disgusting lines prompts me to get up and leave, because at some point I will."
The intrigue:
Some of the most prolific disruptors of Trump's joint session speech last year didn't say whether they will attend this time around.
Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who was
escorted out of the chamber
and
later censured
for repeatedly interrupting Trump, said he has "not decided" whether to attend or if he plans to repeat his actions from last year.
Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) said she is "not sure yet" whether she will go to the speech, though she plans to invite a guest and doesn't "want to leave them alone."
Yes, but:
Don't expect anything on the scale of last year, when dozens of Democrats held up signs, heckled Trump and walked out early in protest, lawmakers stressed.
"It's a somber moment in our country ... and so I don't expect anybody to do anything that takes away from the importance of that moment," said Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), the deputy chair of the Progressive Caucus.
A second senior House progressive who spoke on the condition of anonymity, asked about the possibility of a coordinated protest, told Axios: "I don't think that's going to happen."
"There is no organized choreography as far as I know," said Huffman.
The bottom line:
For many Democrats, it's simply a dilemma over whether to even attend.
Asked whether she plans to go, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) asked Axios what the date of the speech is.
Told it is on Feb. 24, she replied with a smirk: "I'll have to check my calendar."

Egypt's new cabinet after reshuffle disappoints Egyptians
2026-02-12 09:23:21 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/egypts-new-cabinet-after-reshuffle-disappoints-egyptians

Egypt's
latest cabinet reshuffle has sparked widespread disappointment, falling short of the transformative change that ordinary people and experts have been demanding.
This is especially so, those objecting to the shakeup say, following recent parliamentary polls and as economic hardships deepen across the populous Arab country.
The members of the new cabinet were sworn in by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday, a day after parliament approved the reshuffle, which included changes to 14 ministerial portfolios, including defence.
The changes focused heavily on economic roles, bringing in a World Bank economist as minister of planning and a Financial Regulatory Authority official as minister of investment and foreign trade.
Nonetheless, the reshuffle, which has left key foreign affairs and security roles unchanged, keeps Mostafa Madbouli in office since 2018 and widely seen as emblematic of past policy shortcomings, in place, fuelling perceptions of continuity rather than meaningful change.
This is why some people are voicing frustration through sharp sarcasm, viewing the shakeup as a superficial change that leaves the core leadership untouched.
One expressive example came from an Egyptian journalist who shared a
doctored photo
of Madbouli shaking hands with himself. The caption read: "We need to hold a party to honour former Prime Minister Dr Mostafa Madbouli after handing over his post to his successor... Dr Mostafa Madbouli".
Another man expressed clear
disappointment
at how little is known about the new ministers joining the cabinet.
Old approaches
Critics, including some MPs, have viewed the shakeup as too limited, merely reshuffling faces without addressing deeper failures.
Some critics argue that the change is merely reproducing the same executive structure and will likely maintain the same policies that have harmed middle-class and low-income
Egyptians
in the coming years.
"I cannot regard this as a genuine cabinet reshuffle, as it fails to address the fundamental causes of Egypt's challenges," MP Freddy Elbaiady told
The New Arab
.
"While some new faces have been introduced, I am convinced that the same policies and management approach will persist unchanged," he added.
Elbaiady expressed deep regret that the poor continue to bear the brunt of what he called "misguided policies".
"
Egypt
desperately needed real transformation, one that introduces fresh economic, political, and social approaches," he concluded.
An urban planning expert and former professor, Madbouli, 59, previously served as Minister of Housing, Utilities, and Urban Communities. He assumed the premiership in June 2018.
This is his third government. However, the record of his two previous administrations remains highly controversial, amid public anger over soaring commodity prices and persistent economic hardships.
An
online newspaper
attempted to explain why Sisi remains committed to keeping Madbouli in his position, attributing it to the prime minister's strong support for flagship infrastructure megaprojects, most notably the New Administrative Capital.
This ambitious multibillion-dollar desert city, first announced by Madbouli himself in 2015 while he served as housing minister, has faced widespread criticism as an extravagant misuse of public funds, often labelled a vanity project or a drain on resources amid Egypt's economic challenges.
The newspaper suggested that Madbouli's alignment with and stewardship of such grand initiatives, which are central to Sisi's vision for modernising
Egypt
, make him a reliable figure to continue these high-profile developments.
Claims of mismanagement
Sisi has instructed the new government to prioritise improving economic and living conditions and enhancing health and education services.
In his
presidential mandate
, he handed the prime minister, the Egyptian president also ordered the cabinet to take measures to reduce public debts by implementing new ideas.
There is little confidence, however, that any real change is possible, particularly given that the same prime minister who oversaw Egypt's slide into its current tough economic conditions over the past eight years remains in power.
Since taking the helm of the government, Madbouli has driven Egypt into one economic crisis after another.
His tenure witnessed
repeated devaluations
of the Egyptian pound, a sharp rise in
foreign debts
, and a dramatic surge in the
poverty rate
.
These developments, economists said, have negatively affected the living conditions of tens of millions of Egyptians.
The same developments propelled a wide range of austerity measures, especially in connection with an International Monetary Fund loan programme.
The measures included a raft of structural adjustments and the sale of state assets to the local and foreign private sector.
They also included major cuts to electricity, energy, water, and food
subsidies
, leaving tens of millions of people struggling, especially as salaries have remained the same for most Egyptians.
This is leaving observers disappointed, especially given the reshuffle's potential failure to deliver the anticipated breakthrough in tackling Egypt's deep-rooted structural problems, such as chronic fiscal mismanagement, overdue subsidy reforms, and measures to genuinely empower the private sector.
Economics professor Alia al-Mahdi called for a fundamental overhaul of the government's past approaches to improving citizens' living standards.
"There is an urgent need for such a revision, particularly given the sharp surge in commodity prices in the past few years," she told
TNA
.
With the new government now in place, al-Mahdi added, it has a clear opportunity to correct the errors of previous administrations.
Coming with baggage
State-run media have welcomed the cabinet reshuffle, mostly citing the professional and academic background and expertise of incoming ministers.
Nevertheless, some of the same ministers carry baggage from past controversies.
This was probably why the parliamentary session scheduled for debate on the new cabinet lineup was delayed by several hours (from 1 PM to around 4 PM), amid reports of disagreements and objections over certain names.
Some local media outlets have meanwhile alleged that the new housing minister was implicated in
financial irregularities
dating back to 2017.
The appointment of
Khaled Hashem
as Minister of Industry has also fuelled additional controversy around the new cabinet.
Hashem, a Dubai-based executive who previously served as President for the Middle East and Africa at Honeywell, a US multinational company accused of supplying components or technology used in Israeli military operations during
Israel's genocidal war on Gaza
, has drawn criticism over his past corporate ties.
This backlash has even intensified after Sisi's recent visit to the United Arab Emirates, where he met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan just days before the reshuffle was finalised and approved by the parliament.
Observers said this adds to the general atmosphere of confusion around the latest reshuffle.
MP Elbaiady said the prime minister should have carefully reviewed each new minister's background and dossier before submitting their names to the president for approval.
"This apparent lack of thorough preparation erodes public confidence in the new government," he added.

After deadly protests forced reforms in 2022, Kazakhstan’s president agreed to one term. His new Constitution offers two Putin-style escape hatches to stay in power.
2026-02-12 09:13:18 GMT
https://meduza.io/en/feature/2026/02/12/after-deadly-protests-forced-reforms-in-2022-kazakhstan-s-president-agreed-to-one-term-his-new-constitution-offers-two-putin-style-escape-hatches-to-stay-in-power

On January 31, Kazakhstan unveiled a
draft
of its new Constitution, the culmination of what President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has framed as a parliamentary overhaul. The initiative began in September 2025, when Tokayev
proposed
dismantling Kazakhstan’s two-chamber parliament in favor of a unicameral model, arguing that the Senate is a relic of the “unstable political conditions” of 1995 that has served its purpose. He claims the new structure will allow bills to pass more efficiently, though he
cautioned
that the shift would require changes to about 40 articles of the Constitution.
However, as work progressed on Kazakhstan’s constitutional revisions, it became clear that far more amendments were necessary. Tokayev
explained
on January 20 that such large-scale changes were comparable to adopting a new Constitution. He
created
a special constitutional commission the following day. The group acted swiftly, reportedly drafting the revised Constitution in just 10 days.

The plan calls for amendments to
77 articles
, which account for 84 percent of the Constitution’s text. Key changes
include
:
A unicameral general assembly called the “Kurultai” — a historical term rooted in Turkic and Mongol traditions — will replace the bicameral parliament. The number of deputies will decrease from 148 to 145, and the plan
eliminates
quotas for appointed deputies.
Restores the position of vice president, which existed in Kazakhstan until 1996. The president will appoint the vice president with the Kurultai’s approval. If the president leaves office early, the vice president becomes the successor and must call new elections within two months.
Expands the list of senior officials appointed by the president by at least double. If the Kurultai twice refuses to approve the appointments, the president may dissolve the parliament.
Creates a new advisory state body: the People’s Council. It will convene at least once a year, with the authority to introduce bills to the Kurultai and to propose referendums. Under the plan, the president would
appoint
the council’s members.
Introduces new limitations on free speech,
stipulating
that speech must not “encroach upon the honor and dignity of other persons, the health of citizens, or public morality, and must not violate the public order.”
International treaties ratified by Kazakhstan will no longer have automatic priority over the country’s domestic laws.
Defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman.
A proposed change regarding the use of the Russian language has drawn the most backlash in Russia. Under Kazakhstan’s current Constitution, Russian is used “
equally
” with Kazakh in government offices. While the draft of the new Constitution published on January 31 left this phrasing untouched, Bakhyt Nurmukhanov, deputy chairman of the Constitutional Court and a member of the reform commission,
announced
on February 9 that the word “equally” would be replaced with “alongside.”
Kazakhstan has a total population of approximately 20 million. According to
2021 census data
, 2.98 million residents identify as Russian, and 2.85 million consider Russian their native language. Among ethnic Russians, 2.1 million reported not speaking the state language, Kazakh.

How Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan resist Russia’s linguistic influence
Nurmukhanov said the
decision
was made for the sake of “terminological and semantic uniformity.” According to the Russian state media outlet Sputnik Kazakhstan, the formal status of Russian is
not changing
; it will remain Kazakhstan’s language of interethnic communication and the second most prevalent language throughout the country. The story nonetheless circulated widely in Russian media circles, drawing criticism from pro-Kremlin figures.
“There’s a huge difference between ‘equally’ and ‘alongside,’” State Duma Deputy Konstantin Zatulin warned. A fellow Russian lawmaker, Viktor Vodolatsky, claimed that the change would allow Kazakhstani officials to choose whether to use Russian. At the same time, pundits Vladimir Evseev and Dmitry Solonnikov argued that Kazakhstan is ignoring its ties to Russia to please the U.S., while the pro-Kremlin news site ANNA News went even further, declaring that Kazakhstan’s new Constitution is being “written in Brussels and Washington.” So far, there has been no comment from the Kremlin.
The language norm had previously drawn criticism within Kazakhstan as well. After the draft Constitution was published, but before officials clarified the distinction between “equally” and “alongside,” some critics demanded a revision of the provision. “We are not trying to limit the Russian language,” lawyer Meirman Kalmakhanuly
said
at a news conference on February 4. “But in people’s minds, the phrase ‘Russian is officially used equally with Kazakh’ means that these two languages are one and the same.”
Officials have not revealed if this criticism impacted how they framed the revised Constitution’s new Russian-language standard. The police actively
pressured
individuals who spoke out against the draft Constitution as a whole or against its individual provisions.
For Kazakhstan’s leadership, the Russian language norm is a third rail, according to journalist
Alexander Konstantinov
. The state’s silence is driven by fears of internal discord and a strategic necessity to avoid provoking Russian “patriots.” As lawmaker
Ermurat Bapi
put it, the nation must tread carefully to avoid “catastrophe,” noting that Kazakhstan is not in a position to underestimate “the strength of the arrogant and the malevolent.” Moreover, officials believe that Russian does not threaten Kazakh, which is growing organically.
“Demographically and culturally, Kazakhstan has changed significantly over the past decade. The new generation of young citizens perceives Kazakh as their first — and often only — language. When it comes to learning other languages, they study English, French, or Chinese. Russian is present as background noise, but it’s definitely on its way out,”
notes
Vyacheslav Polovinko, Novaya Gazeta’s special correspondent in Kazakhstan.
In Polovinko’s view, the
primary defect
of the new Constitution is not the language provisions or the many discrepancies, which even the authors
acknowledge
. Instead, the document consolidates Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s power ahead of a new political transition.
Kazakhstan’s president is currently limited to one seven-year term. Tokayev himself
approved
this rule after large-scale protests in 2022. His term ends in 2029, and he has
promised
to abide by the law. However, the new Constitution theoretically offers him a way to circumvent these restrictions — either by “zeroing out” his presidential terms, as President Putin did in 2020, or by transitioning to the vice presidency, as Prime Minister Putin did in 2008.
The referendum on Kazakhstan’s constitutional reforms is
scheduled
for March 15.

Olympic chiefs ban Ukrainian racer who wanted to wear helmet honoring war dead

Ukrainian skeleton pilot Vladyslav Heraskevych will not be performing at the Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina after he refused to comply with the rules on athletes’ self-expression, the International Olympic Committee announced Thursday.
Heraskevych wanted to wear a memorial helmet with portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed by Russia in his race Thursday and refused to consider wearing a black armband instead as a compromise offered to him by the IOC. So the committee decided to withdraw his accreditation from the Games.
“Despite multiple exchanges and in-person meetings between the IOC and Mr Heraskevych, the last one this morning with IOC President Kirsty Coventry, he did not consider any form of compromise,” the IOC
said in a statement
Thursday.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy criticized the IOC’s decision in a
post on X
, noting that “660 Ukrainian athletes and coaches
have been killed by Russia
since the full-scale invasion began” almost four years ago.
“No rule has been broken” in Heraskevych’s wish to wear the memorial helmet, Zelenskyy said. “It is Russia that constantly violates Olympic principles.”
The IOC said it had been “very keen for Mr. Heraskevych to compete. This is why the IOC sat down with him to look for the most respectful way to address his desire to remember his fellow athletes who have lost their lives following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,” according to its statement.
“The essence of this case is not about the message; it is about where he wanted to express it,” the committee added.
Heraskevych was able to display his helmet in all training runs. The IOC also offered him the option of displaying it immediately after the race when going through the mixed zone. However, the athlete instead demanded an apology for the pressure from the IOC as he, as well as the Ukrainian Olympic Committee, insisted the helmet did not violate any rules.
“I never wanted a scandal with the IOC. I did not create it. IOC created it with its special interpretation of the rules, which many people consider discriminatory,” Heraskevych
said
Thursday on social media.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called the IOC’s decision “a
moment of shame
.”
Heraskevych “simply wanted to commemorate fellow athletes killed in war. There is nothing wrong with that under any rules or ethics,” Sybiha said in a
post on X
.
Ukrainians are “proud of Vladyslav and of what he did,” Zelenskyy said in his post.
“Having courage is worth more than any medal.”

Snow White's $170 million flop: Gal Gadot's embarrassment
2026-02-12 09:00:36 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/disney-snow-white-170-million-dollar-loss-gal-gadot/

Nearly a year has passed since the live-action adaptation of "
Snow White
" arrived in theaters and crashed at the box office. The high-profile production starring Rachel Zegler as Disney's first princess and
Gal Gadot
as the Evil Queen received particularly cold reviews (50 lukewarm on Metacritic, 39 rotten on Rotten Tomatoes, and an especially embarrassing 2.2 on IMDb), and the studio has been known to have lost considerable money on the project.
Beyond the mediocrity of the film itself – and that can still be debated – there is no doubt that "Snow White" also failed, and perhaps primarily, because of the drama that unfolded behind the scenes.
Much has already been written about the condescending criticism Zegler hurled at the original animated work; about complaints from some audiences that Zegler is an actress of Latino descent with brown skin tone, while Snow White should be a pale-skinned maiden; about Gadot's participation during the Gaza war and calls from the BDS and other Palestinian organizations to boycott the film; and about claims that Disney chose to avoid casting actual short-statured actors to portray the seven dwarfs, instead opting to create computer-animated characters defined altogether as "magical creatures" rather than dwarfs.
Additionally, "Snow White" has been nominated for six Razzie Awards at the dubious ceremony scheduled for next month, including worst film, worst remake/sequel, worst supporting actor (all seven dwarfs... sorry, the magical creatures), and worst director (Marc Webb).
As if all that were not enough, a new report in the business magazine
Forbes
states that Disney lost a staggering $170 million on "Snow White," based on estimates that the film's production cost was at least $336 million.
However, the studio benefited from tax refunds totaling $65 million from the British government, where most of the film was shot, and therefore the final budget stands at $271 million – against revenues of $205 million worldwide.
The issue is that half the revenue sum – approximately $102 million – goes to the theaters, which, as mentioned, places Disney's losses in the $170 million range, not including advertising and marketing expenses. In short, not pleasant, and that is even before the Razzie distribution.
On the other hand, there is no need to pity Disney when it comes to live-action adaptations of their classic animation hits. The remake of "Lilo & Stitch," for example, which came out in May 2025 (two months after "Snow White"), grossed more than $1 billion, and estimates are that the new adaptation of "Moana," coming to us this July, will crush the box office without blinking.
Up next are remakes of "The Little Mermaid," "Hercules," and "Bambi" that have not yet received official release dates but are in development stages. Love it or not, the genre is not going anywhere.

WH fires member who hijacked antisemitism hearing to condemn Israel
2026-02-12 09:00:26 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/white-house-fires-commissioner-antisemitic-outburst-hearing/

A hearing at the
White House Religious Freedom Commission
, held Monday and focused on antisemitism in the United States, devolved into an extraordinary confrontation after committee member Carrie Prejean Boller chose to redirect the discussion toward Israel and
Gaza
while incorporating antisemitic statements, leading to her removal from the commission. One of the central witnesses in the discussion was Shabbos Kestenbaum, a American-Jewish activist, who said he was surprised not only by the questions asked but by the disregard for the actual topic.
"I took ten minutes in my opening testimony not to mention Israel, the Middle East, Gaza, Zionism or Netanyahu," he said. "I did this deliberately because I'm accused of being 'Israel First', or a foreign agent. I wanted the audience to understand the problem here is American."
According to him, his testimony focused on concrete examples of religious discrimination in the United States. "I spoke about anti-Christian, anti-Mormon, and anti-Jewish discrimination. I brought practical cases happening on campuses and explained how such a commission, and how the federal administration, can actually help."
But instead of addressing what was said, Kestenbaum claims Boller chose to divert the discourse. "At the end of the hearing, after she sat almost the entire time busy on her phone, she decided to ask questions. Not about what we said, not about how to advance religious freedom in the US, but about our opinions regarding conflicts in the Middle East," he said. "It was completely disconnected from reality and from the discussion that took place." During the exchange, Boller pressed Kestenbaum to condemn Israel for what is happening in Gaza, claiming "70,000 innocent civilians" were murdered, while completely ignoring Hamas' actions.
During the discussion, Boller declared that due to her Catholic faith, she believes "Jews killed Jesus" and that she "doesn't embrace Zionists." During the hearing, she also asked panel participants, "Because of my opposition to the State of Israel, am I antisemitic, yes or no?" and received jeers from some of those present in the hall.
Kestenbaum emphasized he does not seek to restrict free speech. "I'm not interested in policing people's thoughts or words," he said. "Students at Harvard or anywhere else should be free to say 'Free Palestine' or 'Globalize the Intifada.' Free speech, even if it's ugly, is free speech."
However, according to him, the red line is clear. "The problem starts when words become actions, when students block Jews or Christians from accessing public spaces, events or classrooms. Here, we're no longer talking about an opinion but about a violation of federal law. And that's exactly what we saw on campuses."
Regarding Boller's religious statements, Kestenbaum said the question for him is not just whether it constitutes antisemitism. "If someone says 'Jews killed Jesus,' I don't dwell on the question of whether it's antisemitic or not," he said. "What concerns me more is how someone who displays such basic biblical ignorance finds herself on a panel appointed by the White House."
According to him, Catholic clergy, including priests, were present during that day's discussion and condemned what was said. "And yet she felt comfortable speaking on behalf of hundreds of millions of Catholics worldwide, despite converting to the faith less than a year ago. I wish I had that confidence," he added cynically.
Beyond the specific incident, Kestenbaum sees antisemitism as an expression of a deeper problem in American society. "We're teaching young people that their failures stem from Jews," he said. "This is a destructive perception. It creates despair, extremism, and ultimately violence."
Following the confrontation, the exchange spilled over to social media Tuesday. Boller accused Kestenbaum of calling Hamas a "rapist Islamic regime," claimed his words reflect "offensive generalization toward Islam," and made clear she would "not resign from this commission." She added that "Zionist supremacy has no place on an American religious freedom commission." Kestenbaum responded that he stands behind his words, stating clearly that Hamas is a rapist Islamic regime and that those who think differently are welcome to start their own commission but should not tarnish the MAGA agenda and President Trump's mission.
Tuesday, commission chairman and Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick announced that Boller "has been removed from President Trump's Religious Freedom Commission" and made clear that "no commission member has the right to hijack a hearing for a personal and political agenda on any issue." According to him, "This is exactly what happened Monday at our hearing on antisemitism in America," emphasizing it was "my decision." Patrick added that the commission will submit "one of the most important reports in American history directly to the president," and that "the president respects all religions" and believes in Americans' right to their heritage, anchored in the First Amendment.
Following Boller's removal, Kestenbaum responded, "Unfortunately, at the White House hearing on religious freedom that focused on religious discrimination against American Christians and American Jews, a commission member chose to hijack the agenda, tarnish the MAGA movement and focus exclusively on the Middle East conflict. Let it be clear – Americans are free not to like Zionism, not to like the State of Israel, not to like the Jewish people. What concerns us is violation of federal law, which the commissioner showed no interest in."

The United States and Iran are showing flexibility on a

, with Washington appearing "willing" to tolerate some nuclear enrichment, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told the
Financial Times
in an interview published Thursday.
"It is positive that the Americans appear willing to tolerate Iranian enrichment within clearly set boundaries," Fidan, who has been involved in talks with both Washington and Tehran, told the
FT
.
"The Iranians now recognise that they need to reach a deal with the Americans, and the Americans understand that the Iranians have certain limits. It's pointless to try to force them."
This comes as Israeli forces continue their ongoing offensive in the
occupied West Bank
, having detained at least 40 Palestinians in the region, including 15 in Qalqilia.

Iraq protests Turkish's FM over PKK remarks
2026-02-12 08:25:07 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/iraq-protests-turkishs-fm-over-pkk-remarks

The
Iraqi
Foreign Ministry called in the Turkish ambassador to Baghdad on Wednesday after Turkey's foreign minister said Iraq would soon face pressure to take stronger action against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).
Baghdad
criticised these comments as interference in its internal affairs.
The ministry
said
it hosted Turkish Ambassador Anil Bora İnan on 11 February, following remarks by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan during a televised interview on
CNN Türk
two days earlier.
At the meeting, Iraq's Undersecretary for Bilateral Relations, Ambassador Mohammed Hussein Bahr al-Uloom, told the ambassador that Baghdad was "dissatisfied" with the statements, saying they hurt relations and broke diplomatic protocols.
He stressed that
Iraq
is a sovereign country with its own democracy and should not be compared to countries with different systems. Bahr al-Uloom said that issues in Sinjar and other regions are Iraq's internal affairs and should be handled in accordance with its own priorities. He firmly rejected outside efforts to force political or military solutions.
For his part, the Turkish Ambassador clarified that the Foreign Minister's statements were inaccurately understood due to an incorrect translation. He explained that the Minister's remarks concerned members of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) present in
Iraq
and were not related to Iraq's internal affairs or its citizens.
Ankara responds
In a written
statement
issued later on 11 February, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Öncü Keçeli said that Fidan's remarks had been "distorted by some media outlets in Iraq."
The statement affirmed Ankara's intention to strengthen cooperation with Iraq in areas including security and counterterrorism.
Ankara explained that Fidan's comments were meant to point out what Turkey sees as a threat to Iraq's territorial integrity from the PKK, which it says is based in places like Sinjar, Makhmur, and Qandil.
The statement said Fidan stressed Turkey's commitment to removing the PKK from Iraqi territory, as it has tried to do in Syria, and called for more cooperation with Baghdad.
Ankara rejected allegations of interference and reiterated its support for
Iraq's
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
What did Fidan say?
In a live interview on
CNN Türk
, Fidan said that after events in Syria, attention would turn to Iraq when it comes to the PKK.
"There is also an Iraq dimension to this issue," he said. "After the Syrian side is resolved, there is the Iraq side. Hopefully,
Iraq
will draw lessons from what has happened here and make wiser decisions so that the transition there will be easier."
The Turkish minister stated that Baghdad would need to show political resolve on the PKK, especially in Sinjar, and suggested Iraq would eventually adopt a policy banning armed groups from operating within its borders.
"Our argument has always been this: the PKK is an organisation established against Turkey, but it doesn't occupy or control any territory within Turkey. However, in
Iraq
, it occupies vast swathes of land," Fidan said. "The problem has become more your problem than mine. What kind of sovereign state allows an armed organisation to exist on its territory in this way?"
He added that Iraq has the capacity to address the PKK and described a potential joint ground and air operation as "a very simple military operation," noting that Sinjar is surrounded by the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF).
In response, Ambassador İnan told Iraqi officials that Fidan's remarks had been misunderstood due to translation errors. He stressed that the comments were only about PKK elements in Iraq, not about Iraq's political system or its people.
Some analysts argue that Baghdad's response was insufficient and overly cautious.
Harry Istepanian, energy and water expert and a senior fellow with the Iraq Energy Institute, told
The New Arab
that Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's remarks went beyond legitimate security concerns and amounted to public interference in Iraq's sovereignty, particularly by questioning Iraq's statehood and outlining a potential joint military operation in Sinjar.
He dismissed Ankara's claim that the controversy stemmed from mistranslation as unconvincing, noting that Fidan's comments were consistent across multiple accounts and clearly conveyed policy messaging.
Istepanian suggested that
Iraq's
decision to treat the issue as a translation problem appears to be a diplomatic off-ramp, allowing Baghdad to formally protest while avoiding a deeper confrontation with Turkey, a key partner in trade, water, and security matters.
Bilateral relations
Iraq and Turkey have strong economic ties, with Ankara among Baghdad's main trading partners. Turkish companies play an important role in Iraq's infrastructure and energy sectors. Trade between the two countries is among the highest in the region.
Despite these economic ties, security tensions continue, especially as Turkey keeps up its military campaign against the PKK in northern
Iraq
. Ankara often carries out cross-border strikes against PKK fighters, whom it calls a terrorist group, a label also used by the European Union and the United States.
Since ISIS was defeated, Sinjar has remained a volatile area with federal forces, Yazidi militias, and Shia armed groups operating there. After ISIS overran the town in August 2014 and carried out mass killings and enslavement of the Yazidi community, local fighters formed the Sinjar Resistance Units (YBS) with support from the PKK to protect the population.
Although the PKK has since announced its withdrawal from Sinjar, and the YBS has been formally incorporated into
Iraq's
Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), Ankara maintains that PKK elements continue to operate in Sinjar and the nearby Makhmour area.

Asia shares mostly gain after Wall Street wobbled over strong jobs report

2026-02-12T04:55:22Z
HONG KONG (AP) — Asia shares were mostly higher Thursday and benchmarks in Japan and South Korea reached new records after
Wall Street wobbled
following a better-than-expected U.S. job report.
U.S. futures edged higher.
Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 surpassed the 58,000 mark early in the session as trading resumed after a holiday. However, it gave up those gains, edging just 10 points lower to 57,639.84.
Japanese shares have rallied following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s landslide victory in a parliamentary election on Sunday, as investors expect more policies to help spur economic growth.
South Korea’s Kospi breached the 5,500 mark for the first time, driven by gains for technology-related stocks. It was up 3.1% at 5,522.27.
Samsung Electronics, South Korea’s biggest listed company, rose 6.4%. Chipmaker SK Hynix added 3.3%.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.9% to 27,028.67. The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% higher, to 4,140.59.
In Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 picked up 0.3% to 9,043.50.
On Wednesday, the S&P 500 was flat after initially moving toward an
all-time high
, closing 0.34 points lower, at 6,941.47. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1% to 50,121.40. The Nasdaq composite dropped 0.2% to 23,066.47.
A U.S. Labor Department report said U.S. employers
added 130,000 jobs to their payrolls
in January, way more than economists had forecast.
The blockbuster U.S. non-farm payrolls report “strengthens the case for higher U.S. Treasury yields and a rebound in the dollar over the coming months,” Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note.
The latest job report reflects that the U.S. labor market is stabilizing, he said, so the chance of another Fed rate cut over the next few months is “quite low.”
In the U.S. stock market, Robinhood Markets, the trading and investment app, lost 8.8% as investors focused on a slowdown in crypto trading that has weighed on the company. Bitcoin’s price in recent days has fallen to roughly half of its record high set in October.
Moderna
fell 3.5%, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration refused to review its application for a new flu vaccine. Kraft Heinz was up 0.4%, as the company said it was pausing plans to split into two businesses.
Shares of companies in the raw-material and energy sectors saw some of the bigger gains. Exxon Mobil rose 2.6%, while Smurfit Westrock surged 9.9%.
In other dealings early Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 15 cents to $64.78 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 13 cents to $69.53 per barrel.
Gold and silver prices fell on Thursday. The price of gold was down 0.4% to 5,080 per ounce, and the price of silver fell 1.2% to about $83 an ounce.
The U.S. dollar fell to 152.94 Japanese yen from 153.27 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.1873.

Israel owes $9 billion in compensation for Palestinian workers
2026-02-12 08:00:08 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/news/israel-owes-9-billion-compensation-palestinian-workers

The Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions
, backed by international labour bodies, is seeking $9 billion in compensation from
Israel
for about 225,000 Palestinian workers who lost their jobs inside Israel after the genocidal war on Gaza began in October 2023. A case has been filed with the International Labour Organisation concerning the right to wages and legal entitlements under binding international agreements.
Although he is increasingly convinced that Israel will not pay up, Imran al-Saeed, a worker from Nablus in the northern occupied West Bank, agreed to have his name included on a list of tens of thousands of Palestinian workers for whom the federation, with support from international unions, is seeking financial compensation from Israeli employers.
"My losses exceed $100,000. I worked for more than two decades for a contracting company in
Israel
with a legal permit. I am entitled to end-of-service benefits and other financial rights. But after
7 October 2023
, I was not allowed to enter Israel, and my employment was terminated without the company paying any of my rights. There are tens of thousands of workers like me," al-Saeed told
Al-Araby Al-Jadeed
, the Arabic language sister publication to
The New Arab
.
Broad effort
Shaher Saad, the federation's secretary-general, told
Al-Araby Al-Jadeed
that Palestinian workers who lost their jobs in Israel are facing catastrophic conditions by all standards. Hundreds of requests for assistance have reached the federation, particularly in the absence of any support from the Palestinian government, which, he said, is unable to pay its employees' salaries.
At the same time, labour unions are unable to provide financial support to these workers, who require substantial budgets.
Saad said this prompted the move to secure workers' rights. The federation submitted a file to the
International Trade Union Confederation
containing figures and statistics on losses suffered by workers inside Israel.
There were several visits to Palestine by the international body, including the secretaries-general of seven international federations, notably those representing transport, construction and wood, public services, industry, education, journalism and agriculture. These visits included meetings with union leaders and workers and listening to dozens of testimonies from affected
workers
, in which the officials were informed that more than 200,000 workers employed inside Israel had lost their jobs and that unemployment had risen as a result of the war on Gaza.
They agreed to file a complaint with the International Labour Organisation demanding that the Israeli government compensate Palestinian workers in the Israeli labour market.
Saad said the file includes a demand for compensation for about 225,000 workers who lost at least $9 billion during the war.
"Support is essential because the Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions cannot file the case directly with the International Labour Organisation, as Palestine is not a member state," he said.
Saad said the wages of workers employed inside Israel were estimated at 1.35 billion shekels per month, a figure that exceeds the combined salaries of public and private-sector employees and has a significant impact on the local economy.
"Israel is aware of the importance of the steps taken and is seeking to thwart them.
Israeli authorities
last week prevented a delegation from the Building and Woodworkers International from entering the Palestinian territories. The delegation included nine international union leaders representing 30 million construction and woodworkers worldwide. The body has adopted the compensation case and is advancing it in international forums," he added.
'A real test'
"This case represents a real test of the effectiveness of the International Labour Organisation in protecting workers’ rights and implementing international agreements, particularly amid rising international pressure and growing support from labour unions worldwide for the cause of Palestinian workers," Saad said.
Mohammed al-Hazzam, a labour affairs specialist, told
Al-Araby Al-Jadeed
that the federation based its estimations on agreements stipulating compensation for workers, particularly an agreement with the Israeli construction workers union that
provides compensation
for workers in the construction sector if they are
forcibly prevented from working
, whether by the Israeli government or employers.
He added that Israel is a signatory to International Labour Organisation conventions and can therefore be compelled to compensate Palestinian workers.
Al-Hazzam said that any worker holding a work permit has the right to receive compensation from Israel, citing Article 26 of the International Labour Organisation's Constitution and Convention No. 95, which provides for compensation for workers prevented from working due to war or circumstances beyond their control.
The unions that filed the complaint also accuse Israel of
violating
the Protection of Wages Convention No. 95, which Israel ratified in 1959. The complaint focuses on the non-payment of wages and due benefits to tens of thousands of workers.

Instagram chief says he does not believe people can get clinically addicted to social media

2026-02-11T21:14:06Z
LOS ANGELES (AP) —
Adam Mosseri
, the head of Meta’s Instagram, testified Wednesday during a landmark social media trial in Los Angeles that he disagrees with the idea that people can be clinically addicted to social media platforms.
The question of addiction is a key pillar of the case, where plaintiffs seek to hold social media companies responsible for harms to children who use their platforms. Meta Platforms and Google’s YouTube are the two remaining defendants in the case, which
TikTok and Snap have settled.
At the core of the Los Angeles case is a 20-year-old identified only by the initials “KGM,” whose lawsuit could determine how thousands of similar lawsuits against social media companies would play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials — essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury.
Mosseri, who’s
headed Instagram since 2018
said it’s important to differentiate between clinical addiction and what he called problematic use. The plaintiff’s lawyer, however, presented quotes directly from Mosseri in a podcast interview a few years ago where he used the term addiction in relation to social media use, but he clarified that he was probably using the term “too casually,” as people tend to do.

Mosseri said he was not claiming to be a medical expert when questioned about his qualifications to comment on the legitimacy of social media addiction, but said someone “very close” to him has experienced serious clinical addiction, which is why he said he was “being careful with my words.”
He said he and his colleagues use the term “problematic use” to refer to “someone spending more time on Instagram than they feel good about, and that definitely happens.”
It’s “not good for the company, over the long run, to make decisions that profit for us but are poor for people’s well-being,” Mosseri said.
Mosseri and the plaintiff’s lawyer, Mark Lanier, engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth about cosmetic filters on Instagram that changed people’s appearance in a way that seemed to promote plastic surgery.
“We are trying to be as safe as possible but also censor as little as possible,” Mosseri said.
In the courtroom, bereaved parents of children who have had social media struggles seemed visibly upset during a discussion around body dysmorphia and cosmetic filters. Meta shut down all
third-party augmented reality filters
in January 2025. The judge made an announcement to members of the public on Wednesday after the displays of emotion, reminding them not to make any indication of agreement or disagreement with testimony, saying that it would be “improper to indicate some position.”

During cross examination, Mosseri and Meta lawyer Phyllis Jones tried to reframe the idea that Lanier was suggesting in his questioning that the company is looking to
profit off of teens
specifically.
Mosseri said Instagram makes “less money from teens than from any other demographic on the app,” noting that teens don’t tend to click on ads and many don’t have disposable income that they spend on products from ads they receive. During his opportunity to question Mosseri for a second time, Lanier was quick to point to research that shows people who join social media platforms at a young age are more likely to stay on the platforms longer, which he said makes teen users prime for meaningful long-term profit.
“Often people try to frame things as you either prioritize safety or you prioritize revenue,” Mosseri said. “It’s really hard to imagine any instance where prioritizing safety isn’t good for revenue.”
Meta CEO
Mark Zuckerberg
is expected to take the stand next week.
In recent years, Instagram has added a
slew of features
and tools it says have made the platform safer for young people. But this does not always work. A
report last year
, for instance, found that teen accounts researchers created were recommended age-inappropriate sexual content, including “graphic sexual descriptions, the use of cartoons to describe demeaning sexual acts, and brief displays of nudity.”
In addition, Instagram also recommended a “range of self-harm, self-injury, and body image content” on teen accounts that the report says “would be reasonably likely to result in adverse impacts for young people, including teenagers experiencing poor mental health, or self-harm and suicidal ideation and behaviors.” Meta called the report “misleading, dangerously speculative” and said it misrepresents its efforts on teen safety.
Meta is also facing a separate
trial in New Mexico
that began this week.

Europe warily awaits Rubio at Munich Security Conference as Trump roils transatlantic ties
2026-02-12 07:53:01 GMT

2026-02-12T05:02:22Z
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Secretary of State Marco Rubio
is leading a large U.S. delegation this week to the Munich Security Conference where increasingly nervous European leaders are hoping for at least a brief reprieve from President Donald Trump’s often inconsistent policies and threats that have
roiled transatlantic relations
and the
post-World War II international order
.
A year after Vice President JD
Vance stunned assembled dignitaries
at the same venue with a verbal assault on many of America’s closest allies in Europe, accusing them of
imperiling Western civilization
with left-leaning domestic programs and not taking responsibility for their own defense, Rubio plans to take a less contentious but philosophically similar approach when he addresses the annual gathering of world leaders and national security officials Saturday, U.S. officials say.
The State Department’s formal announcement of Rubio’s trip offered no details about his two-day stop in Munich, after which he will visit Slovakia and Hungary. But the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the trip, said America’s top diplomat intends to focus on areas of cooperation on shared global and regional concerns, including in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as China, an economic powerhouse seeking to
take advantage of the uncertainty in U.S.-European ties
.
Should that be the case, many in the audience may be relieved after being buffeted first by Vance’s blunt rebukes last year and then a series of
Trump statements and moves
in the months since that have targeted virtually every country in Europe, Canada and long-standing allies in the Indo-Pacific.
Rubio has work to do to ease European concerns
Trump’s recent comments about
taking control of Greenland
from NATO member Denmark and
insults hurled at various leaders
were particularly unnerving, leading many in Europe to
question the value of the U.S. as an ally
and partner.
That leaves Rubio with a heavy lift if he wants to calm the waters.
Vance’s speech last year was “really a shock moment,” said Claudia Major, a senior vice president at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin. “It was perceived as the first very clear statement of what the new Trump administration was about,” namely that “Europeans are not partners any longer.”
“There is a big doubt whether the basis (of trust) is still there and whether we still share the same vision for the trans-Atlantic relationship,” she said. “The longer this kind of estrangement goes, the more difficult it will be to re-find a solid relationship.”
Munich Security Conference chairman Wolfgang Ischinger offered a similar view.
“Transatlantic relations are currently in a significant crisis of confidence and credibility,” he said this week. But he also expressed hope that Rubio and the dozens of U.S. lawmakers expected to attend the meeting will offer a less dire and dour prognosis for the future.
Some leaders take a middle line on Trump and some see a break
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, whom Rubio will meet Friday, has tried to adopt a middle line to deal with Trump’s unpredictability and insistence on transactional relations.
He said Europe also needs to “learn the language of power politics” to assert itself, for example, by
taking greater responsibility for its security
, striving for greater “technological independence” and boosting its economic growth. But he stressed that “as democracies, we are partners and allies and not subordinates” of the U.S.
Some, like French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, appear to have all but given up on Trump and the United States. Both Canada and France opened consulates in the Greenlandic capital, Nuuk, last week in a
show of support for both Greenland
and Denmark.
Macron warned this week that tensions between Europe and the U.S. could intensify after the recent “Greenland moment.” He described the Trump administration as “openly anti-European” and seeking the European Union’s “dismemberment.”
“When there’s a clear act of aggression, I think what we should do isn’t bow down or try to reach a settlement,” he said in an interview with several European newspapers. “I think we’ve tried that strategy for months. It’s not working.”
Macron noted a “double crisis: We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side.”
Carney — who drew applause from many for
pushing back against Trump in a speech
last month at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland — has made no secret of his frustration and impatience with the Republican president.
Carney has emerged as a leader of a movement for countries to find ways to link up and counter the U.S. He vowed to
pursue trade deals with countries
other than the U.S., including China, to serve as anchors of commercial stability. The China deal drew
new threats from Trump
.
Greenland and Ukraine fears
For many in Europe, Trump’s intentions regarding Greenland exacerbate their fears over
Russia’s war with Ukraine
and serve as a reminder of centuries of power politics in which diplomacy was subordinate to the use of military force.
“Greenland is to Trump as, essentially, Ukraine is to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, although obviously without the devastating war at this stage,” said Fiona Hill, a Russia expert who served on the White House National Security Council during Trump’s first term in office.
In the meantime, as Trump tries to mediate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war and seek a nuclear deal with Iran, Europeans are increasingly uneasy about
Trump’s “Board of Peace,”
a 27-member group of world leaders tasked first with handling the Gaza peace agreement but eventually envisaged as a vehicle for
resolving other major conflicts
.
Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Norway and Sweden, among others, have either declined to accept or have not yet signed on to the board, which will
hold its first meeting
to raise money for Gaza in Washington on Feb. 19.

EU leaders meet to counter pressure from Russia, China and Trump

2026-02-12T05:05:06Z
BILZEN-HOESELT, Belgium (AP) — Leaders from across the European Union are meeting Thursday in a Belgian castle as the 27-nation bloc faces
antagonism from U.S. President Donald Trump
, strong-arm economic tactics from
China
and
hybrid threats
from Russia — challenges that have prompted a rethink of Europe’s approach to diplomacy and trade.
“We all know we must change course, and we all know the direction,” Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever told a meeting with some European leaders on Wednesday. “Yet it sometimes feels like we’re standing on the bridge of the ship staring at the horizon without being able to touch the helm.”
But there are competing visions of how the EU must change. Thursday’s meeting is to shape proposals for another summit in late March.
As leaders are set to walk across a drawbridge to the 16th-century Alden Biesen castle, the fault lines in the battle for Europe’s future are becoming clear.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni lead a wing of the bloc calling for deregulation, rebooting
Europe’s relationship with Washington
and forging trade deals like the recent
one struck with the Mercosur nations
of South America.
“We must deregulate every sector,” Merz said Wednesday.
But they are at odds with France.
One key issue is how much of the EU’s defense spending should be restricted to buying from EU arms companies. French President Emmanuel Macron argues that EU companies should get priority, while Merz and Meloni say purchases should be from both foreign and European firms.
Macron has urged the EU to protect its industries overall via applying “European preference” in key sectors like cleantech, chemicals, steel, the car industry and defense.
“We need to protect our industry. The Chinese do it, the Americans do it too,” Macron said in an interview with several newspapers including Le Monde and The Financial Times published Tuesday.
Without some European preference on strategic sectors, “Europeans will be swept aside. This is defensive, but it is essential, because we are facing unfair competitors who no longer respect the rules of the World Trade Organization,” Macron said.
EU leaders will also debate new financial instruments to protect the bloc in a global trading system rocked by Trump’s blitzkrieg of tariffs and
China’s restricting
of critical mineral exports.
Macron is renewing his call for the EU to be able to borrow money, which he described as “Eurobonds for the future” that would provide an opportunity “to challenge the hegemony of the dollar.”
Merz and Meloni are avoiding
the economic revitalization and modernization strategy
called for by Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank: deregulation,
diversification of trade ties
, deep investment in infrastructure, and regulatory integration and simplification across the bloc.
On Thursday, Germany and Italy will call on leaders to act by cutting EU red tape, strengthening the single market and “ensuring an ambitious trade policy based on shared rules and a level playing field.”
That echoes the economic security focus of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who like Merz is a leading figure in the European People’s Party, which is the largest bloc in the European Parliament and claims 13 heads of EU states as members.
In speeches on Wednesday in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, and at the European Industry Summit in Antwerp, Belgium, von der Leyen said economic strength underlies everything else.
“Our power on the global stage depends greatly on our strength on the economic front,” she said.
Citizens across the bloc are hungry for a stronger EU and a
more unified, stronger and ambitious leadership
amid military threats, economic pressures and climate instability, according to an official EU poll, Eurobarometer.
“There has never been a better time for European leaders, national political leaders, to actually leverage on these European citizens’ demand for greater European action,” said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at the HEC Paris business school.

House votes to slap back Trump’s tariffs on Canada in rare bipartisan rebuke

2026-02-11T22:32:17Z
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House voted Wednesday to slap back
President Donald Trump’s
tariffs on Canada, a rare if largely symbolic rebuke of the
White House agenda
as Republicans joined Democrats over the objections of GOP leadership.
The tally, 219-211, was among the first times the House, controlled by Republicans, has confronted the president over a signature policy, and drew instant recrimination from Trump himself. The resolution seeks to end the national emergency Trump declared to impose the tariffs, though actually undoing the policy would require support from the president, which is highly unlikely. It next goes to the Senate.
Trump believes in the power of tariffs to force
U.S. trade partners
to the negotiating table. But lawmakers are facing unrest back home from businesses caught in the trade wars and constituents navigating pocketbook issues and high prices.
“Today’s vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person -- Donald J. Trump?” said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who authored the resolution.
Within minutes, as the gavel struck, Trump fired off a stern warning to those in the Republican Party who would dare to cross him.
“Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” the president posted on social media.
The high-stakes moment provides a snapshot of the House’s unease with the president’s direction, especially ahead of the midterm elections as
economic issues resonate
among voters. The Senate has already
voted to reject Trump’s tariffs on Canada
and other countries in a show of displeasure. But both chambers would have to approve the tariff rollbacks, and send the resolution to Trump for the president’s signature — or veto.
Six House Republicans voted for the resolution, and one Democrat voted against it.
From Canada, Ontario, Premier Doug Ford on social media called the vote “an important victory with more work ahead.” He thanked lawmakers from both parties “who stood up in support of free trade and economic growth between our two great countries. Let’s end the tariffs and together build a more prosperous and secure future.”
Trump recently threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada over that country’s proposed
China trade deal
, intensifying a feud with the longtime U.S. ally and
Prime Minister Mark Carney
.
GOP defections forced the vote
House Speaker Mike Johnson
tried to prevent this showdown.
Johnson insisted lawmakers wait for a pending
Supreme Court ruling
in a lawsuit about the tariffs. He engineered a complicated rules change to prevent floor action. But Johnson’s strategy collapsed late Tuesday, as Republicans peeled off during a procedural vote to ensure the Democratic measure was able to advance.
“The president’s trade policies have been of great benefit,” Johnson, R-La., had said. “And I think the sentiment is that we allow a little more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch.”
Late Tuesday evening, Johnson could be seen speaking to holdout Republican lawmakers as the GOP leadership team struggled to shore up support during a lengthy procedural vote, but the numbers lined up against him.
“We’re disappointed,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday morning. “The president will make sure they don’t repeal his tariffs.”
Terminating Trump’s emergency
The resolution put forward by Meeks would terminate the national emergency that Trump declared a year ago as one of
his executive orders
.
The administration claimed illicit drug flow from Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat that allows the president to slap tariffs on imported goods outside the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.
The Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, said the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. is a dire national emergency and the policy must be left in place.
“Let’s be clear again about what this resolution is and what it’s not. It’s not a debate about tariffs. You can talk about those, but that’s not really what it is,” Mast said. “This is Democrats trying to ignore that there is a fentanyl crisis.”
Experts say fentanyl produced by cartels in Mexico is
largely smuggled into the U.S.
from land crossings in California and Arizona. Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the U.S., but to a much lesser extent.
Torn between Trump and tariffs
Ahead of voting, some rank-and-file Republican lawmakers expressed unease over the choices ahead as Democrats — and a few renegade Republicans — impressed on their colleagues the need to flex their power as the legislative branch rather than ceding so much power to the president to take authority over trade and tariff policy.
Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said he was unpersuaded by Johnson’s call to wait until the Supreme Court makes its decision about the legality of Trump’s tariffs. He voted for passage.
“Why doesn’t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we’re an independent branch?” Bacon said. “We should defend our authorities. I hope the Supreme Court does, but if we don’t do it, shame on us.”
Bacon, who is retiring rather than facing reelection, also argued that tariffs are bad economic policy.
Other Republicans had to swiftly make up their minds after Johnson’s gambit — which would have paused the calendar days to prevent the measure from coming forward — was turned back.
“At the end of the day, we’re going to have to support our president,” said Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas.
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said he doesn’t want to tie the president’s hands on trade and would support the tariffs on Canada “at this time.”

Taiwan’s AI-powered economy soars in the shadow of bubble fears and China threats
2026-02-12 07:53:01 GMT

2026-02-12T05:00:00Z
TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) — In Taipei, real estate agent Jason Sung is betting that home prices around a high-tech industrial park in the northern part of Taiwan’s capital will soon take flight – because of computer chip maker Nvidia.
The area is where Nvidia plans to build its new
Taiwan
headquarters as it rapidly expands on the island, set to surpass Apple to become the biggest customer of Taiwan semiconductor maker TSMC, the biggest contract manufacturer of the advanced chips needed for artificial intelligence.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang describes Taiwan as the “center of the world’s computer ecosystem.” It’s riding high on the global AI frenzy. Its economy grew at an
8.6% annual pace
last year, and it’s hoping to maintain that momentum after it recently sealed a
trade deal
with U.S. President Donald Trump that cut U.S. tariffs on Taiwan to 15% from 20%.
“We have been lucky,” said Wu Tsong-min, an emeritus economics professor at National Taiwan University and a former board member of Taiwan’s central bank.
But Taiwan’s heavy reliance on computer chip makers and other technology companies carries the growing risk of the AI craze turning out to be a bubble.
“What if the AI bubble is real, and what if its rapid growth pace slows, what’s next for Taiwan? That’s the question many have been asking,” Wu said.
Escalating tensions
with Beijing, which claims independently governed Taiwan as mainland China’s territory, are another abiding threat, despite the island’s vital role in global chip and AI supply chains.
Taiwan’s leads in chipmaking
An island of about 23 million people, Taiwan depends heavily on exports. They jumped nearly 35% year-on-year in 2025, as shipments to the U.S. surged 78% due to ballooning AI demand.
That’s thanks largely to
TSMC
, or Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., and electronics giant Foxconn, which makes AI servers for Nvidia and is a major supplier to Apple.
Taiwan has undergone massive economic changes while shifting from mainly labor-intensive industries such as plastics and textiles to advanced manufacturing like semiconductor fabrication.
The AI frenzy has made TSMC one of the world’s top 10 most valuable companies. Its profit jumped 46% last year to $1.7 trillion Taiwan dollars ($54 billion).
The chipmaker is investing heavily both in Taiwan and in
new factories in Arizona
in the U.S. It produces more than 90% of the world’s most advanced chips.
Foxconn
, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., has doubled its value since 2023. The maker of Apple’s iPhone and iPads now produces AI servers and racks and has a
partnership with OpenAI
to supply AI data center equipment.
Taiwan’s heavy reliance on its technology industry means its biggest risk is that growth will be “very highly contingent on the AI boom and tech race continuing,” said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank.
Risks persist of an AI bubble?
Worries that the AI craze may prove to be a
bubble
prone to a bust similar to the dot.com crash in 2000 that swept through markets, alarming many in Taiwan.
“I’m also very nervous about it,” C.C. Wei, TSMC’s chairman said when asked about a potential AI bubble during an earnings call in January. “Because we have to invest about $52-$56 billion (this year).”
“If we did not do it carefully, that will be a big disaster to TSMC for sure,” he said. “I want to make sure that my customers’ demands are real.”
In a recent report, analysts from Fitch Ratings argued that AI demand will remain strong at least in the near term. In the longer term, however, the risks “will depend on the evolution of AI, as well as trade and investment policies and the adaptability of Taiwanese firms,” they wrote.
Taiwanese electronics company Asia Vital Components, a key supplier of liquid cooling systems for Nvidia, is investing heavily in research and development. Its chairman, Spencer Shen, said he saw no signs of a slowdown in AI-related demand so far. The company is already designing thermal solutions for 2028 AI servers, he said.
“We do not believe this is a bubble,” Shen told The Associated Press in an interview. “AI is driven by companies with real products and massive cash flows, like Amazon,
Microsoft
, Google and Meta.”
“In fact, AI infrastructure is still in short supply,” Shen added. “I expect AI to trickle through to our everyday level and change the way that things will work fundamentally.”
Taiwan has a ‘silicon shield’ against Beijing
Some in Taiwan believe that its pivotal role in the technology sector, especially as a maker of computer chips whose main material is silicon, helps to protect the island from attack by
communist-ruled
Beijing, whose leaders have vowed to reunite the island with the Chinese mainland, by force if necessary.
The two governments split in 1949 during a civil war. Beijing has been stepping up
pressure,
conducting military drills nearby. Exercises in late December included
live rounds landing closer
to the island than before, Taiwan officials said.
Such geopolitical factors cloud the economic outlook, though many in Taiwan including its former President Tsai Ing-wen believe its importance to global chipmaking would deter China from attacking.
The risk of an invasion is unclear. Both global tech companies and Chinese industries would suffer from massive disruptions of the chip supply chain, said Wu of National Taiwan University.
Still, some companies have been identifying contingency scenarios in recent years on how to respond in case of military action by China, said Chen Shin-horng, vice president of the semi-official Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.
“We need to understand the potential risk, potential damages to Taiwan,” said Chen.
While many of its core research and development activities are in Taiwan, TSMC already has plants in China, Japan and the U.S., and it’s expanding its offshore production in the U.S., Germany and Japan.
Roughly 65% of Foxconn’s manufacturing is in China, and the company has factories in other parts of the world such as India, Mexico and the U.S. AVC has been expanding its production capacity in Vietnam.
While some have called for Taiwan to diversify its
economy
away from technology to reduce risks, others argue that doubling down on its world-leading technology is the way forward. “It is our greatest strength,” said Shen of AVC.
Some in Taiwan are being left behind
The AI boom has done wonders for Taiwan’s stock exchange, where the benchmark Taiex has climbed nearly 250% over the past decade, making many investors rich. Economists have significantly upgraded forecasts for Taiwan’s economic growth for 2026 based on its robust AI-related exports.
But as is true elsewhere, the wealth is not evenly spread. Many Taiwan residents feel they have been left behind.
Taiwan’s wealth gap, according to official data, has roughly quadrupled over the past three decades.
The pay of tech workers already earning high wages, especially chip engineers and managers, has skyrocketed. For other traditional industries, such as plastics and machine toolmakers, growth has lagged.
Economists say that gap might widen as the
AI frenzy
continues.
“It can be tough to make a living,” said Jean Lin, a 30-something manager of a takeaway outlet selling bento meals in a Taipei neighborhood where Foxconn’s office is located.
“Many of the younger generation still can’t afford to buy an apartment,” Lin, who wishes to start her own business one day, added. “A lot of young people still feel they don’t have much money.”

How Ayat and Al Badawi built a Palestinian community in NYC
2026-02-12 07:00:16 GMT
https://www.newarab.com/features/how-ayat-and-al-badawi-built-palestinian-community-nyc

Bethlehem-inspired murals line the walls, mana'eesh sizzle on a saj in the open kitchen, and bottles of olive oil sit stacked in tribute to the Levant's olive groves. At
Ayat
and
Al Badawi
, two of New York's most popular Palestinian restaurants, food is inseparable from identity.
Step inside and the message is immediately clear: this is Palestinian space. Through their decor, menus and open kitchens, the praised Palestinian chains embrace heritage and political presence despite hostility, vandalism and hate-filled reviews.
"Our food carries history, heritage, and love," Abdul Elenani, CEO and founder of both establishments, told
The New Arab.
"It tells the story of a people whose culture has endured."
The upcoming Upper West Side location of Ayat will bring dishes like mansaf and shawarma just blocks from Columbia University, the epicentre of the 2024 pro-Palestine campus protests.
The expansion follows Al Badawi's Upper East Side opening two years ago, which brought Palestinian cuisine to one of Manhattan's most affluent neighbourhoods, possibly for the first time.
Ayat – Hind's Hall
Demonstrating his commitment to cultural and social awareness, Abdul
announced on Instagram
that the Upper West Side location of Ayat will be renamed Ayat – Hind's Hall, in tribute to five-year-old
Hind Rajab
, who was killed by Israeli forces in 2024.
Hind's final moments were captured in a phone call with the Palestinian Red Crescent that went viral, sparking global outcry and inspiring the Oscar-nominated film
The Voice of Hind Rajab.
"We cannot bring her back, but we can refuse to let her be forgotten," Abdul said, adding that carrying her name on the storefront is "the least we can do" to remind people that every child matters.
In his social media post, Abdul explained that Ayat – Hind's Hall "stands just steps from Columbia University, where students renamed Hamilton Hall to Hind's Hall in solidarity with Gaza. We choose to honour their gesture and carry that name forward."
Such a public display of support for pro-Palestinian student activists is uncommon in a neighbourhood where pro-Israeli counterprotests and attacks against Arab and Muslim students occurred regularly after 7 October 2023.
From kitchen to community
At the heart of Abdul's approach is human connection.
"We never wanted to be just a restaurant. We wanted to be a place of community, solidarity, and care," Abdul explained. To him, sharing his culture with others and fostering a sense of belonging are major parts of the job.
That philosophy is clear in the design and story of the restaurants. "Open kitchens and shared plates were intentional choices to create warmth and connection. The story has always been about welcome, beauty, and presence, a space that feels grounded, alive, and deeply human," he added.
As a result, his restaurants have often become sites of community events and free public dinners. Among them are celebrations of faith, Jewish and Muslim alike.
At an iftar dinner at Ayat Bay Ridge last year, Abdul said about 2,000 people attended.
"We cooked everything we had," he
revealed
. "This iftar was for all: Muslims, Christians, Jews, Hindus, atheists, everyone. No questions, just kindness."
In 2024, he also
hosted
a Shabbat dinner at Ayat Ditmas Park, where over 1,300 people attended, at a time when he was receiving death threats and hateful comments online for his restaurants' open support of the Palestinian cause.
He continued hosting community dinners even after his restaurants were vandalised.
"We have experienced hostility and racism, and unfortunately, that still happens, but we have also received overwhelming support. That contrast shows us how deeply this work matters," Abdul said.
Abdul also shared that last year, he cancelled his family Thanksgiving to host a free dinner for anyone who had nowhere to go. "No one is eating alone this Thanksgiving," he wrote in an
Instagram post
, "I will host anyone and everyone that will be spending it alone with some delicious Palestinian food."
The restaurateur also hosted fundraiser dinners for Gaza with Palestinian photographer and influencer
Motaz Azaiza
, including a farewell dinner at Ayat Astoria in 2024 that raised money to send food into the Gaza Strip.
Separately, Abdul offered free meals to members of
Zohran Mamdani
's mayoral campaign.
"Our commitment to people, to showing up with love and generosity, will always be stronger than hate," he stated.
Flavours of the Levant
Abdul's values are embedded in the restaurant concepts, with Al Badawi calling itself, "The first family-style Palestinian restaurant in NYC."
Ayat's family platters are similarly designed for four or more people, staying true to the Levant's family dining format.
Traditional Palestinian and Jordanian platters like musakhan, mansaf, and maklouba may be hard to find elsewhere in the city.
Meanwhile, menu items like pizzawarma and shatta-fired wings are entirely new creations.
"Food has always been our way of telling a story," Abdul added.
Specialised options like the flatbreads, known in the region as mana'eesh, come in traditional zaatar and cheese as well as experimental offerings such as shrimp, chicken, and pistachio.
The mixed grill and appetiser listings are favourites, with the mezze filistini providing a harmonious blend of starters: hummus, baba ghanoush, muhammarah, tabbouleh, salata bi tahina, and labneh.
Arabic pitta bread for dipping, served in a side basket, stays warm beneath a cloth, with more always at the ready.
Fusion desserts like baklava sundae and Dubai chocolate cheesecake top off the experience, leaving guests both satiated and inspired.
Palestine to the world
"Manhattan is a global stage, and being here allows Palestinian cuisine and identity to reach people far beyond our original community," Abdul told
The New Arab.
"It reflects our desire to share this food and culture with everyone, while staying rooted in the values that shaped us from the beginning."
The Arab-American restaurateur and his Palestinian-American wife, Ayat Masoud, have changed the food landscape in Manhattan by bringing Palestinian food to notorious and elite neighbourhoods.
In expanding to the Upper East and Upper West Sides, hospitality, community, and Palestinian values will remain Abdul's top priorities.
"I want guests to leave having experienced more than a meal," Abdul shared.
"I want them to understand that Palestinians have a rich, living identity, and that our approach comes from peace, warmth, and generosity."

Why philanthropy should be managed like an exit
2026-02-12 06:25:06 GMT
https://www.israelhayom.com/2026/02/12/why-philanthropy-should-be-managed-like-an-exit/

The resurgence of high-tech exits in Israel has rightfully brought the question of taxation back to center stage. In recent years, more companies have chosen to incorporate in the United States, driven by regulatory and tax considerations. When significant wealth is generated, the state is expected to benefit from its share of funding for security, education, health, and infrastructure. This is a fundamental principle of the social contract. Yet precisely at this juncture, a conceptual error often occurs, blurring the essential distinction among the tools of civic responsibility.
The argument that "it is better to simply pay taxes" is often presented as a definitive moral stance, or conversely, as an assumption that renders any discussion on philanthropy redundant. Simultaneously, there is a perception that a tax-deductible donation makes the state a partner in decision-making, thereby requiring an alignment between public priorities and the donor's will. Both assumptions miss the point. They treat taxes and philanthropy as if they were the same mechanism, whereas, in reality, they are entirely different tools with distinct purposes, paces, and capabilities.
Taxation is a broad, uniform, and central instrument. It is designed to ensure formal equality, functional continuity, and the funding of massive national systems. Its advantage lies in its ability to generate stability; yet, for this very reason, it struggles to react swiftly to changing situations, identify hyper-local needs, or accompany complex, long-term social processes. This is not a systemic failure but rather a structure designed for stability rather than innovation.
Philanthropy, on the other hand, is not a substitute for the state but a complementary mechanism. Its advantage lies not in the scale of its resources but in flexibility, focus, and a willingness to take calculated risks. It enables the development of solutions to problems not yet ripe for public policy, the testing of new models, and the support of processes that do not align with annual budget cycles. Mental rehabilitation, community building, restoring trust, and closing gaps are not "projects" with a clear end date; they are human processes that require persistence, listening, and continuous learning.
The events of October 7 illustrated this sharply. Within days, a massive wave of giving emerged- fast, generous, and at times, chaotic. The urge to help was immediate and understandable, but reality proved that in moments of emergency, a distinction is required: between an initial reaction and the construction of a sustained response. At Keshet, we observed firsthand how donations made in response to urgency later required replanning, adaptation to changing needs, and the realization that community rehabilitation, trauma treatment, and strengthening civil resilience do not end when the headlines fade. The ability to hold resources over time, to separate the moment of decision from the moment of execution, and to act from a systemic rather than a reactive perspective, is what distinguishes good giving from stable impact.
Here, one of the central challenges of our time becomes clear: Wealth is created in a moment, but social impact is built over time. An exit is a point-in-time event; social resilience is a cumulative process. Unplanned giving may produce immediate relief, but it does not always allow organizations to go deep, examine the effectiveness of their actions, or build a stable infrastructure for the long term. True responsibility is measured not only by the amount on the check but by the ability to accompany a process even when results are not immediate.
Therefore, modern philanthropy is not a question of generosity, but of management. Just as business capital is managed carefully, separating decision-making from implementation, social capital requires planning, timing, and discretion. The ability to separate the timing of donations from the distribution of grants is not merely a financial technique; it is a mindset that acknowledges that social needs change and that deep impact is built in stages, not in one-off gestures.
At a time when Israel is facing continuous rehabilitation and budgetary uncertainty, this distinction becomes critical. The question is not who is more responsible, the state or civil society, but how each tool operates in its proper place. When taxes fund systems and philanthropy strengthens processes, when the state ensures continuity, and giving allows for depth, economic success ceases to be just a number in a report and becomes a wisely managed social resource.
Smart philanthropy is not just distribution, but the creation of infrastructure and lasting impact. It requires distinction, planning, and institutional maturity, just as wealth management requires wisdom and responsibility.
