- The US Justice Department sued Harvard for student admissions data, investigating potential racial discrimination against white applicants, despite not directly accusing Harvard.
- Donald Trump demanded US$1 billion from Harvard for inadequate protection of Jewish students during protests, leading the Pentagon to cut academic ties.
- These actions are part of the Trump administration's long-running battle with Harvard, including past attempts to cut US$2.6 billion in federal funding.

WASHINGTON -The US Justice Department sued Harvard on Feb 13 demanding its student admissions data, in the Trump administration’s latest salvo in its long-running battle with the elite university.
“Harvard has failed to disclose the data we need to ensure that its admissions are free of discrimination,” Attorney-General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
In a 2023 ruling, the Supreme Court barred consideration of race in college admissions and Mr Trump’s Justice Department is investigating whether any US schools are discriminating against white applicants.
The Justice Department said the lawsuit “seeks only to compel Harvard to produce documents related to any consideration of race in admissions and does not accuse Harvard of racial discrimination.”
“If Harvard has stopped discriminating, it should happily share the data necessary to prove it,” Assistant Attorney-General Harmeet Dhillon said.
US President Donald Trump recently demanded that Harvard pay US$1 billion (S$1.26 billion) in damages
“We are now seeking One Billion Dollars in damages, and want nothing further to do, into the future, with Harvard University,” Mr Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Just days later, the Pentagon cut all academic ties with Harvard.
Mr Trump has previously sought to cut more than US$2.6 billion of federal funding to Harvard, and has moved to block entry of international students – a quarter of its student body.
Those moves have largely been temporarily blocked by the courts.

Former NYPD official charged with taking bribes from company selling 'panic button' to city schools
A former NYPD school safety commander has been charged with taking bribes to push a panic alert system into city schools

A former high-ranking official in the New York Police Department has been charged with accepting $35,000 in cash, luxury travel perks and other bribes from a Florida businessman seeking to sell panic buttons to the city’s public schools and police.
In an indictment Thursday, federal prosecutors said Kevin Taylor attempted to steer an $11 million contract toward the company, SaferWatch, while serving as the commanding officer of the NYPD’s School Safety Division. The company markets its product as a “mobile panic alert system” used for mass shootings and other emergencies.
In exchange, the company’s founder, Gene Roefaro, showered Taylor and his romantic partner with gifts — including luxury hotels and airfare to the Bahamas and Las Vegas, helicopter tours, tickets to Broadway musicals and a “medieval-themed dinner theater” — along with multiple cash payments, prosecutors said.
Taylor pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges on Thursday. An emailed inquiry to his attorney was not returned.
Roefaro is also facing charges, including bribery and wire fraud. He has not yet entered a plea. An attorney for Roefaro said it was “puzzling and deeply concerning that the United States Attorney’s Office has chosen to pursue charges against Geno, while at the very same time, alleging — and seeking to prove — that he was the victim of an extortionate shakedown."
The charges are the latest allegations of corruption and favor-trading lodged against officials appointed by the city’s former mayor, Eric Adams, who faced his own indictment in a separate bribery scheme that also involved luxury travel gifts.
While the case against Adams was later abandoned by the Trump administration, at least some of the probes into his inner circle remain active, including an ongoing bribery case involving his former chief advisor. In recent weeks, federal prosecutors have announced bribery charges against two other NYPD officers and a former housing official under Adams.
The investigation into SaferWatch first emerged in September 2024 as part of a sprawling federal probe into the Adams administration. The company was one of several to hire a consulting firm run by the brother of two top Adams officials, both of whom resigned after their homes were searched by federal authorities.
Federal prosecutors allege that in 2023 Taylor helped secured a no-bid contract to pilot Roefaro’s products within the command center of the NYPD’s school safety division. But as the police official struggled to expand the program, Roefaro grew frustrated, at times describing himself as a “sugar daddy” who had “made a MAJOR investment and zero return,” according to the indictment.
“It’s been fun, but it’s not fun or funny anymore,” Roefaro allegedly texted Taylor in late 2023. “Our company (ME) needs to report something real and significant that is in place prior to end of year.”
Days later, Taylor tried to put together a press conference to announce his division would be procuring a tip line from Roefaro's company, prosecutors said. But that event was later cancelled.
During roughly the same time, Taylor was also attempting to solicit $75,000 in bribes from two businessmen involved in a company that sold bullet-resistant vests to police, according to the indictment. Both men declined his solicitations, prosecutors said.

‘Dangerous’ sexual predator who manipulated women to abuse children jailed
Elliot Jones faced 17 charges of sexual offences against children, three counts of making indecent photographs of children and a charge of blackmail
- Bookmark
A "dangerous sexual predator" who "coerced, pressured and manipulated" three women into sending him child abuse videos has been jailed for 26 years.
Elliot Jones, 49, of Necton, Norfolk, was sentenced at Winchester Crown Court.
He faced 17 charges of sexual offences against children, three counts of making indecent photographs of children, and a blackmail charge.
Jones, who also abused some of the victims, will serve an eight-year extended licence period after his prison term.
Sarah Johnson, 57, of Andover, Hampshire, was sentenced to 11 years in prison with an extended licence period of one year for 12 charges of sexual offences against children, three of taking indecent photographs of children and three of distributing indecent photographs.
Heidi Ludbrook, 45, of King’s Lynn, Norfolk, was jailed for seven years for two counts of conspiracy to cause a child to engage in sexual activity, two counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity, three counts of taking indecent photos of children and three of distributing indecent images of children.
Catarina Araujo, 46, of Dereham, Norfolk, was sentenced to 12 months in prison suspended for a year for one count of taking indecent photographs of children and one count of distributing indecent photographs of children.
Barry McElduff KC, prosecuting, said that the abuse first came to light after one of the victims revealed sexual assaults they had suffered from Johnson.
He said that Jones then blackmailed Johnson into continuing the abuse, which involved her performing sex acts on herself and on the young victims which included the use of sex toys.
He said that the victims described being in “obvious pain and distress”, with one saying that the abuse, which happened on a “weekly basis for six to 12 months”, had “broken” them.
Mr McElduff said that Jones also contacted other women through dating apps in a bid to target more children during a six-year period.
The court heard that the eight victims included both boys and girls.
He said: “He had been in contact with many other women in which a clear strategy is evident.
“He would befriend a woman online, start speaking with them, push effectively at boundaries, talk in a sexual way, share sexual images and chats and move on eventually to the topic of abuse of children to see how far it would go.
“Heidi Ludbrook and Catarina Araujo were two women who had engaged in conversation with Mr Jones to varying degrees, he was provided with material.”
Judge Adam Feest KC said that Jones had “coerced, pressured and manipulated” the other defendants into taking part in the abuse, which had caused the victims “severe psychological harm”, with one saying they had considered suicide.
He told Jones: “You deliberately and effectively manipulated and coerced your co-defendants.
“Your targeted, repeated and sustained actions have been a corrupting and destructive influence on your victims and co-defendants alike.”
He added: “I am quite satisfied the risk you pose to others, particularly children, is of the highest order. I am also quite satisfied this risk is unlikely to diminish over time.”
Bartholomew O’Toole, defending Jones, said: “He does fully acknowledge the seriousness of these matters and he very much regrets everything he has done.
“He regrets the hurt and the damage he has caused.”
Adrienne Knight, representing Johnson, said that her client suffered from “underlying mental health difficulties” including ADHD, borderline personality disorder, autism, depression and anxiety which she said made her “more vulnerable and susceptible than others”.
Ms Knight said that Johnson was “manipulated” by Jones and added: “She was almost hypnotised, he was able to control and coerce her into things she would never have done, she is overwhelmed with remorse.”
Helen Easterbrook, representing Ludbrook, said that her client was “incredibly sorry” for her actions and added: “There was a lot of clever manipulation in this, but for Mr Jones this would never have happened. She allowed herself to fall under that pressure.”
John Montague, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “Elliot Jones is a dangerous sexual predator who tactically befriended women online to engage in discussions about child abuse for his own sexual gratification.
“His horrifying and persistent offending, enabled by the women he met online, resulted in profound and lasting harm to numerous children over many years.”

Time for Europe to become geopolitical power, France's Macron says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH, Feb 13 - Europe must turn its focus to long-term strategic thinking, including creating deep-strike capabilities and assessing how France's nuclear deterrent can fit into the bloc's future security architecture, France's president said on Friday.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, President Emmanuel Macron dismissed accusations that Europe was decaying and defended its push to tackle disinformation and the excesses of social media that were harming Western democracies.
"This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe," Macron said. "Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power. It was not part of our DNA."
Macron, who is set to enter his final year in office, said Europe would still face an aggressive Russia even if there were a deal on the Ukraine war and that it could not cave into Russian demands or allow a short-term accord that would not resolve core issues.
"The Europeans must start this work with their own thinking and their own interests. So my proposal today is to launch a series of consultations on this important issue, which we have started to flesh out with our British and German colleagues, but in the broader European consultation with all the colleagues here, with a lot of capacities, a lot of strategic thinking," Macron said.
Macron, who is scheduled to deliver a speech later this month on how he sees the role of France's nuclear deterrent within Europe, said he had started those consultations.
"We have to reshuffle and reorganise our architecture of security in Europe. Because the past architecture of security was totally designed and framed during Cold War times. So it's no longer adapted," he said.
"We have to rearticulate nuclear deterrence in this approach. And this is why we are conceiving, and in a few weeks' time I will detail that, but we engaged a strategic dialogue, obviously with Chancellor (Angela) Merkel, but with a few European leaders, in order to see how we can articulate our national doctrine, which is guaranteed and controlled by the Constitution," he said.

France's President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, February 13, defended Europe as an example to follow, as the continent seeks to rebuild strained ties with the United States. "Everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticizing us," he said at the Munich Security Conference, after US Vice President JD Vance used his address at the annual gathering last year to attack European policies on immigration and free speech.
Macron said there had been a tendency "to overlook Europe, and sometimes, to criticize it outright," to vilify it "as an aging, slow, fragmented construct," as "a society prey to barbaric migrations," and even "as a repressive continent where speech would not be free." But "Europe is a radically original political construction of free sovereign states" that gave up centuries of rivalry and war "to institutionalize peace through economic interdependence," he said. Now, "Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power," he added.
Macron said France supported US President Donald Trump's "drive toward a negotiated peace" to end Russia's war in Ukraine that started in February 2022. But if a settlement is reached to end Europe's worst conflict since World War II, the continent would need to "define rules of coexistence that limit the risk of escalation," Macron warned.
"We should articulate among Europeans our real long-term security interests in our region, and give ourselves the metal and the clout to prosecute them, and at the same time fortify ourselves as confident democracies," the French president said. "This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America," he added. "Because it will be a partner taking its fair share of the burden. It will be a partner being respected."
Macron last month said France preferred "respect to bullies" after Trump's vow to impose levies on countries opposing his threat to seize Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. The US leader has since backed down and started talks with Denmark.

Trump says Nancy Guthrie sheriff ‘didn’t want to let go’ of case delaying FBI action
Trump’s remarks came amid growing scrutiny of the Pima County Sheriff’s Department
- Bookmark
President Trump said Friday that the investigation into the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie was slowed because the local sheriff’s department “didn’t want to let go” of the case – but that “progress has been made” now that the FBI is involved.
“Well, they took it over originally, that was a local case originally,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
“They didn’t want to let go of it, which is fine; it’s up to them. It’s really up to the community. But ultimately, when the FBI got involved, I think, you know, progress has been made.” “Complicated,” he added.
When asked by reporters if he believes Mexican cartels or a foreign country is involved in Guthrie’s disappearance, he said: “You can’t say that yet; it’s a little bit early, but it’s, uh, somebody either knew what they were doing very well or they were rank amateurs. Either way, it’s not a good situation.”
Trump’s remarks came amid growing scrutiny of the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, after reports suggested federal investigators were delayed in gaining access to key evidence in the high-profile case involving the mother of Today co-host Savannah Guthrie. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos denied these allegations.
A law enforcement official told Reuters that the FBI requested a glove and DNA collected from Guthrie’s to be processed at the bureau’s national crime lab in Quantico, Virginia.
However, Nanos has instead insisted on using a private Florida lab, effectively denying the FBI access to crucial evidence, the official said.
The sheriff has primary jurisdiction over the case and FBI assistance must be officially requested by the county, otherwise the FBI is legally precluded from taking part in the investigation. The official said that the county has spent some $200,000 so far to send evidence in the Guthrie case to the Florida lab.
“It risks further slowing a case that grows more urgent by the minute,” the official argued, citing unspecified “earlier setbacks” in the investigation.
The official also criticized the sheriff for not seeking FBI assistance in the investigation sooner.
“It’s clear the fastest path to answers is leveraging federal resources and technology. Anything less only prolongs the Guthrie family’s grief and the community’s wait for justice,” the official said.
In an interview with KVOA, Nanos pushed back and said the FBI agreed with his decision to send newly discovered evidence to a lab that has worked with his office for years.
He called the claims “not even close to the truth” and said he discussed the matter directly with the FBI.
Signs of friction between the FBI and sheriff’s department emerged as the search for Guthrie stretched into its 12th day, as investigators intensified their search for clues in the presumed kidnapping for ransom
Earlier this week, the case saw its biggest break with the release of newly recovered surveillance footage showing a masked individual on Nancy Guthrie’s porch the night she disappeared.
The FBI said the newly released images were recovered from residual backend data from the doorbell camera after days of searching for footage that may have been lost or corrupted.
The video shows a person wearing a backpack and gloves approaching the front door and attempting to cover a security camera with plants. The individual appeared to be armed with a holster at their waist.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president reacted with “pure disgust” after reviewing the video.
“I was once again with the president. He and I were both reviewing the newly released surveillance footage from FBI in the Savannah Guthrie case on just this heartbreaking situation with respect to her mother,” Leavitt told reporters. “His initial reaction, of course, is of pure disgust,” she added.
Leavitt urged the public to contact the FBI with any information.
“The president encourages any American across the country with any knowledge of this suspect to please call the FBI, who continue to assist state and local authorities, who are leading this investigation on the ground,” she said on Tuesday.
Guthrie’s family continues to publicly plead for her safe return.

Ex-Met Officer filmed making rape jokes committed gross misconduct
Brian Sharkey was secretly filmed joking about rape, with the footage then being aired in a BBC Panorama documentary in October
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A former Metropolitan Police officer who was secretly filmed joking about rape and sexual assault has been found to have committed gross misconduct by a tribunal panel.
Ex-police constable Brian Sharkey, who retired in May 2025, made a series of comments in undercover footage which aired in a BBC Panorama documentary in October belittling claims of racial bias and talking about disposing of evidence, his misconduct hearing in south London was told.
Finding his behaviour breached professional standards and amounted to gross misconduct, panel chairman Commander Stephen Clayman said of Mr Sharkey’s comment about sexual offences: “It undermines public confidence in policing at a time when police forces and particularly the Met Police are trying to demonstrate how seriously it takes offences of violence against women and girls.”
At a pub following a shift in January last year, Mr Sharkey’s colleagues were discussing a police officer getting away with committing sexual assault, the tribunal heard earlier.
Following on from that discussion, footage played on Friday showed Mr Sharkey saying: “If you are going to get accused of it you might as well f****** do it then.
“If you go down for a sexual assault you might as well go down for rape.”
He added: “Please, that’s a joke. I challenge myself on that.”
He then said: “That was wrong, I do apologise.”
Cecily White, for the Met Police, told the tribunal it is “clear” he was making a joke, adding: “For an officer to make a joke about allegations of sexual assault or rape, especially to other colleagues… (it) is capable of undermining public trust and confidence because it is capable of making members of the public think that police officers do not think such allegations are particularly serious. They are just a joke, just a laughing matter.
“It is capable of giving the impression that they won’t be taken seriously.”
During his evidence, Mr Sharkey told the panel “something else had been said” after the discussion about sexual assault and that the conversation had turned towards challenge culture in the Met.
He claimed he meant to provide an “example” of how treating “trivial matters” with too much weight can devalue the impact of more serious matters, but accepted it was a “poor example” and “very, very, very wrong”.
“I take sexual assault very, very seriously, do not trivialise it at all,” he said.
“I do regret it, I regretted it right from the start.”
In August 2024, Mr Sharkey was filmed while taking his break during a night shift telling the undercover journalist: “You stop a toerag because he is up to no good, you don’t find anything on him ‘well you’re just stopping me because I’m black or you’re just stopping me because I’m this or you’re just stopping me because I’m that’ and you just get a whole load of a mouth full of shit from them.”
Ms White argued the then-officer was treating claims of racial bias as “spurious excuses”.
“The use of stop and search powers particularly against black and minority communities is a legitimate matter of public concern as this officer was or should have been aware,” the lawyer for the Met said.
Mr Sharkey told his misconduct hearing he “was not being racist at all” and that he would have given more examples rather than just said “this and that” but he got “very tongue-tied”.
He said he does believe the abuse of power over racial bias “is a source of concern”, adding: “I’m not trying to trivialise it at all it was not my intention.”
At the pub evening in January last year, Mr Sharkey was also videoed speaking to the undercover journalist about who to bring into custody.
He said: “If it’s some office worker who has got his first bit of class A – I don’t say do this because I may have, may not have done it – ‘oh shit mate I’ve dropped it, oh f*** I’ve got no evidence now’.”
Mr Sharkey added that if it was someone with a criminal record it would be a different set of rules.
The former officer said he was not talking about himself but that he was telling a story from his probation days some 20 years ago, the panel heard.
“I had explained it incorrectly but that gave him the impression I had done it,” he said on Friday.
The panel found his comments amounted to a breach of the standards of professional behaviour in respect of authority, respect and courtesy, discreditable conduct and equality and diversity.
Mr Sharkey was also filmed making a sexual innuendo to colleagues but the panel did not find that the comment breached professional standards.
On October 1 last year Panorama aired footage that had been captured by an undercover BBC journalist working as a designated detention officer at Charing Cross police station custody suite.
Seven other police officers have been sacked after the BBC investigation.
Last year Pc Sean Park, Sergeant Lawrence Hume, Sergeant Clayton Robinson, Pc Jason Sinclair-Birt, Pc Philip Neilson, Pc Martin Borg and Sergeant Joe McIlvenny were dismissed without notice in separate hearings after it was found they had committed gross misconduct.
The hearing continues.

US President Donald Trump on Friday urged his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to move swiftly in negotiations with Russia.
"Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelenskyy's gonna have to get moving — otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move," Trump told reporters.
Russia and Ukraine held two rounds of US-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in January and earlier this month. As a result, they agreed to the first exchange of war prisoners in five months.
The Kremlin said on Friday that the next round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine will take place on Feb. 17-18 in Geneva, Switzerland.

Türkiye reveals new prototypes of homegrown combat aircraft KAAN
Defense Industries chief states that country continues test and production preparations for KAAN
ANKARA
New prototypes of the homegrown combat aircraft KAAN, which will undergo testing during the development process led by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), have made their debut.
The head of Türkiye's Secretariat of Defense Industries, Haluk Gorgun, visited the KAAN hangar on Friday to receive information regarding the latest developments.
Gorgun noted that the rollout of the aircraft intended for full-size static testing, alongside the first and second flight prototypes, represents a significant technical milestone.
The official emphasized that KAAN stands beyond a mere aircraft as a symbol of Türkiye’s engineering prowess and independent defense capabilities.
The primary objective of the project centers on indigenously developing a next-generation combat aircraft that will serve the Turkish Air Force for many years.
KAAN will feature advanced capabilities such as low observability, internal weapon bays, enhanced situational awareness and sensor fusion for superior performance in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.
Following the first flight of the initial prototype in 2024, development and production processes continue uninterrupted while simultaneously advancing operational capabilities for manned and unmanned fighter jets.
Gorgun explained that KAAN continuously enhances the country's defense and aviation infrastructure, elevating Türkiye into an elite league of global players, particularly through the ongoing development of a domestic engine.
The strategic program also serves as a catalyst that simultaneously strengthens the country's infrastructure, human resources and technological accumulation, he noted.
Authorities are rapidly carrying out preparations for mass production in parallel with the current testing phases as part of this critical technology initiative.
The domestic supply chain for KAAN currently consists of more than 5,000 employees working across over 300 companies in more than 20 cities, Gorgun said.

Chilling images from Nancy Guthrie's porch could hold valuable clues about the masked suspect
Those frightening images of a masked man on Nancy Guthrie’s porch could provide valuable clues to investigators
- Bookmark
The chilling videos of a masked man outside Nancy Guthrie’s home in Arizona before she vanished show just glimpses of the suspect, but for investigators they hold a mountain of clues.
And those images — from the suspect's gloves to his flashlight — could be what's needed to break the case.
“There’s a tremendous amount of information that this guy left,” said former FBI profiler Clint Van Zandt.
The FBI already has analyzed the videos from Guthrie's doorbell camera to identify the suspect's backpack, posting an alert on Thursday with a photo of the brand and model in hopes of narrowing down tips flooding the agency.
It has been nearly two weeks since the mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie was believed to have been abducted.
Former criminal investigators say it's almost certain that authorities are building a physical and psychological profile of the suspect, using the footage released publicly on Tuesday that totals less than a minute.
Whether authorities recovered more footage isn't known, but technology will allow them to see more than meets the eye.
“Every single thing that is in the video is being digitally enhanced. Everything from the mask to backpack to the jacket,” said Ed Davis, the former Boston police commissioner during the marathon bombing and manhunt in 2013.
Here's what was captured in the footage and what clues each might yield:
The backpack
It probably didn't take long to pinpoint the type of backpack the suspect was wearing, Davis said.
Technology available today allows investigators to break down photos and videos to the pixel, he said, giving them images of the stitching and maybe the manufacturer or brand name.
The FBI described the backpack as a black, 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack.”
The holster
The FBI says the man on Nancy Guthrie's porch was armed.
But the video shows he had an unusual holster setup, hanging over the middle of his waist and not on the side. It might be an indication that whoever it was has little experience with firearms.
“I've never seen anything like that,” Davis said.
The gloves
The footage gives a close-up view of the suspect trying to cover Guthrie's doorbell camera, first with a gloved hand and then with part of a plant ripped from the yard.
The black gloves appear to be thicker than most and shimmered in the light.
“I spend a lot of time in Home Depot, and I've never seen those gloves,” Davis said. “They're not very common.”
The clothes
The suspect's zip-up jacket, pants, shoes and mask don't immediately stand out. But identifying one or more of those items could be a key.
Because once that happens, investigators can start looking at where those items are sold and combing through receipts and store surveillance cameras, starting with stores in the Tucson area closest to Guthrie's home, said Van Zandt, who spent 25 years with the FBI.
Going through mounds of receipts and footage will take time and isn't something that would be done on most cases, but there's no shortage of people assigned to this one, he said. The Pima County Sheriff’s Department earlier this week said several hundred detective and agents have been assigned to the case.
“If all of the stars line up properly — and they rarely do — I find someone who was in there two weeks prior who bought the jacket, the shoes, the backpack all at the same time,” Van Zandt said.
The flashlight
In one of the videos, the suspect appeared to be holding a small flashlight in his mouth while in front of Guthrie's door.
Figuring out the type of flashlight might be difficult, but there's something else to look at there, said David Lyons, a former homicide detective and police commander in Lexington, Kentucky.
Not many people instinctively hold a flashlight in their mouth, but those who work in the trades might — such as an electrician or a plumber, he said.
“That’s a small thing,” he said. “But at the same time, down the road, it could be something.”
The movements
Every step and movement the suspect made on the porch is worth a close look — from the way he walked, to how he seemed unhurried and how he grabbed the plant from the yard, Lyons said.
All of that will likely be used by behavioral analysts to create a profile of the suspect, he said.
“That’s what this will come down to,” Lyons said. “Those small aspects added all together.”

We examine how mass production and convenience culture reshaped our diets, why some ingredients are banned in parts of the world but legal elsewhere, and what “FDA-approved” actually means. We also cut through the fearmongering on social media, where viral claims and influencer warnings can blur the line between legitimate health concerns and misinformation.

US President Donald Trump told reporters that President Volodymyr Zelensky was “going to have to get moving” on peace negotiations with Russia on Friday.
Ukraine has long engaged with efforts to negotiate a peace. In November 2025, a 28-point plan to end Russia’s full-scale war – drafted by the Trump administration with input from Kremlin officials – leaked to the press.

“Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelensky’s going to have to get moving, otherwise he’s going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move,” Trump said, according to AFP.
The last round of trilateral talks, hosted by Abu Dhabi, took place on Feb. 4-5. Although the talks resulted in the first prisoner exchange of 2026, there was little tangible progress towards a ceasefire.
While Ukrainian and US negotiators said the talks were constructive, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said earlier this week that the progress of talks had been overhyped – criticizing Washington for supposedly reneging on what Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed at a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, last year.
Zelensky said Wednesday that territorial issues will be the central focus of the next round of negotiations. Territory has long been a sticking point, as Russia continues to demand Ukraine concede territory Russia has proved unable to win on the battlefield.
Zelensky, who is currently in Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference, has not responded directly to Trump’s comments. However, he said in a Telegram post that he had discussed “diplomatic work” during his meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.

“Ukrainians, along with all other Europeans, must be confident in their future and that Russian aggression will never happen again. I thank the partners who understand this and help.”
Also on Friday, Merz said in his opening remarks to the conference that the global rules-based order “no longer exists” – and that “the leadership claim of the US is being challenged, perhaps already lost.”

Paris police fire on knife attacker at Arc de Triomphe
French police on Friday shot and injured a man who tried to stab an officer with a knife during a ceremony at the Arc de Triomphe monument in central Paris. The man was injured and has been taken to hospital.
A man wielding a knife tried to attack police during a ceremony beneath the Arc de Triomphe monument in Paris on Friday, and was shot and injured by a police officer, officials said.
The attacker targeted an officer securing the ceremony for relighting the eternal flame honoring unknown soldiers at the Napoleon-era landmark, according to a Paris police official. Another officer shot the attacker, who was hospitalised, the official said.
No bystanders or police officers were injured in the incident, the official told The Associated Press.

Read below for the latest headlines, videos and deep dives into the 2026 MSC from Friday, February 13 to Sunday, February 15
Macron: Europe should not cave in to Russia's demands
France's President Emmanuel Macron touched on Russia's invasion of Ukraine during his speech at the MSC.
Russia has been particularly keen on taking control of the eastern Ukrainian Donbas region as part of a peace deal.
He said Europe should not give into Russia's demands: "We should exhibit strength and tenacity on Ukraine."
"I hear some leaders urging Ukraine to accept that they are defeated, overpraising Russia as well. This is a huge strategic mistake, because this is not the reality," Macron said.
"This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe," Macron said, while adding that more pressure should be put on Russia.
The French president said if there is a peace deal with Russia, Europe will have to create a new framework for coexistence.
"If we reach a settlement on Ukraine, we will still have to contend with an aggressive Russia," Macron said. "We will have to define rules of coexistance that limit the risk of escalation."
France's Macron: 'We should be proud of our European achievement'
French President Emmanuel Macron, in his speech at the MSC, said Europe should be seen as a model for the rest of the world.
"Everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticizing us," Macron said, referring to criticisms of Europe on issues such as speech and migration.
"Everybody is asking Europe to be stronger, except for our adversaries and sometimes, less understandably, ourselves," Macron said, adding that Europeans need a "much more positive mindset."
"We need to be proud of our European achievement," Macron said, adding that Europeans "should be proud of ourselves." He said Europeans are "prone to playing themselves down."
Macron noted achievements such as freedom of movement and goods within the EU, and said Europe ranks high in areas such as life expectancy and health. He also said Europe invests in sciences and protects academic freedoms.
"Obviously, we have to fix a lot of things," Macron said, calling on Europeans to face their challenges and fix them. He urged Europe to become more of a "geopolitical power" on the world stage.
AOC: 'We need to have a working-class centered politics' to stave off authorianism
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a congresswoman from New York who belongs to the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, spoke at an MSC panel focusing on the "rise of populism."
Ocasio-Cortez was elected to Congress in 2018. She had defeated longtime congressman Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary in a shock win, causing a political earthquake in her party.
"When I was elected, the Democratic Party was telling working people 'everything is fine' when it wasn't. I campaigned on the pain points in my life," Ocasio-Cortez said, referring to promises such as raising the minimum wage and expanding public healthcare programs.
"If we are to succeed, if we are going to stave off authorianism, we need to have a working-class centered politics," Ocasio-Cortez said.
She said that "extreme levels of income inequality" leads to "social instability" and right-wing populism.
"It is of utmost urgency that we get our economic houses in order and deliver material gains for the working class — or else we will fall to a more isolated world, governed by authoritarians that also do not deliver for working people," Ocasio-Cortez said.
Ocasio-Cortez, like Gavin Newsom, is rumored to be considering a presidential run in the 2028 election.
UN will emerge 'stronger' after reforms, US diplomat says
US ambassador to the UN Michael Waltz defended US-initiated cuts and reforms to the UN, saying that Donald Trump was right to ask why the UN was not getting results in international crises.
"The UN will be stronger at the end of this process. The status quo was unsustainable and not working in places like Gaza or Azerbaijan-Armenia," Waltz an MSC panel dedicated to the changes to the global order.
Waltz also said that having more focused multilateral organizations, such as the new Board of Peace was "perfectly acceptable if we are getting the results."
Trump launched the Board of Peace during the Davos summit last month, expanding on the idea of a coalition of countries working together to resolve the Gaza conflict. The wider agenda and specific mechanisms of the new international body, however, remain unclear.
US allies such as Germany and France have outright refused to join it, while the UK left open the possibility of doing so in future.
California Governor Gavin Newsom: Trump climate policy is 'temporary'
California Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, took part in an MSC panel titled "Playing with Fire: The Need for Decisive Climate Action."
During the discussion, Newsom harshly criticized US President Donald Trump's climate policy.
"I want to be clear: Donald Trump's administration is temporary. California's commitment is not," Newsom said in a post on X summarizing his comments on the panel. "He will be gone in three years. Our resolve to confront climate change is enduring and we remain a stable, reliable partner in that fight."
Newsom claimed that Trump is trying to recreate the 19th century and accused him of being a "wholly owned subsidiary of big oil, gas and coal." The 19th century was a time in the US when fossil fuels, in particular coal, fueled the industrial revolution.
Newsom said Trump took large amounts of money from the fossil fuel industry during the 2024 presidential election and, in return, is attempting to eliminate "all regulations in the United States of America."
His comments came one day after the Trump administration reversed an Obama-era finding that said carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are harmful to human health. That finding allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate carbon emissions to protect public welfare.
Newsom's appearance at the Munich Security Conference comes amid rumors that he is planning to run for the White House in the 2028 election.
AfD lawmakers attend Munich Security Conference
You may remember that US Vice President JD Vance sent shockwaves with his speech at last year's Munich Security Conference (MSC).
In it, he railed against what he described as an erosion of democratic norms across Europe, citing, among other things, the decision not to invite lawmakers from Germany's far-right Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) to the conference.
To add insult to injury, he later declined a meeting with then German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and instead met with the AfD's co-leader, Alice Weidel.
Coming in the middle of an election campaign, the move was widely seen as a significant breach of diplomatic decorum.
This year, Vance is not attending. The AfD, however, now the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, will be represented.
Three AfD lawmakers have been invited, although organizers stress they will not be "given a platform."
The party's defense policy spokesman, Ruediger Lucassen, told me he wants Germany to return to being a "leading European nation" by "taking on the main military burden on NATO's northeastern flank."
To that end, he said Germany should commit four army divisions, two helicopter squadrons and a cruiser squadron, while also developing deep-strike precision capabilities.
Smaller countries, he argued, should be able to rely on Germany. "Not a European army, but a European alliance ready for defense," he said.
Members of the AfD delegation are also said to be hoping for face time with the US delegation, though both sides are keeping any potential contacts discreet.
According to media reports, the AfD's foreign policy spokesman, Markus Frohnmaier, will travel to Munich for meetings with US officials on the sidelines of the conference, including at the State Department. I have been unable to independently confirm those reports.
Frohnmaier has been a key figure in strengthening ties between the AfD and the MAGA movement in recent months.
I understand that Weidel has no plans to make a spontaneous trip to Munich to meet the US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio.
Rubio is due to travel on to Hungary, where Weidel is a regular guest of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Europe is no longer appeasing Trump, DW's chief political editor's read on Merz' speech
The United States just got a geopolitical dressing down by the German Chancellor.
Here at the Munich Security Conference, Friedrich Merz just held a mirror up to President Donald Trump’s America, and the destructive effect it is having on the world order.
Merz’ pointed analysis of how isolated Trump’s aggressive take on trade and security has left the US was so blunt that it sounded like an insult.
His depiction of a self-centred America was calm, collected and brutal, without any attempt to soften the edges - like he did in the past.
Note, where there was spontaneous applause from the room packed with world leaders and US Senators, when Merz declared that "the MAGA culture war isn't ours."
Trump will likely perceive Merz’ warning of what this new age of power politics holds in store for him as outrageous.
As leader of the still way weaker end of this relationship, Merz wants a full reset of the transatlantic relationship.
For now Washington is still sticking with NATO, the US-dominated defense pact which Europe fully depends upon. Merz just fired a departing shop for Europe to stop wanting the old America back and instead focus on building up its own security and trade strength.
And he stressed new or deeper relations with Canada, Japan, Turkey, India, Brazil and the Gulf States along the way.
That rallying cry includes the strictly European take on freedom – without tariffs, protectionism but with a rules based order that includes a climate deal and global organizations like the World Health Organization, which Trump has now left.
The – we are told – carefully coordinated message from Merz and his European allies is clear; after the Greenland standoff, the Europeans have dropped appeasement as a strategy to deal with Trump.
Whatever the response – and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is still due to speak – Europe clearly believes, and can finally agree, that they need to stand their ground. No matter the tariff on that.
IN PICTURES: Behind the scenes at the Munich Security Conference
US diplomat: Many countries 'welcomed' US reasserting its leadership
Commenting on the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, US Ambassador to the UN, Michael Waltz, told a panel at the Munich Security Conference that the controversial move actually garnered international praise "behind the scenes."
"So asserting US leadership has been welcomed and we hear, again and again, behind the scenes, 'thank you' from a number of countries," he said.
The US seizure of Maduro last month is broadly considered to be against international law, with allies such as France saying it was running "counter to the principle of peaceful dispute resolution" and rivals including China and Russia dismissing it as "bullying" and "international banditry."
Waltz also commented on recent budget cuts to the UN and President Donald Trump's efforts to establish the Board of Peace, which many observers have portrayed as an attempt to sideline the UN Security Council.
"We needed to put the UN on a diet," said the US ambassador to the UN.
"Everyone agrees that reform was needed. We are pushing hard for the US to be back to basics, to that peacemaking and peacekeeping function," rather than attempting to be "everything to every nation," Waltz said.
Merz urges Europe to use 'pressure' to forge 'something good'
Friedrich Merz has said Germany and its European allies must not shy away from the reality of the new global order
Merz said European nations must "use the pressure we are facing to create something new, something good" as he firmly rejected "big power politics," which he said are "not an option for Germany" or Europe.
"Leadership in partnership, yes. Hegemonial fantasies, no," Merz said.
The chancellor also pointed to what his country has learned from when Nazi Germany occupied much of Europe.
"Never again will we Germans go it alone. This is the enduring lesson we have learned from our history. We assert our freedom with our neighbors — only with our neighbors, our allies and our partners."
EU's top diplomat says UN 'not reflecting the world as it currently is,' urges reform
Speaking at a panel focusing on the changes to the international order, European Commission Vice-President and top diplomat Kaja Kallas said that the world was missing "accountability."
"So the rules are there, I think everybody signs onto the United Nation's charter, the principles are there, but what happens if somebody breaches those principles? The accountability is clearly not working," she said.
"The United Nations is not reflecting the world as it currently is, so I think we have to use this opportunity to really develop this world forward, because the majority of the countries in the world want rules-based order."
What else did Merz say during his MSC speech?
Friedrich Merz highlighted several areas that Europe needs to address to become more secure and more competitive in a fast-changing global environment.
"Competitiveness policy is security policy. And security policy is competitiveness policy. Both serve our freedom," Merz said.
Here are some of the key points the chancellor made during his speech at the MSC:
- Germany and Europe must do more to secure the Arctic.
- He repeated his pledge to make the German armed forces the strongest conventional army in Europe as soon as possible.
- He highlighted new legislation aimed at making grids and critical infrastructure more resilient to hybrid attacks.
- He called for forging resilient supply chains and reducing unilateral dependencies on raw materials, key technologies and key products.
- He urged better protection of Europe's free democratic order against domestic and foreign threats and pressed for strengthening Europe's intelligence services.
'We don't want to lose you,' Merz tells EU candidate countries
German Chancellor Merz said there's a need for "a new strategy" to bring more countries into the European Union.
He was responding to a question from the president of Montenegro, Jakov Milatovic, who asked whether the enlargement of the EU could make Europe more competitive globally.
"Yes," Merz answered. "We have promised the accession to become a member of the European Union to many countries … and frankly I'm feeling more and more uncomfortable with our approach to your countries."
Montenegro is currently one of nine official candidate countries seeking to join the EU.
"I don’t want to lose you," Merz added. "You are part of the European continent and therefore you are potentially part of the European Union. And I know that this is a consensus."
He said he hoped to move forward with the next steps toward accession in April to bring countries such as Montenegro "closer and closer to the European Union at the very end as members."
Merz says Russia must be made to see no advantage in war
During a Q&A session after his speech, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Russia must be brought to a point where it sees "no further advantage" in continuing its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
In response to a question about why, unlike the Americans, Europeans were not talking directly to Russia, Merz replied: "We are in close contact with those who are talking to Russia."
In an apparent reference to Hungarian leader Viktor Orban, Merz cited the example of an EU prime minister who had "achieved nothing" during a visit to Russia. Shortly afterward, Russia launched a particularly harsh attack on Ukraine, the German chancellor said.
Merz stressed the importance of bringing Russia to a point where waging war is no longer advantageous for Moscow.
"We have to bring them to this point to stop it," the German chancellor said. "We must do everything we can militarily, economically, politically, and diplomatically to achieve this," he added.
US top diplomat Marco Rubio meets China's Wang Yi in Munich
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met and talked on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday but shared no information about the talks with the press.
The Friday meeting was held behind closed doors at a hotel conference room with senior aides from both sides also in attendance. The talks lasted at least an hour, according to Rubio's team.
The US and China are locked in a prolonged standoff over trade and security issues. A deal between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in October averted Washington's threat of escalating tariffs on Chinese imports to 130% and a similar Chinese response, but tensions persist over US arms sales to Taiwan.
This week, Trump confirmed he would be visiting Xi Jinping in April.
"He will be coming to the US later in the year, and I look forward to it," Trump said.

Olesik and Repilov jointly with their assisting staff - Alexander Vasin and Ivan Nevmerzhitsky - arrived at the Moscow Vnukovo airport after a lengthy flight from Milan to Moscow with a stopover in Turkey’s Istanbul.
They were greeted at the Moscow airport by relatives, close friends, representatives of the Russian Luge Federation, coaches and other athletes.
At the ongoing 2026 Winter Games in Italy Olesik and Repilov finished 13th and 14th in women's and men’s singles luge respectively.
Athletes from Russia and Belarus have been cleared to participate in the 2026 Winter Games under a neutral designation, which excludes the display of national flags and anthems.

Three skiers die in avalanche at French ski resort
The skiers were caught in an avalanche at France’s Val d’Isere resort on Friday

Three skiers have died after being caught in an avalanche at the renowned French Alpine resort of Val d'Isere on Friday.
Cedric Bonnevie, who manages the resort's pistes, confirmed the fatalities, stating that one of the victims was a French national, while the other two were foreign.
An inquiry into the tragic incident is now underway. Initial reports suggest one individual was caught higher on the mountain slope, while the other two were part of a group of five, including a professional guide, further down the face, who reportedly did not see the impending danger.
The precise cause of the avalanche remains unclear, Mr Bonnevie added.
The incident occurred just a day after Meteo France, the national weather service, had placed the local area under a red alert for avalanche risk.
Avalanches have rocked France recently, with four skiers passing away in the space of three days in the French Alps.
Two were killed on Monday, including a 38-year-old man Saint-Agnes, near Grenoble, shortly before 4pm while skiing off piste in the Belledonne mountain range, police said. He was with another skier who was unharmed.
Another man in his early 30s was also killed by a “very large avalanche” while skiing off piste near Montgenevre, on the Italian border, public prosecutor Marion Lozac'hmeur said.
He was also accompanied by a fellow skier, who was unharmed.
Ms Lozac'hmeur reported previously that two skiers were killed on Saturday after an avalanche was triggered near the village of Saint-Veran, southeastern France.
The two victims, aged in their 30s, were part of a group of four when they were struck by a large avalanche down the north side of the Tete de Longet mountain peak. The other two skiers were unharmed.
Heavy snowfall in the Alps caused the avalanches, with December through to February being peak season in the northern hemisphere.

Diplomat overseeing Gaza ceasefire says violations threaten transitional governance
The top diplomat overseeing the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza said Friday that continued violations of the agreement pose major obstacles to the Palestinian committee expected to oversee postwar governance and reconstruction
- Bookmark
The top diplomat overseeing the U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza said Friday that continued violations of the agreement pose major obstacles to the Palestinian committee expected to oversee postwar governance and reconstruction.
Nickolay Mladenov, who serves as high representative for Gaza for the U.S.-established Board of Peace, spoke during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference. The international board, established by U.S. President Donald Trump, is set to meet next week.
The transitional committee, made up of Palestinian administrators, has met in Egypt but has not yet entered Gaza. Mladenov said it won't be able to do its work unless Hamas, the militant group that has governed Gaza since 2007, hands over institutional control. He also called for more aid and improved security.
The agreement calls for Hamas to lay down its arms and for an international security force to be deployed, but there has been no visible progress on either. Israel has continued to carry out strikes in response to what it says are violations of the truce. Palestinian militants have also attacked Israeli forces.
“We need to make sure that what is happening now with the violations of the ceasefire stops,” Mladenov said. “We’re only embarrassing the committee and ultimately making it ineffective.”
Mladenov didn't lay out a specific timeline but said “all of this needs to move very fast.”
Ceasefire is aimed at ending 2-year war
Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin, speaking at the same panel, said the timeline is key, adding that Gaza must not be severed from the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The Palestinian Authority wants to govern both territories ahead of eventual statehood, something to which Israel is adamantly opposed.
The Oct. 10 U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal attempted to halt a more than two-year war between Israel and Hamas.
While the heaviest fighting has subsided, the ceasefire has seen almost daily Israeli fire. Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military- held zones. There have been 591 Palestinians killed, according to Gaza health officials.
The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. But it does not give a breakdown of civilians and militants.
Militants have carried out shooting attacks on troops, and Israel says its strikes are in response to that and other violations. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Mladenov, a Bulgarian diplomat, as the director-general of the board mean to oversee the implementation of the second and far more complicated phase of the ceasefire.
Dozens of Palestinians buried
The bodies of 53 unidentified Palestinians, along with 86 unidentified human remains, were laid to rest on Friday at a mass burial in a cemetery in central Gaza’s Deir Al-Balah.
Earlier this month, Israel transferred the bodies of 54 Palestinians and 66 boxes containing human remains, all unidentified, to Gaza via the Red Cross. Only one body was identified by a family, while the others were buried on Friday.
Israel gave no identification for the bodies and doesn’t allow DNA testing material into Gaza.
“A period of time is allotted for families to identify these bodies and remains. Unfortunately, none of these remains or organs were identified,” Ziyad Obeid, director of the cemeteries department at the Endowments Ministry, said from the burial site. ___

Canada school shooter’s online history shows fascination with violence and mass killings
Jesse Van Rootselaar created a mall shooter game on Roblox and was active on forum where users shared images of gore and mass violence
- Bookmark
Before killing nine people in British Columbia, Canada, 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar appeared to leave behind an extensive online presence that reflected her struggles with mental health and a growing fascination with mass violence and gore.
Tuesday’s mass shooting has devastated the small rural community of Tumbler Ridge, where Van Rootselaar is accused of killing her mother, 11-year-old stepbrother, five schoolchildren and an education assistant. The shootings happened at the family’s home and Tumbler Ridge Secondary School. Van Rootselaar, a former student at the school, died from a self-inflicted injury. Twenty-seven others were injured.
Her digital footprint appears to show a fascination with firearms, violence and previous mass shooters, as well as drugs and nihilistic content, often within dark and obscure internet forums, where users share and celebrate images of death.
She - police say Van Rootselaar was transgender and used she pronouns - appears to have created an account on the website WatchPeopleDie, an online forum where users share images of violent death and glorify mass shooters.
The Independent has also confirmed an account with Roblox, where she created a game that allowed players to simulate a mass shooting inside what appeared to be a shopping mall. The account and content has been removed.
In 2019, she created a Reddit account where she discussed suicidal thoughts, video games and gender transition; in 2023, Van Rootselaar started to socially transition and posted that she was on a six-month waiting list for hormonal treatment, though it is unclear whether she actually received medical gender-affirming care. Health authorities reported that Van Rootselaar was never enrolled in any inpatient care programs in the region.
In February 2023, Van Rootselaar posted that she started a fire in her house while high on psychedelic mushrooms. In that post, she also said she had been recently hospitalized for psychiatric care, was experiencing other mental health conditions, including depression, and received a diagnosis that she was on the autism spectrum.
Van Rootselaar also claims to be taking antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs.
An account on WatchPeopleDie included images and videos of firearms, though the account has since been removed by site moderators in the wake of the attack, according to an analysis from the ADL Center on Extremism.
The account includes many images of guns that were also visible in a Facebook post from the shooter’s mother. In 2021, her mother Jessica Jacobs — who appeared to use her maiden name, Strang, for herself and Van Rootselaar — said to “check out my oldest son Jesse Strang YouTube Channel.”
“He posts about hunting, self reliance, guns and stuff he likes to do,” she added.
Another image from her Facebook account in 2024 shows six guns with the caption “think it’s time to take them out for some target practice.”
Van Rootselaar’s minor’s firearms license expired that year, according to police.
On Reddit, Van Rootselaar posted an image of a Chinese Norinco SKS rifle, the same model that was also included in an image on her mother’s Facebook account.
That same firearm was included on the WatchPeopleDie website with an account using a similar username to one Van Rootselaar used on Reddit.
The account on the website — which has been linked to several school shooters — was immersed in videos of death and violence, commenting “I appreciate this post” on a thread that compiled footage of prior mass shootings.
“I love these first person perspective type videos, when the shooter records his or her own actions it’s always heat,” the account commented on another threat of shooting footage.
In August, the user posted that they found violent content “addictive.”
“I've tried to stray [sic] away from watching this type of thing before cuz it really sucks me in and is a massive useless time dump,” the account wrote, according to the ADL’s analysis.
“To say it ‘doesn’t effect [sic] me is likely naive,” the user added. “It just doesn’t feel like a big deal.”
The Independent has requested comment from the website.
Roblox confirmed to The Independent that Van Rootselaar’s account was removed February 11.
The mall shooting game could only be accessed through downloading a separate app used by developers to design games, and had only seven visits, according to a company spokesperson.
Van Rootselaar’s online presence reflects a pattern of online radicalization towards committing mass violence fueled by engagement with violent content, which experts and law enforcement officials are increasingly warning is a trend of online-driven “nihilism.”
Officials have not found a legible agenda behind a recent streak of high-profile killings and acts of political violence where assailants defied being neatly categorized into familiar ideologically- or racism-driven threats.
A recent wave of attackers instead broadly declared their contempt for humanity and welcomed the end of civilization.
“Although these subcultures can produce outcomes similar to ideologically-motivated extremism, their goals, worldviews and motivations differ from classic ideological movements,” according to a December report from the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. “This presents distinct challenges for prevention and safeguarding.”
The Department of Justice is also investigating what it has labeled Nihilistic Violent Extremism, while Canada labeled groups 764 and Maniac Murder Cult as terrorist entities, among a growing number of groups stemming from far-right accelerationist threats within the “Nihilistic Violent Extremism” ecosystem.
Such groups have proliferated online and spread globally, with arrests reported in at least 29 countries, according to a February report from the Global Network on Extremism and Technology, which reported on a trend of what it calls “post-ideological violence.”
“These communities glorify violence and its perpetrators while engaging in manipulative and coercive practices that draw young people into committing extreme acts of violence against others, animals, or themselves,” according to the report.
“While the full scope of this phenomenon … remains difficult to determine, the growing number of documented cases and victims underscores the urgent need for targeted and coordinated responses,” the group found.
In the aftermath of Tumbler Ridge shooting, social media also focused intensely on Van Rootselaar’s gender, a frequent phenomenon in the wake of recent mass shootings where users wrongly identify suspects as transgender.
Fewer than one in 1,000 mass shooters over the past decade have been identified as transgender, according to the Gun Violence Archive. The overwhelming majority of mass attacks are committed by cisgender men, while trans people are more than four times likely to be victims of violent crimes, including rape and sexual assault, according to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law.

Sybiha: We expect concrete decisions from Geneva talks, not history lectures
This was stated by Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
The head of Ukrainian diplomacy recalled that two rounds of trilateral talks have already taken place in Abu Dhabi and noted that, thanks to U.S. leadership, there is an opportunity to make progress. At the same time, he stressed that pressure on Russia must be increased in parallel, and that the necessary tools to do so are available.
Sybiha said he agrees with the assessment that there are currently no signs from the Russian side of any readiness for serious negotiations. By contrast, Ukraine has prepared realistic proposals.
“Of course, there can be no peace agreements at the expense of our territorial integrity and sovereignty. But in any case, if we are talking about a 20-point plan, three points remain that must be agreed at the leadership level, and we have workable proposals. We therefore very much hope that during the next round we will not hear any additional history lectures. This is not about the process – now is the time for action, for concrete and decisive steps,” Sybiha emphasized.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, the Ukrainian delegation led by Rustem Umerov, Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, has already begun preparations for a trilateral meeting between representatives of Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, scheduled to take place in Geneva on February 17–18.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that the Russian delegation at the next round of talks between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia in Geneva will be led by Russian presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.

Gavin Newsom Says Trump is ‘Code Red’ For Climate Leadership

California’s Governor Gavin Newsom has called the current Trump Administration “Code Red” for American climate leadership. His comments come in response to President Donald Trump repealing the endangerment finding on Feb. 12, the landmark rule that gave the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) authority to regulate greenhouse gasses.
“Pollution is an act of theft in the health of a nation,” Newsom said during a panel at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Feb. 13. “Never in the history of the United States of America has there been a more destructive president than the current occupant in the White House in Washington, D.C. He's trying to recreate the 19th century. He's a wholly owned subsidiary of big oil, gas, and coal.”
Newsom’s reaction echoed that of Former President Barack Obama who yesterday said that repealing the endangerment finding, which was established during his administration, would make the U.S. less safe, writing on social media, “Today, the Trump administration repealed the endangerment finding: the ruling that served as the basis for limits on tailpipe emissions and power plant rules. Without it, we’ll be less safe, less healthy and less able to fight climate change—all so the fossil fuel industry can make even more money.”

On the world stage, Newsom aimed to assure leaders that California, the fourth largest economy in the world, was not backing down from the climate fight. Greenhouse gas emissions in California have gone down 21% since 2000, and in 2023, the state was powered by two-thirds clean energy, making it the largest economy in the world to achieve this level.
Last week, in the face of the federal government’s efforts to support the electric vehicle industry, the governor announced a $200 million proposal to revive the state’s EV market, which would require automakers to match dollar-for-dollar state incentives. “What Donald Trump just did yesterday with the endangerment finding, by basically eliminating any federal regulations, not just on power plants, methane, but also tailpipe emissions, I think, was writing a death sentence to legacy American automobile manufacturers,” he said. “You talk about innovation, it's been California's regulation in this space that's driven manufacturing innovation that allows American automobile manufacturers to be competitive globally.”

Newsom, a 2028 presidential hopeful, argued that it is possible to make climate appeal to voters across parties in the next election given that many communities are already experiencing the impact of a warming planet, from wildfires to flooding. “Places, lifestyles, traditions are being wiped off the map. This issue has been brought home in a very personal way, not a political way,” he said. “It’s becoming uninsurable. This is an economic issue, not just a moral issue. It's not just a competitiveness issue, and so it's incredibly important that we talk in those terms to address some of the political dynamics.”

Despite federal rollbacks, Newsom assured the crowd that California will remain committed to the climate fight. “Donald Trump is temporary. He'll be gone in three years. California is a stable and reliable partner in this space, and it's important for folks to understand the temporary nature of this current administration in relationship [sic] to the issue of climate change and climate policy.”
He also urged corporate leaders to take a stand against Trump. “I think this is a moral moment across the board…We have to stand up with more clarity and conviction, and we have to be more consistent. People don't speak up because they're afraid of retaliation,” he said. “Well, you know, buck up.”

Rutte in Munich: Europe stepping up to lead NATO
United Kingdom

04:19:11 KST

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has said European allies are increasingly taking a leadership role within the alliance, arguing that higher defence spending across NATO is strengthening the transatlantic relationship rather than weakening it.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference following a NATO Defence Ministers meeting in Brussels, Rutte described what he called a “real shift in mindset” among allies, with European nations and Canada stepping up investment and assuming greater responsibility for their own defence.
“Yesterday we had the Defence Ministers session with NATO, and there was a real shift in mindset,” he said. “The Europeans now, all, and Canada, on 2%, and we agreed, of course, in The Hague… to reach the 5%.”
Rutte said the shift was not simply about meeting spending targets, but reflected a deeper political change in how European governments view their role in NATO. He suggested this would reinforce the US commitment to the alliance by addressing longstanding American concerns over unequal burden-sharing.
“What I was also seeing yesterday is this notion of Europe really stepping up, taking more of a leadership role within NATO, and also taking more responsibility for its own defence,” he said. “And I think this will only strengthen NATO.” He added that Europe’s increased spending would remove what he described as a persistent point of friction between Washington and its allies.
“I’m convinced it anchors the United States even more in NATO than it was already because of this dealing with this big irritant… of Europeans spending less than the Americans,” Rutte said. Asked about the role of the United States, Rutte insisted Washington remained fully committed to NATO’s collective defence posture, including its nuclear deterrent. “They are totally committed… both nuclear and conventional, to the Alliance,” he said.
Rutte also said the priority for allies remained continued military support to Ukraine, describing fresh funding commitments as “good news” but warning that more urgent assistance was still needed, particularly in air defence.
“One: good news, more money coming in to support Ukraine in the war effort, but we still need more,” he said. “Particularly, we need interceptors. We need the ammunition to make sure Ukraine can stay strong in the fight.”
During the exchange, he also rejected suggestions that Russia was winning in Ukraine, claiming Moscow’s progress was slow and coming at a heavy cost. “What I will also be doing today and tomorrow is make clear that the Russians are not winning this,” he said. “This so-called Russian bear is not there.”
Rutte described Russia’s battlefield movement as sluggish, while pointing to what he claimed were high monthly casualty figures. “It is basically the stilted speed of a garden snail what we are seeing in Ukraine,” he said. “Staggering losses, tens of thousands a month. 35,000 deaths in December, 30,000 deaths in January.”
He argued that Ukraine was making effective use of Western support, reinforcing the case for sustaining military assistance. “We have to keep Ukraine strong, because what we see is that they make the best use of our support,” he said.
Responding to questions about whether Europe could become militarily independent from the United States, Rutte said NATO’s core strength remained the transatlantic partnership, while acknowledging that allies were moving toward a more European-led model. “I think we all agree in NATO that we should stick together, the US and European and Canadian NATO,” he said. “But having said that, we also all agree that NATO should be more European-led.”
He cited Germany’s increased spending and deployments, alongside European purchases of US equipment for Ukraine, as evidence of that shift.
“We have seen, for example, Germany doubling his defence spending… A clear example of Europe stepping up,” he said, adding that Europe’s expanded role would develop gradually. “We will do this step-by-step, in close conjunction with United States, based on the defence planning process we have.”
Rutte also addressed a question on the reported deployment of Russian ballistic missile systems in Belarus, using it to reiterate the urgency of providing Ukraine with interceptors and counter-drone capabilities. “This is reason why I’m saying here today and tomorrow… we need to do even more,” he said. “Because when it comes to the interceptors to take out missiles… we need the counter drone technology.”
He said NATO allies should also expand cooperation with Ukraine’s defence industrial base, while continuing to rely on US-produced systems purchased through multinational funding mechanisms. “Making use of this essential gear coming out of the US, including, of course, PURL… which only the US can provide, paid for by Allies and partners,” he added.

Russia calls for exclusion of Europe from upcoming Ukraine peace talks

The Kremlin has clarified that the upcoming round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine in Geneva, Switzerland, will be held strictly in a trilateral format, excluding any European representatives.
"No, it's only a trilateral format, meaning Russia, America, and Ukraine. There won't be any Europeans there," Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday in a briefing, dismissing the possibility of involvement of the EU or international organisations.
The talks, scheduled for Feb. 17-18, were previously confirmed by Peskov as the next step in a mediation process facilitated by Washington.
He added that Russia's delegation at the upcoming talks will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.
Russia and Ukraine held two rounds of US-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, in January and earlier this month. As a result, they agreed to the first exchange of war prisoners in five months.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said that once the conflict in Ukraine is settled, Europe will need to establish a new framework for living alongside Russia to prevent any future military escalation.
"If we reach a settlement on Ukraine, we will still have to contend with an aggressive Russia," he said at the Munich Security Conference. "We will have to define rules of coexistence that limit the risk of escalation."

Arundhati Roy boycotts Berlin fest premiere of her revamped 1980s cult classic – the film shows why

Arundhati Roy boycotts Berlin fest premiere of her revamped 1980s cult classic – the film shows why
Indian writer Arundhati Roy on Friday said she was withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over the jury president’s Gaza remarks. The award-winning author and activist was set to attend the world premiere of a restored version of 1989 cult classic “In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones”, which she wrote and starred in. The film provides hints of her unflinching courage, 37 years after its release.
Late one night in 1989, Indian audiences watching the national TV station were captivated when a film, the likes of which they had never seen, suddenly appeared on their screens.
The main actress in the film, "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", had an impish face dominated by expressive, kohl-lined eyes, and she carried herself with an insouciance that was thrilling. She was also the screenwriter of the peculiarly titled film, the maverick responsible for dialogues featuring a mix of Hindi and English (or “Hinglish”), the patois of millions of educated urban Indians that was never deemed worthy of cinematographic attention.
“Arundhati Roy”, read the credits, an unknown name across the country back then. But her writing, as discerning viewers could tell, was electrifying.
The film is based on Roy’s student days at New Delhi’s School of Planning and Architecture. And while it’s fiction, there’s little doubt that Radha is a young Roy, displaying all the creativity, sharpness and courage that has marked her work as a writer and activist.
Eight years after the film's TV broadcast, Roy's novel, "The God of Small Things", won the Booker Prize. In addition to her writing, her fearless activism, run-ins with India’s Supreme Court, headline-grabbing jailing, and an array of awards made Arundhati Roy an international household name. Her latest memoir, "Mother Mary Comes To Me", hit bestseller charts in several countries and has been widely hailed by critics.
But the first film Roy ever wrote simply disappeared from the public eye. "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones" won two National Film Awards when it was released in 1989, but there were no cinema screenings. In cinephile circles, it was assumed that the original 16mm film had gotten lost. That never diminished the movie’s popularity, instead helping propel it to cult film status. In the pre-internet era, video cassette (VHS) recordings of the original TV broadcast began to circulate. They were copied, borrowed, watched and rewatched until their degrading resolution made viewing virtually impossible.
The low-budget film had a scruffy, grainy quality which suited the story about student life at a Delhi architecture school in the 1960s. But before YouTube appeared and copies of the film were posted online, watching "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones" required dedication.
Now, 37 years after its TV release, "Annie" – as it’s fondly known in cinema circles – has been restored and is having its world premiere at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival under the Berlinale Classics section on Monday, February 16.
Roy was supposed to attend the premier. But on Friday, the Indian author and peace activist suddenly announced that she will not be attending the Berlinale due to the festival jury’s comments regarding the war in Gaza.
On Thursday, Berlin Film Festival jury president Wim Wenders was asked about Germany's support for Israel despite accusations of genocide in Gaza. "We have to stay out of politics," the celebrated German director replied.
In her statement, Roy noted that, “What has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel. It is supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries in Europe,” she said. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”
Roy has never shied away from taking positions, criticising governments, institutions and individuals when they fail to stand up for human rights.
Traces of her unflinching courage are visible on screen in the first film she wrote and starred in 27 years ago.
‘This year’s bleeding-heart thesis’
Directed by Pradip Krishen, Roy’s longtime partner, the film tells the story of Anand “Annie” Grover – a hopelessly idealistic student at a state architecture institute who keeps on failing his final academic year.
Roy plays Radha, a non-conformist student thumbing her nose at societal norms requiring Indian women to be chaste, helpless and polite. She’s not afraid to take on authority, letting professors know exactly what she thinks of them and the commercial business of architecture. When the school’s principal, Yamdoot, dismisses her final project idea as, “This year’s bleeding-heart thesis” that is of no interest to the jury, she cheekily asks him if it’s because her thesis “questions the basis of their existence? Or your existence?” She also steals his cigarettes – and enjoys them.
In her memoir, "Mother Mary Comes To Me", Roy devotes an entire chapter to the film, which marked her debut as a writer. “We called it 'In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones'. In Delhi University slang, ‘giving it those ones’ meant ‘doing one’s usual shit’,” she writes. “It was never meant to be anything more than fun, fringe cinema. But when it finally showed on Doordarshan [India’s national TV channel], it got an audience of millions, which would otherwise have been impossible for a film like 'Annie'.”
"Annie" captures the zeitgeist of its time – the impact of which is felt to this day, particularly in a generation and segment of the Indian population that continues to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist policies. Roy is a vocal critic of the Modi administration’s assaults on human rights, free speech and secular principles.
In its form and content, "Annie" has all the makings of a cult film classic. “The film is honest in intent and execution, unafraid to poke fun at pretentiousness and authority, filled with lovable and relatable characters,” said Nandini Ramnath, a film journalist at Scroll India. “'Annie' was also quite pathbreaking in using the Indian English idiom. Here were students who looked and sounded like the film's viewers. They didn't sound like leftovers of British colonial rule. They didn't sound like they were parodying the language. Roy simply put into dialogue what she was hearing. Plus, she had and continues to have a great sense of humour, which courses through the film.”
Boxes of film history and a negative in archives
The film restoration chapter began a few years ago, when Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, founder-director of the Film Heritage Fund, a Mumbai-based NGO, heard that "Annie"’s director Krishen wanted to donate his film material. Following his years as a filmmaker, Krishen turned his attention in the 1990s to ecology and is now a leading Indian naturalist and environmentalist.
When Dungarpur flew to New Delhi to meet Krishen, he was shown a treasure trove of film history. “All these boxes were lying with all that material,” he told FRANCE 24 in a phone interview from the Berlin Film Festival days before the premier. “We started going through the scripts, photographs, notebooks, all the documentations, clapboards… and the original script of 'Annie' – not the one Arundhati wrote, which she has, but Pradip’s original script,” he noted.
While the low-budget film was shot in 16mm, Dungarpur was given a 35mm copy of the original. “When I went back, I started seeing the film on the rewinding table, and those images, the film, everything just kept coming back to me. The print didn't look that great, and I said, what about the negative?” he recounted.
When Dungarpur called Krishen, he was informed that the 16mm negative was sitting in the National Film Archive of India, and no one had any idea about its state. The Film Heritage Fund got the negative out of the archive and watched it with trepidation. “It was damaged a bit, the colours had faded, there were scratches, the sound was a mono sound. We knew that there was a lot of work on the restoration, a lot of tedious work, and I then decided that I must restore this film,” said Dungarpur.
A filmmaker himself, Dungarpur understood the cultural value of the project when he got down to the restoration work. It took a year and a half to complete, including work done at Italy’s L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in Bologna. “We had to do colour corrections, the subtitles had to be done because the subtitles have to be correct, and it was just one thing after the other,” he explained.
The effort was worth it, according to Ramnath. “What is nice about the restored 'Annie' is how it captures the original's graininess, the seedy interiors of the college hostel, the general cheerful chaos of the student dorms while also being sharper and brighter,” she noted.
For Dungarpur, it was a labour of love. “Whenever you restore any film, the first thing you want is that people see it,” he said. “You want the younger generation to see it, to discover it.”
The generation of "Annie" fans who watched the original 1989 broadcast have long acknowledged that the film is a record of a more tolerant time in India. They once believed it was a niche film, set in a specific context for a specific audience. But as cultural borders blur and the world enters a more divisive era, perhaps "Annie" has one of those for everyone.

Senators urge Trump to scrap social media vetting for foreign tourists

WASHINGTON, Feb 13 - Two Democratic senators urged the Trump administration on Friday to abandon a proposal to require millions of foreign visitors to provide social media handles used over the past five years.
The proposed policy from U.S. Customs and Border Protection would require travelers from countries in the visa waiver program to submit the social media data.
"By requiring travelers to disclose their personal social media information, CBP will force people who simply want to visit family in the United States, conduct business with U.S. companies, or attend events such as the upcoming World Cup to submit to sweeping digital surveillance," said Senators Ed Markey and Ron Wyden.
"No doubt many Americans would be outraged if countries such as Great Britain, France, or Australia imposed a similar policy on American tourists."
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately comment. In December, the department said the proposal could take effect as early as this month.
Earlier, a group representing the U.S. travel and tourism industry warned the proposal could have a "chilling effect" on visits to the United States. "If we get this policy wrong, millions of travelers could take their business and the billions of dollars they spend elsewhere, only making America weaker," the U.S. Travel Association said.
Applicants for immigrant and non-immigrant visas have been required to share that information since 2019.
Washington has taken steps to tighten vetting of foreigners, stemming from a Trump executive order issued in January 2025 calling for visitors to the U.S. to be "vetted and screened to the maximum degree."
The visa waiver program allows travelers from 42 countries, mostly in Europe, to visit the U.S. for up to 90 days without a visa. They must complete an Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) form, which under the change would require social media handles.
The U.S. is considering requiring all email addresses used over the last 10 years and names, birth dates, residences and birthplaces of parents, siblings, children and spouses.
The U.S. State Department in December said it was requiring all H-1B applicants and their dependents to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media profiles to "public" in order for the department to review social media posts by applicants. REUTERS

US judge orders Trump administration to facilitate deported college student's return
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BOSTON, Feb 13 - A U.S. federal judge on Friday ordered the Trump administration to facilitate the return of a Honduran college student who was deported in violation of a court order, a step the government had previously refused to take.
Boston-based U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns gave the administration two weeks to enable the return of Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a student from Babson College in Massachusetts who was deported after being detained at Boston's Logan Airport while traveling to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family in Texas.
"Wisdom counsels that redemption may be found by acknowledging and fixing our own errors," Stearns wrote. "In this unfortunate case, the government commendably admits that it did wrong. Now it is time for the government to make amends."
Stearns, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, said he had hoped to avoid holding anyone in civil contempt by giving the administration a chance to correct what it called a "mistake."
But the State Department last week called the judge's recommendation to issue her a new student visa "unfeasible," and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement declined to facilitate her return, prompting Friday's order.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, and Lopez Belloza's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The 20-year-old college freshman is a Honduran national who was brought to the U.S. by her mother, who was seeking asylum, when she was 8 years old. Babson is located in Wellesley, Massachusetts.
Lopez Belloza has said she was unaware she was subject to a final order of removal, which was the basis for her arrest.
She was flown to Honduras on November 22 even though her lawyer had secured a court order in Massachusetts on the previous day barring Lopez Belloza from being deported or transferred out of the state for 72 hours. She remains in Honduras with her grandparents.
A lawyer for the government at a hearing last month apologized for the violation of the court's order, attributing it to a "mistake" by an ICE officer who did not properly flag it. REUTERS

Don Lemon pleads not guilty to church protest charges as crowd at court chants ‘Bondi has got to go!’
Lemon and eight others are charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act

Journalist Don Lemon pleaded not guilty Friday to federal civil rights charges stemming from a church protest he was covering in Minnesota.
Lemon, a former CNN host turned independent journalist, did not speak to reporters as he entered the courthouse in St. Paul accompanied by his attorney, Joe Thompson.
Roughly two dozen protesters stood outside the building chanting “Pam Bondi has got to go” and “Protect the press."
Lemon says he was acting as a journalist when anti-ICE protesters stormed a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor.
Four other people are also set to be arraigned in the case. Also scheduled for arraignment Friday is civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong.
The prominent local activist was the subject of a doctored photo posted on official White House social media that falsely showed her crying during her arrest.
The picture is part of a deluge of AI-altered imagery that has circulated since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.
Two more defendants accused in the protest at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul are scheduled for arraignment next week, including another independent journalist, Georgia Fort. Nine people have been charged in the case.
Protesters interrupted a service at Cities Church on Jan. 18 by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,” referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last month. Lemon has said he is not affiliated with the group and that he was there as a journalist to chronicle the event for his livestream show.
“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now. In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable,” Lemon told reporters after his arrest.
The church protest drew sharp complaints from conservative religious and political leaders. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned in a social media post: “President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship.”
Even clergy who oppose the administration's immigration enforcement tactics expressed discomfort.
All nine are charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits interference or intimidation of “any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.” Penalties can range up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.
Thompson is one of several former prosecutors who have left the Minnesota U.S. Attorney's Office in recent weeks citing frustration with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown in the state and the Justice Department’s response to the killing of Good and Pretti.
One of four lawyers registered to represent Lemon, Thompson had led the sprawling investigation of major public program fraud cases for the prosecutors office until he resigned last month. The Trump administration has cited the fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown.

Shelly Desai, the character actor best known for his appearances on the hit sitcom It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, has died. He was 90.
The Mumbai-born actor earned over 90 screen roles, including the Ray Romano-led drama Men of a Certain Age.
His death was announced on Facebook by his stepdaughter, Dawn Lerman Vaccaro, who wrote: “The kindest person in the world passed away today. I am beyond heartbroken. He was my mother Phyllis's husband, soul mate , my stepfather, my kid’s grandfather and my cheerleader for all my creative projects.”
She added: “Besides his friends and his family, the thing he cared most about was acting and charity.”
In a follow-up post, she added: “He was that guy if you watched enough TV, films, or plays, you saw him — and said it: “Oh, that guy.” With over 92 credits, he was a completely memorable character actor who could walk into a scene, raise one eyebrow, and suddenly everyone else had to work harder.

Another fast food chain plans to close hundreds of locations across US
- Fast-food giant Wendy's is undertaking a significant restructuring, including the closure of hundreds of its US restaurants.
- The company plans to shut between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of its US outlets, equating to 298 to 358 locations, in the first half of this year.
- This strategic shift follows a disappointing fourth-quarter performance, with global same-store sales plummeting by 10 per cent.
- Wendy's aims to attract 'inflation-weary customers' by intensifying its focus on value deals, such as the new permanent 'Biggie Deals' menu.
- Despite challenges, the company projects global systemwide sales to remain flat this year, and its shares rose by nearly 5 per cent following the announcement.

Trump planning to shake up RFK Jr’s leadership team to promote his healthcare priorities before midterms: report
The reported leadership shuffle includes an official leading the administration’s Minnesota fraud crackdown
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Trump administration is reportedly looking to change up the top leadership at the Department of Health and Human Services ahead of the midterms.
HHS Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill and General Counsel Mike Stuart are expected to leave their roles, Politico reported.
The changes are part of an attempt at “muscling up the management team” to emphasize President Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s signature Make America Healthy Again policies, such as rolling out new healthy-eating guidelines and reducing drug prices.
“What basically happened was that HHS Secretary Kennedy, and also the White House, realized that we want to be most efficiently and most effectively implementing that policy and moving the needle on these issues that we see as very clear and unambiguous wins for us,” a White House official told the outlet. “And obviously the polling and such is very clear on these topics as well.”
The administration reportedly saw O’Neill as a poor communicator who hadn’t found his fit within HHS, an insider told CNN.
Both officials are reportedly expected to be offered other jobs within the administration.
O’Neill, currently Kennedy’s second in command at HHS, has been attached to some of the administration’s more divisive health policy moments.
The official, who does not have a formal medical or public health background, took over as interim leader of the Centers for Disease Control after the August ouster of Dr. Susan Monarez, who said she was pressured to pre-approve controversial vaccine recommendations and fire career scientists.
More recently, O’Neill has been one of the public faces of the administration’s attempt to freeze child care funding to states in the wake of a conservative influencer’s allegations of mass fraud at day care centers in Minnesota.
GOP insiders reportedly see so-called MAHA voters as a key voting bloc ahead of the midterms and want the administration to emphasize its more palatable health goals, like healthy eating, rather than Kennedy’s more divisive vaccine skepticism.
"While the MAHA agenda is broadly popular in the area [of] food and agriculture, vaccine skepticism stands as an outlier, rejected by most voters even within the MAHA movement," according to a recent memo obtained by Axios regarding polling of voters in competitive House districts.

AOC says Trump is ‘tearing apart transatlantic partnership’ between US and Europe
The congresswoman said that the U.S. president is looking to command the western world ‘as his personal sandbox’
- Bookmark

US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said that President Donald Trump’s administration is “tearing apart the transatlantic partnership” as its relationship with Europe remains strained.
The New York Democrat, who is a potential 2028 presidential candidate, told the Munich Security Conference: “President Trump has withdrawn from and is looking to withdraw the US from the entire world and turn into an age of authoritarianism to carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the western world and Latin America as his personal sandbox."
Speaking alongside other world leaders, including Czech president Petr Pavel, Ms Ocasio-Cortez called for a return to “rules-based order” and to address hypocrises.
She said: “I think this is a moment where we are seeing our presidential administration tear apart the transatlantic partnership, rip up every democratic norm, and … really calling into question, as was mentioned by Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum, the rules based order that we have, or, question mark, do we have?
“But that does not mean that the majority of Americans are ready to walk away from a rules-based order and that we’re ready to walk away from our commitment to democracy.
“I think what we identify is that in a rules-based order, hypocrisy is vulnerability.”
Taking direct aim at Trump’s record during his first year in office of his second term, she referenced his threats to Denmark and his recent capturing of Venezuela’s president Nicolas Maduro.
She said: “And so I think what we are seeking is a return to a rules-based order that eliminates the hypocrisies … when, too often, in the West, we’d look the other way for inconvenient populations to act out these paradoxes, whether it is kidnapping a foreign head of state, whether it is threatening our allies to colonise Greenland, whether it is looking the other way in a genocide.
“Hypocrisies are our vulnerabilities and they threaten democracies.
“And so I think many of us are here to say we are here and we are ready for the next chapter, not to have the world turn to isolation, but to deepen our partnership on greater and increase commitment to integrity to our values.”
Europe has been left reeling from Trump’s more aggressive foreign policy in his second term, forcing a reassessment of global alliances. This has included threats of annexing Greenland, the resource-rich island which is part of Denmark (a Nato member), while his representative at peace talks between Ukraine and Russia – Steve Witkoff – has consistently taken Moscow’s side.
US vice-president JD Vance’s criticism of European countries, including the UK, over free speech and immigration last year set the tone for a dramatic deterioration in relations, which has also seen multiple threats of tariffs on the EU bloc.
It follows comments from California’s Democrat governor Gavin Newsom earlier on Friday, who told the conference that Trump is “doubling down on stupid”.
Mr Newsom, who is also said to have presidential ambitions and has been in a long-lasting dispute with Mr Trump, said: “Never in the history of the United States of America has there been a more destructive president than the current occupant in the White House in Washington, DC.”
In a conversation that was largely focused on climate change, he said that Trump “is trying to recreate the 19 century.”
“We’re proving at scale that we can implement, we can compete and we can dominate, but Donald Trump is trying to turn back the clock.”
He added:“I hope, if there’s nothing else I can communicate today, Donald Trump is temporary. He’ll be gone in three years.”
He also called on other world and corporate leaders to “call out” the U.S. president, stating: “We’re all becoming Chamberlains in this place, corporate leaders have to stand up.”
Sir Keir Starmer will address the conference on Saturday morning and take part in a moderated conversation titled “Principled and pragmatic: wielding power in a world in disarray” with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
He is expected to call for the bloc to move away from its over-dependence on Washington, while his German counterpart, Freidrick Merz, said that the United States’ “claim to leadership is disputed, perhaps squandered”.

Zelenskyy Meets Son Of Iran's Last Shah In Show Of 'Support'
Unknown

MUNICH -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has met Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran -- an extremely rare meeting at such a level for the former crown prince who is one of many figures vying for prominence among the fractured Iranian opposition in exile.
The meeting took place on February 13 during the Munich Security Conference, where Zelenskyy will deliver a major speech and is holding a series of meetings with foreign leaders.
Pahlavi is not reported to have any similar meetings in Munich planned.
'It's From The Heart'
Video shot by Ukrainian public TV showed the two men shaking hands in a wood-paneled room and then sitting at a table. Pahlavi thanked Zelenskyy for voicing support for Iranian protesters during his speech at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
“Sometimes [it is] very important to give strong support in time, when it's important, not after,” Zelenskyy said. “It’s from the heart.”
Security forces killed thousands of people during mass protests in Iran in January, according to reports, prompting strong condemnation from Washington and its allies.
This includes Zelenskyy, who in January declared that “every decent person on this planet sincerely wishes that the people of Iran would finally be freed from the current regime, which has brought so much evil to Ukraine and other countries."
Zelenskyy was clearly referring to Iran’s support for Russia’s war effort, notably through the supply of Shahed attack drones that have caused widespread death and destruction in attacks on civilian targets across Ukraine.
But while the United States has supported Iranian protesters, it has not endorsed Pahlavi or any other leaders in exile -- although Pahlavi has repeatedly called for intervention in Iran by US President Donald Trump.
For Pahlavi, the meeting with Zelenskyy may be a way to try to boost his chances of gaining wider international recognition. Over the last three years, he has met lawmakers from some Western European countries.
In January, Trump said Pahlavi "seems very nice." But the US leader also expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.
Shortly before Pahlavi met with Zelenskyy, there was a small but vocal demonstration outside the conference center by a rival opposition group, the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which denounced both the current Iranian authorities and the idea of monarchist rule.
Speaking to Zelenskyy, Pahlavi said the situation in Iran was similar to that faced by Ukraine -- which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022.
“We have pretty much the same predicament,” he said, “fighting for independence and sovereignty.”
US Strike Force
US naval forces remain poised within striking distance of Iran in one of the biggest US military buildups in the region in years. Trump has voiced support and encouragement for Iranian protesters and signaled that US forces might intervene to protect them.
However, talks between US and Iranian negotiators appear to be more focused on other issues, such as Iran’s nuclear and missile programs, and its network of proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen.
The Iran talks and the prospect of US military action is a major topic of discussion here at the Munich conference.
“I don't have much hope for diplomacy to the extent that it ends up curtailing Iran's nuclear program while continuing to give them access to some level of enrichment,” US Senator Chris Murphy (Democrat) told RFE/RL.
“Why did he throw out the agreement that did exactly that?” he asked, referring to a nuclear deal agreed upon during the Obama administration that Trump withdrew from during his first term of office.
Later, during a panel discussion, US Senator Lindsey Graham (Republican) said the dispute is not just about the nuclear program, missiles, or proxies.
“President Trump gave an answer, [saying to Iranians] keep protesting, help is on the way. And a couple of days later, he said, it's time for new leadership in Iran because the ayatollah and his crowd, they're bad guys, they're terrible guys. You put all three of those statements together then what do you have? You have a president standing with the people,” he said.
“I am confident that President Trump will get an outcome consistent with those three statements through diplomacy or military force,” Graham added.

Three costly retirement regrets in your 70s and 80s - and how to avoid them

Three costly retirement regrets in your 70s and 80s - and how to avoid them
‘Having a comprehensive plan is rarely something anyone regrets,’ one expert said
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
For all the planning that comes with retirement, certain decisions can fall through the proverbial cracks.
When those cracks widen to a financial gap in retirement for those in their 70s and 80s, regret over missed opportunities can emerge. Instead of enjoying time with grandkids or pursuing travel dreams, retirees may have to work through a maze of tax regulations and income possibilities, for example, to bridge the gap created by choices made (or not made) decades ago.
“Having a comprehensive plan is rarely something anyone regrets,” Virginia-based financial adviser Jeffrey B. Smith, owner of retirement planning firm The Retirement Smith, said in an email to The Independent. “Not having one almost always is.”
The Independent spoke with several financial experts to learn which regrets are common among retirees in their 70s and 80s and how to avoid them.
Not planning for incapacitation
The financial and personal implications of death tend to be front-of-mind for retirees but not what might happen if they become so ill they can no longer make decisions. And when they lose agency to an illness or accident, regret surges, said attorney Lisa McCurdy, CEO of estate and asset protection law firm The Wealth Counselor.
“When no one has been legally appointed to make financial or health care decisions on your behalf, and you lose cognitive ability or become incapacitated, your family is left scrambling,” McCurdy told The Independent by email. “That regret is profound, and it's entirely preventable.”
To prevent this, those looking toward retirement or who are already retired and healthy should assign two legal documents: a durable power of attorney for finances and a healthcare power of attorney or advance medical directive.
The former lets you choose a trusted person to manage your finances if you’re incapacitated, and the latter lets you choose someone to make decisions about things such as medical procedures, medications, authorize medical procedures, approve medications and direct how funds are spent for long-term care, McCurdy said.
“Doing this while you have full capacity means you choose the decision-makers, not a courtroom during a crisis,” she said.
Not saving enough
While the average retiree believes they need more than $800,000 to retire comfortably, they typically only have around $290,000 set aside for their golden years, according to a survey from Clever Real Estate. That disparity is indicative of one of the biggest regrets that certified financial planner Shelby Rothman, owner of wealth management firm EnJoy Financial, sees frequently among her clients.
“Clients often regret not saving enough money for retirement and focusing on short-term goals, like buying a house or starting a family, early in their lives,” she told The Independent by email. “Retirement sneaks up on them and they don’t have enough income for retirement.”
What makes the savings situation even more difficult is that those who realize the shortfall in their 70s and 80s can’t really make up for the lost savings. There just isn’t enough time for compound interest to build in any new savings contributions, Rothman said.
“It’s not just missing out on the dollars they should have saved, but on the money that money should have made over time, like a negative snowball effect,” she said.
To avoid this regret, people should remember that their Social Security should supplement their retirement funds, not be the only source of income, Rothman said. Second, save as much as you can when you’re young.
“If your employer offers a match on a company 401(k), make sure to contribute enough to receive that match - it’s free money,” she said. “In addition, be consistent with your savings. The longer money is invested, the more opportunity there is for it to grow.”
Not hiring a financial professional
Many retirees don’t hire a financial planner or adviser until years after they should, leaving them with regrets during retirement, Smith said.
“After going through a thorough planning process, I frequently hear, ‘I wish I had done this years ago,’” Smith said. “The clarity, structure and long-term strategy provide confidence that many retirees realize they lacked for decades.”
Avoiding this regret requires dispelling a myth commonly held among future or soon-to-be retirees: that financial planning is something that only rich people do because it’s expensive.
If individuals can overcome that mental hurdle, the decision to pay for a financial planner is well worth the investment. Many times, people hire a planner when something goes wrong, and that’s not always the best timing, Smith said.
“Much like hiring a personal trainer, people often don’t realize the value until there’s a specific trigger - retirement approaching, a market downturn or a major life event,” he said. “Most individuals spend decades working without truly knowing whether they are on track or if the decisions they’ve made will sustain them once the paycheck stops.”

Marine Le Pen's 2027 presidential rivals adjust their strategies to her legal timetable

Politics is about anticipation. In Marine Le Pen's case, her political rivals have all but buried the prospect of her embarking on a fourth presidential campaign in 2027. Rather than wait for what they expect to be an unfavorable ruling from the Paris Criminal Court in the embezzlement case involving alleged misuse of European Parliament funds, they are preparing in advance. The Paris Court of Appeal is due to deliver its ruling on July 7. Le Pen was sentenced in March 2025 to four years in prison, including two suspended, a €100,000 fine and a five-year ban on holding elected office. Since November, she has said she will clarify her political future immediately after the appeal ruling.
On both the left and the right, the Le Pen chapter is already closed. Attention has shifted to RN President Jordan Bardella. "We think she's finished," said Socialist Senator Alexandre Ouizille. "Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Bardella will be the RN's candidate," asserted Xavier Bertrand, one of several presidential hopefuls from the conservative Les Républicains (LR). It is a political burial without ceremony. Bertrand had long considered Le Pen his preferred opponent, always ready to remind people of his victory over her in the 2015 regional elections.

Dubai port giant DP World replaces leader after he is named in Epstein emails

- DP World replaced chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem with Essa Kazim and Yuvraj Narayan as CEO on Feb 13.
- Bin Sulayem's removal followed 'Epstein files' revelations of over 9,400 correspondences with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, sparking condemnations.
- British BII initially suspended new investments with DP World due to the revelations but welcomed the new appointments to continue partnership.
AI generated
DUBAI - Dubai’s DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Feb 13, replacing its former leader Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.
The statement did not mention Mr Bin Sulayem. But his close ties to Jeffrey Epstein were revealed in documents recently released by the US Department of Justice, where he is cited more than 9,400 times – making international headlines and sparking condemnations.
“DP World announced the appointment of His Excellency Essa Kazim as chairman of its board of directors and the appointment of Yuvraj Narayan as group chief executive officer,” the group said, in a statement published by the Dubai media office.
DP World took down Mr Bin Sulayem’s biography from their website shortly after the statement came out.
Described by Jeffrey Epstein as one of his “most trusted friends”, Mr Bin Sulayem was group chairman and chief executive officer of DP World, one of the largest port operators on the globe.
The move to replace him followed a decision on Feb 11 by British government investment institution BII to suspend investments with DP World in view of the revelations.
“We are shocked by the facts emerging in the Epstein files regarding Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem. In light of the allegations, we will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company,” a spokesperson said.
On Feb 13, a spokesperson said: “We welcome today’s decision by DP World and look forward to continuing our partnership.”
BII is an investor with DP World in four ports in Africa.
‘Right hand’
The documents revealed that Epstein and Mr Bin Sulayem maintained regular correspondence from 2009 to 2018, exchanging messages on intimate matters, meetings, introductions and business opportunities.
The mere mention of someone’s name in the Epstein files does not in itself imply any wrongdoing by that person.
The wealthy Emirati businessman was presented at the time by Epstein as “the right hand” of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
The correspondence suggests he visited the US sex offender in his home several times, including on his island.
Mr Bin Sulayem shared very intimate information with Epstein.
He told him details about his relationship with a student at a Dubai university, with whom he described having the “best sex I ever had amazing body” and reported sexual massages he received during a trip to Tokyo.
Their correspondence shows that Mr Bin Sulayem travelled to Israel several years before the United Arab Emirates normalised ties with the country, and that Epstein put him in contact with former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak.
Representative Thomas Massie, who along with Representative Ro Khanna had access to unredacted versions of the files, posted on X a 2009 email exchange between Epstein and a redacted sender discussing a “torture video”.
Mr Khanna then took to the House floor and read the names of six men whose names he said had been redacted, including Mr Bin Sulayem’s.
Mr Massie on Feb 13 posted a tweet referencing Mr Bin Sulayem’s resignation and said: “DOJ redacted information necessary to identify who sent Epstein the ‘torture video email.’ @RepRoKhanna and I first discovered his name and released it Monday. Today he resigns.”
Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor. His extensive ties to the world’s rich and powerful, especially after he was released in 2009, have become politically explosive across the globe.
He died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children in what was ruled a suicide. AFP

Ukraine War Latest: UK to spend $545M on hypersonic weapons after Ukraine battlefield lessons
Key developments on Feb. 13
- Ukraine's battlefield lessons drive UK to spend over $545 million on hypersonic, long-range weapons in 2026
- Using Starlink ruse, Ukrainian cyber forces trick Russian soldiers into revealing positions, donating to armed forces
- 'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture
- Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces release footage of strikes on Russian airfield in Crimea, other targets in occupied territories
- Four injured as Russian strikes target energy infrastructure in Odesa
The U.K. plans to spend 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) on hypersonic and long-range weapons in 2026, drawing on lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Feb. 13.
The announcement comes as the annual security conference opens in Munich, running on Feb. 13–15, with about 50 world leaders and government officials expected to attend, including President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"To meet this new era of rising threats, we need hard power, strong alliances, and sure diplomacy," U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said.
"We can see from the war in Ukraine the decisive impact of long-range precision weapons, so the U.K. is stepping up, investing more than 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) in long-range and hypersonic weapons this year," Healey added.
The planned investments will also support joint weapons projects with France, Germany, and Italy, the statement said.
The Stratus program, a collaboration between the U.K., France, and Italy, is developing a next-generation stealth missile to replace the Storm Shadow. The new missile is designed to "defeat high-value targets, destroy enemy ships, and suppress enemy air defenses," the statement said.
Separately, a joint long-range weapons program between the U.K. and Germany is entering a study phase and will focus on future stealth and hypersonic capabilities.
"Alongside Germany, France and Italy, we will deliver the cutting-edge weapons that will keep the U.K. and NATO safe, boost deterrence, and build a new deal for European security," Healey said.
This year's investment in hypersonic weapons will also cover the development of key technologies, ground and flight testing, and support for academic training, including funding for postgraduate studies, according to the statement.
The U.K. Defense Ministry added that the new domestically produced Deep Precision Strike system, with a range of more than 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), is expected to enter service in the 2030s.
Earlier, the U.K. and other partners announced roughly $38 billion in aid to Ukraine following a Feb. 12 meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in the Ramstein format.
More than $2.5 billion will be allocated for Ukrainian drones, more than $500 million for the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, and $2 billion for air defense, according to Ukraine's Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
Ukraine has long urged its partners to boost support for air defense systems, as Russian strikes on its energy infrastructure have intensified over the past months.

Using Starlink ruse, Ukrainian cyber forces trick Russian soldiers into revealing positions, donating to armed forces
A Ukrainian cyber unit claims it tricked Russian soldiers into revealing their positions and donating money to Ukraine's Armed Forces by pretending to help them reconnect Starlink devices they were using on the battlefield.
Russian forces have long been using unauthorized Starlink access to operate drones and other military equipment in occupied areas of Ukraine, but this was effectively switched off last week after the Ukrainian government, in cooperation with SpaceX, introduced a mandatory registration and "whitelist system.
Monopolizing on Russia's desperation to regain access to a crucial battlefield technology, Ukrainian cyber forces posed as a Russian-linked activation service offering to help restore terminals that had been disconnected under the new registration rules.
The operation was carried out by the 256th Cyber Assault Division in cooperation with the InformNapalm and MILITANT, according to a statement published on social media on Feb. 12.
Russian servicemen were instructed to submit identifying information and the coordinates of their terminals under the guise that the devices would be reactivated through Ukrainian administrative service centers.
The group said they collected 2,420 data packets related to Russian-used terminals and transferred them to Ukrainian law enforcement and defense agencies. According to the statement, the data was provided to authorities "for final transfer into brick mode," referring to the disabling of the terminals.
The group claims the terminals were subsequently deactivated. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.
The group also said it received $5,870 from Russian soldiers seeking to restore connectivity which it is donating to fundraising efforts for Ukrainian drones.
It also identified 31 Ukrainian "traitors" willing to assist Russian forces by registering terminals. According to the statement, that information has been forwarded to Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU).

'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture
President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 13 unveiled the first strike drone produced by a newly launched German-Ukrainian joint venture ahead of the Munich Security Conference, as he said in a statement published on X.
The launch marks the first Ukrainian drone production line in Germany and is part of Kyiv's broader effort to expand arms manufacturing in Europe, as the war with Russia drives sustained demand for unmanned systems.
"Today, I received the first jointly made attack drone. We saw the production line and the first flight of the drone," Zelensky wrote on X.
"This is modern Ukrainian technology. Battle-tested. Powered by AI. It will strike, it will scout, it will protect our soldiers," the president added.
Zelensky, accompanied by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, visited Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI), a joint venture between Germany's Quantum Systems and Ukraine's Frontline Robotics.
During the visit, the Ukrainian-German Linza 3.0 multi-purpose drone was demonstrated and then handed over to Zelensky.
The facility is expected to produce up to 10,000 drones within a year, all of which will be delivered to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, according to the president.
The Linza 3.0 drone, developed by Frontline Robotics, is the latest version of the company's multi-purpose platform. The manufacturer said it features AI-enabled visual-inertial navigation, can carry up to 4 kilograms of payload, operate up to 15 kilometers (9 miles), and can stay in the air for up to 60 minutes.
The parties announced the start of joint production in December 2025, and Ukraine plans to open 10 more joint ventures by the end of 2026, Zelensky said. The president did not specify which countries the ventures would be located in.

Ukraine's Unmanned Systems Forces release footage of strikes on Russian airfield in Crimea, other targets in occupied territories
Ukrainian forces have struck multiple Russian military targets, including an airfield, in Russian-occupied territories over the past two days, the Unmanned System Forces (USF) said on Feb. 13.
Ukraine regularly attacks military facilities in Russian-occupied areas that supply weapons, fuel, and equipment to Russian troops.
The 1st Separate Center of the USF struck on Feb. 12 an airfield in the village of Hvardiiske in Crimea, the Kirova electrical substation in the city of Luhansk, Luhansk Oblast, and a data center in Prymorsk, Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
All targets were struck with mid-range precision weapons and were located in Russian-occupied territories, according to the USF.
Drone operators from the "Kairos" unit of the 414th Separate Brigade, also known as "Madyar's Birds", targeted an ammunition depot near the village of Rozivka in the Russian-occu[ied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast on Feb. 11, according to the statement.
"Systematic strikes on such infrastructure disrupt command and logistics, reducing the Russian army's ability to sustain combat operations," the USF said.

German chancellor Friedrich Merz makes Brexit joke to Starmer at Munich summit
Germany’s Friedrich Merz quipped to Sir Keir Starmer “I hope you don’t mind about the European flag” as they posed for the cameras in front of a row of flags ahead of their meeting with France’s Emmanuel Macron.
The German chancellor made the Brexit-related joke before the trio sat down for talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday (13 February).
The three European powers are known collectively as the E3.
With the media present before their bilateral meeting, Sir Keir warned: “There’s no UK security without European security. There’s no European security without UK security.
“So we have to work together.”

Global: European states must retract outrageous attacks on UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese

Reacting to calls by ministers and officials in France and Czechia for Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, to resign, Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard said:
“It is reprehensible that ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy have attacked the UN Special Rapporteur on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, Francesca Albanese, based on a deliberately truncated video to misrepresent and gravely misconstrue her messages – as is clear from watching her original address in its entirety.
“The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media – as some have done. They must publicly apologize and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation. Their governments must also investigate how this disinformation happened with a view to preventing such situations.
“If only these minsters had been as loud and forceful in confronting a state committing genocide, unlawful occupation and apartheid as they have in attacking a UN expert. Their cowardice and refusal to hold Israel accountable stand in stark contrast to the Special Rapporteur’s unwavering commitment to speaking truth to power.
“The Special Rapporteur’s commitment to objectively investigate facts based on hard evidence and apply international law has been vital in exposing Israel’s ongoing violations of Palestinians’ rights and the complicity of third parties. The calls for her to resign are the latest in a series of alarming personal attacks and attempts to silence her – and must be categorically rejected. This campaign to discredit her only serves as a smokescreen to deflect attention away from Israel’s genocide in Gaza, its system of apartheid and unlawful occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
“Despite a drop in Israeli air attacks and some limited improvements in the cross-border movement of goods and people since the truce in October 2025, there has been no meaningful change in the conditions Israel is inflicting on Palestinians in Gaza and no evidence to indicate that Israel’s intent has changed. The genocide is ongoing.
“Israeli military operations in the occupied Gaza Strip have continued, killing over 590 Palestinians since October 2025. The estimated death toll of Palestinian victims since October 2023 now stands at over 72,000.
Not only does this allow Israel to violate international law with impunity, but it also effectively undermines the integrity of crucial international human rights mechanisms that were adopted to protect us all.
Amnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard
“Israel has also significantly escalated the cruel and unlawful closures that it has imposed on Gaza for over 18 years. Israeli military operations to effectively create a no-go zone across nearly 60 percent of the Gaza Strip have further worsened conditions. In the occupied West Bank, including illegally annexed East Jerusalem, attacks by Israeli forces and state-backed settlers have killed more than 1,100 Palestinians and displaced tens of thousands since October 2023.
“This outrageous injustice persists despite the International Court of Justice repeatedly ordering Israel to take all measures within its power to prevent genocidal acts, and its Advisory Opinion that Israel’s occupation is unlawful and must end as soon as possible. Let’s also not forget that the International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants against Israel’s prime minister and the former minister of defense for war crimes and crimes against humanity.
“Instead of upholding their legal obligations under international law to protect Palestinians, third states have decided at best, to look away, and at worst, to arm the perpetrators of genocide and war crimes while attacking those who tirelessly condemn Israel’s impunity and the material gain to be made by state and non-state actors from supporting Israel’s violations of Palestinians’ rights.
“Not only does this allow Israel to violate international law with impunity, but it also effectively undermines the integrity of crucial international human rights mechanisms that were adopted to protect us all.
“This is a critical moment for humanity, with international law and human rights institutions under attack like never before. The use of misinformation to further delegitimize them poses a profound threat to human rights and the rule of law itself.
“This is the precise moment that states such as Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy should be taking a stand. They must demonstrate their commitment to upholding their legal obligations to stop Israel’s genocide and bring its decades-long international crimes to an end. This means actively supporting UN mechanisms and respecting the autonomy of UN-appointed independent human rights experts. They must act to hold Israel accountable for its ongoing genocide, apartheid and unlawful occupation, rather than joining the shameful bandwagon of weaponizing disinformation against this Special Rapporteur.”
Background
On 7 February, UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, Francesca Albanese, spoke at a forum in Doha organized by Al Jazeera. She said:
“The fact that instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed, given Israel political excuses, political sheltering, economic and financial support […] We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons, we now see that we as a humanity have a common enemy, and freedoms, the respect of fundamental freedoms is the last peaceful avenue, the last peaceful toolbox that we have to regain our freedom.”
These comments were misconstrued as describing Israel as that “common enemy”. Albanese rejected these accusations and clarified her comments on social media that “the common enemy of humanity is the system that has enabled the genocide in Palestine, including the financial capital that funds it, the algorithms that obscure it and the weapons that enable it”.
On 11 February, the French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot made a statement calling for the Special Rapporteur to resign. This was followed by similarly harmful statements from Austrian, Czech, German and Italian ministers.

Peugeot center Odesa Adis-Motor showroom completely destroyed in drone attack – Stellantis Ukraine rep
As a result of a massive overnight drone strike on Odesa on February 13, a fire completely destroyed the building housing the Peugeot Center Odesa "Adis-Motor" dealership, the Ukrainian representative of Stellantis told Interfax-Ukraine.
The representation reported that neighboring dealership centers were also partially damaged, including one representing the Opel brand. In addition, the premises of the paint shop, service center, and office-administrative building were destroyed.
The company added that employees of the Adis Motor automotive complex were present on the premises at the time of the strike but, fortunately, no one was injured.
Efforts are currently underway to document the consequences and assess the damage caused.
According to Stellantis Ukraine, due to damage to the Opel and Peugeot dealership centers, customer service operations will temporarily be carried out at the Jeep Center Odesa Adis-Motor facility.
"The process of organizing the redirection of service operations is currently underway to ensure continuity of customer service for the dealerships," the representation stated.
In Odesa, the Adis-Auto automotive group operated three Adis-Motor dealership centers representing Stellantis brands: Peugeot (opened in 2010), Opel (opened in 2020), and Jeep (opened in 2024).
The Adis Group is an official dealer of Mitsubishi Motors, Peugeot, Opel, Subaru, and Jeep, and also serves as a service partner for Citroën.
The official representative of the Stellantis group in Ukraine, Peugeot Citroën Ukraine, represents the Peugeot, Citroën, Opel, DS Automobiles, and Jeep brands.
As previously reported, on the night of February 13, Russian forces carried out a massive drone attack against Odesa and the surrounding region.
Energy, port, residential, and industrial infrastructure facilities were damaged. The nighttime attack resulted in six people being injured and one fatality.
According to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Odesa Region, the fire completely destroyed the auto dealership.
"As a result of the strikes, large-scale fires broke out at the auto dealership, spreading across an area of 2,000 square meters. Vehicles parked nearby, garage units containing vehicles, and an energy facility that sustained significant damage were all engulfed in flames," the agency said in a statement on Facebook.

Berlin Format supports Ukraine – von der Leyen
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated this on X while participating in the Munich Security Conference alongside other world leaders, Ukrinform reports.
"We reaffirmed our readiness to provide strong security guarantees after the fighting ends, with a crucial US backstop and monitoring role," von der Leyen stated.
She added that at the same time, European, American, and Ukrainian partners have prepared a joint Prosperity Framework, based on reforms, EU integration, and the mobilization of public and private capital.
Europe is also strengthening its direct support for Ukraine, the European Commission President recalled, noting that the EU is finalizing a EUR 90 billion loan to support the functioning of the Ukrainian state, while simultaneously reinforcing air defense systems and boosting defense capabilities.
The EU is also increasing the cost of the war for Russia through a 20th sanctions package, which is expected to be approved soon, she emphasized.
"Our goal is clear: to ensure Ukraine can negotiate peace on its own terms, from a position of strength and with a safe, secure and prosperous future for its citizens within the EU," von der Leyen said.
As previously reported, the 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13 — a leading global forum for discussing key international security challenges.
Up to 1,000 representatives from nearly 120 countries are taking part in the three-day event, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, more than 30 defense ministers, and leaders of over 40 international organizations.
The Ukrainian delegation is headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

The government has left itself almost powerless against Palestine Action
Editorial: While it was always absurd for the home secretary to categorise the direct action group as a terrorist organisation – placing it in the same bracket as Isis and the Provisional IRA – there are better ways for its activists to win the argument than by using violence
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Whatever might be said about the merits of the government’s attempt to outlaw Palestine Action, it has proved to be a humiliating failure in every respect.
The High Court ruling that the proscription of Palestine Action as a “terrorist” organisation is “disproportionate” and in contravention of human rights legislation has left ministers in the worst of all worlds. The government is accused of tyranny, but in fact is also now prospectively unable to control an organisation that has resorted to violent acts, at least against property, and which Jewish communities have found deeply threatening.
Given that two juries have refused to convict Palestine Action activists in high-profile cases where the evidence of wrongdoing has been overwhelming and unchallenged, the situation is clearly a mess.
The home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, says she is “disappointed” by the judges’ decision, but she should not be surprised. She will appeal against the decision, so the ban on Palestine Action remains in place for the time being – but it feels like a dead letter.
Indeed, the Metropolitan Police declined to take the latest bait offered outside the High Court by protesters with placards saying they support Palestine Action. Officers refused to arrest them for the benefit of the television cameras. The police pointed to the “unusual” situation created by the High Court ruling; they are correct that it is unusual, but this is not a convincing reason for failing to uphold the law.
When Ms Mahmood’s predecessor, Yvette Cooper, stood up in the Commons last June to make the case for proscription, she had some reasonable arguments. She was right to say that Jewish communities found some Palestine Action activities “intimidatory and unacceptable”. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has issued a warning that “Palestine Action has repeatedly targeted buildings hosting Jewish communal institutions, Jewish-owned businesses, or sites associated with Israel, in ways that cause fear and disruption far beyond the immediate protest sites”.
We live in a time when legitimate concerns about the behaviour of the Israeli armed forces in Gaza have too easily slid into blaming British Jews for such actions – a classic antisemitic trope, whether conscious or otherwise.
After the Manchester synagogue attack, the Bondi Beach shootings, and other murderous assaults on Jews who have nothing to do with the Netanyahu government, all those who protest the suffering of the Palestinian people have to be especially clear about the peaceful nature and intent of their cause. Those who are pro-Palestine, however that is defined, must never allow their movement to be overtaken or hijacked by anti-Jewish hate.
Sadly, despite Ms Cooper’s honourable intentions, the decision to proscribe Palestinian Action has done nothing to ameliorate this danger.
There is no reason, either, for the government – or the British people as a whole – to accept the destruction of vital and valuable defence equipment as an exercise in freedom of expression. The definition of “direct action” does not include committing vandalism in the pursuit of a political cause.
As Ms Cooper pointed out, Palestine Action does not have the right to attack “key national infrastructure and defence firms that provide services and supplies to support Ukraine, Nato, Five Eyes allies and UK defence”. It is not just property that gets hurt. Last year, a Palestine Action activist was allegedly responsible for breaking a police officer’s spine with a sledgehammer during a raid on premises belonging to an Israel-based defence company. (The jury failed to reach a verdict in that case, and a retrial is pending.)
We are still a democracy, with the ancient right to protest protected by common law, by the human rights convention, and by the safeguard against bad law guaranteed by a jury. There are better ways for Palestine Action to win its arguments than by using violence, as was seen in the general election, when many so-called Gaza independents were elected to the House of Commons. If Palestine Action goes beyond peaceful, noisy protest and resorts to intimidation and violence, then its members should be restrained, as with any other group, through proportionate action by the authorities.
The mistake made by Ms Cooper and the government was to choose the wrong measure to keep the peace so far as Palestine Action is concerned. Despite the violence sometimes deployed, it was always absurd to categorise Palestine Action as a “terrorist” organisation, bracketing it with, say, Isis or the Provisional IRA. It resulted in retired people and wheelchair users, who were obviously not terrorists in any accepted sense of the word, being manhandled by the police for holding up a piece of cardboard with words on it. The law was dragged into farce and disrepute when confronted with a T-shirt proclaiming loyalty to “Plasticine Action”.
There are existing laws and powers that can, and are, used in the case of demonstrations and direct action, including incitement to racial or religious hatred, disorder, criminal damage and grievous bodily harm. If Palestine Action is a more sinister organisation than it appears – as ministers have claimed it to be – but is still not clearly a terrorist one, then a new law should be framed accordingly, and be justified to parliament and the people.
At the moment, the government has left itself practically powerless to deal with Palestine Action, while simultaneously infringing on the common right to protest. Even if the ban is upheld on appeal, juries may still choose to ignore it, and other laws for that matter, and free Palestine Action protesters. On behalf of her government, Ms Mahmood will need to think again about what to put in place of this unenforceable ban.

Bangladesh ends its authoritarian chapter as BNP wins parliamentary majority

The victory won by Tarique Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) was overwhelming. The party won 212 of the 300 seats up for election, guaranteeing it an absolute majority, in parliamentary elections that finished on Thursday, February 12, according to the electoral commission. Meanwhile, Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, made significant gains in a country where 90% of the population is Muslim, securing 77 seats – its best-ever result.
The party leader asked its officials and activists not to hold street celebrations, but instead to offer prayers in mosques on Friday. Rahman, 60, is set to become prime minister after spending 17 years in exile in the United Kingdom. He is the heir to a dynasty that has dominated the country's political scene. His father, BNP founder General Ziaur Rahman, served as the country's president from 1977 to 1981, before being assassinated during a coup attempt. His mother, Khaleda Zia, former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's main rival, was the first woman to become prime minister of Bangladesh in 1991. She was the face of the BNP until her death in December 2025.

Russia and Ukraine to hold more talks in Geneva next week
Trump has given both sides until June to reach deal, but future of Donbas industrial heartland remains a sticking point.
Russian and Ukrainian envoys are set to engage in a new round of United States-brokered talks next week in Geneva as the war approaches the four-year mark with no apparent compromises on territory in sight.
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that the trilateral talks, which follow two earlier rounds in Abu Dhabi, would be held on February 17-18, according to the RIA Novosti news agency.

The new round of negotiations was confirmed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communications adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn.
As fighting continues along the roughly 1,250-kilometre (750-mile) front line, with Moscow keeping up its assault on Ukraine’s power grid and Kyiv launching long-range attacks on war-related targets like oil refineries, the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland remains a major bone of contention.
Russia is pushing for Ukraine to pull out of the fifth of the eastern Donetsk region in the Donbas that it still controls. Ukraine, for its part, has rejected a unilateral pull-back and wants Western security guarantees to deter Russia from re-launching its offensive if a ceasefire is reached.
Zelenskyy said last week that the US had given the warring parties a June deadline to reach a deal, though US President Donald Trump’s previous ultimatums have not resulted in a breakthrough.
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and tens of thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, according to many estimates, making the war Europe’s deadliest since World War II.
Two previous rounds of trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, reportedly focused on military issues, such as a possible buffer zone and ceasefire monitoring.
In the upcoming talks, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s adviser, Vladimir Medinsky, a hawkish ex-culture minister who previously led failed talks in Turkiye in March 2022, is returning to head Moscow’s delegation.
Ukraine’s delegation will again be led by Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council chief, accompanied by Zelenskyy’s chief of staff, Kyrylo Budanov, and a host of other officials.
In advance of the talks, Russian forces continued to carry out air strikes, killing three brothers between eight and 19 years of age in a strike on eastern Ukraine overnight from Thursday to Friday.
In Odesa, one person was killed and six more injured in a Russian strike at the city’s port and energy infrastructure, officials said.
The local governor of the Volgograd region of southwestern Russia said Friday that three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were injured by drone debris from a Ukrainian attack.
Later, two people were killed and three others wounded in a missile attack on the Russian city of Belgorod, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
On Friday, Zelenskyy attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany, where he was due to hold bilateral and multilateral meetings to secure support from allies before the talks.
Speaking in Munich, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was “ready to talk” with Russian leaders, but that Russia was not yet prepared for “serious” peace talks with Ukraine.
He said discussions with Moscow might make sense as part of a broader effort to bring Russia to the negotiating table, following French efforts to urge European leaders to consider resuming dialogue with Putin.
But the Russians “have to concede that they are really willing to talk about a ceasefire and then about a peace plan,” said the German leader.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that the Russians were “not winning [the war] as some are thinking”.
“This so-called Russian bear is not there,” he told reporters. “It is basically still the speed of a garden snail”, adding that Moscow was accruing “very slow, staggering losses”.
In other developments, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha met his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Munich, where the pair “discussed peace efforts and China’s important role in facilitating an end to the war”.
Beijing has said it takes a neutral stance on the Ukraine war, but has been accused by Kyiv and Western allies of providing Russia with crucial support, notably by supplying military components.

Vaping in cars carrying children to be banned in England

03:54:48 KST

Vaping in cars carrying anyone under 18 will be banned in England under government plans to reduce the harm caused by smoking and e-cigarettes.
The move is included in the tobacco and vapes bill, which will also outlaw smoking, vaping and using heated tobacco in playgrounds and outside schools and hospitals.
Smoking in cars containing children and young people up to the age of 18 has been illegal in England since 2015. The new legislation will extend that prohibition to the use of vapes and heated tobacco.
“No child in a playground or hospital patient should suffer because someone else chooses to smoke,” said Wes Streeting, the health secretary.
“Secondhand smoke increases the risk of heart disease and lung cancer and we want to protect children and the sick from harm.”
The Department of Health and Social Care said that the measures it is proposing are needed to protect health given the growing evidence about the dangers of heated tobacco and vaping.
It said: “Evidence is emerging that emissions from heated tobacco and secondhand vapour from vapes pose health risks. At the same time, youth vaping has risen sharply in recent years, raising concerns about nicotine addiction and long-term health effects.”
The bill does not include a ban on smoking outside pubs. It also exempts smoking or vaping in care homes, hospices, mental health hospitals and residential schools.
The measures are subject to the outcome of a public consultation, which launched on Friday and will run for 12 weeks until 8 May.
The health campaign charity Action on Smoking and Health said ministers were right to explore the possibility of outlawing vaping in cars carrying under-18s.
Caroline Cerny, ASH’s deputy chief executive, said: “This consultation, and the wider legislation it is part of, is focused on protecting children. Although exposure to secondhand vapour is significantly less harmful than secondhand smoke, it is reasonable to consider whether steps should be taken to minimise any potential risk – particularly in small, enclosed spaces such as cars where children are present.
“A balance needs to be struck in these regulations between protecting children and ensuring adults who smoke are still supported to switch to vapes. The consultation process should help the government strike that balance.”
Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, said: “People who do not smoke but who are exposed to secondhand smoke can suffer significant harmful effects on their health, including an increased risk of asthma, poor birth outcomes, several cancers, stroke and heart disease.”

Bangladesh nationalists claim landslide victory in first election since Gen Z uprising
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) celebrated a landslide victory on Friday in the first elections held since a deadly 2024 uprising, with leader Tarique Rahman poised to become prime minister.
Election Commission figures said the BNP alliance had won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami alliance, which said Friday there had been "massive irregularities in vote counting" and demanded "redress".
It was unclear immediately what action Jamaat would take.
BNP chief Rahman told AFP two days before polling he was "confident" that his party, crushed during the autocratic 15-year rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina, would regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.
Hasina's Awami League party was barred from taking part.
The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a "historic victory", while neighbouring India praised Rahman's "decisive win", a significant step after recent rocky relations with Bangladesh.
China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.
'Seek redress'
But Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, who had mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign on a platform of justice and ending corruption, told reporters angrily on Friday that his party would "seek redress from the Election Commission".
His party had earlier claimed there were "repeated inconsistencies and fabrications" in the result announcement process.
"Our youths will not spare anybody who attempts to compromise the sacrifices made in July", he said, referring to the 2024 uprising against Hasina.
The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.
Another 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.
Heavy deployments of security forces are posted countrywide, and UN experts warned ahead of the voting of "growing intolerance, threats and attacks" and a "tsunami of disinformation".
Political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600 during campaigning, police records show.
However, after a turbulent campaign period, the vote passed largely peacefully, and a day after the vote, Bangladesh has seemingly reacted to the result so far with calm.
Party workers spent the whole night after voting in front of the BNP offices.
"We will join the nation-building effort led by Tarique Rahman," Md Fazlur Rahman, 45, told AFP. "Over the last 17 years, we have suffered a lot."
Khurshid Alam, 39, a businessman in Dhaka, said: "The promises and aspirations for the next five years made by Tarique Rahman to the people, I hope he can implement them."
'Ended the nightmare'
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who will step down once the new government takes power, has urged all to stay calm.
"We may have differences of opinion, but we must remain united in the greater national interest," he said.
The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led Bangladesh since Hasina's rule ended with her ouster in August 2024.
Yunus said the election had "ended the nightmare and begun a new dream".
Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement decrying an "illegal and unconstitutional election".
Yunus championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Voters in Thursday's election also endorsed proposals in a referendum that included prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence, with 60 percent backing the changes.
Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced "daunting challenges", including "boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process".

Chris Paul, the “Point God” who was a 12-time All-Star selection and two-time Olympic gold medalist, announced his retirement on Friday in the capper of a 21-season career that will surely merit induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame.
Paul made the announcement on the first day of the NBA’s All-Star weekend at the home of the Los Angeles Clippers in Inglewood, California. Paul spent his final season — an abbreviated one — with the Clippers, who sent him home in December and wound up trading him to Toronto earlier this month.
The Raptors knew Paul would never play in Toronto, and that begged the question about whether the Wake Forest legend would try to finish the season with another team in pursuit of the thing he never got — an NBA title.
The answer came Friday. He’s done. He said last summer that he has hated missing events with his children over the last few years, and now he can devote himself much more to his family and other interests.
“It’s time for me to show up for others and in other ways,” Paul wrote on a social media post, announcing the decision.
He strongly hinted earlier this season that this year was going to be his last. Paul was a four-time All-NBA first team selection, and he ranks second in NBA history with 12,552 assists and 2,728 steals. He was the first player to score at least 20,000 points while recording at least 10,000 assists; LeBron James and Russell Westbrook have both since done that as well.
“It feels really good knowing that I played and treated this game with the utmost respect since the day my dad introduced me to it,” Paul wrote. “It was the very first relationship I ever knew.”
Paul played for New Orleans, Houston, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Golden State, San Antonio and the Clippers during his career, spending the last four years with four different teams.
He also was a past president of the National Basketball Players Association — instrumental in getting the league through the bubble season when the pandemic struck in 2020 — and championed the NBA establishing better ties with Historically Black Colleges and Universities.
He’s 15th all-time in regular season games played and 36th in points, was a six-time steals champion, five-time assists champion, a nine-time All-Defensive team pick, 11-time All-NBA selection and was part of the NBA’s 75th anniversary team.
He’s one of six players in NBA history to have reached $400 million in career earnings.
“I’ve been playing basketball since I was 4 years old, and there’s nothing other than my family that brings me more joy than the hard work and all that stuff that goes into it,” he said in 2024. “Yeah, that’s why we get to play a child’s game and say it’s my way of life.”
Paul became arguably the most accomplished player in Clippers franchise history while leading the team to six winning seasons from 2011-17, including the Clippers’ first two Pacific Division titles and three playoff series victories. Paul returned to Los Angeles as a free agent last July, rejoining a franchise where he is loved by fans — but it went bad quickly, and Paul’s last game with the Clippers was Dec. 1.
It turned out to be his last NBA game, period.
“While this chapter of being an ‘NBA player’ is done, the game of basketball will forever be engrained in the DNA of my life, spanning three decades,” Paul wrote. “It’s crazy even saying that!! Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lost of responsibility. I embraced it all.”
Paul is one of seven players to have an NBA career span at least 21 seasons. And he’s already in the Hall of Fame: the 2008 Olympic ‘Redeem Team’ was enshrined as part of the 2025 class. It won’t be long before he goes in on his own as well.

Brazilian au pair gets 10-year sentence for scheme to kill lover’s wife and another man

Brazilian au pair gets 10-year sentence for scheme to kill lover’s wife and another man
Brazilian au pair gets 10-year sentence for scheme to kill lover’s wife and another man
RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — An au pair who schemed with her employer-turned-lover to kill his wife and another man received a 10-year sentence on Friday.
Prosecutors had recommended immediate release for Juliana Peres Magalhães in exchange for her guilty plea to a downgraded manslaughter charge in the February 2023 killing of Joseph Ryan. She testified that she fatally shot Ryan as Brendan Banfield was fatally stabbing his wife, Christine, in the couple’s bedroom.
Instead, the judge delivered the maximum possible sentence to the woman from Brazil.
“I know my remorse cannot bring you peace,” Magalhães said to the victims’ families. “I lost myself in a relationship, and left my morals and values behind.”
Fairfax Chief Circuit Court Judge Penney S. Azcarate showed little mercy.
“Let’s get it straight: You do not deserve anything other than incarceration and a life of reflection on what you have done to the victim and his family. May it weigh heavily on your soul,” the judge said.
Magalhães had remained silent for months before agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors in their case against Brendan Banfield, who was convicted by a jury this month of aggravated murder in the deaths of his wife and Ryan. Prosecutors said they continued their affair for months after the killings.
At his trial, Magalhães testified that she and Banfield, an IRS agent, had created an account in the name of his wife, a pediatric intensive care nurse, on a social media platform for people interested in sexual fetishes. Ryan connected with the account and agreed to meet for a sexual encounter involving a knife.
Magalhães said she and Brendan Banfield took the couple’s 4-year-old child to the basement, and then entered the bedroom, where she said Brendan Banfield shot Ryan and was stabbing his wife in the neck. When she saw Ryan moving, Magalhães said, she fired the second shot that killed him.
She wasn’t arrested until eight months later, and didn’t talk with investigators for more than a year, until she changed her mind as her own trial date approached.
Banfield’s attorney scrutinized the former au pair’s motives during his trial, arguing that she was only saying what prosecutors wanted to hear.
As part of her plea deal, her attorney and prosecutors agreed to end her time behind bars at her sentencing hearing. Chief Judge Penney Azcarate could still reject that agreement. In Virginia, manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.

Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant
Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The Trump administration’s drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities area has been met with relief, but state officials and residents say its effects on Minnesota’s economy and immigrant communities will linger.
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for Operation Metro Surge, which the Department of Homeland Security called its “ largest immigration enforcement operation ever " and touted as a success. But President Donald Trump’s enforcement campaign came under increasing criticism as the situation grew more volatile.
The shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers’ conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
And despite the announced end to the surge, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz urged Minnesotans to remain vigilant and said the damage would be lasting.
“The fact of the matter is they left us with deep damage, generational trauma,” Walz said. “They left us with economic ruin, in some cases. They left us with many unanswered questions.”
The operation leaves a mark
Following the announcement Thursday, some residents held a vigil at a makeshift shrine that went up where Good was shot in Minneapolis.
Mark Foresman, an attendee from the suburb of St. Louis Park, said he is skeptical that the agents will leave.
“The Trump administration has created an atmosphere of distrust for government in general,” he said, suggesting the Trump administration’s tactics seemed designed to sow fear. “They’ve repeatedly been caught in lies.”.
John Schnickel, a local who attended the vigil, disputed Trump officials’ claims that the operation had made Minnesota safer.
“I don’t even want one ICE person here, if they act the way they’ve been acting,” said local attendee John Schnickel. “They talk about how the murder rate is down, and yet they’ve added two people to it,” he said.
Most U.S. adults say they think Trump’s immigration policies have gone too far, according to a recent AP-NORC poll.
Drawdown after improved coordination
Border czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that “extensive engagement” with state and local officials allowed for a formal end to the operation.
Trump shifted his tone and dispatched Homan to reduce tensions after the Jan. 24 killing of Pretti, saying that he and Walz were on a “similar wavelength” after weeks of barbs between the two leaders.
Homan on Thursday highlighted examples of newfound cooperation with state and local entities, including law enforcement being increasingly responsive to requests for assistance and agreements on how jails handle deportable inmates.
But he also said he made various internal changes since arriving, including changing certain personnel, deploying body cameras and making clear that misconduct by immigration officers would not be tolerated.
“There were some issues here. We fixed those issues,” Homan said. “We’ve had great success with this operation and we’re leaving Minnesota safer.”
Immigration enforcement will continue, but with a smaller footprint
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through next week.
Homan said he would be on the ground for a “little longer” and that a small team would facilitate the transition, in part ensuring continuing cooperation from state and local authorities.
He did not specify how many officers would remain, but he said targeted enforcement would continue in the Twin Cities. Todd Lyons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s acting director, said during a congressional hearing Thursday that the agency is still searching for about 16,840 people in Minnesota who have final orders of removal.
Homan also made clear that the administration would continue to deliver on Trump’s promise of mass deportations across the country, and said officers leaving Minnesota will report back to their stations or be assigned elsewhere.
The focus on the Twin Cities, which Trump had pushed for partly because of fraud allegations involving Somali residents, followed increased deployments in big cities and small towns run by Democrats, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans.
Fallout in Congress and the courts
Even as the Twin Cities operation ends, the fallout is ongoing.
The Trump administration is trying to secure votes in Congress to prevent federal funding for the Department of Homeland Security from expiring at the end of the week, as Democratic lawmakers demand restraints on immigration officers following Good and Pretti’s killings.
And there are ongoing federal investigations into the shooting of Pretti.
The effects of the Minnesota crackdown will also continue to play out in court, as federal prosecutors pursue cases against protesters and deportation cases slowly proceed.
A federal judge issued a temporary emergency order Thursday, finding that immigrants detained at a federal building in Minnesota have too many barriers to legal counsel. A DHS spokesperson maintained in a statement that detainees are provided access to phones, adding that the building is a processing facility, not a detention center.
On Friday, former CNN host turned independent journalist Don Lemon and four others were set to be arraigned on federal civil rights charges, accused in a protest at a Minnesota church where an ICE official is a pastor.

Journalist Don Lemon pleads not guilty to civil rights charges in Minnesota church protest
Journalist Don Lemon pleads not guilty to civil rights charges in Minnesota church protest
ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Former CNN host turned independent journalist Don Lemon pleaded not guilty to federal civil rights charges Friday, following a protest at a Minnesota church where an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official is a pastor. Four others also pleaded not guilty in the case.
Lemon did not comment to reporters as he entered the courthouse accompanied by his attorney, Joe Thompson. Roughly two dozen protesters stood outside the building, chanting “Pam Bondi has got to go” and “Protect the press.”
Civil rights attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong was among the defendants to plead not guilty. The prominent local activist was the subject of a doctored photo posted on official White House social media that falsely showed her crying during her arrest. The picture is part of a deluge of AI-altered imagery that has circulated since the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers in Minneapolis amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.
Lemon’s attorney Abbe David Lowell told the judge that she will raise First Amendment issues in the case. The veteran journalist has said he was at the church to chronicle the protest but was not a participant.
Lowell also asked for Lemon’s phone to be returned after it was taken from him during his arrest in Los Angeles. Prosecutors said the phone is in Department of Homeland Security custody, and that the search warrant for it is under seal. The phone cannot be returned until the search process is completed, the prosecutor said.
Two more defendants accused in the protest at a Southern Baptist church in St. Paul are scheduled for arraignment next week, including another independent journalist, Georgia Fort. Nine people have been charged in the case.
Protesters interrupted a service at Cities Church on Jan. 18 by chanting “ICE out” and “Justice for Renee Good,” referring to the 37-year-old mother of three who was fatally shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis last month. Lemon has said he is not affiliated with the group and that he was there as a journalist to chronicle the event for his livestream show.
“I have spent my entire career covering the news. I will not stop now. In fact, there is no more important time than right now, this very moment for a free and independent media that shines a light on the truth and holds those in power accountable,” Lemon told reporters after his arrest.
The church protest drew sharp complaints from conservative religious and political leaders. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt warned in a social media post: “President Trump will not tolerate the intimidation and harassment of Christians in their sacred places of worship.” Even clergy who oppose the administration’s immigration enforcement tactics expressed discomfort.
All nine are charged under the 1994 Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act, which prohibits interference or intimidation of “any person by force, threat of force, or physical obstruction exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.” Penalties can range up to a year in prison and up to a $10,000 fine.
Thompson is one of several former prosecutors who have left the Minnesota U.S. Attorney’s Office in recent weeks citing frustration with the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown in the state and the Justice Department’s response to the killing of Good and Pretti.
One of four lawyers registered to represent Lemon, Thompson had led the sprawling investigation of major public program fraud cases for the prosecutors office until he resigned last month. The Trump administration has cited the fraud cases, in which most defendants have come from the state’s large Somali community, as justification for its immigration crackdown.

Surprise! US Women's Curling team beats Canada for first time at the Olympics ... without knowing it
The U.S. women’s curling team was surprised to learn from AP reporters that their defeat of Canada marked an Olympic first

The U.S. women's curling team was surprised to learn from AP reporters that their defeat of Canada on Friday marked an Olympic first.
“If that's true," caveated Minneapolis native Taylor Anderson-Heide, "I think we just played a really good game. They're No. 1 in the world.”
Tara Peterson, from Shoreview, Minnesota, chimed in: “It just always feels really good to beat (Canada skip) Rachel Homan. So any team to beat them, that’s pretty impressive."
Peterson, like Anderson-Heide, couldn't help but add a qualifier to her response: "Apparently, we’ve never beat them in the Olympics before. That makes it just extra special."
Though the athletes sounded somewhat unsure of AP's intel, it's true. Since 1998, when women's curling was introduced at the Olympics, teams from the U.S. and Canada have played at least once in each games. The U.S. has lost every time.
The U.S. men have beaten Canada, however, notably in the Olympic final in 2018.
Canada’s Team Homan has for years been considered the best in the world.
In Friday’s nail-biting match that went 9-8, the U.S. managed to capitalize on a few weak shots by Canada and clinch the victory. After the win, the Americans walked together down the ice and back to their coaches, raising fists in triumph.
Peterson said she thought the Canadians were less sharp than normal.
This year's American women's curling team — like their Gen-Z men's counterparts — meld approachability with ambition.
Alongside Anderson-Heide and Peterson, the team includes skip Tabitha Peterson, who's Tara's older sister, as well as cool-as-a-cucumber Cory Thiesse, who has already won a silver medal in the mixed doubles event.
Aileen Geving, from Minnesota, is an alternate.
Three of them have jobs other than curling, and three are mothers to young children. Tara's a dentist, Tabitha's a pharmacist and Thiesse a lab technician.
Tara gave birth to her son, Eddie, in September 2024 and a few months later, Tabitha had a daughter, Noelle. Geving had daughter Sienna directly following the 2018 Games.
They have several matches left in the round-robin before the semifinals on Friday. They've won two matches, against Korea and Canada and and lost one, against Sweden.

Rules-based global order no longer exists: German Chancellor Merz

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday that the rules-based international order has eroded, outlining new proposals to confront mounting global instability and geopolitical fragmentation.
In a keynote speech at the Munich Security Conference, Merz said the world has entered a dangerous period of great power rivalries, with a growing number of wars and conflicts threatening global peace and security.
Referencing this year's conference motto, "Under Destruction," Merz cited Russia's war on Ukraine, China's growing assertiveness, challenges to U.S. leadership, and tensions in transatlantic relations as signs of a changing world order.
"The conference’s motto signifies that the international order, which is based on rights and rules, is on the verge of being destroyed. I fear we need to put it even more bluntly: this order-imperfect even at its best-no longer exists in its original form," he said.
"If there was a unipolar moment in history after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is long gone. In any case, the leadership claim of the United States is being challenged, and may already have been lost,” the conservative leader said.
In response to growing unpredictability and threats, Merz said Germany will seek to strengthen the European Union and help build new global partnerships with key actors.
"Great power politics in Europe is not an option for Germany," Merz said, adding that Germany is ready to assume a leadership role in Europe with support from EU partners and neighbors, but has no "hegemonic fantasies” on the continent. "We Germans will never again go it alone. That is a lasting lesson from our history."
In his wide-ranging speech, Merz also addressed recent tensions between U.S. President Donald Trump and European countries. He said Europeans are committed to overcoming these tensions and strengthening NATO to meet the security challenges of the new era.
"In an era of great power rivalry, even the United States cannot go it alone," he said, stressing that NATO membership serves the interests of both Europeans and Americans. "So let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together. We, the Europeans, we are doing our part."

Saudi FM calls for urgent halt to Israel's Gaza killings

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan on Friday called for an immediate end to Israel's killings in Gaza and swift reconstruction of the devastated enclave, saying fatalities have continued despite a cease-fire agreement with Tel Aviv.
Speaking Friday during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, the minister said the cease-fire had failed to end fatalities in Gaza, stressing the need to stop the violence and begin rebuilding the devastated territory.
Prince Faisal also emphasized the need to preserve the unity of Gaza and the West Bank, saying stability in Gaza is essential to that goal. He underscored the importance of addressing Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination.
His remarks come amid heightened tensions in the West Bank, after Israel’s government approved measures on Sunday aimed at changing the legal and civil reality there, including expanding enforcement powers into areas designated as A and B.
An Oct. 10 cease-fire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The U.N. estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Munich is hosting the 62nd Munich Security Conference from Friday through Sunday under tight security, as diplomats describe the current period as the most turbulent since the end of the Cold War, marked by escalating conflicts and growing uncertainty over the future of the global order.

WASHINGTON, February 13. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump said that he intends to visit Venezuela in the future.
"I'm going to make a visit to Venezuela," the White House press pool quoted the US leader as saying.
Responding to reporters’ questions, Trump emphasized that the US has "a very good relationship" with Venezuela's authorized president Delcy Rodriguez. "We are working together very closely," he added.
When asked if the US recognizes Rodriguez as head of state, Trump said: "Well, right now we have done that. We're dealing with them and right now, they've done a great job."
On January 3, the US attacked civilian and military targets in Venezuela. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto said that the US had attacked civilian and military targets in Caracas. He called Washington's actions military aggression. The US later confirmed the strikes and announced the capture and removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife from the country. On January 5, they appeared before a federal court in the Southern District of New York. The couple was charged with involvement in drug trafficking. Neither Maduro nor his wife pleaded guilty. Rodriguez, who served as executive vice president under Maduro, is currently acting as head of state in Venezuela. The US administration has stated that Washington will temporarily take over the administration of Venezuela and expressed confidence that it will obtain compensation for US oil companies from Caracas.

ADL urged Mamdani to disavow ‘Hot Girls 4 Zohran’ co-founder as Brooklyn hire draws fire

03:49:12 KST

The Anti-Defamation League New York/New Jersey escalated its criticism of Zohran Mamdani this week, citing concerns about both a senior Brooklyn appointment and the mayor’s continued proximity to an activist group that helped energize his campaign.
On Thursday, the ADL said Mamdani’s selection of Alvaro Lopez as Brooklyn Borough Director raised “serious concerns,” pointing to a now-deleted social media post and to Lopez’s past activism.
The role is seen inside City Hall as a key liaison post for Brooklyn, home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the US. In the statement quoted by a local New York-area publication, the ADL said the borough includes “approximately 500,000 Jewish New Yorkers.”
The ADL said that on November 3, 2023, less than a month after Hamas and other terror groups abducted 251 people from Israel on October 7, Lopez referred to individuals seen ripping down posters of hostages as “heroes” in a post that was later deleted.
It also said Lopez attended events in 2024 and 2025 that “featured pro-Hamas rhetoric” or explicitly called for Israel’s destruction, and it highlighted his involvement with the Democratic Socialists of America - NYC chapter, which it described as having promoted extreme anti-Israel messaging since October 7.
'Hot Girls 4 Zohran'
In a separate post the same day, the ADL publicly called on Mamdani to distance himself from Kaif Gilani, a co-founder of Hot Girls 4 Zohran, arguing that Gilani had a history of sharing antisemitic content and pro-Hamas rhetoric online, mocking Israeli victims of terror, amplifying conspiracy theories from a Holocaust revisionist, denying sexual violence committed by Hamas on October 7, and calling for Israel’s eradication.
The ADL said the group, now rebranded as Hot Girls Organize, “continue[s] to be embraced by” Mamdani, and asked whether the mayor’s office would “cut ties and disavow” Gilani, as it said the office of Brad Lander had done.
Lander’s campaign said it severed its relationship with Gilani’s firm after reports about the consultant’s social media activity surfaced. In a New York Jewish Week newsletter item published February 11, 2026, the outlet reported that Lander’s team said it was unaware of the account and ended the relationship, with a spokesperson saying the posts did not reflect Lander’s views.
The controversy spilled into state politics this week. A New York Jewish Week roundup reported that after Mamdani testified about the city budget in Albany, he dodged a question about Gilani from Politico, after Jewish Insider reported that Gilani circulated pro-Hamas content and conspiracy theories about Israel.
Mamdani’s office did not immediately respond to the ADL’s latest criticism or to questions about whether City Hall intends to publicly disavow Gilani.

Your Taxes: Israel moves charities online for tax breaks

Charity used to begin at home, but now in Israel, it begins on the home page. As of January 1, the Israel Tax Authority required all charities to move over to an online system of digital donations called “Israel Donations” (Terumot Yisrael). That’s if donors want to continue enjoying a tax break for their generosity. The aim is to stamp out fake donation receipts.
Main tax break
Donations to charities ranging from NIS 207 to NIS 10,354,816 (in 2026) generally confer a 35% tax credit for individuals, or 23% for companies, if various conditions are met. In particular, the charity must be approved by the ITA (under Israel Tax Ordinance Section 46), and the tax break is capped at 30% of taxable income. For example, if you donate NIS 1,000 to an approved charity, your tax bill may go down by NIS 350.
How it works
The Israel Donations system electronically issues the charity a report number to be inserted on each donation receipt in addition to the regular receipt number. The donor doesn’t have to keep the receipt in paper form to claim a tax break.
Instead, starting in 2026, details of each donation reported are immediately stored electronically on the ITA’s system. The donor can access these details in his online “personal area” (Eizor Ishi) in the ITA system.
If you haven’t yet logged onto your “personal area,” you will need to sooner or later. This is how the government now communicates with you without postal delays.
The donor can use the digital donations to claim the charity tax breaks in his or her annual tax return.
But the individual can claim the tax break sooner if: (1) his employer has appropriate payroll software that can handle digital donations and give the tax break on the next monthly paycheck, or (2) when doing a tax adjustment (Tium Mas) if someone has more than one employer.
If the employer has the appropriate software that can handle digital donations, the employee still has to agree to its use. The employer only gets to know how much in total the employee donated, not which charities benefited.
Limitations
Employees cannot claim the tax break for donations over NIS 25,000 per year via their employer. If they do donate more than this amount, they can only claim a tax break for the excess after the year-end on an annual tax return.
If the employer uses a payroll bureau, there are procedures enabling them to provide the charity tax breaks on their software. Only employees designated by the senior management of the bureau can deal with this.
Self-employed freelancers can only claim tax breaks on their annual tax return.
In all cases, donors need to give the identity number to the charity so that they can be credited with each donation in the Donations Israel system.
What the charity should do
To qualify for approval under ITO Section 46 (meaning their donors get tax breaks), charities must register on the Israel Donations system and say which charity personnel are authorized for these purposes.
The new Israel Donations system is available to charities that issue digital donation receipts to named donors whose identity number is known. In the case of charities still issuing paper receipts, another online app can be used to obtain the report numbers for each donation receipt. But this is less recommended, as it involves keying in manually all the donation information into the system. So, charities (local synagogues, etc.) should consider investing in digital-receipt software.
Donations can be in a foreign currency if a special currency code number is added. If donations are by way of standing order, receipts must be issued each year for amounts received in that year. Donations in kind must be marked “in kind.” Donations can be anonymous if marked “anonymous,” but the donor gets no Israeli tax break.
Comment – US olim
The US-Israel tax treaty lets Israeli residents receive both the above 35% Israeli tax credit and a deduction under US law if they are also US taxpayers. This applies to charitable contributions to a charitable organization for US tax purposes that support Israeli causes, i.e., US “Friends of Israel” organizations. The tax break is limited to contributions not exceeding 25% of taxable income from US sources.
Unfortunately, it is not clear whether US olim (immigrants) donating to US Friends of Israel charities can avail themselves of the new Israeli digital donation system.
As always, consult experienced professional advisers in each country concerned at an early stage in specific cases.

Your Investments: The key to responsible planning after receiving an inheritance

So, the Seattle Seahawks won the Super Bowl earlier this week. As a long-suffering Seattle sports fan, it’s nice to win a major sports title. While it’s definitely fun to win, I must admit that while I am a true fan and stay up late Sunday nights/Monday mornings to watch their games, I’m not as emotionally invested as I used to be. What gave me the most joy and feeling of success as a parent was watching the games with my sons while eating wings, hot dogs, some steaks, chips and salsa and onion rings between 2am-4am. While I’m still nauseous from that meal days later, I do feel a sense of pride! The food, along with the game, was a bonding experience.
Earlier this week I sat with a man who received a substantial inheritance. He is retired and his mother passed away at a rather advanced age as you can figure out. He received about $1,250,000. He never had much savings or pension and is living on a small amount of US Social Security and an even smaller amount of Bituach Leumi. After asking some more questions, it became clear that he needs about $30,000 a year in supplementary income.
I mentioned that the amount is doable and that he can have a portfolio where he will be able to take that out and, over time, should be able to even slowly grow the portfolio. Then he threw a wrench into the plan. “I forgot to tell you that I inherited $1,250,000, but I promised my married kids(7) money for a down payment, was thinking about starting a vending machine business and was thinking of buying an investment apartment as well because he only needs to put 10% down. Yikes. That certainly changes things. He literally spread himself too thin and could have potential money problems down the road, especially if he needs to start eating principle from the get-go.
I mentioned that he should scrap the investment property idea. I said that while you only need to put 10% down now, at some point in the not-too-distant future, you need to come up with the rest of the money. That amount, plus the down payment promised to the kids, will wipe you out. And as for the vending machines, I said to just do things by the book and invest in a moderate growth type of portfolio. Keep it simple, don’t fall for some kind of vending machine scam.
I receive calls all the time from heirs. They have come into money and need help planning and managing it. I can tell you that the above story, while maybe a bit extreme, is quite typical. The difference tends to be that the inheritor is thinking about all the things they want to do with the money and the meeting I mentioned actually went ahead and fulfilled his dreams.
An inheritance should be a blessing
Personal finance guru, Dave Ramsey, writes, “Receiving an inheritance from a family member should be a blessing. But too often, it becomes a curse. It’s estimated that $68 trillion worth of assets will pass down from Baby Boomers to younger generations over the next 25 years, and many of those heirs won’t know how to put their inheritance to good use. More than one-third of all inheritors see no change or a decline in their wealth after getting an inheritance.
Did you catch that? Some folks see their wealth decrease after they inherit a financial windfall. We’ve seen too many people get an inheritance and then throw it all away. They go on a few vacations, buy a fancy new car, and before they know it, the money is gone, and they have nothing to show for it.”
When you receive an inheritance, it’s important to take your time before making any decisions. You are in the midst of grieving, and you are overly emotional and not able to make rational decisions. I recommend waiting a couple of months before making decisions. Then, in honor of the deceased, I think it’s a great idea to give some of the money to charity. What better way to honor their name than to help out and give back to society? If you have debt, outside of a mortgage, then pay it off.
You can certainly use some of this money to improve your financial future. Paying down some or all of your mortgage and investing for the long term are two things that you can do today, that will be hugely beneficial down the road.
And finally, there is nothing wrong with enjoying some of the money. Obviously, it depends on your specific financial situation, and how much you have received, but in most cases using some money for a vacation, or the much-needed kitchen renovation is reasonable.
Be smart and deliberate after receiving an inheritance to make sure that you take care of your own financial future before you start promising the world to others. .

An altercation erupted between Palestinians and Israeli settlers around the village of Talfit on Friday morning, Army Radio reported.
According to reports, Palestinians approached an illegal farm established by Jewish settlers on private land in Area B of the West Bank. Police told KAN that dozens of Palestinians attacked the farm, and that two of the settlers required medical attention.
In retaliation, the settlers descended on Talfit, damaging cars and attacking the residents. Locals claim that Hilltop Youth smashed seven cars, and that four people were wounded, including one by gunfire.
The IDF dispersed the chaos and remained in the village. Police opened an investigation, but no arrests have been reported.
Conflicts in West Bank expected to increase
Conflicts between Palestinians and settlers in the West Bank have occurred several times in recent months, and are expected to increase following a court decision on Sunday altering how West Bank land is treated.
Until Sunday, a series of rules were in place requiring additional approvals from the IDF legal division, the Civil Administration, the Palestinian Authority, and others for purchasing or building on land in the West Bank.
On Sunday, the government announced that it was repealing or streamlining many of those rules to make it easier for Jewish Israelis to acquire land in areas where, previously, doing so had been much harder.

DUBAI, Feb 13 - Iran on Friday released on bail three prominent reformist figures arrested last week amid a sweeping government crackdown on dissent, one of their lawyers told the semi-official ISNA news agency.
Lawyer Hojjat Kermani said the freed activists included Azar Mansouri, head of the moderate Reform Front coalition, along with Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh. He said he was not told what charges his clients may face.
The releases come as authorities try to quell the country's bloodiest unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution through a campaign of mass arrests and intimidation.
The U.S.-based rights group HRANA said about 53,000 people have so far been arrested, and the total number of killed had reached 7,008, including 6,509 protesters. Reuters could not independently verify the figures, and Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment. REUTERS

‘They will fire every missile’: Israel braces for worst-case Iran scenario
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

03:45:13 KST

As the diplomatic channel between the United States and Iran continues, Israel is preparing for war. Jerusalem’s red lines are nowhere near Tehran’s, which refuses even to consider limits on its missile program — the same missiles that caused destruction in Israel during the 12-day war.
For Iran, its ballistic missile program is not merely a weapons system but a supreme strategic asset, possibly even more important than its nuclear project, given its proven ability to paralyze Israel’s home front and inflict significant damage despite advanced defense systems. Lessons from the war — in which Israel was forced to manage a “munitions economy” in the face of hundreds of launches, intercepting most of them yet still sustaining heavy damage — reinforced in Tehran the view that Israel is vulnerable to attrition attacks that could deplete its interceptor stockpiles.
Because Iran views its missile array as a primary tool of deterrence and decisive force, intelligence assessments conclude it will not relinquish it even under U.S. pressure in negotiations. That hard line places the region on what officials describe as a collision course — either signing an agreement that leaves Israel exposed to a significant threat, or sliding toward all-out war. In response, Israel’s air defense system — composed of seven battalions deployed nationwide and built around five layers — is preparing alongside the U.S. military, and possibly an international coalition.
Worst-case scenario
Tal Inbar, a senior research fellow at the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, told ynet that Iran’s launch capabilities have not changed significantly from previous attacks, though the regime still possesses dozens of heavier missiles that have not yet been used.
“We have not seen the capability for extremely massive fire — not many hundreds or thousands simultaneously,” Inbar said. “But in a war in which the Iranian regime feels these are its final hours, it will fire everything it has. In such a case, one could imagine strikes even on symbolic targets that are not military.”
He stressed that these are extreme scenarios. “One can assume that if the United States initiates the attack, there would be an operation designed to prevent as much as possible the use of these tools. The U.S. can do things Israel cannot, for example a barrage of hundreds of cruise missiles on various launch sites in Iran. These are things we have not seen before.”
The U.S. 'large armada'
During the most recent confrontation with Iran, the Israel Defense Forces made extensive use of its defense systems. Reports last month claimed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked President Donald Trump to delay a strike on Iran partly due to interceptor shortages. Since then, large American forces have arrived in the region, also to assist with interceptions — despite significant interceptor use in defending Israel in June last year and challenges in replenishing stockpiles.
Israel’s air defense systems are undergoing tests, adjustments and upgrades to address evolving threats. Still, U.S. assistance — providing a broader response to Iranian threats even far from Israeli territory — remains a critical component of the defense array.
As part of coordination between Israel and the United States, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir made a secret visit to Washington about two weeks ago, following visits by Military Intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Shlomi Binder and Mossad chief David Barnea. Zamir met with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine for high-level strategic coordination. Senior American officials have also visited Israel, including U.S. Central Command chief Adm. Brad Cooper. The guided-missile destroyer USS Delbert D. Black docked in Eilat and will continue operating in the Red Sea as part of what Trump described as a “large armada” sent to the region. The deployment includes the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, the USS Gerald R. Ford en route to the Middle East and eight additional destroyers.
According to reports, at least 10 U.S. warships are now in the Middle East. The Lincoln carrier strike group includes the destroyers USS Michael Murphy, USS Frank E. Petersen Jr. and USS Spruance. Other destroyers in the region carry guided missiles capable of neutralizing aerial threats. The Wall Street Journal reported the United States has at least eight destroyers within range to shoot down Iranian missiles and drones: two near the Strait of Hormuz, three in the northern Arabian Sea, one in the Red Sea and two in the eastern Mediterranean.
Fox News identified additional vessels, including USS McFaul and USS Mitscher near the Strait of Hormuz, USS Delbert D. Black, and USS Roosevelt and USS Bulkeley in the eastern Mediterranean.
The Journal also reported that the United States is deploying an additional THAAD battery and Patriot systems at bases where its forces are stationed across the Middle East, including Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Satellite images show an additional Patriot battery positioned at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, a primary U.S. base in the region that was targeted in Iran’s response to strikes on its nuclear facilities in June last year. THAAD systems can intercept ballistic missiles outside the atmosphere, while Patriot systems defend against lower-altitude, shorter-range threats.
Reports say the U.S. has also deployed three squadrons of F-15E fighter jets to Jordan, which could play a role in downing Iranian drones. Those aircraft carried out similar missions during Iran’s first direct attack on Israel in April 2024, in what the U.S. Air Force described as its largest aerial engagement with an adversary in more than 50 years. In addition, six Vermont Air National Guard F-35 jets were recently seen landing in the Azores after being moved from the Caribbean closer to the Middle East. Several U.S. Navy EA-18G Growler electronic warfare aircraft have also relocated from Puerto Rico to Spain in recent weeks.
International coalition expected to assist
During Iranian attacks in April and October 2024, several countries assisted in defending Israel by intercepting drones and missiles and sharing intelligence. The United States, Britain, France and Jordan helped thwart the April 2024 attack. According to the Journal, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other Arab states also took part, quietly sharing intelligence and radar data.
However, during Operation Rising Lion, the international coalition focused more on de-escalation efforts and preventing a broader war, playing a less active role in intercepting launches from Iran. With increased U.S. involvement — and its willingness to lead a strike rather than merely join one — questions remain about how that coalition would respond.
Inbar said past experience demonstrated the effectiveness of regional defense, beginning with detection capabilities largely based on U.S. space assets and the engagement of threats by friendly forces throughout the region. “The coalition and international defense were most evident in the April attack,” he said. “We did not see that in Operation Rising Lion aside from the Americans — and now we may see it again. There is no doubt that if missiles fly that Saudi Arabia or Abu Dhabi can intercept, they will do so.”
He added that in a future confrontation, energy facilities in the Gulf could also come under attack. “If there is a strike, this time they could target assets of value to Iran, such as oil and gas loading terminals or other energy infrastructure not previously attacked.”
First and second layers: accelerated Arrow production
In July last year, following heavy use of Arrow interceptors during the war with Iran, Defense Ministry Director General Maj. Gen. (res.) Amir Baram signed an order to significantly accelerate Arrow interceptor production at Israel Aerospace Industries. The system intercepts ballistic threats outside and at the edge of the atmosphere and defends Israel against long-range strategic threats. Officials describe it as among the world’s most advanced air defense systems.
The Arrow system includes two variants: Arrow 2 and Arrow 3. After long-range ballistic missile launches, the first defensive layer is Arrow 3, a two-stage interceptor that destroys targets at ranges of up to about 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) and altitudes of about 100 kilometers (62 miles) outside the atmosphere through direct impact. U.S. Navy SM-3 interceptors, deployed during Operation Rising Lion, can also intercept missiles inside and outside the atmosphere at ranges of up to about 1,200 kilometers (750 miles).
Missiles that evade exo-atmospheric interception are handled by Arrow 2, the second layer, which intercepts long-range ballistic missiles within the atmosphere at altitudes of up to about 100 kilometers and ranges of up to about 1,500 kilometers. The U.S. THAAD system, if deployed in Israel, can also intercept such threats at altitudes of 100 to 150 kilometers and ranges of up to 300 kilometers, sometimes even during the missile’s boost phase.
Last month, Zamir visited an Arrow battalion, assessed readiness and led a drill simulating a missile attack on Israel.
Third layer: upgraded David’s Sling
Earlier this week, in light of existing and emerging threats, the Defense Ministry completed a series of tests on the David’s Sling air defense system, designed to intercept rockets, missiles, cruise missiles, aircraft and drones. Officials said the tests incorporated lessons from combat and included challenging scenarios.
David’s Sling constitutes the third layer of Israel’s multilayered defense system, after the two Arrow layers. It intercepts medium-range missiles and heavy rockets at altitudes of about 15 to 70 kilometers (9 to 43 miles) and counters cruise missiles through direct impact within the atmosphere. During Operation Rising Lion, it also intercepted missile debris.
Defense officials described the successful tests as another technological and operational leap forward for a system that demonstrated high performance during the war, with successful interceptions that saved lives and prevented heavy damage.
Fourth layer: Iron Dome on land and at sea
The Iron Dome system, which continues to incorporate lessons from the 12-day war, is expected to play a central role in any future confrontation with Iran. It constitutes the fourth layer of Israel’s air defense envelope and intercepts short-range rockets, missiles and mortars at altitudes of about 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles). The system can also intercept threats aimed at populated areas or strategic sites, as well as missile debris and unmanned aircraft.
A battery commander in the 947th Iron Dome Battalion told ynet that current versions of the system have evolved significantly since Operation Rising Lion, with ongoing implementation of lessons learned in what she described as an arms race with Iran.
Alongside the land-based system, the Navy operates a sea-based Iron Dome variant deployed on Sa’ar 6 corvettes. Its first interception occurred in April 2024. The ships are also equipped with Barak missiles that intercept larger and more distant threats. The naval system is designed to protect offshore infrastructure, including gas platforms.
During Operation Rising Lion, another system, Barak MX, joined the defense effort and intercepted dozens of threats from Iran in its early days. The modular, multi-mission system provides sea-to-air and surface-to-air defense against aircraft, helicopters, drones, anti-ship missiles and cruise missiles. It was originally designed to protect naval vessels and strategic maritime assets.
Fifth layer: the laser that changes everything
Less than two months ago, at the end of 2025, Israel delivered for the first time its high-powered laser system, Iron Beam, adding it to David’s Sling, Arrow, Iron Dome and the naval system, as well as Air Force fighter jets and helicopters that have also intercepted drones and cruise missiles.
The Defense Ministry said the laser, developed over more than a decade, proved effective in extensive tests against various threats, successfully intercepting rockets, mortars and drones. Unlike previous systems, Iron Beam uses an advanced laser source and a unique electro-optical targeting system to intercept a wide range of targets with upgraded range, maximum precision and high efficiency at negligible marginal cost.
Originally known as “Magen Or” and earlier as “Iron Beam,” the system is an Israeli laser-based active defense platform against short-range rockets, missiles and mortars, as well as aircraft, drones and gliders. Developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems in cooperation with Elbit Systems, it is considered groundbreaking and the first of its kind in the world. It forms the fifth layer of Israel’s air defense array.

“Europe needs an independent and strong defense industry – in partnership with the United States. I believe that Europe should be independent, with strong security guarantees,” Zelensky said in a Telegram post on Friday.
Zelensky said that Ukraine is ready to share its battlefield experience with European allies – adding that Kyiv counts on its “strategic partnership with Germany and other European countries.”
“We can share our experience, and I am glad that during this Munich Security Conference we are opening joint production,” he continued – apparently referring to the production of Ukrainian drones in Germany, which Zelensky previously said would begin before the end of February.
Later, the president met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, with whom he discussed the “first significant results” of joint production and “how to scale it up.”
Earlier on Friday, Merz made his opening address to the conference – telling attendees that the global order “no longer exists.”

“The leadership claim of the US is being challenged, perhaps already lost,” Merz said, as per Politico.
Zelensky also met with Reza Pahlavi, whose father was the Shah of Iran deposed in 1979.
“We condemned the cooperation between Russia and Iran, in particular the Iranian regime’s supply of Shaheds to Russia and the transfer of licenses for the corresponding production,” Zelensky said. “Such a partnership poses a real threat not only to Ukraine, but also to the entire region.”

State Department orders nonprofit libraries to stop processing passport applications
The State Department has ordered nonprofit public libraries to stop taking passport applications, cutting off a popular local service
- Bookmark
The U.S. State Department has ordered certain public libraries nationwide to cease processing passport applications, disrupting a long-standing service that librarians say their communities have come to rely on and that has run smoothly for years.
The agency, which regulates U.S. passports, began issuing cease and desist orders to not-for-profit libraries in late fall, informing them they were no longer authorized to participate in the Passport Acceptance Facility program as of Friday.
“We still get calls daily seeking that service,” said Cathleen Special, executive director of the Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut, where passport services were offered for 18 years but ceased in November after receiving the letter. “Our community was so used to us offering this.”
A State Department spokesperson said the order was given because federal law and regulations “clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations” from collecting and retaining fees for a passport application. Government-run libraries are not impacted.
The spokesperson did not respond to questions as to why it has become an issue now and exactly how many libraries are impacted by the cease and desist order. In a statement, they said, “passport services has over 7,500 acceptance facilities nationwide and the number of libraries found ineligible makes up less than one percent of our total network.”
The American Library Association estimates about 1,400 mostly non-profit public libraries nationwide could potentially be affected, or about 15% of all public libraries, depending on how many offer passport services.
Democratic and Republican members of Congress from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Maryland are pushing back, sending a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio this month asking him to extend the existing program until Congress finds a permanent solution.
"In a time when demand for passports is surging, libraries are among the most accessible passport acceptance facilities, particularly for working families and rural residents,” the members wrote.
The lawmakers' letter said people will have to travel long distances, take unpaid time off from work or forgo getting a passport when demand is surging due to Real ID requirements. If Republicans in Congress impose strict new voting rules, citizens could need their passport or birth certificate to register. People fearing immigration agents are also increasingly carrying passports to confirm their citizenship.
They said the change is particularly disruptive to their states, where many public libraries are structured as nonprofit entities. They predicted some libraries, which benefit financially from passport processing fees, will have to lay off staff, cut programs or close their doors if not allowed to continue providing passport services.
Public libraries are organized differently in each state. In Pennsylvania 85% of public libraries are non-profit organizations, versus being a department of a local municipal government. In Maine, it's 56%; Rhode Island, 54%, New York, 47% and Connecticut, 46%, according to the American Library Association.
Pennsylvania Reps. Madeleine Dean, a Democrat, and John Joyce, a Republican, have proposed bipartisan legislation that would allow 501(c)(3) non-profit public libraries to continue to serve as passport acceptance facilities by amending the Passport Act of 1920. A similar companion bill is pending in the Senate.
Dean, who first learned about the policy change from a library in her district that has provided passport services for 20 years, called the State Department's interpretation of the law “nonsense.”
In Joyce's rural, south-central Pennsylvania district, the Marysville-Rye Library is one of only two passport facilities serving the 556-square-mile Perry County, according to the letter to Rubio. Now the county courthouse will be the only remaining option.
The State Department noted that 99% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of a designated passport processing location, such as a post office, county clerk's office or government-run library authorized to accept in-person passport applications.
“Should the removal of an ineligible facility affect passport services, we will work to identify new eligible program partners in the impacted area,” the agency spokesperson said.
But Special said the Norwich post office had often referred people to her library for passports when someone needed service outside regular hours or had children who needed to be watched and entertained while their parent filled out the paperwork. Library staff also assisted applicants with language barriers.
“And now the burden falls on them to do all of it and that’s tough on them," she said of the post office down the street. "I don’t know how they’re keeping up, to be honest, because it was such a popular service with us.”

Ring cuts surveillance firm ties amid Super bowl ad outcry
February 13, 2026Under pressure from the United States public, doorbell camera maker Ring has announced a "joint decision" to end its partnership with Flock Safety, a tech company that operates automated license-plate reading systems.
The two US-based businesses have faced backlash over concerns that their products could be used by AI systems and law enforcement to spy on users.
"Following a comprehensive review, we determined the planned Flock Safety integration would require significantly more time and resources than anticipated," Ring said in a statement posted on Thursday.
"The integration never launched, so no Ring customer videos were ever sent to Flock Safety," the statement reads.
However, the statement makes no reference to the "Search Party" feature at the center of the current controversy. And while Flock Safety is under fire over its products being used to support the work of ICE and the US Border Patrol, it remains unclear whether ending the partnership will in any way affect Ring's "Search Party" feature, which is already operating.
Ring and its CEO on blast over Superbowl ad
The Amazon-owned Ring triggered public outcry with a 30-second ad aired during the Super bowl last Sunday.
The final NFL game, watched by nearly 125 million people, included a commercial about a fictional family losing their dog and finding it using Ring's "Search Party" feature through a network of connected outdoor cameras. The ad also features Ring founder and CEO Jamie Siminoff.
"'Search Party' from Ring uses AI to help families find lost dogs... Be a hero in your neighborhood with 'Search Party'," Siminoff's voice-over says.
However, users and experts quickly pointed out that the feature could be used to track human beings.
"Amazon Ring already integrates biometric identification, like face recognition, into its products via features like 'Familiar Faces'," privacy nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote on Tuesday.
"It doesn't take much to imagine Ring eventually combining these two features: face recognition and neighborhood searches."
Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey also blasted the ad on social media, calling it "mass surveillance."
"What this ad doesn't show: Ring also rolled out facial recognition for humans. I wrote to them months ago about this. Their answer? They won't ask for your consent."
What did Ring say?
Responding to the controversy, Ring spokesperson Emma Daniels told The Verge that the "Search Party" feature was designed to track dogs and was "not capable of processing human biometrics."
Pressed on the potential for tracking people, she said those features "are not capable of that today."
"We don't comment on feature road maps, but I have no knowledge or indication that we're building features like that at this point," she told the US tech outlet.

Colombia: Four months after the attack on Yendri Velásquez and Luis Peche, justice remains pending

Four months after the armed attack against Venezuelan activists Yendri Velásquez and Luis Peche in Bogotá, the authorities have yet to present clear progress in the investigation or guarantee full protection measures, warns Amnesty International, while expressing concern over the risks faced by many Venezuelans who have been forced to flee their country without receiving adequate international protection.
“This attack cannot be treated as an isolated case. It reflects the risks faced by migrants and refugees, especially those who have been targeted for their activism. The state’s obligation is to protect and investigate urgently. Every day without progress deepens the harm,” said Valentina Ballesta, America’s Deputy Director for research at Amnesty International.

Colombia is the main host country for Venezuelans displaced by the prolonged human rights crisis in their country. In this context, Amnesty International recalls that states receiving migrants and refugees have clear obligations under international law: they must not only allow entry or stay in their territory, but also ensure effective access to asylum-seeking procedures without unreasonable delay, adopt timely protection measures against foreseeable risks to life and integrity, and investigate and punish acts of violence with due diligence.
“The case of our colleague Yendri Velásquez and Luis Peche illustrates how administrative barriers to the timely recognition of refugee status generate risks — particularly for people who defend human rights and who should therefore be subject to special protection, given they face particular risks,” said Marcos Gómez, Amnesty International’s Venezuelan section director.

Four months after the attack, Amnesty International warns that the lack of clear and effective investigative results prolongs the suffering of the victims and sends a dangerous message of tolerance toward such attacks — particularly in a country like Colombia, which has faced a longstanding crisis of violence against human rights defenders. Impunity is also a form of violence; when states fail to investigate seriously and promptly, they breach their duty to protect, and erode trust in institutions.
“People live in fear in Venezuela, and those of us outside the country do too. The state has the responsibility to protect us and to investigate what happened. We will continue to speak out because silence will not protect us,” said Yendri Velásquez, Amnesty International member.

Amnesty International urges Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office to advance immediately with a thorough and impartial investigation into this attack; ensure adequate protection measures for the victims; and reaffirm in practice its commitment to international protection for those seeking safety.
Likewise, we remind the migration authorities of Colombia and across the Americas that international protection is not a discretionary concession: it is a legal duty and an ethical responsibility. Amnesty International will continue to monitor this situation and demand justice for any attack against people in need of international protection.

A battered car forces William Byron into a backup for his Daytona 500 three-peat bid

A battered car forces William Byron into a backup for his Daytona 500 three-peat bid
William Byron chases an unprecedented third straight Daytona 500 win Sunday when he attempts to make NASCAR history
- Bookmark
William Byron will try to drive his way into NASCAR history Sunday when he attempts to become the first winner of three consecutive Daytona 500s.
He'll have to do it in a backup Chevrolet after his preferred No. 24 was damaged in a qualifying race at Daytona International Speedway.
No big deal, though: Byron won his first Daytona 500 in 2024 in a Hendrick Motorsports backup car.
“We’ve won this race with a backup car, so I’m not super worried on that aspect,” Byron said. “But it does suck that you put a lot of work into the primary and you don’t get to race it.”
He will start 39th in the 41-car field in NASCAR's season opener but isn't concerned about being in the back of the pack. Byron was hardly dominant in winning the last two Daytona 500s — he led a total combined 14 laps in both victories — and his success has been rooted in being in the right place at the right time.
No driver in 67 previous Daytona 500s has won “The Great American Race” three years in a row. Richard Petty in 1975, Cale Yarborough in 1985, Sterling Marlin in 1996 and Denny Hamlin in 2021 all came up short.
“It’s hard. You’re going to need things to fall your way," Hamlin said of Byron's chances. "In 2021, I legit thought we were going to get (it). We led the most laps in that race, was really fast, but didn’t work out on the last pit sequence.
"There’s an element of fortune there that has to fall your way. Last year, he was fortunate on the last lap there, but if you put yourself in the top eight you can get fortunate at times. He puts himself in the top eight, which is what matters.”
Byron came from nowhere last year — he was ninth at the start of the final lap of overtime — when a monstrous wreck in front of him allowed Byron to squeeze through and snag the win after leading all of 10 laps the entire day.
He led only four laps in 2024 — and dropped as low as 34th during the race — but again was in position to pounce when it mattered. He navigated a last-lap scramble to take the lead right before a caution flag froze the field to win under yellow.
Luck? Maybe. But it takes skill to be able to capitalize when the opportunity arises.
“It just feels like I’ve been, at this track in particular, able to have some things go my way and also make good decisions in those moments that I had opportunities," Byron said. “It’s a mix of being in the right place and then having those chances to make good decisions.”
His two-year run is a remarkable turnaround for Byron, who has only finished half of his 16 career starts at Daytona, crashing out eight times.
“I feel like for a while it was a joke; I couldn’t finish a race here,” Byron said. “My first six years, I couldn’t finish the race, but I was always in the mix. I think it’s kind of finally tipped the other way.”
Byron has five career victories at drafting tracks — two at Atlanta and three at Daytona (he won the summer race in 2020). But he thinks his ability to master the draft and navigate through traffic turned in his favor at Talladega, where he has five top-five finishes.
“I feel like we’ve had some things go our way, and then we’ve been good at the speedways. Really, it started at Talladega. I think we were better at Talladega for a while," Byron said. "We weren’t finishing at Daytona, and once we figured out a way to finish the races at Daytona, it seemed like it started to go the other way.
"You just try to do the best job you can, learning the little nuances of the draft. I don’t think I’m the best at drafting at the moment. I think there’s still more to learn.”
Hendrick Motorsports owner Rick Hendrick, winner of a NASCAR-record 20 Daytona 500s, doesn't believe Byron's success at Daytona has been tied solely to luck. He noted that Byron has raced for the NASCAR championship the last three years and has racked up 16 career victories in the No. 24 Chevrolet.
“I don't know if you can really luck into it. You've got to put yourself in position to do it," Hendrick said. "William is probably underestimated as a plate racer; he's one of the best out there. If you watch his way through traffic and the success he's had, not just because he's won the two Daytona's back-to-back, because he's been up there, he’s just getting more mature — not mature — more seasoned.”
Busch tries to end drought
Kyle Busch starts on the pole for the first time in his 21 attempts to win the Daytona 500, and at 0 for 20, his drought is the longest among active drivers in the field.
Even worse, Busch takes a 93-race losing streak into Sunday that dates to 2023, his first season driving for Richard Childress Racing. It's a frustrating drought for Busch, a two-time NASCAR champion with 63 career Cup wins.
His 10-year-old son, Brexton, a budding racer, watched his father win the pole from the family motorhome in the infield and fell back onto a couch in anxiousness after watching his dad's qualifying run. Busch said he badly wants to win for his family.
“It’s been a rough stretch. It’s no secret, right? Seeing my son and his passion that he has, he really, really is probably my biggest cheerleader,” Busch said. “He wants to see me run well. He wants to see me win races. He wants to celebrate in victory lane like he sees other drivers’ kids being able to do. So there’s nothing more that drives me every single weekend than seeing him see me, be proud of me.”
The pole-winning run comes as RCR tries to return to its championship-contending form, which has been spotty in the 25 years since Dale Earnhardt was killed in a last-lap crash at the Daytona 500. Earnhardt won six championships and one Daytona 500 driving for Childress.
No driver has ever won the race for the first time in more than 20 attempts — the number it took the Earnhardt to win it in 1998.
“It’s a box we’ve got to check,” said Busch, who finished second to then-teammate Hamlin in 2019. “This is an opportunity to be able to do that. I’ve come down here a lot of years. I think I finished in about every position possible. It would be nice to (open) 2026 with a victory here in the Daytona 500.”
Hamlin goes for No. 4
Hamlin missed his shot to win three straight Daytona 500s but still has records to chase.
Another victory would be his fourth and tie him with Yarborough for second-most all-time victories in NASCAR’s biggest race. Only seven-time winner Richard Petty, also a seven-time NASCAR champion, has more.
“Every win that you get here puts you in a certain list,” Hamlin said. “The list is so small at that four number, it certainly was on my mind on the last lap last year when we were leading, that we are going to get another one. I feel as though the opportunity will be there, and hopefully we can put ourselves in position to move ourselves up that Daytona 500 winners board.”
Keselowski races hurt
Brad Keselowski is 0 for 16 in the Daytona 500 and doesn't have great odds Sunday because of a fall he took while on a family ski trip in December.
Keselowski slipped on ice and broke his right leg, and the injury caused him to miss last week's preseason exhibition race. He arrived in Daytona using a cane to walk as he's hurried his recovery time to ensure he wouldn't miss any points-paying races.
“When I’m in the car, I know I’ve got an injury, don’t get me wrong, but I feel the best in the car," he said. "The seat is molded to me really well and you get a little adrenaline flowing, so I felt pretty good.”
He's raced hurt before: Keselowski broke his ankle in a 2011 crash but raced to a victory at Pocono a few days later. He said the injuries are extremely different.
“This is way more serious. When I broke my ankle that sucked. Don’t get me wrong, it was very painful, but in a couple weeks, I was fairly mobile,” he said. "This is a much more significant injury, unfortunately. It’s hard to explain to people that have never broken their femur before what it’s like.
"A normal broken leg is eight to 12 weeks. This is more like six months, so it’s just totally different.”
Odds and ends
Joey Logano and Chase Elliott won their qualifying races earlier in the week to emerge as strong contenders. ... Dale Jarrett is the last driver to win from the pole in 2000. ... Jimmie Johnson and rookie Connor Zilisch start side-by-side in 31st and 32nd as row 16 pairs the oldest and youngest drivers in the field. Johnson is 50 and Zilisch is 19. ... Logano and his Team Penske teammate Ryan Blaney are the betting favorites at plus-1200.

IAEA chief says Iran inspections deal 'possible but terribly difficult' after 12-day war

IAEA chief says Iran inspections deal 'possible but terribly difficult' after 12-day war
Grossi says nuclear landscape has 'changed radically' as inspectors return, but damaged facilities remain off limits
LONDON
The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said a new agreement with Iran on nuclear inspections is “absolutely possible” but “terribly difficult” following what he described as a dramatic shift in the country’s nuclear landscape after the recent 12-day war between Iran and Israel.
“An agreement with Iran on inspections is technically possible and it is politically even viable but difficult,” IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said during an event at the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
Grossi said the conflict had “changed radically” the situation surrounding Iran’s nuclear infrastructure.
“After the 12-day war, the whole landscape of nuclear Iran has changed radically in terms of perhaps not capabilities, but in terms of actual physical infrastructure, which is basically no longer there or badly damaged,” he said.
He pointed to facilities at Isfahan, Natanz and Fordo, suggesting that the previous “impressive array of so many facilities dealing with different aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle” may no longer exist in the same form.
Any future agreement, he said, would have to focus not only on what remains but also on “what kind of nuclear Iran can emerge from this new situation.”
Grossi stressed that Iran, as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), has the right to pursue peaceful nuclear activities. However, he acknowledged “the reality of a political restraint, which is being very clearly articulated by the US and perhaps others.”
IAEA inspectors have returned to Iran, though they have not been able to access damaged facilities. “We have been inspecting, if I can put it in simple terms, everything but the attacked facilities,” he said.
Despite the challenges, Grossi said dialogue had resumed. “Some said, with this war, it is over. You will never see monitoring in Iran again… So we were able to work again to establish some form of dialog, imperfect and complicated and extremely difficult.”
He described the coming days as “a very, very crucial moment,” raising the possibility of “light at the end of the tunnel” towards a new arrangement.
Israel launched attacks on Iran on June 13, 2025, sparking a war marked by tit-for-tat airstrikes, raising fears of a broader regional conflict.
Several senior Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists were killed in Israeli airstrikes that targeted Tehran and other cities, including Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of the Iranian Armed Forces, Gen. Hossein Salami, chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and senior IRGC commander Gen. Gholam Ali Rashid, head of the central headquarters of the Iranian military.

ECB fines French bank Crédit Agricole for failing to identify climate risks

The European Central Bank said on Friday, February 13, it had fined French bank Crédit Agricole €7.55 million for failing to properly identify climate change-related risks that could affect its balance sheet. "Crédit Agricole did not sufficiently assess the materiality of its climate-related and environmental risks" by a deadline set after an investigation in 2024, the ECB said in a statement, adding the bank was late by "75 full days."
Since 2020, the ECB has required banks to manage and disclose climate-related risks to their portfolios as fears grow that increasingly frequent and intense natural disasters could hit asset values. The transition to a lower-carbon economy also introduces risk for investments in fossil fuel firms or energy-intensive sectors.
Crédit Agricole expressed its "incomprehension" at the ECB's move and said the fine related to only a small part of the bank's work. Climate risk is limited overall across the bank, according to the statement. "This risk is immaterial at the Crédit Agricole group level," the bank said in a statement, adding that it had missed the ECB's deadline since "responding to the ECB at the requested level of granularity required extensive work." "The group reiterates that it naturally identifies and takes climate and environmental risks into account in its models," it said.
The ECB fined Spanish bank Abanca €187,650 last November for failing to identify and disclose climate risks on time.

Merz Say U.S. Not Powerful Enough to ‘Go It Alone,’ Warns Against ‘Deep Rift’ With Europe

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has warned of “a deep rift” between Europe and the United States, arguing that the latter “will not be powerful enough to go it alone.”
In his address at the Munich Security Conference Friday, Merz urged Europe and the U.S. to “repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together” in what he referred to as an “era of great power rivalry.”
Switching to English as he addressed American “friends,” Merz nodded to Trump’s contentious relationship with NATO, insisting that “being a part of [the alliance] is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage.”
While he acknowledged that the existing global order has long been flawed, Merz—when discussing the “under destruction” theme of this year’s conference—argued the “international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed.”
He also referenced Vice President J.D. Vance’s speech from last year’s conference. Vance drew ire from European leaders when he argued that what concerned him most was Europe’s “threat from within... the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values—values shared with the United States of America.” He used “free speech” as an example of the values in retreat.
“The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours,” Merz continued. “Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
The German leader appeared to make further strides to distinguish Europe from the Trump Administration, adding: “We stick to climate agreements and the World Health Organization (WHO) because we are convinced that global challenges can only be solved together.”
On Jan. 22, the U.S., under Trump’s direction, officially pulled out of the WHO. The move has garnered much criticism from global health experts.
TIME has reached out to the White House for comment on Merz's comments.

As Europe takes part in ongoing negotiations regarding the hope for a cease-fire in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, Merz said he has also started private talks with French President Emmanuel Macron about “nuclear deterrence.”
Merz’s concerns echo those made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Davos in January. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, Carney argued that the old world order was “not coming back” and encouraged people not to “mourn” the way things used to be. He accused “great powers” of using economic pressure to yield results while urging middle powers to push back.
Carney’s remarks were delivered shortly after Trump threatened to tariff countries who oppose his campaign to annex Greenland—a threat he has since walked back. Trump later lashed out in response to Carney’s speech.

The U.S. President will not be appearing at the Munich Security Conference. Instead, Secretary of State Marco Rubio will represent the U.S. on Saturday and deliver a highly-anticipated speech.
Rubio also warned of a “new era” in geopolitics as he boarded his flight to Germany.
When asked if his message to Europeans will take a softer approach than Vance’s address last year, Rubio told reporters: “The world is changing very fast right in front of us. We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be.”
On Friday afternoon, the U.S. Department of State confirmed that Rubio and Merz had met in Munich, after the German Chancellor’s speech.
“They discussed pressing global challenges including securing supply chains, advancing efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war, and strengthening the partnership between the United States and Europe,” said a spokesperson. “The Secretary expressed appreciation for Germany’s strong support for Ukraine, including over $76 billion in assistance since 2022, and discussed continued coordination on reconstruction efforts.”

Zaporizhkoks allocates UAH 4.3 mln to restore one of its regenerators
PJSC Zaporizhkoks, one of Ukraine's largest producers of coke-chemical products, has invested UAH 4.3 million in a major overhaul to ensure stable operation of the plant's regenerator.
According to the company, Zaporizhkoks has completed a capital repair of Regenerator No. 6 in the recovery shop. A contractor carried out a comprehensive overhaul of the regenerator's foundation metal structures, installed new reinforcement segments for the casing, and added structural stiffeners.
The project also included replacement of the roof's metal structures with fencing and internal protective lining, as well as upgrades to the slurry pipeline and air duct. The total investment in the overhaul amounted to nearly UAH 4.3 million.
Maksym Shapovalov, head of the recovery shop, explained that regenerator overhauls at the plant are performed on a scheduled basis.
"This is a technically complex process lasting nearly nine months, involving restoration of both external structures and internal lining. The regenerator's technical readiness for uninterrupted, efficient operation without failures directly determines the stability of the recovery shop's technological process and the plant's overall performance. That is why Zaporizhkoks prioritizes a systematic approach to repairs, continuous monitoring of equipment condition, improving energy efficiency, and implementing modern technical solutions," he noted.
The coke gas desulfurization unit (formerly the sulfur removal shop) of the recovery shop ensures purification of coke gas and production of gas sulfur. Stable operation of this equipment allows for high-quality purification of coke gas, which is used to heat coke batteries and power plant boilers, critical for the continuity and stability of the entire production process.
This year, Zaporizhkoks plans a capital overhaul of Regenerator No. 7. In total, 12 such units are in operation at the shop.
Zaporizhkoks operates a full technological cycle for processing coke-chemical products.
According to the National Securities and Stock Market Commission (NSSMC), as of Q4 2025, Dashuria Ltd. (Cyprus) owns 94.9565% of the company's shares.

Five more Ukrainian children returned from occupied territories, Russia – Lubinets
Five Ukrainian children returned home from the temporarily occupied territories and Russia, among them a seven-year-old boy who was deported from Kherson children's home during the occupation of the city, Verkhovna Rada Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets has said.
"We also managed to return a four-year-old boy and his six-year-old sister, who were kidnapped by the occupiers from the children's home as infants; their mother had not seen the children for four long years," he said in Telegram channel on Friday.
Lubinets also told another story. About a nine-year-old boy who ended up in Russia with his mother, who died there from a serious illness. After the grandfather's unsuccessful attempt to take the child away, the boy was finally returned to Ukraine, where his uncle will take care of him.
According to the Ombudsman's Office, a total of 1,985 children have already returned since the start of the full-scale invasion of the Homeland.

WASHINGTON, February 13. /TASS/. The Washington administration and European authorities are negotiating over Greenland, US President Donald Trump told reporters.
"We get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it all works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland," he said.
On January 31, the US administration announced the start of negotiations on the future ownership of Greenland and expressed hope for a deal that would benefit both the US and Europe. Washington said that quite a lot had already been agreed upon. Trump has repeatedly stated the need for Greenland to join the US. During his first presidential term, he offered to buy the island, and in March 2025, he expressed confidence that it could be annexed.

Palestine Action cofounder Ammori after High Court win: UK ban ‘backfired’
Huda Ammori celebrates ‘victory for Palestine’ as top court rules proscription as a ‘terror’ organisation was unlawful.
London, United Kingdom – The United Kingdom’s ban on Palestine Action has “backfired”, its cofounder said, after the High Court ruled that proscribing the group as a “terror” organisation was unlawful.
Critics from the United Nations human rights chief to the Irish author Sally Rooney decried the UK’s ban last June as an illiberal overreach, since it put Palestine Action on par with ISIL (ISIS), al-Qaeda and dangerous far-right organisations.

- list 4 of 4UK court says Palestine Action ban ‘unlawful’: What does the verdict mean?
On Friday, High Court judges dealt a massive blow to the government of Labour leader Keir Starmer, saying, “The decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate.”
“Today is a victory for Palestine,” Palestine Action cofounder Huda Ammori told Al Jazeera. The ban has “backfired on [the government] massively. They’ve made Palestine Action a household name.
“They have spread the message and the power that ordinary people have to shut down weapons factories across the country and across the world. So for that, I thank them.”
Founded in 2020, Palestine Action’s stated objective has been to counter Israeli war crimes – and what it says is British complicity in them – by targeting weapons manufacturers and associated companies.
Its main target is Elbit Systems, Israel’s largest arms company, which has several sites in the UK.
“Rather than ask somebody else to stop those weapons going and being used to commit genocide, we go to the source, and we stop those weapons ourselves,” said Ammori, a 31-year-old Briton of Iraqi and Palestinian heritage.
“That is what direct action is about. If you saw a building burning down with children inside, you wouldn’t hesitate to bang down the door to save those children’s lives. It is exactly the same principle. You don’t care about the value of the door. It is about those lives. It is about the liberation of Palestine. And so we do our bit to shut down the Israeli weapons trades from Britain.”
The group has been a thorn in Starmer’s side since Israel began its genocidal onslaught in Gaza.
Palestine Action-linked activists have carried out several raids, often leaving their mark in red spray paint intended to symbolise blood.
Dozens are currently being held on remand in relation to two actions.
Some prisoners, known as part of the “Filton 24”, are alleged to have participated in a break-in at a UK subsidiary of Elbit Systems in Bristol.
Others are accused of involvement in a break-in at the UK’s largest air base in Oxfordshire, where they were alleged to have spray-painted two Voyager refuelling and transport planes. It was after this raid that the government banned Palestine Action.
They all deny the charges against them, such as burglary and criminal damage.
Six of the “Filton 24” were recently acquitted of aggravated burglary; five of them were bailed.
“At its core, Palestine Action is an organisation that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality. A very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action,” the High Court judges said.
Tens of thousands of people have protested against the ban. Almost 3,000 of them have been arrested for raising placards with slogans such as: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”
“The government committed a huge crime against its own population,” said Ammori. “It was unlawful for them to ban Palestine Action, and when they banned Palestine Action, they subsequently did thousands of unlawful arrests against their own citizens and tried to prosecute them through the courts for terrorism offences, for holding up signs.”
Despite Friday’s ruling, the ban remains in place pending appeal.
The UK’s Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed” by Friday’s ruling and intends to appeal – earning further criticism from rights groups and some fellow Labour politicians.
John McDonnell, an MP who voted against the proscription, said on X, “I thought it was unjust. We have a right to protest, to assemble, and to speak freely in this country – that has been secured largely by direct action over centuries. I am urging the government to abide by that tradition and not to appeal this judgement.”
“Shabana Mahmood needs to take a step back,” said Ammori. “She’s completely betrayed the Palestinian people since she’s become minister … it’s only going to backfire on her.
“Palestine Action’s ban will be lifted … We won today in the High Court … If they try and appeal, we’ll beat them again.”

German Spy Chief Warns of Russian Threat to Local Polls

Germany’s foreign intelligence chief warned Friday that Russia is planning to target high-stakes regional elections this year with “hybrid” attacks, and called for Berlin to consider “counter-measures” against the growing threat.
Berlin, a key backer of Ukraine in its war against Moscow, says it has faced a growing number of Russian sabotage plots and cyberattacks, and accused Moscow of spreading disinformation before general elections last year.

Russia dismissed those claims as “absurd” and “baseless”.
Five German states hold elections this year and all eyes are on whether the far-right AfD, which has been surging in the polls and is seen as Moscow-friendly, will succeed in taking power in any of the regions.
Martin Jaeger, head of the BND foreign intelligence agency, warned that Russia had dramatically stepped up its use of “hybrid warfare” -- which refers to largely unconventional methods that can involve sabotage, disinformation campaigns and other disruptive attacks.
“Elections in Moldova and Romania are recent examples, and we expect more hybrid campaigns throughout this election year in Germany,” Jaeger said in a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference.
But he warned the efforts to fend off Russian attacks had so far fallen short.
“Deterrence is not working yet,” he said.
“This raises the question, do we simply want to continue to observe and record these developments, or have we reached a point where we must take action -- counter-measures?”

“I’m deeply convinced we should much more often prove that we would be able to do very similar things to make the other side also feel the pain,” he added.
His comments come after recent reports said that Berlin is considering overhauling laws to expand the powers of the BND.
Under new proposals, German spies would reportedly be able to launch sabotage operations and cyberattacks if the country’s recently formed National Security Council concludes there is a “systemic threat”.
The BND would also be handed extra powers for intelligence gathering, including the use of facial recognition software.
The government previously declined to comment on specifics, saying only that they planned to make changes to laws governing espionage.

Brazil breaks up China-linked US$190m money-laundering ring tied to top crime syndicate
Prosecutors claim Chinese-run distribution network concealed revenue, evaded tax obligations and fostered money laundering of drug proceeds
The Primeiro Comando da Capital, or PCC, syndicate allegedly sold imported consumer electronics throughout Brazil via a Chinese e-commerce platform called “Knup Brasil”, including mobile phone chargers, electronic scales and other accessories at competitive prices.
According to São Paulo police, customers placed orders through the platform but were instructed to transfer payments via Brazil’s instant payment system, Pix, to separate companies with no legitimate commercial activity.
Invoices were allegedly issued at artificially reduced values by third-party firms, creating what investigators described as a deliberate mismatch between declared income and actual cash flow.

Trump says he will visit Venezuela, praises ‘very good’ relations

WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump said Friday that he plans to visit Venezuela, citing what he described as strong ties between the two countries and growing cooperation in the oil sector.
“I’m going to make a visit to Venezuela … We haven’t decided (when),” Trump told reporters at the White House.
Trump praised relations with interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, saying Washington and Caracas are “working together very closely,” particularly on energy.
“We have a very good relationship,” he said, adding that major US oil companies are operating in the country and that the partnership is generating significant revenue.
“The relationship we have right now with Venezuela is, I would say, a 10.”
Asked whether the US recognizes Rodriguez’s administration as Venezuela’s official government, Trump responded: “We have done that. We’re dealing with them.”
He said oil production is on the rise and that the US is refining Venezuelan crude, describing the relationship as “strong.”
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright visited the South American country this week to assess its oil industry and hold talks with teh interim government centered on a massive overhaul of the country’s energy sector to revitalize its economy and reintegrate its oil reserves into the global market.
Wright’s high-profile visit to Venezuela follows a political shift on Jan. 3, when US forces captured President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in a military operation in Caracas and transported to New York, where they are being held in a federal detention facility. Rodriguez has since moved to normalize relations with Washington.

Trump warns of 'very big force' if talks with Iran fail
'Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it,' Trump says when asked why he decided to send 2nd aircraft carrier to Middle East
WASHINGTON
President Donald Trump said Friday that the US is prepared to deploy a “very big force” if ongoing negotiations with Iran fail.
"Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it ....If we have a deal, we could cut it short," Trump told reporters when asked why he decided to send a second aircraft carrier to the region.
"It'll be leaving. It'll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived ...We have it ready. A big, a very big force," he added.
His remarks came after local media reported that the US will send the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Middle East to back up the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group.
When asked about the negotiations with Iran, Trump said he thinks they will be "successful."
"And if they're not, it's going to be a bad day for Iran — very bad," he added.
The US and Iran held indirect talks in the capital Muscat on Feb. 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program.
The sit-down marked the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during an escalation of the Iran–Israel conflict in June 2025.
Amid the negotiations, the US has significantly increased its military footprint in the region as Trump warns Iran that it must make a deal.
Uranium enrichment remains a central point of dispute. The US demands Iran halt uranium enrichment and transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country—a non-starter for Tehran.
Washington has also sought to include Iran’s missile program and its support for armed groups in the region in the negotiations, but Tehran has repeatedly said it will not negotiate issues beyond its nuclear program.

German spy chief calls for more operational freedom to counter threats
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BERLIN, Feb 13 - Germany should beef up its intelligence services and allow them more freedom to act in the face of a range of hybrid threats from Russia, the head of the country's foreign intelligence service said on Friday.
After decades of self-imposed caution over state spying and surveillance following World War Two, German politicians and security officials have been pressing to allow its foreign and domestic intelligence agencies greater leeway to act in the face of what they see as an increased threat from Russia.
"The threat emanating from hybrid warfare has been recognized," Martin Jaeger, head of the BND, Germany's foreign intelligence service, told a panel at the Munich Security Conference.
"Deterrence is not working yet. This raises the question, do we simply want to continue to observe and record these developments, or have we reached a point where we must take active countermeasures?"
"This question also applies to my service, the BND. In my opinion, the service must and will become more operational," he said.
Jaeger said Germany had uncovered a major Russian-linked influence operation ahead of last year's federal election, which he said used pseudo-investigative research, deepfakes, and fabricated witness statements on various platforms. He said police had registered 321 acts of sabotage in Germany last year, many of which were likely to be linked to Russia.
The Russian government has consistently denied running disinformation networks but the perceived threat has been a recurrent theme among Western policymakers since Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the conference of security policy experts in Munich that Germany would strengthen its intelligence services as part of a wider drive to rebuild its armed forces and improve its resilience in the face of a heightened threat from Russia.
"We will protect our free democratic order from both internal and external enemies," he told the conference in a speech in which he said the old international rules-based order no longer existed as it had in the past.
The German parliament is debating a new bill that would allow the intelligence services, which are currently bound by strict rules curtailing their activities, to take more active measures against security threats. REUTERS

The Guardian view on Starmer’s trust crisis: it is unlikely to be managed away | Editorial

Once a political leader’s net favourability sinks deep into negative territory, recovery is the exception, not the rule. It usually takes an economic rebound, a dramatic political reset or an opposition implosion to reverse the slide. Sir Keir Starmer’s personal ratings are in a danger zone from which few escape.
Yet the prime minister, like the Bourbons, has learnt nothing and forgotten nothing. He made a speech this week after coming close to being ousted suggesting he would “fight” on. He doubled down in parliament despite glaring errors in judgment. He forced out his cabinet secretary while his own failures remain unaddressed. He seemed to blame everyone but himself. When support slips and a leader answers with defiance, voters don’t see strength – they see denial.
The bigger picture, as the Resolution Foundation said this week, is that living standards are forecast to rise up by just 0.3% a year until 2029-30 – even weaker than the previous decade’s 0.4% annual growth, which included Covid and the energy crisis. Britain, under Sir Keir’s stewardship, is set to grow more slowly in “normal times” than it did during national emergencies.
The prime minister’s claim to responsible management is undone by his own incompetence. Public trust ebbs away – a worry when voters start shopping around and Reform UK is selling racism. Stagnation exposes governments that lack an economic model. That is why interventions this week by Andy Burnham, the Greater Manchester mayor, and Daisy Cooper, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson, matter. Both accept that cost of living pressure is becoming politically dangerous and that the status quo isn’t working.
The Lib Dems want to shake up Whitehall. They are calling for a break up of the Treasury and its replacement with a new department of growth based in Birmingham. The most radical idea is that the growth department would set fiscal policies. That might be a very good idea if it opened up the space for productive cash injections with an acknowledgment that fiscal deficits are required to rebuild the social democratic space.
By contrast, Mr Burnham’s plan is a revolution: roll back Thatcherism and restore politics to the heart of economics. Hence his call for electoral reform, abandoning the parliamentary whip system and replacing the House of Lords with an elected senate of nations and regions. A new political settlement, he says, is a precondition to achieve public control of essentials – such as housing and utilities – to reduce costs and support productivity.
Mr Burnham’s distance from Westminster – after his path back was closed by Sir Keir – gives him freedom to speak out. His proposal logically implies a constitutional role for metro mayors. In this vision, the national government sets the macro framework; regions control infrastructure and housing, and the senate safeguards territorial interests. That would be a welcome and different version of the UK from today’s Treasury dominated unitary state.
Zack Polanski’s Green surge has made radical talk respectable and cost of living politics inescapable, especially ahead of an upcoming Manchester byelection in what was a safe Labour seat. The Greens are part of a wider revolt against Britain’s economic model. From Labour’s soft left, Mr Burnham offers structural overhaul, while the Lib Dems promise a growth engine, and the Greens push redistribution. Meanwhile, Sir Keir’s Labour is governing inside a failed model rather than replacing it. That looks politically fatal.

Cuban official decries ‘massive punishment’ by US oil blockade
Diplomat Carlos de Cossio says US fuel embargo harms Cuba’s medical services, food production and standard of living.
Cuban diplomat Carlos de Cossio has accused the United States of imposing collective punishment on his country as the administration of President Donald Trump ramps up pressure to choke the Caribbean island’s access to oil.
In a post on X on Friday, de Cossio, who serves as Cuba’s deputy foreign minister, described the situation from Havana’s perspective.

“To be clear: a. Cuba requires importing fuel. b.The US is applying threats & coercive measures to any country that provides it. c. Lack of fuel harms transportation, medical services, schooling, energy, production of food, the standard of living. d. Massive punishment is a crime,” he wrote.
The Fourth Geneva Convention says that “collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of terrorism are prohibited” under international law.
Cuba relied heavily on oil imports from Venezuela, which have been cut off after the abduction of the country’s leader, Nicolas Maduro, by US forces last month.
After the fall of Maduro, Cuba turned to Mexico for fuel.
But the White House has threatened to impose “additional tariffs on imports from any country that directly or indirectly provides oil to Cuba”.
The Mexican government halted the oil supplies to Cuba after the Trump administration’s threat.
But on Thursday, Mexico sent two ships loaded with humanitarian aid to Cuba.
The US oil blockade comes as the Trump administration pursues a policy of regional dominance over the Americas.
Washington targets Cuba
The White House said in its National Security Strategy last year that Washington’s goal is to “restore American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere”.
With Maduro gone, many foreign policy hawks in the US see a golden opportunity to topple the Cuban government.
Washington has had hostile relations with Havana since the rise of the late President Fidel Castro after the communist revolution that overthrew US-backed repressive leader Fulgencio Batista in 1959.
Trump has argued that the Cuban government is “ready to fall” on its own without access to Venezuelan oil.
Last month, the White House released a memorandum labelling the Cuban government an “unusual and extraordinary threat” to the US.
For its part, Havana has issued defiant statements against the US while also expressing willingness to engage in diplomacy.
“The Cuban people and the American people benefit from constructive engagement, lawful cooperation, and peaceful coexistence,” the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement on February 2.
“Cuba reaffirms its willingness to maintain a respectful and reciprocal dialogue, oriented toward tangible results, with the United States government, based on mutual interest and international law.”
But days earlier, Carlos de Cespedes, Cuba’s ambassador to Colombia, told Al Jazeera that his country will not accept being “terrorised” by US pressure.
“It will not subjugate us or break our determination even if a single drop of oil doesn’t reach us,” he said.
Last month, Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his country is “ready to defend the Homeland to the last drop of blood”, but he has also said that the island is not a threat to anyone and is open to talks with the US.

The Society man v the premier: When Daniel Andrews tipped Chris Lucas over the edge
In a new weekly series profiling the tycoons whose money and influence define Victoria’s hospitality landscape, we begin with Chris Lucas — the Geelong underdog who built a Toorak palace and traded the dining room for the war room to challenge a premier.
It’s 11.54am on a Friday, and a woman in a bedazzled shirt is swinging eagerly on golden handles, trying to pull open the double doors of one of Melbourne’s most palatial restaurants.
After a few seconds, she concedes defeat, slumping into one of the black metal chairs laid out for diners who routinely arrive early for the midday lunch service at Maison Bâtard.
Finally, the tall glass doors click open with a whoosh, sounding like a collective sigh. The diners hurry inside.
The creative director
Stepping into one of Chris Lucas’ restaurants is like stepping into a theme park. Beyond inhaling the food, he wants you to feel the weight of the 110-page wine list at Bâtard; marvel at its “icy throne” of an oyster bar, flanked by marble and smoked mirrors; and gawk at boisterous dining institution Chin Chin’s famous, and sometimes unsettling, projections.
His head chefs’ names elude most. Lucas is the face of the operation – the creative director, the visionary, Walt Disney.
It’s a role that sees him rub shoulders with the rich and famous – arm in arm with Margot Robbie, his restaurants visited by Drake and John Cena – and in the ear of Australia’s most influential people.
He is one of former Victorian premier Daniel Andrews’ most vocal, and arguably influential, opponents – even when the restaurateur’s team feared it was to his detriment.
As it stands, he has 12 restaurants operating nationally (including Grill Americano in Sydney, which opened in November), or almost double that if you count the micro bistros and bars inside his larger venues.
He has amassed a sprawling commercial empire. Between 2021 and 2024, he bought $70.1 million worth of property in Melbourne’s CBD alone.
Bâtard, a four-level Parisian giant, is his most ambitious project yet, thought to have cost $45 million. And still, he’s plotting world domination.
He designs his venues alongside wife Sarah Lucas, with whom he shares a 22-room mansion in Toorak bought in 2014 for $18.55 million, according to commercial records.
Lucas has “fingers in every pie”, and control of every menu in his restaurants, down to the commas. “He’s hands-on with everything,” his former publicist Monica Brown tells me, laughing.
“I mean, you’ve got to love working with somebody like that, or you’d want to kill him.”
Where delays have hampered billionaire Justin Hemmes’ plans to infiltrate Melbourne’s hospitality sector on a grand scale, Lucas is on an unprecedented run of restaurant openings.
His restaurants are a refuge for the wealthy, a hangout for those too rich to care (hello, stealth-wealthers sporting trackpants), a go-to for people who want to impress (clients, dates) and the frequent site of once-a-year – or once-in-a-lifetime – celebrations.
Overwhelmingly, though, they are ambitious and aspirational – like his life story, the way he tells it.
The salesman and strategist
When I meet Lucas, it’s at Grill Americano in Melbourne – a typically stylish affair frequented by businessmen and barristers.
He’s more relaxed than I imagined. Chattier. He asks the maître d’: “Did you tell her who had lunch here yesterday?”
They did.
“Ricky Martin,” he says, grinning.
A friend tells me before our interview that, at the opening of his restaurant Carlotta in Canberra, Lucas knew everyone in the room.
He closed the restaurant just 14 months later, in December, impatient with the lack of progress in its CBD precinct, which he said was unconducive to his “multi-venue model” and plans for expansion in the national capital.
“It isn’t consistent with our strategy to operate just one restaurant in a market,” Lucas told Good Food.
So profound is his crowd-pulling power, developers and project heads approach him to move into their buildings (he’s got another four venues in the works, including two at a $400 million Toorak development, and all-electric restaurants at a swanky $1 billion Bourke Street office tower).
He haggles on rent and pushes developers to chip in for restaurant fit-outs, according to sources not authorised to speak on the subject.
He is strategic. A master networker. He is involved in the details – he will handpick bronze sconces from French antique stores. So it surprises me a little he still sees himself as a “kid from Geelong with no money”, whose success came off the back of an opportunity to go to university in Melbourne – something he wouldn’t have done if it wasn’t free.
Before our interview, he asks me whether I’m from country New South Wales. I tell him not quite, but a regional area. He nods, as if to say “me too”.
We talk a lot about his ultimate goal as a restaurateur: elevating Australia to international culinary acclaim.
The country’s distance from the northern hemisphere holds it back, he says, but it’ll only take the success of one or two local restaurants overseas to “open the floodgates”.
He reveals his team is looking at opening venues in the Middle East, Britain and the United States.
“We’re having a bit of a go at all of those areas,” he tells me.
A while later, I put to him one of the main criticisms of the Lucas Collective that I’ve seen in hospitality circles: effectively, that they don’t care about the “little guy”. Lucas appears confused, hurt.
“Well, I don’t understand that because I grew up as a little Greek immigrant boy in Geelong, in a pub working with my dad, with nothing. And then my dad died when I was quite young, and my mother brought me up on a widow’s pension,” says Lucas, whose surname is an anglicisation of the Greek Loukas.
One former bartender at Chin Chin – the Aussie-Thai juggernaut that made Lucas a household name, and divided diners with its no-bookings policy – tells me colleagues laughed at her request for a pay rise because they were so rare.
Some complain Lucas restaurants “will work you ’til you break”.
But a former marketing assistant recalls Lucas was horrified to find her working more than six hours’ overtime, at about 11pm, printing menus in a back room at one of the venues. Lucas finished the job himself, staying until at least midnight.
Lucas says: “The foundation stone of what I’ve achieved today is because I have regard for – I won’t use the ‘little’ bit, because I don’t really understand that – but the people who work for me, work with me.
“You know, our business supports thousands and thousands of small farmers, winemakers, who rely on us.”
Lucas got his first inklings about restaurants at age 10, stepping inside the kitchen of Melbourne’s first modern hotel, where his uncle was the executive chef.
His father, Kon, warned him against a life in the restaurant business, leading him to study pharmacology at university in the years after Kon’s death.
He graduated, but dramatically changed course because of advice from his faculty head: Lucas was one of the worst chemists he’d ever seen, and he should become a salesman instead.
Lucas took it to heart, and signed up to sell computers with global technology company IBM – which was recruiting on campus – in 1981.
It was a move that saw him work in Tokyo, London, Silicon Valley and New York; exploring restaurants and izakayas, courtesy of the company’s generous expense account; and partying at the likes of Studio 54.
Years later, Lucas would tell the Australian Financial Review the job took him from “simple country boy to global executive”. He was highly regarded among IBM colleagues, according to people who knew him at the time.
Then the niggling allure of the restaurant business proved too much.
After a decade at IBM, Lucas sold his stake in telecommunications start-up Primus Telecom, funding his debut restaurant venture, St Kilda brasserie One Fitzroy Street, in 1995. There was “no Mark Zuckerberg story” – no tech millions, Lucas maintains – only a gamble that paid off.
Property journalist Nicole Lindsay tells me One spearheaded a “cleaner” image for the area.
“That really changed the nature of that whole strip, and St Kilda in general,” says Lindsay, who tracks Lucas’ commercial portfolio.
But it was with South Yarra’s Botanical, which Lucas bought and renovated for $7 million, that his status as culinary visionary was carved out.
He mortgaged his home and borrowed from the bank and family connections to afford it, before upending the pub’s layout and erecting a pick-it-yourself wine wall.
With top British chef Paul Wilson, he instituted a popular early iteration of the now-ubiquitous gourmet burger (a menu item Lucas’ wife refuses to eat but a mainstay at Bâtard). He sold the leasehold for Botanical in 2007 for a reported $16 million.
When the Bot was named the Good Food Guide’s 2004 restaurant of the year, reviewer John Lethlean wrote that the place groaned “with energy and innovation”.
“As with most things Lucas has done, he did this properly,” Lethlean wrote. “Acres of cash have been splashed.”
When I interview the now 64-year-old Lucas, he’s just announced his Collective Foundation, a huge part of which he says is about elevating hospitality as a sought-after career path in Australia.
He’s working with La Trobe University to design an “elite” program of specialised hospitality diplomas and degrees, and fund scholarships for underprivileged kids.
“It’s great that someone like me, coming out of Geelong – [which] was just a small country town at the time – [can] achieve some success,” he says.
“I want to be able to see if we can do that for other young kids.”
The Society man and the premier
Lucas does not always come off as the country boy made good.
He has the polish and pugnacity of a business titan accustomed to getting his way, and will slam his restaurant door in the face of a premier.
It all started with a phone call to Melbourne talkback radio. Long before the Andrews government announced its road map out of lockdown, its relationship with business – especially the restaurant business – was starting to fracture.
Lucas’ tipping point came in August 2020, during Melbourne’s second lockdown, when then-premier Andrews announced he would push for a 12-month extension to state-of-emergency powers – a move that would give authorities the power to enforce lockdowns for another year.
It was, he told 3AW’s Neil Mitchell, the equivalent of “dropping a bomb” on Victorians.
“The premier is disconnected,” Lucas lamented. “I think he has a lack of understanding of what’s actually going on in the community at the grassroots level.”
The interview started a media campaign among restaurateurs fearing for their livelihoods. Within half an hour of hanging up the phone, Lucas received thousands of messages of support.
Later, one media outlet described the phone call as a “tear-here” moment for Melbourne, when demands for an end to lockdowns became unrelenting.
“The mental state of Victorians is at such distressing levels,” Lucas told Mitchell. “The suicide rates, the family bust-ups, the torment, the financial pressures amongst the people of Victoria is extraordinary.”
Lucas became the uncompromising spokesman for the hospitality industry’s revolt against COVID-19 restrictions. Again and again, he derided the Andrews government, arguing it was needlessly decimating businesses and destroying Victorians’ mental health.
His public scolding of Andrews was so frequent that his then-publicist Brown says she was concerned about alienating diners.
“There are times when I told him to take the foot off the pedal,” Brown tells me over the phone from Britain.
When his contempt led him to break one of hospitality’s unspoken rules, Brown was particularly worried.
Andrews’ wife, Catherine, tried to make a lunch booking at his South-East Asian venue Hawker Hall, and Lucas told her there was nothing available.
The restaurateur later defended this rejection, pointing out that the Italian restaurant Di Stasio also knocked back Andrews for a birthday booking.
The premier had his “own cross to bear”, but they were allowed to disagree, Lucas told a media outlet. After all, he said, “we live in a democracy”.
“[Lucas] was never a Dan Andrews fan during COVID,” Brown says. “There were a lot of people who were, and when you own a restaurant, your door’s open to everybody, whatever the politics are … you welcome everybody.”
To this day, some former senior Andrews staffers refuse to eat at Lucas’ restaurants, instead favouring those belonging to restaurateurs like Andrew McConnell, who were less outspoken about the state government’s COVID-19 containment measures.
Brown and Lucas maintain the restaurateur’s issue wasn’t with the premier himself but his policy decisions. “[They] were driving [Lucas] crazy because he was on the receiving end of them,” Brown says.
During our interview, Lucas tells me that two of his young staff took their lives during the pandemic.
“Two?” I ask, taken aback. His eyes well up with a mixture of anger and sadness: “Two too many.”
Lucas had a line to Victoria’s then-treasurer Tim Pallas during the pandemic, as well as then-tourism minister Martin Pakula and prolific Andrews critic, former Liberal MP Tim Smith.
He often spoke to City of Melbourne’s then-lord mayor Sally Capp, and was also in touch with former Labor leader Bill Shorten and then-federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg, with whom he shared his despair.
But his frustration was not being able to get through to Andrews himself, according to insiders. “I did meet with lots of other politicians, and to be honest, [Andrews] didn’t really make himself available. He didn’t want to talk to anyone,” Lucas tells me.
The professional stakes were immense for Lucas during COVID-19. He was on the verge of unveiling his much-anticipated Society restaurant, billed as an avant-garde training kitchen to rival Europe’s best.
The project was years in the making, after Lucas in 2018 recruited chef Martin Benn and maître d’ Vicki Wild – the couple behind the vaunted Sydney fine-diner Sepia – to co-lead it in a coup for Melbourne.
But lockdowns stalled the restaurant’s official opening three times. Wild left the business weeks before it finally opened in July 2021 (a year late), and Benn followed in September.
Publicly, Benn blamed the pandemic for their decision. But insiders tell me that by the time Wild left Society, she refused to speak to Lucas – even when they were in the same room.
Wild declined to comment for this story.
Lucas doesn’t want to say much about Benn and Wild’s departure.
But he lauds them for sticking it out in Melbourne during COVID, particularly when they didn’t have family living locally. Society’s kitchen – which he describes as the “most amazing” in Australia – wouldn’t exist without Benn, he says.
Benn and Wild recently announced they are opening a $35 million four-level private members’ club three minutes’ walk from Bâtard.
“Thousands of people come through these businesses, play their role and then move on,” Lucas says. “They played a key role, and they’ll always be part of that history moving forward.”
Some industry insiders believe Society didn’t live up to its vision. Its enormous kitchen, bespoke chandeliers and soaring ceilings still impress, and it is a “very good restaurant” that pulls a crowd. But hot, innovative? Not so much.
Society dropped from two hats to one in the 2026 Good Food Guide, and the neighbouring Lillian Brasserie was de-toqued. Flinders Lane’s Grill Americano regained its hat, and Kisume returned to the Guide for the first time in four years, after several years of the restaurant’s 12-seat Chef’s Table being reviewed.
Lucas’ seven remaining large Victorian venues – including Bâtard – are without hats, although these run the gamut from casual pizzeria Baby to the perennially busy Chin Chin.
Emma Breheny, editor of The Age’s Good Food Guide, says restaurant groups often have ups and downs as they expand nationally.
“It’s a lot of balls to keep in the air. Grill Americano, for example, was awarded two hats in its first year, then dropped to one, then none, and is now back to one hat,” she says.
“Within big groups, the focus and energy gets stretched in a way that’s different to owner-operator venues, where the boss is in there every day noticing every little thing.”
Bâtard and Society are Lucas’ crown jewels. The latter is an internationally recognised restaurant, but more importantly lives up to its mission of giving young Australian chefs a world-class alternative to training overseas, Lucas says. “That’s a unique thing.”
The two faces of a culinary king
In Lucas’ great dominions, it’s a bit of a novelty for staff when he visits for a meal.
Sorcha Harrop, a bartender at Chin Chin between October 2016 and July 2017, says he came in for lunch during one of her shifts and she tried acknowledging him a few times – but was ignored. Lucas denied the exchange.
Harrop launched legal action against the Lucas Group in November 2017, alleging she was underpaid, but withdrew it after the company agreed to back-pay her $9500.
In 2019, this masthead revealed a broader audit found more of Lucas’ workers were paid less than the minimum rates of the award – an error for which Lucas says his company was “absolutely exonerated”.
The Fair Work Ombudsman formally cautioned the Lucas Group in July 2020 following an investigation. The ombudsman confirmed the company paid back affected employees and had overhauled its payroll systems.
When the underpayment audit was revealed, Harrop claimed the company, which has since grown to almost 2000 employees, “exploited eager, passionate people and worked them to the bone”.
But other people describe working at Lucas’ restaurants as creative, exciting, fun; the ultimate resume addition in a youthful and naturally transient industry. And Lucas is one of its most recognisable champions.
Pakula, a key player in Andrews’ cabinet over two terms, recalls receiving a rush of texts from Melbourne restaurateurs throughout the pandemic – each of whom suddenly had his personal mobile number.
The messages detailed the pressure the industry was under and what the government should do to ease it, he says.
It wasn’t until two years later, while chatting with Caterina’s Cucina e Bar owner Caterina Borsato over lunch, that Pakula found out it was Lucas handing out his number, and mobilising restaurateurs to hassle him. He ran into him a couple of nights later at an event and told him jokingly, “you’re sprung, mate”.
“The thing with Chris is, you can have a pretty robust conversation with him and a pretty robust disagreement, and he’s not sensitive … he doesn’t bear a grudge, and I like to think I don’t either,” Pakula says.
“That’s a good, healthy relationship. I actually value it quite a bit.”
In 2024, Lucas launched the Australian Restaurant and Cafe Association. Its sole focus is having a seat at the government’s table when it comes to policy issues including tax, wages and skilled worker migration – an industry first, Lucas says.
Merivale – a Sydney-based restaurant group run by Justin Hemmes, which is seeking to expand into Melbourne – had a seat on the association’s board, but stepped down following allegations of sexual harassment, exploitation and drug use at the company’s Sydney venues. The allegations were reported by this masthead and 60 Minutes and are denied by Merivale.
I ask Lucas whether, as the association’s deputy chair, he had any say in Merivale’s stepping down.
“I can’t really disclose what goes on and what doesn’t go on,” he says.
“We’ve worked really hard over the last 30 years to create amazing restaurants [and] safe workplaces, where women can feel safe, young people can feel safe.
“I feel a bit of a parental obligation as well. I’ve always felt that way, which is why, during COVID, I went to great lengths to protect my kids and my people, because I felt they’re like family.”
According to hospitality insiders, Lucas thought it was embarrassing when City Of Melbourne Lord Mayor Nicholas Reece recently posed for a photo with Merivale’s billionaire boss Hemmes.
Lucas quietly campaigned for Reece’s deputy, Roshena Campbell, before she joined Reece on Melbourne’s mayoral ticket in mid-2024. When I interview Lucas, he says he supports them both.
The restaurateur would have more venues around Australia by now if it weren’t for COVID-19, as his ambition has always been for a national and international business, he says.
He’s just unveiled a characteristically bold second foray into Sydney: Grill Americano in the centre of the city’s “prime-cut zone”.
Lucas’ business acumen and ambition demand respect from his peers – and in his hometown, Geelong, he is a hero.
The restaurateur is a long-time supporter of the Cats, and in 2024 the AFL club approached him to open Club Chin Chin at GMHBA Stadium.
The regional outpost “speaks volumes” about what the restaurateur is trying to achieve, Cats chief executive Steve Hocking says.
“He’s very thoughtful about where he places [his restaurants], and the access people have to them,” Hocking tells me.
Local hospitality matriarch Lyndsay Sharp, who is also on the Cats’ board, describes Lucas as a risk-taker who is “always raising the bar”, while Brown says the restaurateur has more energy than men half his age.
But there’s a lesser-known side to Lucas: he’s a romantic, his former publicist says. “I don’t think many people you speak to will describe him like that.”
It’s a side of Lucas likely born in his uncle’s restaurant, where – as a starry-eyed kid – he fell under the allure of towering cakes, croquembouches and ice sculptures, in what felt like “a fancy show” he couldn’t afford.
Back at Bâtard, it comes through in the light cast by the hanging lanterns outside, which beckon diners to escape from the chaos of Melbourne’s CBD.
It draws their gaze to the sparkling Parisian chandelier centrepiece of the restaurant’s first floor, and blares through speakers on its ceiling, where Nat King Cole sings “Love was made for me and you …”
Lucas has become the curator of his own fantasy – and he’ll step on anyone who tries to take it from him.
Crisis support is available 24/7 from Lifeline (13 11 14).
The author dined at Maison Bâtard as a guest of the Lucas Collective.

Michael Mohammed Ahmad confronts traumatic childhood abuse in his new novel, Bugger
Michael Mohammed Ahmad is marking his 40th birthday with the publication of his most confronting book yet.
Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse.
Ahmad is the founder of the influential Sweatshop Literacy Movement, a Western Sydney collective committed to giving voice to diverse communities.
He's also the author of four novels, including The Lebs (2018) and The Other Half of You (2021), both shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Literary Award.
His latest novel, published this month, is Bugger, an unsparing account of 24 hours in the life of a 10-year-old boy who is sexually assaulted by his 17-year-old cousin.
A proponent of own-voices writing, Ahmad draws on his own experience of childhood sexual abuse in the novel.
It's a book he says he couldn't have written earlier in his writing career.
"I don't think I could have done this 20 years ago when I first began writing," he tells ABC Radio National's The Book Show.
"I'll turn 40 this week, and it's taken me 40 years, really, to live the kind of life and develop the education and the skill set, as well as the courage and resilience, to put together this book.
"I was ready to tell the story at the time that I started writing it, but it took me my entire life to get here."
The tragedy of abuse
The process of writing the novel, followed by the back-and-forth of editing, was gruelling for Ahmad.
"Every time I had to work on the book, every time I had to sit down and write in explicit detail some of the scenes, the quite harrowing scenes, I had to relive the story itself. I had to relive the memories," he says.
He was also cognisant of the effect the book's publication could have on his family and others in his circle: "The victims, myself included, and also the perpetrators, and then the enablers, the people around the victims and the perpetrators and how they participated in the crimes that are depicted in the book."
The author is aware that Bugger is a book that deals with a distressing subject.
"The tragedy of sexual abuse against a child is the worst thing that can happen to a family," he says. "And I come from a family where we've had many tragedies."
Other kinds of misfortune — illness, death or accident — often bring families together in their grief, he says.
"Whether it's at home or at the funeral or at the cemetery, in the days, the weeks, the months and sometimes even in the years after, family members are literally holding each other, consoling each other, checking in on each other, bringing food over for one another."
Child sexual abuse often plays out differently.
"It's the kind of story that doesn't bring a family together. It's the kind of story that absolutely tears an entire family apart," he says.
"Not least of all, and this is probably the most important detail … because in many cases, family members will side with and protect the perpetrator over the victim."
This last point informed his decision to write the novel as a first-person narrative in the present-tense, rather than give the narrator, Hamoodi, the advantage of hindsight.
"I want to emphasise that I did write it very delicately and sensitively because I was aware of the pain that some readers might go through," he says.
"[But] I really wanted to show the confusion, not just the pain, but the confusion that a child [who is the victim of sexual abuse] goes through."
Discussing the book on ABC Radio National's The Bookshelf, co-host Cassie McCullagh says the result is "a convincing and evocative portrayal of the life of a child through their eyes".
Fellow host Kate Evans agrees. "It's deliberately discomforting and almost claustrophobic," she says.
"It's being trapped under the sheets with the boy, and with the experience and with the secrecy and the silence, which makes it relentless but also powerful."
'Write like you're dead'
Despite the deeply personal and traumatic nature of the story he tells in the novel, Ahmad approaches it with unflinching honesty.
"I consider myself literally an open book," he says. "There's no question that I find offensive. There's no conversation that I would shy away from having."
This sense of fearlessness has always underpinned Ahmad's creative writing practice.
"You have to produce your work like you're dead," he says
"I strongly believe that if a writer isn't 100 per cent truthful in what they are trying to communicate to their audience, then, by extension, the audience won't believe what they're saying.
"You have to be willing to open yourself up to be completely vulnerable and to confront the darkest elements of your lived experiences and your reality."
It's a philosophy shared by his Sweatshop colleagues, including Winnie Dunn, whose debut novel Dirt Poor Islanders was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Literary Award in 2025.
But "writing like you're dead" requires a thick skin and a disregard for any ensuing fallout.
"You can't be afraid of consequences," he says.
"If I spent too much time thinking about the possible outcomes, how it might affect me or affect certain people in my life that I care for dearly, I think I would get cold feet and prevent myself from doing it or going all the way with what I need to communicate.
"So, I tend to try and block out that possibility while I'm creating the work."
Justice for victims
Ahmad closes his novel with "un-acknowledgements" rather than the usual gratitude-filled acknowledgement section.
The two-line paragraph reads:
"How cruel of me to ask any decent person to take credit for such a book? How selfish of me to ask any dignified creature to share its burden?"
Ahmad says he initially tried to write a typical acknowledgements section.
"I must have written about 30 variations of an acknowledgements, but every time I did, I found myself very overwhelmed emotionally.
"Everybody that I love dearly and that I'm grateful towards for having helped me produce this book, I didn't want to taint their name with the tragic story that unfolds."
The author has already received correspondence from people who have read the book.
"The first thing they do is they thank me for having the courage to come forward and tell this story, and then they share their own story … of abuse or the experience of somebody they love who's been through abuse," he says.
It's a note of hope in an otherwise bleak episode.
"If the book can provide an opportunity for us as a country to have the conversation, to find the confidence and the courage to come forward, and in doing so, destigmatise this widespread issue, I think that could ultimately lead to justice for victims," Ahmad says.
Bugger is published by Hachette Australia.

Trump pardons 5 former NFL players ranging from perjury to drug trafficking
Ex-NFL players Joe Klecko, Nate Newton, Jamal Lewis, Travis Henry and the late Billy Cannon are all granted clemency.
President Donald Trump has pardoned five former professional football players – one posthumously – for various crimes ranging from perjury to drug trafficking.
The pardons were announced on Friday by White House pardon czar Alice Marie Johnson. Ex-NFL players Joe Klecko, Nate Newton, Jamal Lewis, Travis Henry and the late Billy Cannon were granted clemency.

“As football reminds us, excellence is built on grit, grace, and the courage to rise again. So is our nation,” Johnson wrote on the social media site X, as she thanked Trump for his “continued commitment to second chances”.
Johnson said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones “personally” shared the news with Newton, who won three Super Bowls with the team.
The White House did not return a request for comment Thursday night on why Trump, an avid sports fan, pardoned the players.
Klecko, a former star for the New York Jets, pleaded guilty to perjury after lying to a federal grand jury that was investigating insurance fraud. A defensive lineman, Klecko was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2023. He was a two-time Associated Press All-Pro player and a four-time Pro Bowler.
Newton, an offensive lineman, pleaded guilty to a federal drug trafficking charge after authorities discovered $10,000 in his pick-up truck as well as 175 pounds (79kg) of marijuana in an accompanying car driven by another man. Newton was a two-time All-Pro player and six-time Pro Bowler.
Lewis, formerly of the Baltimore Ravens and the Cleveland Browns, pleaded guilty in a drug case in which he used a cellphone to try to set up a drug deal not long after he was a top pick in the 2000 NFL draft. Lewis, a running back, was named an All-Pro once and was a one-time Pro Bowler. He was named the 2003 AP Offensive Player of the Year.
Henry, who played for the Denver Broncos, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to traffic cocaine for financing a drug ring that moved the drug between Colorado and Montana. He was a running back for three teams and a one-time Pro Bowler.
And Cannon — who played with the Houston Oilers, Oakland Raiders and Kansas City Chiefs — admitted to counterfeiting in the mid-1980s after a series of bad investments and debts left him broke.
Cannon was a two-time All-Pro player and a two-time Pro Bowler. Cannon also won the 1959 Heisman Trophy while starring for Louisiana State University, where he had one of the most memorable plays in college football history: an 89-yard punt return for a touchdown against Ole Miss. He died in 2018.

MUNICH, Germany — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that U.S. leadership can no longer be taken for granted and Europe must prepare to stand more firmly on its own, in a stark warning to world leaders in Munich.
“The leadership claim of the U.S. is being challenged, perhaps already lost,” Merz said during the opening of the Munich Security Conference, laying out the starkest assessment yet from Berlin of a world increasingly defined by great-power rivalry. “In the era of great powers, our freedom is no longer simply guaranteed. It is under threat.”
He argued the global system itself may already have collapsed. “The international order based on rights and rules … no longer exists in the way it once did,” he said.

Two Britons among three dead in French Alps avalanche
Two Britons and one French person have died in an avalanche in the French Alps on Friday.
The British pair were part of a group of five people accompanied by an instructor, off-piste skiing in Val d'Isère, a spokesperson for the resort told the BBC.
The French national was skiing alone, Albertville prosecutor Benoit Bachelet said in a statement announcing the deaths .
Another British person has minor injuries, he added.
A manslaughter investigation has now been launched by the Albertville public prosecutor's office and will be carried out by CRS Alpes mountain rescue police.
The ski instructor, who was unharmed, tested negative after taking alcohol and drug tests, according to Bachelet.
France's national weather service had issued a red alert for avalanche risk across the Savoie region on Thursday, which was then lifted on Friday. But the risk level remained high across the Alps with "very unstable snow cover".
The avalanche comes in the wake of Storm Nils, which passed through France the day before, leaving between 60cm and 100cm of snow, the weather service said.
There have been a number of fatal avalanches in the region in recent weeks, including the death of a British man off-piste skiing at the La Plagne resort in January.

Trump warns of 'very big force' if talks with Iran fail

President Donald Trump has said that the US is prepared to deploy a “very big force” if ongoing negotiations with Iran fail.
"Well, in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it," Trump told reporters when asked why he decided to send a second aircraft carrier to the region.
"It'll be leaving. It'll be leaving very soon. We have one out there that just arrived. We have it ready. A big, a very big force," he added.
His remarks came after local media reported that the US would send the USS Gerald R. Ford to the Middle East to back up the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group.
Venezuela
Trump said that he plans to visit Venezuela, citing what he described as strong ties between the two countries and growing cooperation in the oil sector.
“I’m going to visit Venezuela. We haven’t decided (when),” Trump told reporters at the White House.
Trump praised relations with interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez, saying Washington and Caracas are “working together very closely,” particularly on energy.
“We have a very good relationship,” he said, adding that major US oil companies are operating in the country and that the partnership is generating significant revenue.
“The relationship we have right now with Venezuela is, I would say, a 10.”
Asked whether the US recognises Rodriguez’s administration as Venezuela’s official government, Trump responded, “We have done that. We’re dealing with them.”
He said oil production is on the rise and that the US is refining Venezuelan crude, describing the relationship as “strong”.
US Energy Secretary Chris Wright visited the South American country this week to assess its oil industry and hold talks with the interim government centred on a massive overhaul of the country’s energy sector to revitalise its economy and reintegrate its oil reserves into the global market.
Wright’s high-profile visit to Venezuela follows a political shift on January 3, when US forces abducted President Nicolas Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in a raid in Caracas and transported them to New York, where they are being held in a federal detention facility.

Using Starlink ruse, Ukrainian cyber forces trick Russian soldiers into revealing positions, donating to armed forces
A Ukrainian cyber unit claims it tricked Russian soldiers into revealing their positions and donating money to Ukraine's Armed Forces by pretending to help them reconnect Starlink devices they were using on the battlefield.
Russian forces have long been using unauthorized Starlink access to operate drones and other military equipment in occupied areas of Ukraine, but this was effectively switched off last week after the Ukrainian government, in cooperation with SpaceX, introduced a mandatory registration and "whitelist system.
Monopolizing on Russia's desperation to regain access to a crucial battlefield technology, Ukrainian cyber forces posed as a Russian-linked activation service offering to help restore terminals that had been disconnected under the new registration rules.
The operation was carried out by the 256th Cyber Assault Division in cooperation with the InformNapalm and MILITANT, according to a statement published on social media on Feb. 12.
Russian servicemen were instructed to submit identifying information and the coordinates of their terminals under the guise that the devices would be reactivated through Ukrainian administrative service centers.
The group said they collected 2,420 data packets related to Russian-used terminals and transferred them to Ukrainian law enforcement and defense agencies. According to the statement, the data was provided to authorities "for final transfer into brick mode," referring to the disabling of the terminals.
The group claims the terminals were subsequently deactivated. The Kyiv Independent could not independently verify the claims.
The group also said it received $5,870 from Russian soldiers seeking to restore connectivity which it is donating to fundraising efforts for Ukrainian drones.
It also identified 31 Ukrainian "traitors" willing to assist Russian forces by registering terminals. According to the statement, that information has been forwarded to Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU).
Starlink, which provides high-speed satellite internet without reliance on local mobile networks, has become critical infrastructure on both sides of the war. Ukrainian forces rely heavily on the system for frontline communications and drone coordination. At the same time, Kyiv has accused Russia of exploiting the technology to improve battlefield connectivity.
On Feb. 10, Ukraine’s Coordination Headquarters for the Treatment of Prisoners of War said Russia was coercing the families of Ukrainian POWs into registering Starlink terminals, describing the tactic as another attempt to bypass Ukraine’s new verification system.

Man indicted for murder after fatal helicopter crash and shootout in Flagstaff
The suspect hopped from roof to roof while shooting at officers, police said
- Bookmark
An Arizona man has been indicted on two counts of first degree felony murder and dozens of other charges after a helicopter crashed during a shootout.
Terrell Storey, 50, opened fire on officers from multiple rooftops in a Flagstaff neighborhood on the night of Feb. 4 in a standoff that lasted over two hours, police said.
As he was being captured, a state helicopter crash responding to the shooting crashed. Trooper paramedic Hunter Bennett, 28, and pilot Robert Skankey, 61, were killed.
The indictment does not specify whether Storey fired at the helicopter with the semiautomatic long rifle that police said he was using. The cause of the crash remains under investigation by federal authorities.
After his arrest, Storey was hospitalized for gunshot wounds that were not life-threatening.
Coconino County Attorney Ammon Barker said Friday that he anticipates Storey will be arraigned on Feb. 23 but declined further comment on the facts of the case.
The indictment names as victims 25 law enforcement officers who responded to the scene and people who live in homes in the area.
The indictment totals 60 criminal counts, including the two felony murder charges for the deaths of Bennett and Skankey. Other charges include aggravated assault, burglary disorderly conduct and endangerment.
Storey remained hospitalized Friday, said Jon Paxton with the Coconino County Sheriff’s Office.
He's being held on a $5 million bond and is represented by the Coconino County Public Defender’s Office. The Associated Press left a voicemail message for Public Defender Jennifer Stock.
The confrontation that led to the helicopter crash began when officers responded to a domestic violence call, according to Flagstaff Police Chief Sean Connolly.
As the officers spoke with the victim in the front yard, Storey shot at them from the back of the residence with a semiautomatic rifle, Connolly said. A protracted gunbattle ensued, with the suspect “hopping from roof to roof” in the neighborhood while shooting at officers, the chief said.
The helicopter crew had been playing a common role, helping officers on the ground. Before crashing, the helicopter was making a pass back to the shootout scene when it slowed to almost a hover about 1,000 feet (300 meters) over a hilltop, according to public flight-path data.
Skankey was a longtime resident of Kingman, Arizona, and had been hired by the Arizona Department of Public Safety in May 2021. He previously served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was married with four children.
Bennett was an honors graduate of Arizona State University and the top graduate of his 2023 Arizona Law Enforcement Academy class. He transferred to an air rescue unit in 2024 and months later married his high school sweetheart, officials said.
Barker said in a statement announcing the indictment that his office was “committed to pursuing this case with the diligence and care it requires.”
“Our hearts remain with the families of Hunter Bennett and Robert Skankey, and with all the families impacted by this incident,” Barker said.

Here's what we know about Angus Taylor's policies
In short:
Angus Taylor says the Liberal Party will focus on "Australian values" under his leadership.
He has foreshadowed a stricter immigration policy and a focus on deregulation.
What's next?
The Liberal Party is expected to release its immigration policy within a few weeks.
New Liberal leader Angus Taylor has signalled he will pursue a stricter immigration policy and a return to "Australian values" in his first pitch to win back voters.
Mr Taylor said the party would not be moving "left, right or centre", but rather focusing on "hard-working Australians".
Standing in front of six Australian flags in Canberra yesterday, he outlined some core principles for the Liberal Party's direction under his leadership.
His policies remain light on detail for now, but we know Mr Taylor backs himself, after famously commenting "Well done Angus" on his own social media post.
But will Australia? Here's the promise so far.
Immigration
Mr Taylor will unveil an immigration policy within weeks and said it would be a key priority for the party, both as a vehicle to reduce cost-of-living pressures and to "protect the Australian way of life".
"It is clear that numbers have been too high, and standards have been too low," he said.
"If someone doesn't subscribe to our core beliefs, the door must be shut."
When asked who those people might be, Mr Taylor was not definitive but referenced the Bondi terror attack and said Australians were "less free".
"Our borders have been opened to people who hate our way of life. People who don't want to embrace Australia, and who want Australia to change for them,"he said.
Mr Taylor said he wanted immigrants to adhere to core beliefs in democracy, the rule of law and basic freedoms.
But he also said he believed "good migration" was in Australia's best interests.
"But we don't want bad immigration," he said.
This rhetoric is similar to comments from One Nation politicians, and in the Newspoll that preceded Sussan Ley's last days as leader, pollsters found almost a third of responders preferred One Nation's policies on immigration over the major parties.
Mr Taylor insisted his party was not trying to become One Nation "lite".
"We are not seeking to be One Nation lite — but we respect the fact that those voters who might be thinking about One Nation have reasons to do so. We need to restore their confidence in us."
Cost of living
Mr Taylor said he wanted to reduce financial pressure on families, including "expanding choice in child care", and indicated he did not support Labor's universal childcare model.
He also touched on energy costs and said Australia's energy policy needed to be "based on common sense, not Labor's net-zero ideology".
The Liberals believe some of Labor's carbon taxes, including on family vehicles, electricity and manufacturing, should be scrapped.
Mr Taylor said he also wanted to re-establish home ownership as the "centrepiece of the Australian dream".
"All Australians, especially young Australians, deserve the stability and the opportunity to own a home."
The economy
Mr Taylor said he considered free markets central to the economic prosperity of Australia.
"Bigger government isn't the solution to Australia's problems. Australians are the solution,"he said.
The Liberal leader, who served as shadow treasurer under Peter Dutton, said the party would focus on growing the economy, deregulation and scrapping "bad taxes".
"We will ferociously fight Labor's bad taxes — taxes on homes, taxes on superannuation, taxes on our children's future."
He also said he did not like tariffs.
"And I'm going to continue to fight for access to markets for our resources, our miners, our farmers, manufacturers, our service providers."
The policies we won't see
Mr Taylor took some responsibility for the Coalition's lacklustre economic policies taken to the last election, but would not be drawn into an analysis of the election campaign.
He acknowledged the party had "got some big calls wrong", including its opposition to Labor's income tax cuts.
But he said the Liberals had learned lessons from the election and were committed to being the "party of lower taxes".
New deputy leader Jane Hume was also forced to answer for her part in the work-from-home policy the Coalition scrapped midway through the campaign after a massive backlash from its base.
"That policy was a mistake which is why we didn't take it to the election," Ms Hume said.
"We won't be taking it to a future election."

Air Force Working with Collins, Shield AI to Build Autonomy Software for CCAs

The Air Force is working with Collins Aerospace and Shield AI to develop the software Collaborative Combat Aircraft will use to fly missions alongside manned fighters, the service revealed Feb. 12—and drone-maker General Atomics was quick to announce it has already flown its YFQ-42A aircraft with Collins’ system.
Shield AI, meanwhile, said Feb. 13 it expects to start flight testing its software on Anduril Industries’ YFQ-44A drone “in the coming months.”
The two companies are developing “mission” autonomy software, which will allow CCAs to take complex action when given basic directions from a pilot in a manned aircraft. Shield AI, for example, noted in a release that its system allows aircraft to “reroute around no-fly zones, avoid or engage obstacles, respond to unexpected conditions, and complete missions safely and effectively without human intervention.”
That’s separate from but related to the flight autonomy software responsible for executing basic or preplanned operations, like taking off, sticking to a flight path, or landing.
Anduril and General Atomics have been publicly competing to build the first aircraft for the CCA program since April 2024, and the Air Force has announced milestones like first flights and designations.
By comparison, the competition to build the software that will enable the drones to operate semi-autonomously had been kept largely secret until now. Back in July 2024, officials revealed that five companies were working on the “mission” software side of the program but declined to name them citing security concerns. Then, in September 2025, Aviation Week reported that Collins and Shield had been selected to move forward, but no official announcement followed.
Now, nearly six months later, the Air Force has confirmed the two firms’ selection. The service release touted the integration of both into the Autonomy Government Reference Architecture—the open, universal standard the government has set for mission autonomy software that all contractors must build their systems to comply with.
“Verifying A-GRA across multiple partners is critical to our acquisition strategy,” Col. Timothy Helfrich, portfolio acquisition executive for fighters and advanced aircraft, said in a statement. “It proves that we are not locked into a single solution or a single vendor. We are instead building a competitive ecosystem where the best algorithms can be deployed rapidly to the warfighter on any A-GRA compliant platform, regardless of the vendor providing the algorithm.”
Collins is paired with General Atomics, while Shield AI is working with Anduril—feeding into the dynamic of “established Pentagon supplier vs. Silicon Valley startup” that has defined the GA-Anduril competition. Collins has gone through various mergers and acquisitions but traces its roots back decades, while Shield AI was founded in 2015 and quickly expanded with backing from venture capital firms.
Shortly after the Air Force made its announcement, General Atomics published its own release with additional details on how it has already started flight testing Collins’ software on the YFQ-42A.
Testing began earlier this month, GA’s release states, and Collins’ software, dubbed “Sidekick,” controlled the drone for more than four hours. During that time, a human operator on the ground provided “various commands” to the drone and the software interpreted those commands and directed the aircraft to execute them “with high accuracy,” the release states.
GA’s release also notes that since the YFQ-42A made its first flight in August 2025, the company has built and flown “multiple” aircraft, including instances of “push-button autonomous takeoffs and landings”—using flight autonomy software separate from the mission software. An image accompanying the release shows three YFQ-42s on a flightline.
Ryan Bunge, vice president and general manager for strategic defense solutions at Collins, said in a statement that “the rapid integration of Sidekick onto this platform to perform various combat-relevant tasks highlight the strength and adaptability of Collins’ open systems approach. The autonomy capabilities showcased in this flight highlight nearly a decade of dedicated investment and close collaboration with our customers to advance collaborative mission autonomy.”
Anduril and Shield AI, meanwhile, released their own statements promising flight tests with Shield’s “Hivemind” autonomy software in the near future—Shield’s release states that flight demonstrations are expected “in the coming months,” while Anduril’s says the firm is looking forward to a first flight “very soon.”
Shield noted in its release that Hivemind has already operated on multiple other aircraft, including General Atomics’ MQ-20 Avenger drone, the U.S. Navy’s BQM-177 target drone, and Airbus’ H145 helicopter.
“Shield AI is proud to be named a mission autonomy provider supporting the Collaborative Combat Aircraft program,” Gary Steele, the firm’s CEO, said in a statement. “The Air Force is moving with urgency to explore how autonomy can reshape air combat, and we have spent years preparing for this—building, testing, and flying mission autonomy in the real world. We will work relentlessly to deliver and to help advance the next era of airpower alongside the Air Force and its industry partners.”
Anduril, meanwhile, emphasized the YFQ-44A’s modularity.
“The aircraft’s simple design, external weapons stores, and open hardware and software architectures ensure that the aircraft can easily be configured with a range of mission systems, software suites, and payloads to support a wide variety of missions,” Jason Levin, senior vice president of engineering, said.

Zelenskyy: Ukraine negotiating with partners on largest ever aid package by 24 February
Ukraine is expecting several major aid packages ahead of the anniversary of the Russian full-scale invasion and has received positive signals from its partners.
Source: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking to journalists in Munich, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Zelenskyy shared these expectations after a so-called Berlin-format meeting with Ukraine's partners, which included European, EU and NATO leaders. He said the main subject of the discussions was the energy situation.
"We discussed the most complex energy issues we have in Ukraine in detail. And we discussed with the entire Berlin group the separate aid packages in addition to those that are currently being prepared," Zelenskyy said.
Early arrangements suggest that the joint energy aid package could be record-breaking in size. "I think we can now work on the largest energy assistance package," Zelenskyy noted.
He emphasised that the package is expected to be finalised very quickly, and that large military aid packages are also anticipated.
Quote: "Separately, we will work on air defence missiles and other measures to strengthen our armed forces. We want – and all partners have agreed – to deliver the maximum support packages for Ukraine within 10-11 days, by 24 February. We want the packages, decisions and hopefully also sanctions to be ready by the 24th."
Background:
- Earlier, in Munich, Zelenskyy discussed joint weapons production with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.
- Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said that agreements on rapid accession to the EU are realistic and negotiations are ongoing.
- An AI-generated video depicting drones striking targets in Davos and Brussels was shown at the Munich Security Conference.

How the Space Force Is Managing Growth at Its Busiest Launch Range
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
18:24:16 UTC
03:24:16 KST

If the forecast holds, the world’s busiest spaceport is poised to get even busier.
The Space Force’s latest projections show that its Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida could be supporting as many as 500 launches annually by 2036—a fivefold increase over the next 10 years.
That forecast is based on business projections from each of the major launch companies who have pads at the spaceport, including SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin, as well as newcomers like Firefly, Stoke, and Relativity. Their backlogs are filled with commercial and government customers making plans for proliferated constellations with hundreds to thousands of satellites. They’re also seeing demand from the Pentagon itself, which is growing increasingly dependent on space for things like navigation and communication and wants more spacecraft to track and even intercept threats.
Rapid growth is nothing new for the range, which is home to both Cape Canaveral and NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Over the last decade, SpaceX’s mastery of reusable rocketry and its prolific launch rate—combined with the rise of proliferated satellite constellations and demand for space-enabled services—has spiked the spaceport’s annual launch rate from around 18 missions in 2016 to 109 last year.
The Space Force in recent years been managing that growth by rethinking the way it operates its ranges, running them more like commercial spaceports than government launch facilities. That means streamlining processes, introducing more automation, relocating office buildings to increase efficiency, and pushing for policy changes that allow it to collect more fees from the companies that use its facilities and reinvest them in infrastructure improvement projects. Congress has allocated $1.3 billion between fiscal 2024 to 2028 for the service to make those improvements at the Cape and its West Coast range at Vandenberg Space Force in California, part of an effort called “Spaceport of the Future.”
Col. Brian Chatman, who oversees operations at the Cape as commander of Space Launch Delta 45, said that funding is helping reshape the landscape at the range, but there’s more work to be done and more resources needed to meet an annual cadence of 500 launches—a milestone he thinks could come much sooner than 2036.
Chatman’s instinct to be prepared for launch rates to grow faster than expected is based on past experience. In 2017, the Space Force projected the Eastern Range would hit the century mark—100 launchs per year—by 2030. The service reached that cadence in 2025.
“We’re laying in plans now for 500 in ‘36, but I would not be at all surprised if we saw that happen sooner,” he told Air & Space Forces Magazine in an interview. “Right now, 500 by 2030 is really what I’m pushing the team to build the plans to.”
Spaceport of the Future
With funding in hand for the first phase of the Spaceport of the Future infrastructure overhaul, SLD 45 has spent much of the last two years in design mode, finalizing building plans and relocating offices to ensure it’s making the most of its limited footprint.
One such project involves relocating government workspaces that are currently scattered throughout what’s known as the “industrial area,” where launch service providers assemble and test their rockets and prepare hardware to be transported. By consolidating the government functions in another area of the range, Chatman said, companies can expand and use that space more efficiently.
Another project will move some of the range’s weather balloon release stations that are currently situated within one of the launch complex’s blast damage assessment areas, which can cause schedule issues that Chatman said have led to launches being scrubbed.
“Relocating the weather balloon release facility more inland to decouple it from the blast damage assessment area of one of the launch complexes allows us then to be able to continue to support weather balloon releases while, simultaneously, launches are happening, and allows people to access the weather balloon location to release those weather balloons while we’re doing hazardous operations in and around the launch sites,” he said.
Construction on these and other phase one projects will start early this year and continue for the next three years or so, Chatman said.
Spaceport 2036
But the work won’t stop after that. As the SLD 45 team completes the first round of projects, it’s also making plans for upgrades it will need to support the growth it expects by 2036, if not sooner—projects it didn’t account for as part of the Spaceport of the Future initiative. The service is still finalizing its strategy in partnership with NASA and its launch providers, and Chatman said the goal is to have it finalized this summer and then included as part of the Space Force’s fiscal 2028 budget request.
Through its meetings with industry, the Eastern Range team identified five broad focus areas it needs to address to support a higher launch cadence:
- infrastructure and utilities
- transportation and access limitations
- commodity supply chains
- process and organizational alignment
- expanded launch support facilities
One major need, Chatman said, is for a transport lane dedicated to moving rocket boosters across the range. Today, the base relies on one main travel route to get on and off the Cape. Launch vendors use that same lane to transport rockets to the pad and—as more companies transition to reusable vehicles—to bring spent boosters back to their processing facilities.
That wasn’t an issue when the range was supporting 10 or 20 launches a year, but today, it presents a real challenge. Chatman said the issue was on full display last November after Blue Origin’s New Glenn made its second flight and the company recovered its booster. Getting the booster from the wharf to the company’s processing facility took more than four hours and caused major disruption to traffic flow.
“That was four and a half hours that we had to come up with alternate means for personnel just to get to work,” Chatman said. “I’ve got to have dedicated routes for those transports to happen, again, to maximize efficiency for all operations happening now on the Eastern Range.
The range is also considering changes to the way it provides utilities and delivers commodities, like fuel, to launch sites. Today, it moves fuel via hundreds of trucks and is seeing a growing demand for power and wastewater treatment, Chatman said.
“As we look to increase the amount of launches, that increases the amount of wastewater that is being produced,” he said. “A wastewater treatment facility that can grow and stay on par with the requirements to be able to handle that wastewater coming off those launch vehicles is something we didn’t account for in the first Spaceport of the Future.”
Near-Term Needs
While the bulk of these projects will be included in future budget requests, Chatman said the range is hopeful it might be able to secure funding for a few more pressing needs in the fiscal 2027 budget, due for release this spring. That includes the booster transport lane and some of the commodity distribution needs.
Chatman said he’s also trying to make a case for more near-term funding to fill personnel gaps. SLD 45 has 3,000 personnel, about 2,000 of them government civilians. The range has never fully recovered from cuts made during sequestration in 2012 and then took an additional hit last year as civilian employees left via the government’s deferred resignation program.
Today, the range has 450 approved but unfilled manpower billets that Chatman said he lacks the funding to fill. Those positions are crucial during what could be five to 10 years of construction at the Eastern Range, providing everything from legal support to navigate environmental regulations to maintaining day-to-day operations.
“The team is absolutely getting after it, but one of the conversations we’re having within Space Systems Command and across the Air Force and Space Force is, I need some additional bodies to be able to meet that cadence we have going forward,” Chatman said. “We are methodically going through and executing as fast and as hard as we can, but within the constraints that we have, just from a limited manpower and resourcing perspective.”

Implementation of EU standards in agricultural sector requires audit of state capacity – ex-official

Implementation of EU standards in agricultural sector requires audit of state capacity – ex-official
The successful implementation of European standards in Ukraine's agricultural sector depends less on passing laws than on the state's actual ability to enforce them, said former head of the State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection (2016–2019) and current serviceman of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, Volodymyr Lapa, in an interview with the channel MinSelo.
"The issue is not simply writing into law that 'we comply with EU standards.' The key question is whether the state service is prepared to enforce the new rules and whether this works in practice at every enterprise and in every laboratory. Legislation provides for an audit of the state service's capacity by the Cabinet of Ministers, but it remains unclear whether such an audit has ever been conducted," he said.
According to Lapa, the real indicator of the situation is the statistics on violations recorded by the European side.
"If we look at the trend in notifications concerning Ukrainian products over recent years, we see that their number has essentially not changed. This means the control system has not qualitatively improved, and the implementation of standards without properly trained specialists risks remaining purely declarative," the expert said.
In his view, Ukraine must change its philosophy of oversight, shifting from process control to risk-based control, following the EU model, where businesses are responsible for safety and the state is responsible for the functioning of the system itself.
"The state should not control businesses as such, but rather the risks. If an inspector comes to an enterprise just to 'tick a box' or collect a bribe, that is imitation. The state must control the quality of its own inspector's work. Until we move to a model of controlling the controllers, we will continue to receive notifications," explained the former head of the State Service for Food Safety and Consumer Protection.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday rejected an appeal by Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych against his disqualification from the Olympics.
The International Olympic Committee on Thursday blocked Heraskevych from performing at the Games for refusing to change his helmet, which depicted 22 Ukrainian athletes that Russia has killed during its war on Ukraine. The IOC said the helmet violated its guidelines on political messaging during the Games.
Heraskevych said his memorial act was not political and denied violating any rules. The IOC returned his accreditation to the Olympics, which are being held in Northern Italy, but still banned him from performing, despite a wave of support for Heraskevych from senior figures, including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Trump administration sues Harvard, accusing it of defying investigation
US authorities are seeking documents to determine whether the Ivy League university had illegally considered race in its admissions process
The Trump administration sued Harvard University on Friday, accusing it of failing to comply with a federal investigation and seeking documents to determine whether the university had illegally considered race in its admissions process.
The move comes less than two weeks after US President Donald Trump said his administration was seeking $1 billion from Harvard to settle probes into school policies, after a news report that said Trump had dropped his demand for a payment from the Ivy League school.
Harvard representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Trump’s administration has been threatening to withhold federal funds from Harvard and several other universities over issues including pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s war in Gaza, campus diversity and transgender policies.
The US Justice Department said on Friday in a press release that Harvard had “repeatedly slow-walked the pace of production and refused to produce pertinent data and documents”, including admissions policies and correspondence related to banned diversity, equity and inclusion programmes.
In the complaint filed in Boston federal court, Justice Department lawyers said the documents requested will help assess whether Harvard is complying with a 2023 decision by the US Supreme Court which said that race-conscious college admissions programmes are unconstitutional.

World's rules-based order 'no longer exists', Germany's Merz warns

World's rules-based order 'no longer exists', Germany's Merz warns
The rules-based world order "no longer exists", the German Chancellor has warned at a major security summit.
Opening the annual Munich Security Conference, Friedrich Merz told other world leaders that "our freedom is not guaranteed" in an era of big power politics, and that Europeans must be ready to make "sacrifice".
He also admitted that "a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States".
The conference is taking place on the backdrop of US President Donald Trump threatening Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland by pledging to annex the Arctic territory and his tariffs on imports from European nations.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was listening to Merz and will deliver his own speech on Saturday, earlier spoke of a "new era in geopolitics".
Some 50 world leaders are expected to attend this year's conference, where European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship will be discussed.
It comes at a time when US commitments to the Nato military alliance have been called into question. Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland has also been viewed by many European leaders as a watershed moment that has eroded trust with their biggest ally.
Trump told reporters outside the White House on Friday: "Greenland's gonna want us... We get along very well with Europe. We'll see how it works out. We're negotiating right now for Greenland."
The Russia-Ukraine war, tensions between the West and China, as well as a potential Iran-US nuclear deal are also on the agenda at the annual gathering.
Referring to multiple warnings that the rules-based order was collapsing, Merz told the conference: "I fear we must put it even more bluntly: this order, however imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form."
He also said that "a rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States. Vice-President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago".
Merz continued: "He was right. The culture war of the Maga [Make America Great Again] movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade."
Last year, Vance attacked Europe, including the UK, for policies on free speech and immigration. His speech triggered a year of unprecedented transatlantic tension.
But Merz did not write off the decades-long partnership, instead appealing directly to the US by saying "let's repair and revive transatlantic trust".
The German leader also revealed that "confidential talks" were ongoing with French President Emmanuel Macron on creating a joint European nuclear deterrent. He gave no further details.
France and the UK are the only two nuclear powers in Europe - but Germany and many other European nations have traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella within the Nato alliance for deterrence.
Addressing the conference later on Friday, Macron reiterated his call for Europe to "learn to become a geopolitical power" in the new global context.
He said Europe was already re-arming following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - but stressed that "we have to accelerate" and work collectively across the continent.
Describing the war in Ukraine's as Europe's "existential challenge", the French leader urged others not to "cave in to Russian demands" - but rather to increase pressure on Moscow to achieve a just peace.
Ahead of the Munich conference, Rubio warned that "the world is changing very fast right in front of us" after being asked whether his message to Europeans would be more conciliatory than Vance's a year ago.
"We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to sort of re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
Tensions have been heightened in recent months as Trump has repeatedly said that Greenland is vital to US national security, stating without evidence that it was "covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place".
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said earlier in the day that she planned to meet Rubio to discuss the US threats to seize Greenland from its Nato ally.

Taylor Swift rumors spiked ticket sales for Pebble Beach golf tournament
Travis Kelce is playing in the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-am, and there was a spike on ticket sales
- Bookmark
Taylor Swift boosted ticket sales to the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-am without even being there.
Pebble Beach had an extra buzz Friday morning with rumors swirling in the cool Pacific breeze Swift would be there to watch her fiancé, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, playing in the PGA Tour event that combines corporate CEOs and celebrities with golf's best.
Alas, Swifties, it was just another pretty day at Pebble Beach.
It still was good news for the Monterey Peninsula Foundation, which runs the event. Tournament director Steve John said when Kelce was announced as playing in the pro-am, more than $60,000 in tickets were sold over the next 12 hours.
Swift is rumored to be in town. But she was not at Spyglass Hill on Thursday, where Kelce was playing with pro partner Keith Mitchell along with Mackenzie Hughes and retired NFL quarterback Alex Smith.
No matter. Pebble Beach is the main attraction, and John said some $21,000 tickets for the second round were sold between 6:30 p.m. Thursday and 6:30 a.m. Friday, two hours before Kelce played.
More than 1,000 spectators lined the left side of the first fairway at Pebble Beach, but all they saw was Kelce hitting his tee shot to the right, into and out of the trees, and along the cart path (he made a par).
Sure, there was plenty of Chiefs gear in the crowd, one young girl wearing a Kansas City sweatshirt. The tournament has a long history of athletes over the years, including Ken Griffey Jr. playing in a group with Tiger Woods some 20 years ago. Roger Clemens once made a hole-in-one.
This, however, was clearly a Swift moment. Except that it wasn't.
John and his tournament staff left nothing to chance. When he wasn't busy responding to text messages — will she be there or not? — he had plans in place for security, for transportation across the course, even a secure suite overlooking the 18th green.
The big crowd — not the largest, but more than usual — followed along the Kelce group down the first few holes. They still had four hours left. They had hope.

World’s largest drone fleet deployed to deter Russia
United Kingdom

NATO is moving to expand the use of unmanned systems in the Baltic Sea, after senior Alliance officials described the deployment of a large drone fleet in 2025 as a major proof of concept for rapidly fielding commercially available technology to protect critical undersea infrastructure.
The next phase of the initiative, Task Force X Baltic, will be formalised through a new letter of intent signed by eight participating Allies, with NATO arguing the programme represents a practical shift from innovation testing towards real operational adoption.
Speaking at NATO Headquarters in Brussels, Nikolaos Loutas, Director in NATOâ€™s Defence Industry, Innovation and Armaments Division, told myself and other journalists that the effort is tied directly to the Allianceâ€™s wider post-2025 Summit drive to accelerate the pace of technology integration. â€œAt the 2025 NATO Summit, Allied governments agreed a substantial increase in our defence spending to deliver on a new ambitious set of defence targets,â€ he said, adding that they also endorsed â€œa rapid adoption action plan to accelerate the pace of technology adoption to deliver on those targets.â€ He described the action plan as a mechanism to embed innovation into defence planning, aimed at addressing what he called the urgent operational need for effective new technology. â€œThe action plan mainstreams NATOâ€™s innovation efforts into defence planning and capability development to address our Armed Forcesâ€™ urgent need for innovative and effective technological products,â€ Loutas said.
He said Allies had committed to measures designed to accelerate procurement and integration, including shared best practice, new adoption pathways, and greater experimentation to reduce risk for new products. â€œThey committed to de-risk new products through providing more testing and experimentation opportunities to innovators,â€ he said, pointing to Task Force X Baltic as one of the practical mechanisms enabling this. Loutas said the initiative is now reaching a significant milestone, with NATO preparing to launch the second phase. â€œOne measure in this direction is the Task Force X framework, which is reaching a second milestone today, a very important one, with the signing of a letter of intent for the second phase of Task Force X Baltic,â€ he told reporters.
Loutas said the first phase of Task Force X Baltic was launched in support of NATOâ€™s Baltic Sentry activity in 2025 and was intended to show that Allied forces could integrate new technology at speed alongside conventional capabilities. â€œTask Force X supports Allies rapidly acquiring, integrating and deploying new technological products alongside our conventional forces,â€ he said. He added that the project demonstrated how close collaboration between militaries and industry could deliver persistent surveillance at scale, covering multiple domains. â€œThe first phase of Task Force X Baltic demonstrated that allied navies and army forces, when collaborating closely with industry, can deliver persistent intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance from sea floor to space at speed, at scale and more affordably,â€ he said.
NATO officials said the second phase will see eight Allies reaffirm cooperation on rapidly acquiring technology-enabled, multi-domain capabilities for naval operations: Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Sweden. â€œAt todayâ€™s signing ceremonyâ€¦ eight participating Alliesâ€¦ reaffirmed their readiness to cooperate on rapidly acquiring new technology enabled multi domain capabilities for naval operations,â€ Loutas said, adding that the work supports NATOâ€™s broader Digital Ocean concept endorsed by Defence Ministers. â€œThis will contribute to the implementation of the Digital Ocean vision,â€ he said.
Alongside Task Force X Baltic, Loutas said several other multinational initiatives were progressing, including cooperation on military airworthiness in crisis or conflict, ballistic missile defence capability development, a deep precision strike initiative involving drone technology, and Swedenâ€™s entry into an existing NATO air mission memorandum. â€œAll these initiatives demonstrate concrete actions taken by Allies to meet their capability targets,â€ he said, framing them as part of the Allianceâ€™s wider effort to strengthen deterrence and defence. He added that Task Force X Baltic in particular is intended to translate experimentation into deployment, with a focus on rapid acquisition of commercial systems and real-world testing in operational conditions.
â€œWe will see commercially available drones and systems be acquired quickly and deployed in operational conditions in the Baltic Sea,â€ he said. â€œBy integrating those innovative solutions alongside our conventional forces Allies will be able to test real time interoperability and command and control integration,â€ with lessons then captured in a playbook that can be scaled. â€œLessons learnedâ€¦ will be summarised [in] a playbook which will allow NATO to scale and quickly establish further Task Force instantiations in the future,â€ he said.
NATOâ€™s Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, Admiral Pierre Vandier, linked the origins of Task Force X Baltic directly to the cable-cutting incidents in the region, saying NATO seized the moment to demonstrate rapid response and capability deployment. â€œRemember, in December one year ago, we got the cables that were cut in the Baltic,â€ he said. â€œI seized the opportunity [to] demonstrate that NATO was able to take that into account, and probably more rapidly than [people expected].â€ Vandier said the first vessels deployed quickly, with NATO able to show the presence of an unmanned fleet within a month. â€œThe first two ships that were able to sailâ€¦ was only 30 days after the cables were cut,â€ he said.
He added that the effort expanded sharply in the following weeks, reaching 50 boats before the NATO Summit. â€œDuring the following month, we demonstrate that we were able to operate a fleet of 50 boats before the summit,â€ Vandier said, claiming the United States later increased the size of the force by providing additional platforms. â€œThe USâ€¦ provided 20 boats more,â€ he said.
Vandier described the activity as unprecedented in scale, stating: â€œWe have operated during one month the biggest unmanned fleetâ€¦ on this earth.â€ He said the aim now is to move beyond experimentation and into multinational adoption, arguing that NATO is pushing towards a new era of integrated operations between traditional platforms and unmanned systems. â€œNow we are in a state whereâ€¦ we have the nations to adopt,â€ he said. â€œWe are on the way to make nations cooperate on this and open a new era of cohabitation between legacy platforms and unmanned platforms.â€ According to Vandier, such integration would increase operational dilemmas for adversaries, while also improving cost efficiency. â€œ[It] will create more dilemmas for the enemyâ€¦ and a better use of the money,â€ he said.
The Admiral repeatedly framed the case for unmanned systems as a response to both mass and affordability problems, contrasting the cost of major surface combatants with the need for persistent presence and surveillance. â€œWhen you just look atâ€¦ a frigateâ€¦ [the] price per day at sea is 5 million,â€ he said. â€œItâ€™s something you canâ€™t afford.â€ He linked this to broader lessons from Ukraine, arguing that the challenge of countering mass drone threats has forced militaries to think differently about sustainable capability.
â€œAs we seeâ€¦ where we need toâ€¦ kill these drones with affordable munitions, itâ€™s exactly the same with [unmanned surface vessels],â€ he said, describing them as a way to apply technology to achieve effects that would otherwise require prohibitively expensive force structures.
When asked how NATO intends to prevent further cable sabotage, Vandier acknowledged that physical prevention is difficult but argued that persistent surveillance and attribution are achievable through sensor networks and unmanned monitoring. â€œYou canâ€™t prevent a ship to drag its anchors on the sea bed and cutting the legs,â€ he said. â€œBut todayâ€¦ we have sensors that hear the heat of the anchor on the sea bed.â€ He said such systems can detect the act of dragging and identify responsible vessels. â€œYou hear the drag, and then, with persistence, surveillance fixed, you can identify who is the ship which is trying to do that,â€ he said, comparing it to criminal deterrence through monitoring. â€œItâ€™s exactly as robbersâ€¦ if you have video surveillance in your city, you will get them caught,â€ Vandier said.
Pressed on how large a future unmanned fleet could become, Vandier said size decisions would remain with participating nations, depending on funding and contract structures. â€œThe size of the fleet is nationsâ€™ business,â€ he said. â€œIt depends on the money and the type of contract.â€ However, he suggested that if Baltic states each fielded around 20 platforms, the region could see a fleet approaching 100 unmanned vessels, which he argued would be sufficient for monitoring the Baltic Sea. â€œIf each of the Baltic country hasâ€¦ 20 ships, weâ€™ll see a fleet of less than 100 which is worth enough to monitor the Baltic Sea and for a very limited amount of money,â€ he said.
A key theme of the briefing was the exploration of new procurement and support models, including leasing or hiring platforms rather than traditional ownership. Vandier said NATOâ€™s early work demonstrated that commercial capability could be brought into service rapidly through such approaches, with multiple companies offering solutions. â€œWe demonstrate that we were able to hire something,â€ he said. â€œYou have today a bunch of companiesâ€¦ you have some US, you have some French, you have some Danish, you have a lot of offers.â€
Loutas reinforced that Task Force X is partly intended to explore how defence acquisition must adapt to rapidly evolving systems that blur the line between hardware and software. â€œItâ€™s also an important exercise for us to understand and explore different ways of developing capabilities,â€ he said. â€œIn some cases, might make sense to acquire. In other case might make sense to lease,â€ he added, arguing that the Alliance must understand which business models deliver the best results under modern conditions.
Vandier warned that rapid technological change means long-term procurement assumptions are increasingly risky, particularly as artificial intelligence, miniaturisation and commercial communications technologies drive fast obsolescence cycles. â€œThe speed of obsolescence is very, very high,â€ he said. â€œIf you think that you will buy a ship that will be in your inventory for the next 10 years, you are making a great mistake.â€ He argued that future fleets will need regular refresh cycles for sensors, command-and-control and effectors.
â€œEach yearâ€¦ two years, you will have to refresh your C2, your effectors, [your] sensors,â€ he said. Vandier also indicated that while ISR is a core requirement, some tested systems may have additional roles, including interception. â€œSome of theâ€¦ [systems] we tested are also interceptors,â€ he said. â€œThey can be weaponised.â€
The briefing also suggested NATO is already considering how the Task Force X model could be expanded beyond the Baltic. Asked whether it could be duplicated for Arctic Sentry or Eastern Sentry operations, Vandier said a project is already under way to replicate the approach in the Arctic environment. â€œWeâ€™ve launchedâ€¦ [a] projectâ€¦ replicating this in the weather conditionsâ€¦ of the Arctic,â€ he said, noting that cold temperatures, battery limitations and rough seas present distinct challenges.
He said similar work is also being pursued in support of Eastern Sentry. â€œWe also launched something similar for Eastern Sentry,â€ Vandier said, adding that the first operational exercise in that context had already taken place in Finland last year. Looking ahead, he said NATOâ€™s transformation command plans a large-scale exercise in Romania intended to test emerging counter-drone concepts, with Ukraine involved to assess outcomes.
The Alliance sees unmanned systems as a central tool for achieving mass, persistence and affordability in contested maritime environments. With the second phase of Task Force X Baltic now being formalised, NATO is positioning the programme as a template for wider adoption, with lessons from the Baltic cable incidents driving a push to embed commercial unmanned capability into NATO capability.

‘The Motherland Is Catching Up’: Russians in Kazakhstan Feel Moscow’s Reach in String of Expulsions
Unknown

An activist who used to volunteer for organization run by the late Alexei Navalny in St. Petersburg.
Two Chechens — one fleeing war, the other punishment for criticizing regional autocrat Ramzan Kadyrov.
An IT worker from Crimea who quietly opposed Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and tried to forge a new life abroad.
The profiles of the Russians caught up in a startling new crackdown on Kremlin critics in Kazakhstan embody all the diversity of Russia’s wartime emigre population — and the grave risks such people face trying to escape persecution back home.
In a swift reversal of longstanding norms, Kazakhstan has begun planning to deport or extradite several Russian citizens since the start of the year. If sent back, their lawyers say they face lengthy prison sentences, forced conscription and, in some cases, torture.
To make matters worse, experts say the Kazakh government is circumventing the law to make it happen.
“In general, everything that is happening now is such lawlessness,” Murat Adam, an Almaty-based lawyer representing two of the Russians under threat of extradition, told The Moscow Times in an interview this week.
The news has unsettled the tens-of-thousands-strong Russian emigre community in Kazakhstan, a Kremlin-friendly nation in Central Asia that was nonetheless seen as a safe haven for refugees fleeing Putin’s regime — until recently.
In some sense, the legal guardrails that once protected them seem to have come off. Experts told The Moscow Times that sending citizens back to a country where they face such clear danger violates numerous international human rights treaties to which Astana is an observer.
At times, it has not been clear if the country is even playing by its own rules. The deportation of the IT specialist, a 25-year-old dual Russian and Ukrainian citizen named Alexander Kachkurkin, appears to have been carried out in coordination with Moscow even though the latter didn’t appear to file an extradition request.
Kazakhstan’s Prosecutor General’s Office and Foreign Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
One Russian living in Kazakhstan, speaking to The Moscow Times on condition of anonymity, said that the news has “caused alarm” in the Russian diaspora community. He is now planning to leave the country.
“Before, I felt I could live peacefully and build a career here,” the source said. “But alas, unfortunately, that is now becoming dangerous.”
A friend, he said, aptly described the sense of fear: “It’s as if the Motherland is catching up.”
‘For most people, this causes fear and concern for their lives’
For many in a similar position, trying to outrun the Motherland could describe the past four years.
The full-scale invasion of Ukraine sparked an exodus of tens of thousands of Russians fearing persecution or mobilization. Kazakhstan, with its liberal entry regime for Russian citizens, was an attractive destination for many of them. By the end of 2022, as many as 100,000 Russians had moved to the country.
It was and remains an uneasy existence. While Kazakhstan has a process for obtaining political asylum, it is practically never granted. What’s more, the country’s close relations with Russia have, in recent years, propagated fears of stricter enforcement of Moscow’s extradition requests.
Such fears were largely hypothetical until one event in late January.
When IT specialist Kachkurkin was 14, he lived through the annexation of his home region, Crimea, by the Kremlin, an event he never supported, according to a source close to his case.
“Effectively against his will, he was made a citizen of another country,” said Yevgeny Smirnov, a lawyer with the human rights group Pervy Otdel.
Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 was the final straw that prompted him to move to Kazakhstan. It was only supposed to be a temporary solution: Kachkurkin dreamed of moving to Europe or Ukraine.
In late January, he was handed administrative violations for allegedly jaywalking and smoking hookah indoors.
In response, Astana ruled to deport Kackhurking back to Russia. Immediately upon landing, he was arrested and charged with treason for allegedly transferring money to Ukraine.
Local media have reported that there was no extradition request. The Moscow Times asked Kazakhstan’s Prosecutor’s Office and Foreign Ministry if the country received such a request for Kachkurkin, but did not receive a response. Smirnov said that he has no knowledge of one in this case.
Now, he is in pre-trial detention in Moscow’s notorious Lefortovo Prison, facing a near-certain guilty verdict and a sentence of 12-15 years.
Smirnov said he believes that Astana coordinated with Russia’s security services to circumvent traditional extradition processes, which would have opened the door to appeal the move.
“I’ve probably been involved in several hundred treason cases, so I’m no longer surprised by how they unfold in Russia,” Smirnov said. “But I was very surprised by Kazakhstan’s approach, the fact that they, at the unofficial request of the FSB, are participating in the kidnapping of a person on their own territory.”
The news about Kachkurkin set off a shockwave through the Russian emigre community. If this low-profile, non-activist emigre is vulnerable to Russian law enforcement’s hunt for dissidents, many thought, who isn’t?
“For most people, this causes fear and concern for their lives,” said one Russian living in Kazakhstan, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the topic. “Several of my friends said that we need to prepare more actively for moving out of Kazakhstan because [now] they can send you to Russia for less.”
Those fears seemed to be confirmed this week when Kazakh prosecutors announced that they had approved an extradition request for a different regime critic, 34-year-old activist Yulia Yemelyanova, who has been detained since a layover at Almaty International Airport in August 2025. Her charge? Allegedly stealing a phone worth 12,000 rubles ($155) in St. Petersburg.
Adam, her lawyer, filed a complaint with the country’s Supreme Court on Feb. 11, arguing that Yemelyanova cannot be extradited while her application for asylum is under consideration.
The document, shared with The Moscow Times, lays out a dire situation.
“If extradited to the Russian Federation,” it reads, “Yemelyanova will face a high risk of torture, inhuman treatment and violation of her fundamental right to a fair trial.”
Since leaving Russia, Yemelyanova has worked with organizations supporting Ukrainian refugees and Russian political prisoners — positions that make her even more of a target, the document states.
Meanwhile, two other men could also be extradited in the coming months: 35-year-old Zelimkhan Murtazov and 30-year-old Mansur Movlayev. Both are from the republic of Chechnya, a tightly controlled region in the North Caucasus whose largely autonomous security forces, the Kadyrovtsy, have a reputation for brutality.
A military deserter, Murtazov has been barred by authorities from leaving Astana’s Nursultan Nazarbayev International Airport for over a month.
Kazakhstan agreed to extradite Movlayev in late January after denying him refugee status the month prior. Having suffered torture in Chechnya, Movlayev fled the region in 2022 and has been seeking asylum ever since.
“He fears for his life, fears that he may be killed,” reads a complaint to Kazakhstan’s Supreme Court obtained by The Moscow Times.
‘To a certain extent, it’s to please Putin’
The unsettling string of expulsions represents something new for Kazakhstan. A few extraditions — mostly of military deserters — have taken place since Russia invaded Ukraine, but never on this scale.
“Since 2022 until practically last month, Kazakhstan was very, very cautious about these cases,” said Yevgeny Zhovtis, director of the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and the Rule of Law.
“On the one hand, even if people were looking for asylum, Kazakhstan was not granting asylum to anybody,” he said. “But at the same time, they were not preventing them from leaving to a third country.”
Zhovtis said that recent cases set a worrying precedent. They also potentially violate international human treaties such as the 1951 Refugee Convention and the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits extradition to a country where someone could be subject to torture.
He believes the policy turnaround could be an attempt to keep Moscow happy as the country readies for a constitutional referendum in March, and potential parliamentary and presidential elections after that.
“I think that Kazakhstan doesn’t want to be exposed to some kind of Russian involvement or too much Russian pressure,” he said. “To a certain extent, it’s to please Putin.”
How does a person stay safe under such conditions?
According to one Russian in Kazakhstan, who requested anonymity, the answer is simply to keep one’s head down.
Before the war began, he had engaged in small-scale activism — sometimes attending protests, other times working as an election observer.
These days, he keeps an even lower profile. While the activist gene is strong — as is the occasional urge to publicly comment on Kazakhstan’s domestic political developments — he resists speaking out. The life he’s eked out is too precarious to risk it.
“As long as I’m silent,” he said, “I think I’m safe here.”
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.
Remind me later.

Who is on helmet that led to Ukrainian athlete's Winter Olympics ban?
Ukrainian slider Vladislav Heraskevych's disqualification from the Winter Olympics over his helmet depicting fellow athletes killed since Russia's full-scale invasion is the Games' biggest controversy so far.
Heraskevych was barred from the men's skeleton in Milan-Cortina earlier this week after he refused to stop wearing it and on Friday his appeal was denied.
He has said those featured on his helmet include teenage weightlifter Alina Peregudova, boxer Pavlo Ishchenko and ice hockey player Oleksiy Loginov, adding that some of them were his friends.
More than 20 athletes appear on the helmet in total - here's more on each of them.
Volodymyr Androschuk - track and field
Androschuk died a few years after his 22nd birthday in January 2023 while fighting in the Bakhmut area of eastern Ukraine.
He represented his country at the international level, competing in decathlon and pentathlon events.
At one time he had hoped to qualify for the 2024 Olympics in Paris or the 2028 Games in Los Angeles, the New York Times reported, but by 2022 injuries meant he decided to volunteer for the army instead.
"It was his dream," Oleksiy Kasyanov, the general secretary of Ukraine's track and field federation and formerly its national decathlon coach, told the paper.
Karyna Bakhur - kickboxer
Bakhur was killed last year during Russian shelling in the Kharkiv region, north-eastern Ukraine.
The 17-year-old was a national kickboxing champion who represented Ukraine at national and international level.
She died a few weeks before her 18th birthday after suffering shrapnel wounds while running for shelter in the city of Berestyn.
Bakhur's coach, Volodymyr Zibarov, told Ukrainian newspaper Pravda the athlete "had enormous potential".
"We were supposed to leave tonight for the World Cup in Austria... Russian missile simply took Karyna from us one day earlier," he said.
Karyna Diachenko - rhythmic gymnast
Eleven-year-old Diachenko was a promising gymnast who died in the south-eastern city of Mariupol in March 2022, according to the memorial website Angels of Sport.
She had been inside her home with her family when a Russian air strike hit the building, killing her and her father instantly. Her mother and brother were taken to hospital, which was later hit by an air strike, killing them too.
Maksym Halinichev - boxer
Halinichev died in 2023 in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine.
According to Ukrainian news outlet Tribuna, he refused to participate in a 2022 European boxing championship in order to volunteer as a soldier.
Speaking to Voice of America, one of his coaches said once Halinichiev had seen the destruction caused by the war, he felt he had to fight.
"I have a little child. I don't want her to live in occupation among the aggressor, among the Russians," another of his coaches quoted him as saying.
Tribuna said Halinichev was injured twice during the war but continued to fight until his death.
He won silver at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games and the 2021 European U22 Championships.
Pavlo Ishchenko - powerlifter
Ishchenko from Kyiv was a four-time strongman champion and former Ukrainian powerlifting champion.
He was also a coach, mentoring young people.
Ukrainian outlet Sport.ua said following his death: "His legacy continues to inspire new generations of athletes who see in him a model of resilience, courage, and dedication to sport and the country."
He died last year on the front lines.
Viktoria Ivashko - judo
Nine-year-old Ivashko was a judo enthusiast who was killed while trying to shelter from Russian air strikes alongside her mother in Kyiv in June 2023.
Following her death, the Ukrainian Judo Federation's president Mykhailo Koshlyak said Ivashko's death was "painful for the entire Ukrainian judo family".
Oleksiy Khabarov - shooting
Khabarov, 31, was a "stalwart" of the Ukrainian national shooting sport for over a decade, according to the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF).
During his career he was a national record holder on multiple occasions, as well as a national champion.
In 2023 he joined the army and died in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine last year.
"He was an elite athlete who paused his career to defend his country, and will forever be in the hearts and memories of the Ukrainian people," ISSF president Luciano Rossi said in a statement following his death.
Ivan Kononenko - actor and athlete
Kononenko was a competitive strongman as well as an actor who starred in popular Ukrainian TV programmes.
He went to fight on the front lines in February 2022 and by November had suffered a severe injury, Pravda reported.
He designed his own rehabilitation programme, which he shared with others on social media, before later going back to fight on the front, becoming a senior lieutenant and commander of a rifle platoon.
Contact with him was lost during a combat mission in February last year and he has since been considered missing in action. A funeral was held for him in December.
Mykyta Kozubenko - diver
Kozubenko was a diver and coach from Mykolaiv, southern Ukraine.
He died in combat last year aged 31.
"In the country's most difficult time, Kozubenko took up arms to defend his native land," the Ukrainian Sports Comittee said when announcing his death.
Daria Kurdel - dancer
Kurdel was a 20-year-old dancer who died in the central city of Kryvyi Rih in July 2022 during a Russian air attack.
She had been training at a sports ground with her father at the time of the attack. Her parents were also injured but survived.
Kurdel won a number of international dance competitions before her death.
Andriy Kutsenko - cyclist
Kutsenko was a track cycling champion who had competed for Ukraine between 2006 and 2016, representing his country at European and World championships.
The 34-year-old lived in Italy with his family prior to the full-scale invasion, but came back to Ukraine to join the army not long afterwards.
He was killed in 2024 in a combat mission, according to regional officials.
Mariya Lebid - dancer
Fifteen-year-old Lebid was killed during a Russian missile strike on a high-rise building in Dnipro in 2023.
She was a ballroom dancer and president of her school's student council.
According to Angels of Sport, during her school presidential election campaign she wrote about herself: "I'd like to tell you a little about myself: I'm 15 years old, I have a music education, and I'm passionate about learning English. My hobby is houseplant cultivation. I'm determined, friendly, and hardworking. I try to approach life with humour and positivity."
Oleksiy Loginov - ice hockey player
Loginov was the former goalkeeper of the Ukrainian professional ice hockey team, Bilyi Bars (White Leopard).
He was killed at the age of 23 in the Luhansk region in 2023.
Yevhen Malyshev - biathlete
Malyshev was 19 when he died on the front lines in Kharkiv.
He was a former biathlete who competed in the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in Lausanne, Switzerland.
He was posthumously awarded an Order For Courage in 2022.

According to Angels of Sport, she operated drones on more than 1,000 combat missions.
Andriy Yaremenko - wrestler
Greco-Roman wrestler Yaramenko was a member of the Ukrainian national team.
He died a few days before his 26th birthday in December.
He had dreamed of becoming a coach and had studied for a masters in physical culture and sports, Angels of Sport said.
He was killed during a combat mission.
Friends and colleagues described him as someone with "a keen sense of justice, inner balance, and a big heart," Angels of Sport said.
Fedir Yepifanov - fencer
Yepifanov was a national fencing champion in Ukraine before suspending his career to fight on the front lines.
He joined the army in the first days of the full-scale invasion at the age of 18 and died at the front in 2023.
Nazar Zui - boxer and footballer
Zui, 13, loved boxing and football and played the latter for a local team in Mariupol.
He died in March 2022 after a Russian air strike hit a high-rise building where the family was seeking shelter. His parents were also killed.

Slovak fugitive arrested after arriving at Olympics to watch national hockey team
A Slovak fugitive who had been on the run for 16 years was finally arrested when he turned up in Milan to support his national ice hockey team at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics, police said Friday.
The 44-year-old man, who was not named, was wanted by Italian authorities for a series of thefts committed in 2010.
The carabinieri managed to track down and arrest the man on Wednesday after he checked into a campsite on the outskirts of Milan, thanks to an automatic alert from the campsite reception.
The man was taken to Milan's San Vittore prison to serve a pending sentence of 11 months and 7 days, according to the carabinieri, Italy's military police.
He was arrested before he could see Slovakia's hockey team take the ice in the opening game at Milan's Santagiulia Arena. Slovakia beat Finland 4-1.
Slovakia also beat Italy in a preliminary match on Friday.

Trump says second aircraft carrier ‘leaving very shortly’ for Middle East
US President Donald Trump on Friday upped the stakes in Washington’s already tense relationship with Iran, saying that a second American aircraft will be “leaving very shortly” for the Middle East. Trump is hoping to strike a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear programme, but has warned of severe consequences if one does not come through.
US President Donald Trump said Friday a second aircraft carrier group would be heading to the Middle East soon, upping the military threat against Iran amid negotiations over its nuclear programme.
“It’ll be leaving very shortly,” Trump told journalists when asked about reports the USS Gerald R. Ford would be moved from the Caribbean to the Middle East. “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it.”

Costco makes a major change to its cake ordering process after customer complaints
Costco members have long complained about having to make custom cake orders in person, made worse by crowded parking and no online confirmation
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Ordering cakes from Costco will soon be, well, a piece of one.
The warehouse club is finally going digital, allowing members to place cake and deli tray orders through the Costco app, meaning no more paper forms or in-person trips to the store.
The update is expected to be available to all members by the end of this year, the warehouse retail club announced Thursday, after first revealing plans for it during the Q1 2026 earnings call in December 2025.
For years, members had to physically head to the bakery, scribble their orders on a printed form and make a second trip to pick up their creation. Many found the process half-baked, especially with crowded parking lots and no online confirmation to ease the wait.
“Many of the things that we’ve heard from our members that could be a little bit clunky are now moving to a digital state, and we’re seeing great adoption right out of the chute,” Costco CEO Ron Vachris told investors in the December call, adding that the company aims on “locking in” its brick-and-mortar business with its virtual digital business.
Some members reported seeing the new app feature rolling out in certain areas as early as August 2025. A Reddit user shared a screenshot of the improvement available in Salt Lake City, prompting celebrations among other users.
“This is awesome news, will save me from an extra $200 shopping trip when I go to drop off the order form for my kid’s birthday cake lol,” one person wrote.
Early adopters reported that the Custom Cake Ordering button was not immediately obvious. Some had trouble locating it, while others found it under the Warehouse tab at the bottom of the app, appearing as a rectangular white button.
Costco says in-app ordering will be available exclusively to members, and a Custom Cake Ordering portal still does not appear on the retailer’s website. The company is also enhancing its mobile app with AI-powered features designed to create a personalized, persuasive experience that drives membership sign-ups and renewals. Upcoming tools include digital membership cards, in-store inventory checks and gas price trackers.
The Independent has contacted Costco for comment.
With more than 800 warehouses worldwide, including over 600 in the U.S., Costco has long trailed rivals like Sam’s Club in online bakery offerings. Additional digital upgrades, such as faster self-checkouts, are also on the way.

UK court rules that the government ban on Palestine Action is unlawful

In a blow to Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government, London’s High Court has ruled that the ban on Palestine Action is unlawful.
The court stated that the ban will remain in place, pending the results of the government’s appeal. However, the Metropolitan Police announced that it will no longer arrest people for supporting the group.
“This approach relates solely to the expression of support for Palestine Action,” noted law enforcement in a press release.”We will continue to intervene and make arrests where we see people crossing the line from lawful protest to intimidate, to damage property, to use violence, to stir up racial hatred or to commit other offences.”
In their decision, the three-judge panel said that then-home secretary Yvette Cooper did not account for how the proscription would impact protected protest.
“The nature and scale of Palestine Action’s activities falling within the definition of terrorism had not yet reached the level, scale and persistence to warrant proscription,” read the judgement.
Guardian Legal Affairs correspondent Haroon Siddique referred to the ruling as a “humiliating defeat” for the government, which has “transformed Palestine Action from a little-known protest group to one that is on the front page of newspapers.”
An organizer with the group told reporter Matt Shea that the 2700 arrests and 500 charges that members faced are now void and that they are entitled to financial compensation from the government.
The victory was celebrated by Palestine activists and human rights groups.
“This is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history,” said Palestine Action’s cofounder Huda Ammori in a statement.
“Today’s ruling is a vital affirmation of the right to protest at a time when it has been under sustained and deliberate attack,” said Amnesty International UK’s Law and Human Rights Director Tom Southerden. “The High Court’s decision sends a clear message: the government cannot simply reach for sweeping counter‑terrorism powers to silence critics or suppress dissent. We welcome this judgment as an essential check on overreach and a powerful reminder that fundamental freedoms still carry weight in UK law.”
“This is a vindication for those who had the courage and humanity to oppose genocide,” former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told Novara Media. “This government thinks it can shield itself from accountability for the role it has played in one of the greatest crimes of our time. Today’s historic judgment proves it will not succeed.”
The ruling was condemned by government officials, like Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood, who said he was “disappointed” by the decision
“I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal,” he added.
Palestine Action was proscribed in July, after breaking into the Royal Air Force’s Brize Norton air base and damaging two planes to protest Israel’s genocide in Gaza.
“Britain isn’t just complicit, it’s an active participant in the Gaza genocide and war crimes across the Middle East,” declared the group. “By decommissioning two military planes, Palestine Action have directly intervened in the genocide and prevented crimes against the Palestinian people.”
Starmer referred to the direct action as a “disgraceful” act of vandalism.
Writing in Mondoweiss following their proscription, Dr. Asim Qureshi, the Research Director at CAGE International, detailed how the targeting of Palestine Action was a clear attempt to quash pro-Palestine speech.
“Britain’s proscription regime has entrenched a cultural McCarthyism, where political speech on Palestine is policed not just by the state but by the institutions that claim to protect democratic discourse,” wrote Qureshi.
Earlier this month, six Palestine Action activists were acquitted on aggravated burglary charges over their July 2024 raid on an Elbit weapons factory in Filton, England.

Angry Greek farmers converge on parliament with tractors in overnight protest rally
Greek farmers have driven dozens of tractors to parliament in central Athens for an overnight rally to protest what they say is government inaction that threatens their livelihoods
- Bookmark
Thousands of angry farmers from across Greece converged on central Athens on Friday, driving dozens of tractors to parliament, horns blaring, for an overnight rally to protest what they say is the government’s failure to address problems threatening their ability to produce crops.
Police blocked off central streets in the Greek capital and accompanied the tractor motorcade through the center of the city as it made its way to central Syntagma Square in front of the parliament building, the traditional focal point of protests in Greece.
Farmers have been protesting for months over high production costs, low prices for their products and delays in the payment of European Union-backed subsidies.
The payment delays came as authorities reviewed all requests following revelations of widespread fraud claims for EU farm subsidies. Protesters have argued that the delays amounted to collective punishment, leaving honest farmers in debt and unable to plant their fields for next season.
Livestock breeders, who have seen their flocks decimated by mass culls due to an outbreak of sheep and goat pox, have joined the protests, which began in November.
After weeks of tractor blockades along major highways and border crossings that caused traffic and transportation chaos, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis met with farmer representatives last month. The government made a series of concessions, including fuel tax rebates and cheaper electricity rates.
But while the farmers dismantled their roadblocks, they say the government failed to address many of their problems.
“Our struggle continues, because our basic demands weren’t satisfied,” Rizos Maroudas, head of a farmers’ union of the central Greek region of Larissa, told Greek state television ERT Friday, adding that cheap imports were undermining Greek products.
The government, he said, had the financial ability to resolve the farming community’s problems “but it doesn’t have the political will to do it.”
Early last month, farmers escalated their protests with a 48-hour blockade of major highways, toll stations and junctions over high production costs and the European Union’s trade deal with South American nations. The EU-Mercosur agreement seeks to progressively remove duties on almost all goods traded between the two blocs.
Friday’s protesters have vowed to spend the night at the rally, staying outside parliament until Saturday.

IAEA chief says agreement on nuclear inspections with Iran may be reached in coming days

VIENNA, February 13. /TASS/. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Iran may reach an agreement on inspections of the country’s nuclear facilities in the coming days, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi said.
"We have returned to Iran (after last year’s strikes on the country’s nuclear facilities - TASS). <...> We were able to work again, to establish some form of dialogue - imperfect, complicated and extremely difficult - but it is there. So I think the big question of the moment is how to define these steps for the future. We know perfectly well what needs to be checked and how to check it. I would say we are at a very, very crucial moment. Perhaps, over the next few days, as opposed to weeks or months, we might be seeing light at the end of the tunnel," he pointed out at the Munich Security Conference, when asked about the possibility of a new agreement on nuclear inspections.
Overnight into June 13, Israel launched a military operation against Iran. Less than 24 hours later, Tehran retaliated. Nine days later, in the early hours of June 22, US jets targeted three Iranian nuclear sites, effectively entering the conflict. The following evening, Tehran carried out a missile strike on Al Udeid, the largest US military base in the region, located in Qatar. US President Donald Trump later announced that Israel and Iran had agreed to a complete ceasefire. The truce took effect on June 24.
Iran severed contact with the IAEA due to a lack of condemnation from the agency against Israel and the US. On September 9, Iran and the IAEA signed an agreement to resume cooperation. On September 20, however, Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA over a resolution demanding the country provide the agency’s inspectors with full access to its nuclear sites.

The End of Climate Regulation As We Know It
Unknown

03:05:13 KST

The Trump Administration’s repeal of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) endangerment finding dominated headlines this week. Given that the endangerment finding underpins all of the EPA’s noteworthy climate rules, this move is a big deal with significant consequences for efforts to tackle emissions as well as regulate companies.
In its announcement, the administration framed this as a big win for American industry. In reality, the effort might better be described as an ideological project that will result in marketplace confusion. Lawsuits will abound. States will try to step into the void, generating more lawsuits and more confusion. Meanwhile, companies will need to decide to what degree they respond.
Companies that operate in a global market will continue to face regulatory pressure in many other jurisdictions in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. And they also know that a future administration may restore the endangerment finding and all the regulations that come with it.
Read more: The EPA’s Anti-Climate Move Leaves Industry Confused
In the wake of the announcement, environmental groups put out a flurry of statements condemning the move. Members of Congress joined activists in protest outside of the EPA. “We’re going to stand with you,” said Massachusetts Democratic Senator Ed Markey at the rally. “We’re going to lead this fight in the Senate against this special interest.”
With its current makeup, the Republican-majority Congress is unlikely to push back on the move. Courts, on the other hand, can throw sand in the gears of Trump’s deregulatory move, leaving everyone guessing about how this issue might finally shake out.
In watching the response to the widely anticipated news, I couldn’t help but think about the now famous Mark Carney speech in Davos last month. "The old order is not coming back,” he said. “We shouldn't mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy, but we believe that from the fracture, we can build something bigger, better, stronger, more just."
The endangerment finding was never the first-best solution to tackle climate change. Instead, it came about through a series of contortions. In the early 2000s, the Bush Administration refused to make climate policy. In response, the state of Massachusetts sued the government saying the EPA wasn’t doing its job under the Clean Air Act, a law that dates back to the 1970s when climate change was more scientific curiosity than political issue. The Supreme Court ruled that the EPA should study whether climate change harmed public health. If so, it had a legal obligation to regulate the greenhouse gases that cause it.
Unsurprisingly, in 2009, the EPA released the endangerment finding showing that, in fact, greenhouse gases did threaten public health. From that finding came a slew of regulations from tailpipe emissions standards for cars to power plant emissions rules. But every rule was promulgated under the threat of litigation and the teeth of the regulation relied on a law that was designed with a completely different purpose in mind. Importantly, climate regulation under the Clean Air Act was designed to make the existing system cleaner with sticks but offered little to create a new and better system with carrots.
And, while these rules have played an important role keeping emissions in check and protecting public health, they are not singularly responsible for the progress the U.S. has made in slowing its emissions. Economic shifts and declining cost curves have stimulated clean energy in a way that rules could not have done alone.
No one knows what will happen when Trump leaves off and, presumably, climate denial falls out of favor again. Restoring the endangerment finding would be one step for new leadership to take, but simply bringing back the old regime of climate regulation would be insufficient to the size of the challenge now at hand.
I have put this very question to many of the people I speak with: What does the next era of climate action look like in the U.S.? I have heard only limited thinking in response about what the next big policy agenda on climate may be. Trump’s assault on the system has been so fast and so aggressive that it has left climate advocates in a defensive position. But it would be unwise to assume that Trump has created a resilient status quo.
If anything, the lack of a clear set of climate plans that might be considered in a post-Trump era just means there’s an even wider range of possibilities for businesses to prepare for. In the past, industrial policy, carbon pricing, tightened rules and regulations were all in play. In the future, we could see anything from new taxation regimes fueled by populist backlash to targeted electricity tariffs. It’s also possible that Trump’s climate agenda endures given the understandable focus on other geopolitical issues and domestic challenges.
In short, in completely rupturing climate efforts, Trump has created a blank slate. No one knows exactly what’s next, but it probably shouldn’t be the exact same thing as before.

Minnesotans welcome the immigration surge drawdown but remain vigilant
The Trump administration is scaling back its immigration enforcement surge in and around the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, but state officials and residents say its effects on Minnesota’s economy and immigrant communities will linger
- Bookmark
The Trump administration's drawdown of its immigration enforcement surge in the Twin Cities area has been met with relief, but state officials and residents say its effects on Minnesota’s economy and immigrant communities will linger.
Thousands of officers were sent to the Minneapolis and St. Paul area for Operation Metro Surge, which the Department of Homeland Security called its “ largest immigration enforcement operation ever " and touted as a success. But President Donald Trump's enforcement campaign came under increasing criticism and pushback as the situation grew increasingly volatile.
The shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal officers drew condemnation and raised questions over officers' conduct, prompting changes to the operation.
And despite the announced end to the surge, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz urged Minnesotans to remain vigilant.
Drawdown after improved coordination
Border czar Tom Homan told reporters Thursday that “extensive engagement” with state and local officials allowed for a formal end to the operation.
Trump dispatched Homan to de-escalate tensions after the Jan. 24 killing of Pretti. Homan said a drawdown would be predicated on the level of cooperation the federal agencies received from state and local officials.
That cooperation came to pass, particularly with state and local law enforcement and jails' handling of deportable inmates, Homan said.
But he also said he made various internal changes since arriving, including changing certain personnel, deploying body cameras and communicating that misconduct by immigration officers would not be tolerated.
“There were some issues here. We fixed those issues,” Homan said. “We’ve had great success with this operation and we’re leaving Minnesota safer.”
Immigration enforcement will continue, but with a smaller footprint
Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 in the state. He said Thursday that a “significant drawdown” was already underway and would continue through next week.
Homan said he would be on the ground for a “little longer” to oversee the drawdown, and that a small team would facilitate the transition and ensure the continuing cooperation of state and local authorities.
He did not specify how many officers would remain, but he said targeted enforcement would continue in the Twin Cities.
“President Trump made a promise of mass deportation, and that’s what this country is going to get,” Homan said.
Todd Lyons, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's acting director, said during a congressional hearing Thursday that the agency is still searching for about 16,840 people in Minnesota who have final orders of removal.
The operation leaves its mark on the Twin Cities
Following Homan’s announcement Thursday, some residents held a vigil at a makeshift shrine that went up where Good was shot in Minneapolis.
“I don’t even want one ICE person here, if they act the way they’ve been acting,” said local attendee John Schnickel. “Does it fade away if they leave here? Are they going somewhere else, or has the country and the White House learned a lesson?”
He also disagreed with remarks by Trump officials that the enforcement surge made Minnesota safer. “They talk about how the murder rate is down, and yet they’ve added two people to it,” he said.
Mark Foresman, an attendee from the suburb of St. Louis Park, said he is skeptical that the agents will leave.
“The Trump administration has created an atmosphere of distrust for government in general, so that’s caused citizens like myself to not believe what they say, because they’ve repeatedly been caught in lies,” he said, suggesting the Trump administration's tactics seemed designed to stir up publicity and sow fear.
Juan Uvera, who was visiting from New York City, said one thing that jumped out to him was the number of businesses that were closed or had signs barring ICE.
“From afar, on TV, it’s just like people are getting shot and killed. But you actually see the effect it has on the people over here," he said.
Anna Van Sice, an attendee who was wearing one of the commonplace whistles that have been used in immigration crackdown cities to warn that federal officers are nearby, said the Twin Cities area can’t let its guard down and that will keep responding to ICE's presence.
“We don’t have a lot, or any trust in the government right now,” she said. “I guess I’ll believe it when I see it.”

US orders another aircraft carrier to the Middle East

US orders another aircraft carrier to the Middle East
February 13, 2026The US is preparing to send the USS Gerald R. Ford's aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East, joining the USS Abraham Lincoln and its guided-missile destroyers in the Arabian Sea, President Donald Trump confirmed on Friday.
"It'll be leaving very soon," Trump told reporters without giving an exact timeline.
The deployment of a second aircraft carrier strike group to the region comes after Trump warned of "very bad" consequences if Iran did not make a deal with Washington over its nuclear program.
The Ford's strike group is being redirected from the Caribbean, where it was deployed in October 2025 as the US built up a massive military presence in the region ahead of a raid that captured Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.
The Ford left port in June 2025, and its deployment has already been extended once. Its sailors had expected to return home in March, according to the New York Times, which first reported the re-deployment earlier Friday.
Trump hopes for 'deal' with Iran on nukes
The second carrier group deployment in the Arabian Sea comes after US and Iranian representatives met last week in Oman for inconclusive talks on Tehran's nuclear program.
Trump has not ruled out military action if Tehran does not agree to curb its nuclear program.
Asked why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said on Friday, "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it... if we need it, we'll have it ready."
Trump during his first term in 2018 pulled the US out of a deal that had envisioned a cap on Iran's uranium enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief.
Tehran claims its nuclear ambitions are peaceful, however, the IAEA estimated last year that Iran has enriched uranium far beyond the level needed for civilian use.
Iran suspended cooperation with the IAEA after the US bombed Iranian nuclear sites last June during a Israel's 12-day war against the Islamic republic. At the time, Trump said the strikes had "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities, although this was never independently confirmed.
Despite claiming that Iran's uranium enrichment capability was destroyed, Trump has said he wants a new nuclear deal with Iran.
A White House fact sheet dated February 8 coming after tariffs on countries that "acquire any goods or services from Iran" said that Trump "recently deployed a massive armada to the region, urging Iran to come to the table and negotiate a fair, equitable deal with no nuclear weapons, or face even stronger consequences."
Trump warns Iran
Gulf Arab nations have warned any US attack on Iran could spiral into another regional conflict.
On Friday, Trump told reporters it would be a "bad day for Iran" if Tehran fails to make a deal.
When asked on Thursday about a timeline for a possible deal with Iran, Trump said "I guess over the next month."
"It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly … otherwise it's going to be very traumatic. I don't want that to happen, but we have to make a deal," Trump told reporters.
Trump last threatened the use of force against Iran during the regime's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests in January, but pulled back after claiming the regime had agreed to not execute arrested protesters.
Despite these claims, human rights groups estimate thousands of demonstrators were killed by security forces during the protests. In the coming days, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for those killed.

UK mother separated from children for years has ‘draconian’ order overturned
Unknown

03:01:37 KST

A mother who did not see her children for nearly six years after they were taken away by the family courts has been reunited with her son after the flawed evidence used in her case was overturned.
An assessment by an unregulated psychologist led to “extraordinary” and “draconian” orders that effectively terminated her relationship with her children, lawyers told the high court.
A district judge followed the recommendations of the psychologist Melanie Gill, which included that Erin* had turned her daughter and son against their father and should be banned from seeing them.
Gill also advised that there was no need to investigate cross-allegations of domestic abuse by the parents. This meant that claims of serious physical and sexual assault made by the mother against the father were not examined.
In December 2019 the court ordered the children’s removal from their mother and granted the father sole custody. They were nine and 12 at the time. Erin did not see or speak to them again until last year.
But last month England’s most senior family judge “set aside” the court’s original findings based on the conclusions of Gill, who claims to have acted as an expert witness in up to 200 cases.
It is the second time in six months that findings in a case in which she has given evidence have been dismissed by the high court.
At the 29 January hearing, it was heard how the ruling had left Erin feeling as if she had “a noose around her neck for six years”. In an interview with the Bureau of Investigative Journalism she said: “It wasn’t just me. The children were cut off from all their family and friends. They had 50% of their identity stripped away overnight.”
It was argued that the children had been silenced by the process set in motion by Gill’s evidence, even when they raised allegations of abuse.
Lawyers told the high court that errors and missed opportunities by every professional involved in the case had failed to protect the siblings.
A previous attempt by the mother to appeal was blocked and she launched a fresh application seven months ago.
The case took a dramatic turn in November when her teenage son Dylan* ran away from his father’s home and hired his own solicitor. After a period in foster care he was later reunited with his mother for their first Christmas together in six years.
Unusually, the teenager – represented by his own legal team – was in court for his mother’s legal bid overseen by the president of the family division, Sir Andrew McFarlane.
The 15-year-old sat at the front of the courtroom as Jo Delahunty KC told McFarlane how her young client had lost all trust in professionals and become lonely, fearful and isolated in his father’s care.
McFarlane made a new order for the boy to live with his mother. He is yet to hand down his judgment, which is expected to map out a route for similarly affected families who wish to return their case to court.
McFarlane said: “Melanie Gill considers this some kind of vendetta against her. This is far bigger than one person. It’s about the court properly engaging with allegations and cross-allegations.”
After the hearing, Dylan said that he felt heard at last, adding: “I’m so grateful to be home with my mum finally and to feel happy again”.
The children’s father, who has consistently denied the allegations against him, chose not to attend the January hearing. The daughter, who is now 18, was not party to the case.
Erin’s legal team cited “compelling” new information in bringing the successful challenge. This included guidance from December 2024, which said the courts should not use experts to look for “parental alienation” – the idea that a child has rejected one parent because they have been manipulated by the other.
The guidance also stated that psychologists assessing families on behalf of the courts should be regulated. However, judges are permitted to appoint whom they wish, including experts who are not regulated.
Gill asserts that she is well qualified to perform the role of expert witness in family proceedings and that she has years of specialist training and expertise.
The government is working with the committee that makes rules for the family courts to introduce a ban on unregulated experts, after a public consultation last year, which received 60 submissions.

'I felt like an animal': Palestinian activist says ICE chained her in hospital after seizure
A Palestinian woman held in US immigration detention for nearly a year says she was shackled to a hospital bed for three days after suffering her first seizure, describing the experience as "dehumanising" and "terrifying".
Leqaa Kordia, 33, is currently detained at the Prairieland Detention Facility in North Texas.
In a statement on Thursday through her legal representatives, she said she experienced a seizure on 6 February after fainting twice inside the facility's medical unit.
"I woke up terrified and confused," Kordia said. "Not until enduring nearly a year of cruel confinement in inhumane conditions had I ever suffered one before."
According to her statement, witnesses told her that during the seizure she fell twice after leaving the bathroom, striking her head before beginning to convulse. She was transported by ambulance to a hospital.
Kordia said she remained in shackles throughout her hospitalisation.
"For three days in the emergency room, my hands and legs were weighed down by heavy chains as they drew my blood and gave me medications," she said. "It was terrifying. I felt like an animal. My hands are still full of marks from the heavy metal."
She added that the restraints were not removed when she used the bathroom or showered, and that officers refused to explain why she was chained. When she asked a supervising officer, she said she was told: "Because I said so."
Kordia also said she was prevented from speaking with family members and that hospital staff denied entry to one of her attorneys.
"I worried that if something happened to me, no one would know," she said.
Her doctors, she stated, told her she was more prone to seizures due to poor sleep, inadequate nutrition and stress. Kordia has previously said she lost significant weight in detention and struggled to access food that complies with her religious dietary requirements.
"At Prairieland, your daily life - whether you can have access to the food or medicine you need or even a good night’s sleep - is controlled by the private, for-profit business that runs this facility," she said. "I've been here for 11 months, and the food is so bad it makes me sick."
Kordia is a Palestinian Muslim who grew up in the West Bank and later lived in New Jersey.
She was among dozens of people arrested outside Columbia University in 2024 during pro-Palestinian demonstrations. The charges against her were dismissed.
She was later taken into custody during a routine check-in with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025.
Federal officials have accused her of overstaying her visa and have scrutinised financial transfers she made to relatives in the Middle East. Kordia has said the funds were intended to support family members whose homes were destroyed in Gaza.
An immigration judge has twice ordered her released on bond, but the government appealed both rulings, prolonging her detention. She is the last Columbia protester still held in immigration confinement.
In her statement, Kordia said she believes she was targeted because of her activism.
"The only reason ICE targeted me in the first place is because I protested against the Israeli government's genocide in Gaza," she said, adding that nearly 200 of her family members have been killed.
"ICE detention facilities are built to break people and destroy their health and hope," she continued. "The best medicine for me and everyone else here is our freedom."

Affordable housing so good that architects want to live there too

Affordable housing so good that architects want to live there too
Dan Szwaj is greeted with tears of joy. He is not a technician finally arriving to reconnect the internet, or a plumber coming to unblock the loo.
He is the architect of the Boronia apartments in the Danks Street precinct in Waterloo, who took the “stigma out” of affordable housing for a new tenant, 57-year-old Carrie-Anne Huddleston.
After losing a well-paid corporate job a few years ago, Huddleston’s life unravelled. She was priced out of her home when she was hit with a $600 a month hike in rent. Like many older single women without a partner with an income, she stayed with friends and couch-surfed, initially reluctant to try affordable housing because she had grown up in public housing in Woolloomooloo.
“I just keep crying, happy tears. I feel a huge sense of relief. You just want to have a nice place and stuff. Some people are living in cars,” Huddleston told Szwaj.
Szwaj was moved too. “It made my day.”
Huddleston said her new one-bedroom unit, in the $66 million, five-storey block with 76 units by the non-profit private enterprise City West Housing, felt glam.
Not sad at all, she told Szwaj, director of architectural firm Turner, as she leant in for a hug.
Turner’s practice has a reputation for high-quality, affordable and public housing that is “tenure-blind”. A project by the practice in Liverpool won the 2023 Premier’s Prize for architecture.
“It should be a building that anyone would choose to live in, regardless of income or circumstance,” Szwaj said.
What are often dreary utilitarian spaces, like fire stairs that can feel unsafe, with the whiff of urine, are full of light.
Apartments look away from busy Bourke Street and over a new park.
The fire stairs have been turned into a spiral staircase, with what resembles a romantic Juliet balcony at its top and descending into an increasingly green courtyard on the first floor.
And its use of much-maligned deck access – external corridors or walkways, likely to be familiar to anyone who has watched British shows such as Line of Duty or Slow Horses – connects neighbours.
Szwaj said: “The UK’s [external walkways] function as cheap access. These are on a scale where neighbours can see each other, you can make eye contact.”
UK architectural historian Owen Hatherley said the appeal of deck access – which he has in his own block – is straightforward, reported Architecture Today in the UK.
“Rather than getting to your flat through a dark, enclosed internal corridor, you reach it through a walkway partly in the open air. Like anything, it can be well-designed or badly designed, depending on such factors as width, length and spaciousness.”
Most architects would never deign to live in public or subsidised housing, Hatherley wrote.
Not so Boronia.
Award-winning architect and Churchill fellow Carol Marra’s first response was, “I could live here, this is no different from market housing”.
In some ways, it was even better, she said. The build-to-rent model by City West was built to last with robust finishes, so it’s easy to maintain.
Drains were hidden below entries and balconies to prevent water from entering the units. The floors were flush inside and out, which improved access for those with a disability, and made them easy to repair.
The project was designed when the maximum height limit was lower than it is now, but Szwaj said they had to anticipate future development. “We did this by maximising the prime frontage facing the future park, having apartments facing each of the future street aspects, making use of multiple entries, and creating a central, north-facing courtyard as a communal focus.”
Developer Coronation Property plans to build five blocks directly to the north of Boronia with about 850 homes, including an estimated 70 affordable units and 400 build-to-rent. The tallest could be 29 storeys.
As part of the Herald’s reviews of apartment life, Marra and two other experts on multi-residential housing – Peter McGregor, the director of McGregor Westlake Architecture, and his award-winning associate director Damien Madell – agreed to visit.
Marra, a co-founder of architectural practice Marra+Yeh, saw families hanging out on the corridors, looking down into the courtyard. Residents were using the external stairs rather than the lift and enjoying the internal courtyard.
“There is a generosity to those very functional but highly used areas, corridors, stairs, which turns them into amenities for the residents. Instead of those spaces being the minimum required for compliance, they have been turned into an amenity.”
Madell, who has won awards for apartment design, said the quality of the entry lobbies and the landscaped courtyard was uplifting and would elevate the daily experience of residents. “This project sets a new benchmark for its type.”
McGregor was most impressed by the courtyard layout and the building’s character. The design of the generous open-air galleries – external walkways – that overlook the courtyard and the street dealt with issues of privacy to the bedrooms with screens and small skylights connecting the floors.
“All have good sun, shade and airy qualities, a perfect model for the Sydney climate. The courtyard forms the protected heart of the building.”
Leonie King, the chief executive of City West – a charity that previously had the NSW government as a shareholder – plans more affordable housing around Green Square.
Tenants’ rent is capped at 25 to 30 per cent of household income, or 74.9 per cent of market rent, whichever is lower. Housing is targeted to households on very low and moderate incomes, with a connection to the area.
About 64 per cent of residents at Boronia work, and of those, 35 per cent are essential workers. Others moved from nearby Waterloo Estate.
The rent is based on the gross income of its residents, not on how big the apartment is or the number of bedrooms. A single mum with one child, for example, would be allocated a two-bedroom apartment and would pay the same amount of rent if she had three children and needed a larger unit.
Finding an affordable unit is still hard, something Huddleston experienced first-hand.
Only 2 per cent of the 40,000 homes promised by Housing Australia Future Fund over five years have been completed, reported The Australian Financial Review’s Michael Bleby. Boronia and Assemble’s Swift Walk development in Melbourne were among the first 895 social and affordable homes completed last year. A further 9485 homes are expected to be finished this year, with another 8000 in the works, he reported.
Back on her balcony that will soon have a view of a new 1400-square-metre public park, Huddleston said she appreciated the small touches – places to put photos, the soft-touch drawers in bathroom and kitchen, built-in laundry, a lot of storage, and screening from the entryway.
“It’s new, it’s calm and it’s bright. I feel very safe here. It’s been a gift. My mother said if I didn’t take it she wouldn’t talk to me.” To make ends meet, she had been working as a birth and death doula, and is looking for more work. “I didn’t get married, I didn’t have kids, it is really hard. What’s great, if I lose my work, I can ring these guys, they will work with me, won’t have to worry about being homeless. It’s having a landlord who gives a shit. They actually care.”

The six retirement fears keeping Australians up at night

Opinion
The six retirement fears keeping Australians up at night
I asked a simple question in my Epic Retirement Facebook club last week: What are you most afraid of as you head towards retirement? The responses came flooding in, and what struck me wasn’t the fear itself. It was how consistent the answers were.
“Running out of money.” “Dying at my desk”, “Changing a lifetime of saving to spending”, “Boredom, identity and loss of purpose”, “Centrelink and the government changing the rules on super”, “Being alone”.
These aren’t irrational anxieties. They’re sensible questions asked by people who don’t want to sleepwalk into a phase of life that deserves more care and attention than that.
Dismissing them as benign helps no one. What does help is turning these vague fears into something they can measure and manage. Fear thrives on ambiguity. Give it structure, numbers and a plan, and it tends to shrink to a far more workable size or even get out of the way.
1. “What if I run out of money?”
This was by far the most common response. People were blunt: “Running out of money”, “Not having enough to live on”, “That I can’t afford my living expenses”.
One person wrote, “Not owning my own home and using retirement income on $700 a week rent.” Another said, “It’s being able to survive and not ending up homeless.”
There’s nothing abstract about that.
The mistake people make is jumping straight to the question of how much they need to retire, as if there’s a single magic number that guarantees safety. There isn’t. People don’t run out of money because they missed a headline figure. They run out of money when spending and income drift apart for long enough.
The most useful place to start is far more practical: work out what it actually costs you to live an ordinary year of your life. Not your best year and definitely not your worst year. Just the year you actually live at a comfortable pace of spending and level of income.
After money, the next fear wasn’t financial at all. It was about time.
Once you know that number, the fear becomes more specific and therefore more manageable. You can start asking sensible questions: “What income covers this now? What changes later? If something goes wrong – markets fall, work dries up, health intervenes – what could I adjust?”
For renters, this fear is particularly valid. Housing is the biggest financial risk in retirement. Which is why decisions around location, downsizing, timing, or even part-time work often matter more than chasing higher investment returns. These aren’t failures, they’re tools.
2. “What if I wait too long and lose my health?”
After money, the next fear wasn’t financial at all. It was about time. It’s expressed in statements like: “My biggest fear was dying at my laptop” or “I’m afraid I’ll lose my health before I get the chance to do the things I want.”
This fear feels different because it contains an uncomfortable truth. You can rebuild money. You can’t rebuild time. And once your health goes, your choices narrow quickly. This is why “I’ll do it later” isn’t a plan. It’s a hope.
Retirement isn’t one long phase. There are years when your body is willing, years when it’s slower, and years when it limits you. If there are experiences you care about that depend on energy, mobility, strength or confidence, they belong earlier, not deferred indefinitely.
And health can’t be treated as something you’ll deal with once you stop working. Strength, balance, mobility and prevention aren’t vanity projects. They’re what make retirement usable.
3. “Who am I if I’m not working?”
This fear surprises people, but it shouldn’t. One person put it perfectly: “Trying to get a life is way more stressful than work.”
Work quietly answers many questions for us: when to get up, where to be, who needs you, what counts as a good day. When that structure disappears overnight, it can feel deeply unsettling, even if retirement was planned.
What often goes wrong is that people expect retirement to feel good immediately. When it doesn’t, they assume they’ve made a mistake. But that uncomfortable phase isn’t failure. It’s a transition.
The answer isn’t to fill every hour or find a grand “purpose”. It’s to replace the outgoing structure in your life deliberately. A few anchors matter.
Think about setting up something that gets you moving, something that puts you in contact with people, something that feels useful or absorbing. Purpose usually grows out of commitment, learning with others and making real connection, not hobbies alone.
4. “I don’t know how to spend”
This fear is one that sounds ludicrous to anyone under 50. But it’s very real. “I’ve spent my working life being careful with money. I don’t think I know how to enjoy spending.”
This makes perfect sense. Most people have been rewarded their entire adult lives for restraint. Saving was responsible. Spending was risky. Then retirement arrives, and the instruction flips: start drawing it down.
People hesitate, delay and second-guess every purchase. Many underspend not because they need to, but because it feels safer. That can be just as problematic as overspending.
The fix is putting some spending structure in place. When you were working, pay arrived regularly and spending had boundaries. In retirement, if everything comes from one big pool, every decision feels loaded.
Paying yourself a regular amount for everyday life and separating discretionary spending creates guardrails. Once spending is planned, it stops feeling reckless. Learning how to spend is part of retirement skill-building. It’s not indulgent.
5. “The rules will change underneath me”
This fear had a different tone: people were worried about things they can’t control really affecting their plans. Think about it, inflation, rising costs, governments changing the rules, battles with Centrelink and anxiety about systems becoming more complex or cashless.
Most of these fears can usually be pinpointed back to things you already care about, but may not have proactively stepped through.
And they’re right, things do change. You simply cannot plan retirement on the assumption that nothing in the economy, politics and the bureaucracy will shift. That has never been true.
The mistake is trying to control what you can’t. The goal isn’t certainty, it’s resilience. That means setting yourself up with buffers, flexibility and not running your plan right to the edge. One focused admin day a year beats years of living with low-level anxiety.
6. “What if I end up alone?”
This was the heaviest of the fears because it’s not one many of us talk about out loud. “Losing my partner before we have time to enjoy retirement together.”
Loneliness creeps up quietly on us over our lifetime. We often forget that work provides connection by default. Retirement doesn’t do this. Connection in retirement has to be planned and proactively stepped into.
You need to find groups you can be regular with, commitments that you look forward to, places where people would notice if you didn’t turn up. For those ageing solo, this isn’t optional. You need to think about it as infrastructure to build your life around, so you never end up alone, even if you do end up single by death, divorce or choice.
Ultimately, if you’re feeling them, most of these fears can usually be pinpointed back to things you already care about, but may not have proactively stepped through.
None of them are solved by pretending they won’t happen. The best thing to do to overcome them, or lessen their grip on you, is to examine them, do the work they point you to do, and make good decisions. Have a go!

ABC’s Radio National report card: Have the big changes worked?

ABC’s Radio National report card: Have the big changes worked?
Radio was the ABC’s first medium when it was founded in 1932, grounded in a central mission of building unity in the relatively new Commonwealth. But by the time influential administrator and aesthete Kim Williams arrived as chair in 2024 it had, in his words, been neglected.
In his first public address as chair of the national broadcaster, Williams used the Redmond Barry Lecture to call for a “renewed” Radio National as the broadcaster’s flagship, leading a rejuvenated audio division.
It needed more creativity and better curation, Williams said while giving the lecture at the State Library of Victoria in June 2024, having spent the past three months getting deep under the hood of the broadcaster. Williams spoke, then things happened quickly.
Rumoured plans to cull one of its talkback networks – Local Radio, NewsRadio or Radio National – were kiboshed. Just months later, ABC backflipped on a decision to fold the audio division in with the rest of its screen content.
In August that year, Williams told Radio National staff of his bold ambitions for the station. He wanted it to become the ABC’s “heartland”, and to replicate the BBC’s equivalent station, Radio 4, which reached 17 per cent of the British public (at that time) every week.
“My aspiration would be to that level. My aspiration is to actually see it be a service that has a real impact,” Williams said.
With former ABC Radio Melbourne manager Dina Rosendorff at the helm, the ABC instigated a station-wide review. The result was a visual rebrand, while “Always Curious” replaced “Think Bigger” as the station’s mission. There was also greater emphasis on knitting the day’s programming together with two continuity announcers appointed to guide listeners.
There was a complete rethink of the flagship Breakfast show. Newshound Patricia Karvelas was replaced by Sally Sara and a team of dedicated and experienced roving reporters styled like Radio 4’s Today program. The network’s former star Fran Kelly returned to do The Radio National Hour in the evenings. There were new programs such as Saturday Extra with the BBC’s former Washington correspondent Nick Bryant. Life Matters got a new host, as did The World Today with Andy Park. Journalist and filmmaker Marc Fennell got a new show, there was a new arts program, a new economics show, a media show, a science show, a food and culture show, and many more.
Finally, there was an insistence, led by Williams, that the station be referred to as Radio National, rather than the colloquial “RN”. It was a minor point, but it showed the chairman’s personal investment in small aspects of the station’s presentation, and his desire for it to reassert its position in the national conversation.
At that point, ratings and audience figures had been on the slide for several successive years. Unlike local radio, which was the beneficiary of a ratings boost at the height of the pandemic, Radio National figures were largely consistent with those in 2019, but from 2022 onwards, the statistics fell off a cliff.
National effort
A year on from Williams’ remarks and the average weekly national audience of Radio National had fallen by 9 per cent to 462,000 in the 2024-25 financial year, according to the last annual report. That is just 1.7 per cent of our population. There is a long way to go to reach Williams’ target.
And over the course of the calendar year, Radio National reported an average radio survey cumulative audience of 472,250 across the five capital cities, down from 496,000 in 2024.
There are eight ratings reports published each year, and “cumulative audience” includes any listener who tuned in for at least eight minutes in that survey period.
But after an initial six months bedding the new programming in, a deeper look into the numbers shows there are some green shoots, and at the very least, the station has arrested any further declines. Across the five cities, the final survey delivered 492,000 cumulative listeners, 36,000 more than the same survey in 2024 and across the final four surveys of 2025, audiences rose 4 per cent.
But there remains an audience issue for Radio National in the country’s two largest cities, where the station has lost 35 per cent of its audience since pre-COVID in 2019.
“Talk formats like Radio National tend to attract older audiences, so the numbers should be holding firm,” a former ABC executive says, speaking on the condition of anonymity as they remain in the industry.
ABC head of audio Ben Latimer says live radio is only one part of the picture for Radio National, arguing that many of the station’s programs now reach larger audiences in podcast form than on broadcast.
“What we’re seeing post-COVID is a redistribution of listening rather than a loss of relevance, with Radio National playing a central role in the ABC’s podcast leadership,” Latimer says.
There’s some truth to that. Of the top 100 podcasts in the country, 24 are produced by the ABC, according to recent figures from data and ratings firm Triton, many of them shows on Radio National. Compare that with a year prior, when only 15 of the top 100 shows were made by the ABC, and it’s an impressive jump.
Asked if Radio National is now a podcast-first station, Latimer says its role is to reach Australians “wherever and however they choose to listen”. If You’re Listening, hosted by Matt Bevan, is a prime example of that, airing on radio on Friday afternoons. But the show performs better online. It was the nation’s 18th most popular podcast in December and its full video versions gather hundreds of thousands of extra views on YouTube.
While several of the new shows commissioned for 2025 were dumped after one year, in 2026, Radio National further tinkered with its lineup. There’s a Radio National Arts Hour from Monday to Thursday, and it expanded Global Roaming, adding in two new hosts, Kylie Morris and Latika Bourke, and releasing a new episode each weekday. The approach can look choppy, but it’s also resulting in experimentation, with losses quickly cut and new bets placed.
It also goes some way to rejuvenating its arts coverage, a sector increasingly neglected across media, and which the ABC stripped back in a round of cuts in 2023.
It’s not just ratings that define success for the ABC, says managing director Hugh Marks, still in his first 12 months, though he notes the ABC is No. 1 in “live streaming”.
“Ultimately, success for the ABC’s radio services is about delivering trusted, distinctive content that serves the public interest by meeting the needs of the Australian community with integrity and purpose,” Marks says.
“We continue to strengthen these outcomes by investing in high-quality journalism and specialist programming, improving delivery through broadcast and digital platforms so audiences can engage with ABC content wherever they are.”
Tough programming
The big changes to the ABC’s audio offering have come during the tenure of Ben Latimer, who joined the ABC in 2023 from Nova, Lachlan Murdoch’s commercial radio company. It was a major switch: Nova focuses more on music and entertainment, Radio National is increasingly highbrow. For the broadcaster’s staff, any member of management coming from the dreaded “commercial” sector can be a lightning rod when things don’t go to plan.
When Latimer joined, ABC Radio was already in a transitional phase with an extensive, internal review already commissioned by the Ita Buttrose-led board. The aim: to address the rapid decline in audience figures for its local stations after pandemic-juiced figures. One of the key recommendations was that each show be judged on its own merits, which is in part what followed.
Each network has a distinctive role to play, Marks says. While Radio National provides breathing room for long-form storytelling and engagement, the network of local radio stations is the ABC’s most direct connection to the community.
There have been some significant changes to the local stations, especially in Sydney and Melbourne. Several hosts retired, including Richard Glover, or were pushed out, and ratings suffered.
“Change in any large creative organisation is always complex, and our staff base is just as passionate as our audience, but renewal is essential if we’re to remain relevant to audiences,” Latimer says.
The former ABC executive, who declined to be named, said the simplest explanation for the local stations’ woes was their broadcast material.
“While rivals have continued to provoke, argue and surprise, ABC Radio has become safer, flatter and more predictable,” the former executive says. “The data suggests listeners haven’t been driven away by technology, but by programming that no longer feels essential.”
Marks says the ABC’s job isn’t to chase clicks and provoke, like the commercial talkback model, but he agrees there needs to be investment in the renewed success of the ABC’s local radio.
“It’s important we see positive momentum in the short to medium term, and I think we can already see the impact of some of that work.
“The ABC’s purpose is to provide valued services that reflect and contribute to Australian society, culture and identity, not to compete in the marketplace of clicks.
“Quality, the diversity and distinctiveness of each channel and format, and the ability to serve accurately and distinctively every community that we operate in will stand us in good stead against the rise of noisier formats.”
Now the changes have been made, it’s up to the audience, who will vote with their feet.

Help! My new partner doesn’t wash his hands after going to the toilet

Help! My new partner doesn’t wash his hands after going to the toilet
Q: I’ve met a lovely man. But the other day, I heard him go to the toilet for a long session, then come out without washing his hands. No mistake about it, the soap was bone-dry when I checked. Now I feel reluctant to hold hands or get intimate with him. Please help! T.S., Mildura, VIC
A: Aww, what a romantic scenario to share on Valentine’s Day. You lurking outside the bathroom while your man is in there, your ear pressed against the door like a detective on Law & Order: Special Toilet Unit. And when he comes out, hiding behind a pot plant until he’s gone, then sneaking in to do your surveillance work: examining the moisture content of the soap, inspecting the dampness quotient of the hand towel, counting the remaining toilet-roll squares to confirm that it was an actual sit-down, square-using session.
But do you really know what he was doing in there? He may have just been plucking his inner nostrils. Men do that in bathrooms: our nose hairs regrow every 15 minutes; it’s a part-time job. Or he may have gone in there to get some time out from you because you’re always following him around everywhere, checking on him, ducking down behind pot plants.
But if you’re right, here’s a handy little handwashing tip that might help: men are very open to self-improvement when it comes to intimacy ultimatums. Subtly suggest that you’ll be withholding all spicy activity until he improves his bathroom hygiene, and I guarantee he’ll start washing his hands about 200 times a day. You’ll be going through a bar of soap every hour. His hands will be so puckered and blistered and raw from frenzied over-scrubbing, you won’t want them going anywhere near you. But you made your promise. Now you’ve got to see it through.

Rachel spent five years ‘quiet quitting’ her marriage. Her husband didn’t see it coming
Whether single, divorced or “subconsciously uncoupling”, an ever-increasing number of women of a certain age – and means – are rethinking their romantic relationships.
Four middle-aged women, members of a long-running book club, stand around a marble island bench in the kitchen of an inner-west Sydney terrace, sipping rosé while the host assembles a salad. Call it an extraordinary general meeting of the club – there’s no book on the agenda, and more serious issues are on the table.
“He wasn’t very attractive but it went for six weeks and was fantastic; I had sex again and then I said, ‘Thank you very much,’ ” says one of the guests, Sally*, who met the man she’s referring to via a friend soon after ending her marriage in 2020. Sally, 53, hadn’t dated since her early 20s. “I later learnt that that’s called a ‘palate cleanser’. The kids just thought I was at book club a lot.”
Claudia* interjects to share her expression for a rebound hook-up – “like a sniff of coffee beans”.
Sally, long, fair hair and cool glasses, resumes her story. “Then I started doing the bloody Bumble thing and I was like, ‘This is terrible!’ ” She turns to Rachel* – “like when you and I went speed dating and you came out of that and said you were going to become a lesbian”. Rachel, 59 and slender with strawberry-blonde hair pulled back, replies: “I liked the women more.”
But Sally, the head of finance for a large corporation, is a driven woman and, after two decades with “a terrible husband” who wrapped her in debt, was determined to find a new partner, a good man. She left no stone unturned. An expensive agency introduced her to an international businessman who bought her clothes, took her to restaurants and picked her up in limousines. “There was completely no substance,” Sally says. “After about four months, like when you get past that headiness, I realised my brain was inconvenient to him.” Back in the dating-app swamp, she chatted online briefly to a man who told her about his weekend and sent her a photograph of a barbecue he’d just assembled. “It’s a boy thing,” he told her, before asking what she’d been up to. “That weekend, literally, I’d been chainsawing trees in my garden. It didn’t go very far after that.” But Sally treated her search as a project. “I’d meet six different dates in three weeks, give it a break and just live for a while, and then go back in and I’d do it again.”
Lucy* the 62-year-old host, turns from the sink where she’s draining spaghetti and says to Sally: “You were really brave. You kept getting back out there, you were really corporate about it – like, ‘OK, it’s a numbers game.’ If John and I split up, that’d be it for me, I’d never go online, I’m terrified of it.”
Like Sally, Rachel is determined too. For five years she knew she wanted to leave her husband – he was “emotionally unavailable”, neglectful of her and their children, utterly focused on his IT business. Sometimes when he was working, he’d tell her that he was “in the zone” – as in don’t interrupt him. Sometimes he’d go away for weeks on end. “You did everything, you raised the kids, you pressure-hosed the driveway, you did everything,” Lucy comments. But Rachel wanted her youngest child to turn 18 before she upended the marriage. She parked her unhappiness. In early 2022, she buckled – just before her daughter’s birthday.
“It was, ‘I can’t do this marriage any more,’ I was just done.” Her husband was blindsided. “It was this anger, like, ‘How dare you inconvenience my life which is so good with you doing everything.’ ” One of his first responses to the news was to ask Rachel to hold off until he’d closed a major contract. Plating up spaghetti ragù, Lucy observes: “Women check out a long time before they actually leave, and when they do finally walk out the door the men are like, ‘What! I didn’t see this coming!’ If they’d been paying attention, they would have noticed that she hadn’t been present for years.”
Rachel was ready for adventure after her marriage ended. “I’m quite a sexual person and I needed to enjoy that aspect of my life again.” She had a year-long relationship with the first (and last) man she met via an app. He was kind and loving and the sex was great but, politically, they were a gulf apart. “And he never stopped talking about himself.” Rachel, a public servant, told the man it was over. Now she’s ambivalent about ever entering another relationship. “I’m quite happy to be single,” she says. “It’s important women aren’t afraid to be alone; it’s really disempowering to be afraid to be alone.”
This evening’s book club agenda: a new feminist movement – a revolution in how heterosexual women in midlife are thinking about love, relationships, men and living arrangements. An ever-increasing number of women of a certain age, disaffected with where they’ve found themselves after lifetimes of socialisation about women’s roles, are binning old romantic scripts that cast them as labourers and emotional moorings and reassessing what they want their lives to look like.
Sally’s and Rachel’s stories are emblematic of the shift: both are what psychologists might dub “walkaway wives”; both ditched deeply unsatisfying marriages once they felt their children were old enough to cope with upheaval. Their decisions match a broader demographic shift: while the divorce rate is at its lowest in 50 years, the share of divorces involving couples married 20 years or more – a proxy for midlife and older splits – has risen by about 30 per cent over three decades. (There is no available data to reflect the rate of de facto separations; and, as Nicole Kidman knows too well, men still leave women.) But this story is about more than marriages ending: it’s about what women are deciding to do when they are single again – regardless of whether they chose to leave the relationship or were left. Women who have the financial resources to do so are increasingly taking a stand, sometimes for the first time, about what sort of man and partnership is worth their time and energy, even if that means they end up building solo lives.
Dr Elisabeth Shaw, a clinical psychologist and CEO of Relationships Australia NSW, talks to hundreds of women every year, and has felt the changing temperature. “We’ve really seen out the phase where women feel they need a man to feel good enough,” Shaw says. “More women in midlife are willing to stand alone and take what comes.”
On the morning of the book club, Lucy, a shrewd, plugged-in identity in the Sydney entertainment world, emailed me a recent article from Oprah Daily headed, “Why the Stereotype of the Desperate Single Woman Is Becoming a Thing of the Past”. It cited 2022 Pew Research Centre data showing that 65 per cent of single American women overall (versus 50 per cent of men) were not actively seeking love or dates, while 2020 data reported this rising to 71 per cent for women aged 50-plus. The article noted: “We are living through a moment of quiet refusal, a steady unravelling of roles we never truly wanted.” Now, as Lucy herds us towards the dinner table, she mentions the article. She believes the same change is happening in Australia but is convinced the article understates its weight. “I think it’s far more consequential, a profound shift in the bedrock of the patriarchy and, as an offshoot, it translates to something of a crisis for midlife and older men, particularly in the midst of the male loneliness epidemic. They’ve always been able to rely on having a woman to take care of them; what happens if women clock off?”
In early November last year on national television, Terri Rippon turned down a man, offering Australian women a stunning visual of what midlife female empowerment can look like. In a moment of excellent television, Rippon was steadfast. Although it’s a far less interesting detail, she was beautiful too: silver-blue Grecianesque gown, unsullied grey hair and eyes so deeply blue you could dive into them.
This is what anachronistic television looks like: on the semi-reality show The Golden Bachelor (broadcast on Nine, the owner of this masthead) a silver fox – in this instance, Barry “Bear” Myrden – is ushered through orchestrated dates with a group of middle-aged women before picking them off in a series of tense “rose ceremonies”. The women wait, helpless, as he pauses for dramatic effect before calling on them one by one to receive a rose. Those who do not get a bloom are booted.
As one of the contestants, Rippon had squirmed through a number of the ceremonies, at the end of which Myrden selected her to play on. In one episode, she watched another contestant’s anxiety build as she waited on his decision. “I couldn’t get that out of my mind: here’s this woman feeling that way over a man, waiting for this man to choose her.” By episode five, Rippon was done. “Terri, will you accept this rose?” Myrden asked. For what seemed a lifetime, she was silent. He asked her again. Finally, she stepped forward. “I thought long and hard about it,” she said, shaking her head, smiling kindly, “I’m not going to accept your rose.” Was that a how-dare-she look darting across the bachelor’s face?
Now Rippon, a 62-year-old property developer from Torquay on Victoria’s Surf Coast, tells me her answer was not premeditated or scripted. She simply realised that she had no interest in competing with other women for a man. Her thinking about men and relationships has been hard-won. In 2000, Rippon’s then-husband told her he needed to move out “to work things out”. She discovered he had started a new relationship when her young sons returned from an outing and told her they’d met “Daddy’s new girlfriend”. “I was a complete mess,” she says. “It really broke me.”
Rippon has had three long-term relationships in the years since, the last with a financially insecure man a decade younger. “It was great – probably sexually driven – but he was immature. I remember having an argument with him one day and I said, ‘My god, I’m nearly f---ing 60, I don’t need to put up with this crap.’ ” She is not interested in being either a “nurse or a purse” for a man, she says. “I’m sick of helping men. If I met somebody now, he has to be at least on the same level as me financially and I most likely would never live with them. They need to have their house, I’d have my house. Happy days.”
Rippon’s Golden Bachelor turn is not the only pop culture moment to reflect the midlife shift. Backlash against the influencer-driven, frilly-aproned trad-wife movement was in full swing by the time Lyz Lenz’s divorce memoir, This American Ex-Wife – which described marriage as “a commonplace horror” – was released in early 2024. Two months later, American writer Miranda July’s novel All Fours, the “first great perimenopause novel” according to The New York Times Magazine, quickly became a rallying point for women. “Sometimes I could hear Harris’s dick whistling impatiently like a teakettle, at higher and higher pitches until I finally couldn’t take it and so I initiated,” says July’s anti-heroine of the chore of having sex with her husband alongside “endless cleaning and cooking and caring and working”. The Yale Review described the bestseller as “a call to freedom from conventional forms of domesticity and marriage”. In the novel, a semi-famous artist seething with hormones and discontent farewells her husband and young child and, instead of driving to New York for a work event, stops at a “junky” motel where she spends weeks in a transformative, dream-like liaison with a younger stranger. After All Fours′ publication, women bombarded July, 51, with messages confessing to their own relationship disaffections. Book clubs threw themselves upon it, All Fours group chats proliferated. Inspired, some women reportedly upturned their own lives.
English singer Lily Allen’s exceptional 2025 album West End Girl added another layer. Many read the autofictional exposé of the infidelities of 41-year-old Allen’s (now ex) husband as a rejection of the expectation women should stay silent about men’s poor behaviour. It electrified women, setting off a social media storm. “For every woman who’s twisted herself into a human pretzel to keep some emotionally constipated bloke happy, this is our national anthem,” one woman commented on Allen’s Instagram.
The zeitgeist has spawned headlines (“Is having a boyfriend embarrassing now?” – UK Vogue) and new language. Terms such as “heteropessimism” and “heterofatalism” have emerged to describe, in the main, women’s weariness and cynicism about straight relationships. As Annabel Crabb identified in her 2015 book, The Wife Drought, one of the troubles hetero women face is that they don’t get to have a wife. Even while working full-time, women continue to do the greatest share of unpaid household labour – on average, 32 hours a week, nine hours more than men, according to the Australian government’s 2025 Status of Women Report Card. Studies also have found that women bear about 70 per cent of the mental load of running households – keeping tabs on school projects, medical appointments, gifts for everyone as well as his mother. And then there’s “mankeeping”, a term postdoctoral Stanford University fellow Angelica Puzio Ferrara coined in 2024 to describe the work of being a partner’s de facto counsellor, managing his emotional turmoil and buttressing what is frequently a frail social network.
Little wonder a Chicago psychotherapist’s Substack post headed “Ageing Out of F---s” went viral in late 2025. Ellen Scherr, who claims “to help women navigate midlife transitions when you suddenly can’t tolerate anyone’s bullshit” argues that neurological and hormonal shifts can strip away decades of hypervigilant, people-pleasing behaviour and emotional labour. In their place, she writes, women in midlife can gain clarity, time and authenticity. ”Welcome to what I call the Great Unf---ening,” Scherr wrote. The first comment underneath said: “Wow. This was a whole exhale I didn’t know I’d been holding.”
Back at the book club dinner table: dragging sourdough through sauce, mopping up the spillover of revolutionary discussion. There are any number of aspects of this new love landscape to address. “We’ve looked the devil in the face and gone through the fire,” says Sally, laying down her fork. “We know who we are.”
Such resolve isn’t forged in a vacuum. By midlife, adding to the strain of difficult or insufferable relationships, any number of other blows can land, often simultaneously – bereavement, redundancy, caring for ailing parents or wayward young adult children, menopause, health issues. Eleanor Mills, the 55-year-old founder and CEO of Noon, an organisation dedicated to building community for women in midlife, calls it “the midlife clusterf---“. But Mills also describes an opposing force turbo-powering a woman’s agency at this time – the realisation that, in a “hundred-year life”, they still have time. “We’re seeing lots of women voting with their feet and saying, ’I’m not prepared to settle for something shit when I’m only halfway through my life,” says Mills. “We’re approaching midlife with a different kind of agency and sense of expectation.”
There’s no manual to explain the rules of engagement after a woman decides the status quo is untenable; things can be messy, protracted or even remain unresolved. Enter “quiet divorce” – what an article late last year in New York magazine’s The Cut termed “subconsciously uncoupling”, checking out on a marriage while remaining together, the age-old condition of detaching and living in a state of weary acceptance or worse. As Rachel knows, it can take a toll. During the five years she was quietly quitting her marriage, she endured crippling perimenopause symptoms and, at one point, underwent major surgery. She thought her husband would step up when she was released from hospital but on the first day home, she cooked the family dinner.
As Lucy brings a cake to the table, Rachel says she was on antidepressants and relied heavily on the “serenity prayer” to get through – accepting what can’t be changed and finding the courage to change what can. “You switch off the taxi light,” Sally says. “You do what you have to do,” Rachel replies.
Sally’s “quiet quitting” from her husband was noisier. As fast as she paid the mortgage, her husband piled up debts secured against the house. “I worked my arse off until I had enough to buy him out.” In 2010, she negotiated a financial separation from her husband, although she elected to stay under the same roof for another 10 years for their children’s sake. “I had to give him cash but it meant I had a legal agreement that I was the primary caregiver, the owner of the assets.” Now Sally finds herself thinking about women who don’t have the financial means to engineer exits. “The real work these days is helping women build a five-year plan, because it can take that long, you’ve got to get your ducks in a row.” She has been astonished at women she knows who haven’t even had their own bank accounts when they’ve separated from their husbands. “I’m like, ‘What are you doing!’ ”
Lucy shares her experience: soon after her marriage in the mid-2000s, her husband’s behaviour switched from kind to controlling and abusive. “I realised he was a liar, scary.” Like Sally, she was the main income earner, but it took her seven years to manoeuvre her way through her husband’s coercive control and out of the massive debt he’d landed her in. “With every move I made, I massaged his ego; I had to make him think that things were his idea and would benefit him.” Finally, in 2010, Lucy was able to transfer money out of joint accounts and cancel credit cards. “He wasn’t a shouter, he was a quiet man. He said to me, ‘I just tried to use the credit card.’ I said, ‘Yep, it’s not going to be working any more because we’re splitting up.’ He said, ‘Well, what am I meant to do for money?’ I said, ‘Get a job.’ I came out of the marriage going, I will not be treated like shit ever again.”
With such a mindset, building new intimate connections can be a slow, tremulous process. “I have to protect myself,” Rachel says. One woman I speak with for this article describes the experience of being with a new lover as “terrifying”: “I’m so rigidly keeping my vulnerabilities under wrap that it’s like walking on a tightrope. The truth is, after a spectacularly dramatic end to a long and ultimately toxic 20-year marriage, I’m not sure how I would cope with rejection again and that’s what drives my choices about relationships now. Midlife men should know that midlife women don’t need them – we are independent, we’re not looking for someone to look after us … they need to add value to our life!”
Another woman tells me that, although she recently started dating a new man after rebuilding herself from a devastating relationship breakdown in mid-2023, her only priority is maintaining a calm and peaceful home for her daughters. “The relationship will only continue if it is completely incremental to my life and my peace,” she says. “If in any way it compromises this beautiful life we have now, I just wouldn’t stand for it.”
Both Sally and Lucy are now in strong, committed relationships – Lucy has been with John for 13 years, Sally with Chris for a little over two years. Both are poster women for another hallmark of this new era – LAT relationships, people “living apart together”, maintaining relationships while keeping separate households. In 2019, more than 1.5 million single Australians had an intimate partner they didn’t live with. “It’s a case of build-your-own arrangement,” says Lucy, one of many women who see a LAT arrangement as defensive architecture as much as lifestyle preference, a way to achieve intimacy without slipping into old roles. “I am a great fan of geographic separation; from my experience, I don’t think men and women living together in a heterosexual relationship full-time serves women particularly well. Men are hard work, even the lovely ones. We lose ourselves and end up as domestic servants – it’s in our DNA.” Lucy and John, who both have young adult children, are only now starting to talk about moving closer or in together. “We’re having some really intense conversations about it; we both have baggage and I’m really protective of my own space.”
Lucy has counselled Sally about the issue of cohabitation. Soon after Sally met Chris, she was overwhelmed by the sense they should have been together forever. Lucy took her for coffee. “She said, ‘Don’t try and merge your houses and your kids all at once.’ That really settled me,” Sally says. For now, she and Chris see each other three nights out of seven. “We’ve got a rhythm, I really look forward to seeing him – it’s exciting, there’s so much joy in our relationship; even if eventually we move in together I think we’ll need ways to preserve that.”
Kerri Sackville, the Sydney-based author of Out There: A Survival Guide for Dating in Midlife, offers a compelling example of how living apart together can work. Four years ago, after a decade or more of misery, a marriage breakdown, another traumatic relationship and eight years of what she describes as “almost frenetic dating”, Sackville looked at her platonic friend Michael and had an epiphany. “I swear to god, it felt like I had been hit with the love stick,” she says. “I suddenly thought, ‘I want to touch his knee!’ ” They have been together since soon after that electrifying moment but still live apart. “From the start, we talked about how you can form your own ideas about what a relationship is and what it looks like.” They see each other most days, holiday together and are close to each other’s young adult children but don’t force them together. “As much as it would be nice to one day live together, there’s no urgency,” Sackville says. “We spend a lot of time together, but can then retreat back to our own places – I’m 57, he’s 61, we need space!” Still, she says, “it’s the first time in my life I can honestly say I’ve felt emotionally safe with someone else.”
One day while I’m writing this article I visit my literary agent, Fiona Inglis, at her Paddington office. She tells me a modern love story. As with so many such stories at our time of life – Inglis is 64 – it starts with a tragedy. In 2015, the father of her two young-adult sons died six weeks after being diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. For years, her boys were her sole focus. Soon after they had both finished high school, Inglis, the managing director of Curtis Brown Australia, signed up to Bumble.
Women in midlife aren’t rejecting love or men or relationships. They’re rejecting asymmetry in relationships.
In his dating profile, the man said he loved the ebb and flow of stories. “And I thought, ‘Well, stories are my life.’ ” Inglis met him in the Sydney beachside suburb of Coogee for a coffee. She remembers the blue of the sea and the sky and the red of his T-shirt, his thick grey hair. “Handsome, Irish.” She took him a book, a collection of short stories by the Irish writer Kevin Barry. At the end of the date, the man walked her to her car. “I said, ‘Well, that was fun, that was really fun’, and I put my hand out to shake his hand. He just pulled me into a big hug – he’s really tall, about six foot three – and said, ‘Yeah, me too.’ ” Inglis and Cathal (Karl) de Burca, a semi-retired microbiologist and IT consultant, were married last year at Wylie’s ocean baths in Coogee. He wore an Irish kilt, she wore Trelise Cooper. Her two boys walked her down the boardwalk. In her wedding speech, Inglis said: “I didn’t need to be rescued, I could quite easily have gone on living on my own perfectly happily, but now I have him in my life, I know I can lean on him for absolutely anything.”
The couple have what Inglis describes as “a daggy old house” on the NSW South Coast where de Burca spends most of his time. Inglis typically is in Sydney Monday to Wednesday and on the coast Thursday to Sunday. “I get down there and if I haven’t seen him for two days, we just fall into each other’s arms, we just love seeing each other.” When they swim in the ocean, Inglis slips in behind him. “He’s got really big shoulders and the way he swims is the way he lives; he’s really steady and strong and powerful, and I can just go in his wake.” They have a binding financial agreement but money is unimportant. “He brings absolutely everything else to the table; I feel so fulfilled by having him in my life.”
Women in midlife aren’t rejecting love or men or relationships. They’re rejecting asymmetry in relationships, the cost of love as it has been structured for generations. At multiple turns through the research for this piece, I come upon middle-aged women who have, in the past couple of years, fallen freshly and deeply in love. Book club member Claudia*, for example, who has never married and does not have children. At a pub one night in 2024, out with friends, she and an acquaintance, a widower, were the last to leave. “The seats were being packed up and we were still chatting,” Claudia, a 54-year-old researcher, tells the book club members. She’d not previously had a one-on-one conversation with the man. Within four months of the conversation, they’d both sold their houses and moved in together. “I could just tell he was solid,” she says. “This person is somebody I always want to stay with; I always want to be in the same room as him.”
But if there’s no man sufficiently solid or safe or emotionally literate to hand, midlife women are standing firm, holding on to their authenticity and refusing to compromise. Noon’s Eleanor Mills sees a woman at midlife as a chrysalis. “You finally get a chance to shake off everybody else’s expectations ... all the hoops you’ve had to jump through, and finally get a chance to say, ‘Well, what do I want?’ ” And women are having love affairs of a different nature – with tight groups of girlfriends bound by deep affection, big laughter, emotional support and common interests. “I’ve got the most wonderful girlfriends,” says The Golden Bachelor’s Terri Rippon, “my heart is so filled that men just don’t cut the mustard for me any more.”
The meeting to discuss the revolution is drawing to a close now; Sally and Rachel and Claudia are carrying plates into the kitchen while Lucy stacks the dishwasher. Sally mentions a woman she knows who walked away from her marriage just before she was 65. “She got absolutely caned by the kids and their friends but she just felt the marriage was dead; there wasn’t conflict, it was more just there was nothing. She wanted to travel, to live. He didn’t. She hasn’t stopped travelling since, she’s done the most amazing things.”
Lucy stops for a moment, mid-plate, thinks, and then says: “From birth, the biggest threat society says women face if they don’t conform is that they’ll end up on their own with cats. But, when you’ve been through shit with men, you think, ‘Actually, that sounds pretty good!’ ”

Aussie travel investors get a European tour from hell

Aussie travel investors get a European tour from hell
“Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!” was the famous Monty Python cry.
That was certainly the case for one of Australia’s most successful tourism businesses: ASX-listed Web Travel Group.
It all sounded pedestrian enough last Friday when the group informed the ASX that “the Special Delegation of the Balearic Islands of the Spanish Tax Agency has commenced an audit of its Spanish subsidiary in respect of direct taxes,” dating back three years.
A dusty little Web Travel office in Mallorca, the port city that was once a byword for British package-tour hell, and one-time refuge of the late Australian businessman fugitive, Christopher Skase.
What’s the big deal, right?
What followed was a level of market mayhem worthy of a Monty Python skit.
Web Travel shares crashed 41 per cent to an 11-year low, wiping hundreds of millions of dollars off its market valuation in the process. It was the sort of reaction you would expect for an extinction level event, not a standard audit by tax authorities.
As a shell-shocked boss John Guscic told investors on Monday, having signed off on the announcement while in Tunisia for work: “I went to bed on Thursday night as the market was about to open with a view that we just signed off on a straightforward, non market sensitive ASX release to keep the market appropriately informed.”
He woke up to a CEO’s worst nightmare.
“The market had obviously drawn a much broader and inaccurate conclusion about the content of the release, and we could have ever anticipated it would appear the assumption is we are facing an existential crisis,” Guscic said.
But the Web Travel team should have known better with investors still reeling from the unfolding disaster at one of Australia’s other globally successful travel operators, Corporate Travel Management.
As one analyst pointed out: “The revelation could not have come at a worse time. Investors in the Australian travel intermediary industry are still dazed over Corporate Travel’s accounting irregularities and customer overcharging in Europe/the UK – a saga that has frozen Corporate Travel shares since August 2025.”
Corporate Travel needs to restate its financial accounts going back years and determine if it overcharged clients, including the British government, more than the $160 million it has uncovered to date.
Its lucrative Australian government business is undergoing an independent audit and company founder Jamie Pherous stepped away this month with no clarity on if its shares would trade again. There is no suggestion Pherous was personally involved in or aware of the overcharging.
It’s a long way from Web Travel’s Balaeric concerns, but there is good reason for market caution – as shown by the fact that its stock trades at a significant discount to where it was before the Spanish inquisition kicked off.
But Web Travel’s management were always going to be caught between a rock and a hard place on this issue.
The reason they took the unusual step of announcing this audit was that the “the Special Delegation of the Balearic Islands of the Spanish Tax Agency” didn’t just send a letter through the post.
It showed up at the company’s office with around 12 agents. We know this because local media just happened to witness and photograph the entire operation with reporting that included alarming phrases such as “alleged tax fraud”.
Web Travel is understandably commenting as little as possible. Anything they say would only antagonise the authorities. A little bit of research indicates Spanish tax authorities are not to be messed with.
Late last year, Robert Amsterdam, founder of US law firm Amsterdam & Partners, warned of a “rule of law crisis” within Spain’s tax system which some describe as a hangover from the country’s days under the Franco dictatorship.
“Spain hasn’t passed a new national budget since 2022 and is using the Spanish Tax Authority to shore up the country’s finances by incentivising tax collectors through a shady bonus system. It’s not only unethical, but illegal in our view,” he said in a widely reported interview on the matter.
Web Travel has not said how much of its European revenue, which generates one-third of its overall business, is channelled through Spain.
The company, which used to own Web Jet, acts as an accommodation-selling middleman between hotels and travel agents, which means it is also facing AI concerns and the threat of disintermediation by its partners in this travel eco-system. But that’s a story for another day.
Right now, Web Travel just needs to deliver on the promise that there is no change to its financial outlook and avoid the kind of rolling disaster at Corporate Travel that might cost its investors billions.

Elections are reshaping global politics

From Japan to Israel, elections are reshaping global politics
At a time when so much of the global conversation is about the rapid decline of democracy, it is striking what a huge impact elections — and looming elections — are having on world events just now.
Overshadowed this week, as so often happens these days by news from Washington or the Middle East, was an election result in Japan with huge ramifications for the region, and Australia.
There's also been a landmark parliamentary election result in Bangladesh, after months of instability, as well as significant recent elections as far afield as Moldova and Portugal — either overcoming Russian interference or seeing off threatened incursions by the European far right.
And a complex web of looming poll battles in the United States, Israel, Ukraine and the UK, are exerting their influence over current events.
Japan's stance on Taiwan
The parliamentary dominance won this week by Japan's first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, raises the spectre of a big shift in the regional power balance, just as the clock starts ticking closer to the time many analysts believe China may seek to move on Taiwan.
Takaichi has suggested, since becoming prime minister last October, that Japan may get involved if there is a Chinese military blockade of Taiwan. China has made clear its displeasure. Takaichi has not only not backed down but framed her election win as popular endorsement of her position.
It raises fascinating questions about how north Asia — Japan and South Korea — might now collectively position themselves in the near future, and what knock on effects that might have more broadly.
Beyond the spectre of any looming confrontation over Taiwan, Takaichi has also already begun escalating spending on defence, even broaching the idea of Japan having nuclear weapons, and she also wants Japan to have a greater role in global defence exports.
She is doing this amid the great unravelling — world leaders repositioning themselves to a world that is not led by the United States — however hard it may be to ignore the world's biggest superpower.
Just as there is now uncertainty in the Asia-Pacific about US commitment to the region, and by contrast a fair bit of certainty in Europe about where it stands with the US, America's role in the Middle East seems particularly convoluted.
LoadingNetanyahu meets with Trump
This week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Donald Trump in the White House. It was a meeting taking place amid a lot of conflicting time pressures and it was strikingly absent of the usual pomp and circumstance.
There was no ceremonial welcome or "gaggle" — that moment when reporters are briefly allowed into the Oval Office for a picture of two leaders together and to shout questions.
The Israeli PM said the meeting had been brought forward a week because of planned US-Iran negotiations.
But it also meant Netanyahu was foregoing any attempt to attend the first meeting of Trump's Board of Peace in Washington next week.
And it also meant he would not be attending the annual conference of the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) — a pro-Israel lobby group which has reportedly collected an unprecedented amount of money to invest in this year's US mid-term elections. Netanyahu will reportedly attend the AIPAC conference virtually instead.
There was speculation as to whether the strange nature of the meeting reflected some plotting between the two close powers ahead of a possible US strike on Iran next week, or — as appeared more possible from public comments afterwards — a difference between the two leaders about whether the US should be negotiating with Iran at all.
Either way, it is all important in the context of looming Israeli political developments.
An election looms in Israel
A general election is not due in Israel until October. But there is a budget crisis in play right now which may bring forward an election to as early as May.
Ultra-Orthodox members of Netanyahu's parliamentary Coalition are threatening to block the national budget unless the government agrees to legislation to formalise exemptions from military service for ultra-Orthodox men. The deadline for the budget stand-off is March 31.
Netanyahu's hold on parliamentary power is weak. Polling numbers do not suggest a clear path to power after the election.
His culpability in the security breakdown which allowed the massacre of Israelis on October 7 is being questioned during an inquiry.
The government's shaky political situation at home can be seen to explain much of recent events in Israel — from the government's announcement this week of an aggressive escalation in powers to control the West Bank, as well as the posturing with Trump.
The even more aggressive push into the West Bank and expansion of illegal settlements in the Palestinian territory was seen as a clear attempt to lock in the government's far right support.
Far-right Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the moves, saying, "we will continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state".
But Trump has repeatedly made clear he does not support an annexation of the West Bank and this might explain why the announcement of the new moves in Israel were notably lacking a firm timeline.
Netanyahu's regional strongman persona suffers if the US does not strike Iran.
But the US president has moved from last month threatening an imminent strike from his vast Armada to rejecting immediate action and instead pushing for negotiations.
This gives Netanyahu all the more reason to push the West Bank expansion to shore up his credentials.
His closeness to Trump is also seen as a political plus so it is also worth noting that this week the US president was invited to come to Israel on the nation's Independence Day in late April — potentially only a month from polling day — to personally receive the Israel Prize. He is the first foreign leader and the first non-Israeli citizen or resident to receive the prize.
All in all, pundits in Israel see the signs increasingly pointing to an early poll, and to the government taking actions to maximise its position ahead of that election.
Meanwhile in Ukraine
The spectre of elections even arose in Ukraine this week, with reports that preparations for elections — not held since war broke out — had been underway for some time under pressure from the United States.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hosed down that idea, saying elections would only occur once there were security guarantees and a ceasefire with Russia in place.
It could well be that the US mid-terms end up being the decisive ones for Ukraine's future, given the perception in Washington that Trump wants to see an end to the war he said would end within 24 hours of him returning to the White House, before Americans go to the polls in November.
Elections are even tempering the fallout from the Epstein files.
The crisis surrounding the future of UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer over his appointment of disgraced Epstein associate Peter Mandelson has been diffused for now. That's partly because, well, there really isn't a good alternative and partly because of elections. First up there's a by-election in a couple of weeks' time. And then in May, there are significant votes for local councils and national parliaments in Scotland and Wales.
So amid all the warfare — military and political — and the trashing of institutions abroad in the world, it seems the raw allure of bums on seats still remains a force to be reckoned with.

analysis
Ley didn't define herself by her gender but women might relate to her workplace woes
And they say the Liberal Party doesn't get women.
They got this one pretty quickly — after just nine months. One human gestational period elapsed before Sussan Ley — the first woman to lead the Liberal Party in its 82-year history — was this morning crisply sent on eternity leave by an emphatic vote of her colleagues.
Ley isn't the most swiftly-eliminated leader in the party's federal history. She held on to the job 24 days longer than Alexander Downer, and 16 days fewer than Brendan Nelson. So premature ejection isn't exclusively a lady phenomenon.
And Ley would be the last person who'd want to be assessed purely on the basis of her gender.
Her entire life and career — in farming, aviation, the finance sector, politics — is testament to her preparedness to advance dauntlessly into the denser cock-forests of the Australian biosphere.
She's prospered in many jobs thanks to her diligence, indefatigability and patience, and she's lost this one due to her inability to carry Australians with her. None of the above-listed virtues and failings is gender specific, and it'd be foolish to attribute today's vote chiefly to sexism. Or to argue that women won't return to a Liberal Party led by a man. Women are not stupid. Also, it's more complicated than that.
Some classic workplace tropes
The issue for the Liberal Party is not simply the toppling of a female leader. It's also about what happened to that leader while she was in the job.
And while Ley departed the scene yesterday with unimpeachable good grace, channelling the 4th century Christian martyr Agnes of Rome with her spotless white garb and remembering to thank everyone and to be especially nice about Angus, it's entirely available for less even-tempered females to conclude that her party has some pretty wild double standards.
Among professional women, the fastest-growing demographic in Australia, who also — perhaps relatedly — are among the fastest-defecting voters from the Liberal Party, some of Ley's experiences are classic workplace tropes.
For example:
- Adult Man Babysitting: A situation in which female leaders are sometimes called in to nurse male colleagues through tantrums. Absolute calm is required from her in these circumstances, because even though the tantrum may be about quite a small injury to the relevant dude's ego, if she raises her voice she will absolutely acquire a reputation as a "psycho". See: Negotiations with the National Party.
- Not In The WhatsApp: A phenomenon in which a female leader may become aware that a group of chaps has openly assembled to discuss which of them will get her job, while she is quite busy doing that job. See: The pre-funeral breakfast gathering in Melbourne last month in which an influential group of Liberal men gathered to nut out who would take Ley's place. See also: Julie Bishop, the previous most senior serving Liberal woman, who weathered several leadership spills and regularly witnessed horse-trading between male colleagues over who would get to be deputy, even though she was the deputy and was sitting right there.
- Clean That Up, Would You? In which it becomes extremely urgent for a female leader to fix up a long-standing and extremely knotty problem, even when it has been kicked down the road or in some cases even created by the exact people who are very desirous of a quick resolution. See: Sussan Ley facing pressure from colleagues including Angus Taylor and Barnaby Joyce to abandon the Coalition's commitment to net zero, negotiated in government five years earlier by *checks notes* Barnaby Joyce and Angus Taylor.
- Changing Goalposts: In which a female leader takes a deep breath, mutters fervent prayers to an unresponsive deity and — after consulting widely — accepts a position that may not be her own view but seems genuinely to reflect the majority opinion across her team. At which point the chaps who got their way either defect to One Nation or go for her job regardless. (See point 3)
- Just, I Don't Know… *vague gesture* ... Not Up To It: A classic of the genre, where everyone is convinced that a female leader is generally just not quite right, though no-one can quite put their finger on why. In the genteel rush to rule out the obvious factor (BOOBS!) much weight will commonly come to rest on minor gaffes. See: Sussan Ley's analysis last year that Anthony Albanese's Joy Division T-shirt was an unforgivable piece of subliminal anti-Semitism. Rococo, admittedly. But worse than Angus Taylor's inability, in Question Time, as shadow treasurer, to distinguish between monthly and annual inflation?
An interesting coincidence
These are historical matters now, as far as Ley is concerned. The first female leader of the Liberal Party is off to embark on her new phase of life, leaving the Parliament entirely. The Liberal women of the House of Representatives — having previously required a seven-seater to car-share to work, with a space for handbags — will soon be able to travel in a compact sedan.
Ley herself, it's abundantly clear, does not plan to hang around and settle scores. She is moving on, citing a mantra she learned in her piloting days: "If I had an ego, I'd be dead."
It's unlikely there will be regular commentary on the efforts of her successor, or efforts to defend her legacy or revel in whatever misfortune might come the way of her malefactors.
Of the six former prime ministers of this country who still draw breath, there is really only one who has consistently employed a similar approach. It's the only other woman. What an interesting coincidence.

The world knows how they died. Their families share how they lived
These are the stories of the 15 people killed at Bondi Beach, in the words of those who knew them best and loved them most.
The singer who couldn’t resist a microphone. The mother with Bond girl good looks. The father who woke at dawn to ride alongside his paperboy son. A lolly man, an ideas man, a Holocaust survivor, and a big sister who daydreamed of capybaras.
These are the 15 innocent people killed by two gunmen in a terror attack at Bondi Beach that terrible day, December 14, 2025. Their deaths are known to the world, but their lives are worth remembering.
Their loved ones are the custodians of their memories. Here we have compiled interviews, testimonials, eulogies, family photos, and tenderly crafted words that these memory-keepers were willing to share.
Boris Tetleroyd
Anyone who met Boris Tetleroyd heard him sing. With a tremendous voice and skilled at playing the guitar and piano, he captivated friends, family, and colleagues with renditions of The Beatles and Russian songs from his youth.
“He was just fearless. He didn’t have any kind of stigma, any kind of inhibition. He would just go up and perform,” son Ya’akov remembers.
Niece Jenny Roytur said whenever the family went out and there was a band playing, Boris would find a way to get involved.
“If there was a microphone available … he would grab it,” she said.
Music was how he met his wife, Svetlana. He regularly played at the restaurant where she worked in their home town, now Tashkent, Uzbekistan.
They had three sons – Ya’akov, Roman and Michael – before fleeing the crumbling Soviet Union in 1989, travelling through Italy before landing in Australia and settling in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.
Boris worked as a draftsman for Transport for NSW for 30 years. He had planned to retire by the end of the year.
He loved living on the coast and would walk from Bronte to Maroubra regularly. Surviving colon cancer in the early 2000s “ignited” Boris’ wellness journey, and he began attending yoga retreats and discovered meditation.
He was also detail-oriented, which he attributed to his time in the USSR military. He would tell stories of navigating the Black Sea, peeling thousands of potatoes, and mentoring his shipmates through rough waters.
“His time in the army really served him well throughout his life. He was a very disciplined man,” Ya’akov says.
He was diligent. Boris archived more than 100 years of family history, and stored records and photos to bring out at family gatherings. He loved adding to the cache, snapping photos at family events.
Faith was a big part of his life. His sons were circumcised in secret under Soviet rule, and Boris underwent the procedure aged 60 in Australia.
“He was a very holy man, and he had a lot of wisdom … people just went to him with questions, and he would listen. He was one of the best listeners I know,” Ya’akov says.
“My father died celebrating his Judaism. He came there to celebrate light and happiness. And so my father died the way he lived, with light and happiness.”
Rabbi Eli Schlanger
Two hours before he was killed, Rabbi Eli Schlanger was leaning over the gate in front of his sister’s pool, confiding in his brother-in-law, Rabbi Mendel Kastel.
While the kids swam and nagged for jam doughnuts, Eli was wrestling with his future: The 41-year-old was reckoning with letting go of control of an event he had nurtured for almost two decades, Chanukah by the Sea.
“He was very involved. But this was the first year where he wasn’t running around schlepping chairs and dragging stuff an hour before,” says his sister, Tzippy Kastel.
Instead, Eli was by the pool in the Kastel home near Bondi, as he was most Sundays, with one of his five children hanging off him, playing pranks and imitating family members.
The Kastels remember their last moments with Eli because they were recorded: the final sun-drenched glimpses from four decades spent together, captured forever by the home security cameras necessary for a Jewish family to live safely in Bondi.
“He had a lot of chutzpah. He was cheeky. He had no filter,” Kastel says. “He lived on Bondi Beach, for God’s sake, he was running around there with a beard, dressed in black and white, and everyone else is wearing whatever, he didn’t care, he would rock it with confidence.”
Eli, the little boy with a lisp, became a peacemaker within his family and a counsellor to hardened criminals in the prison system. He was “like a cushion”, Kastel says.
When Eli was still in primary school, the family of 11 moved from London to New York. After studying in France, he joined his family in Sydney, where he not only ran the festival at which he was killed, but also helped build the Chabad centre where his funeral was held.
“He was obsessed with that building. He chose the Jerusalem stone, the materials, and the fabric,” she says. “Everything was personal to him.”
He was a devout religious scholar of the Torah and a Zionist. He hosted barbecues for Israeli soldiers near the border with Gaza and toured controversial Israeli settlements in the West Bank, as the conflict in the Middle East reverberated around the world.
When Anthony Albanese recognised Palestine as a state last year, he wrote to the prime minister urging him to “rescind this act of betrayal”.
“He just absolutely loves Israel,” Kastel says. “When you go there, your soul’s on fire. He had that passion for that reason.”
Two months on from his death, there is still passion in the family, but there is also grief. It’s in security footage at the Kastel home, the family photos, the last $5 note from a Hanukkah raffle that he let Kastel’s son keep. It’s in the streets of Bondi and in the synagogue.
Every time family members go to the kosher shop or Jewish school, they are confronted by others who have lost someone who was once an indispensable part of their lives.
“We’re just feeling a gaping hole,” Kastel says.
Rabbi Yaakov Levitan
Eli Schlanger was an ideas man; Rabbi Yaakov Levitan got them done.
Their wives were close, very close. They had been best friends since high school. Eli and Yaakov would form their own formidable partnership, becoming the driving force behind not only the Chabad of Bondi but also the Chanukah by the Sea festival, where they were both gunned down.
“How do we make any sense of it?” says his brother-in-law, Rabbi Mordechai Guth.
“What was he doing at the moment his soul left his body? He was involved in an event designed to strengthen, inspire, and bring people together.
“Specifically, he was a man with a hot dog stand. Not because he made hot dogs, but because somebody had to man the hot dog stand. And to be involved with something so pure and so special, at the moment that, as providence would have it, turned out to be his last moments, that actually gives a little bit of comfort.”
Guth says Yaakov was a person who brought out others’ potential, and made it real in the name of “making the world more luminous in the spirit of Hanukkah”.
His role in the community spanned everything from running the synagogue and organising trips to Israel, to checking torah scrolls and making funeral arrangements.
When a dozen of their own were massacred on Bondi Beach, Yaakov would have been the person the community turned to for the painful logistics. Instead, the 39-year-old father of four was being buried himself.
“If you go to the Chabad at Bondi today, six weeks after the event, there are certain things that nobody really knows how they work because he was the one who would maintain them,” Guth says.
Yaakov’s small acts of kindness, known as a mitzvah in the Jewish tradition, extended beyond the Chabad. They ranged from helping neighbours rewire their internet cables buried underground to establishing tapNgive, a company that provided tap-and-pay donation kiosks for fundraising.
“The greatest reward for him was that something got done, not that he received recognition,” friend Avremi Joseph told the Chabad. “He was the spine of all Jewish organisations in Sydney.”
Marika Pogany
Roman Benuska speaks tenderly of his mother’s divine red fingernails.
“She was always beautifully manicured from the day I can remember,” he says.
Benuska holds up his phone displaying his favourite photograph of his mother, taken decades earlier. His friends were on the money when they described her as a Bond girl. Marika is breathtakingly beautiful as she leans against a brick wall in bright sunlight. Her blonde hair was perfectly coiffed, with half-moon curls over her ears and leopard print trimming around the collar and button-down front of her white outfit.
“I just can’t believe that’s my mum,” he says proudly.
The feeling was mutual. Her son was the greatest achievement of her life.
“I’d say the most common memory I’ve got in my mum is a protector, defender, whenever you fall, whenever you’re hungry, whenever you want a toy,” Benuska says. “She was there at the drop of a hat. That would be my mum.”
Known lovingly as “Omi”, the mother and grandmother came to Australia from Czechoslovakia in 1968 with her son and her own protector, her older brother, Ivan.
Marika became a citizen four years later and embraced her “Aussie” life with pride.
“She always worried about others, especially as she was getting older, more so than herself,” Benuska said in a video played at the Light Will Win commemoration held at Sydney Opera House in January.
Talk to anyone who worked with her in the kitchen or tuckshop, Benuska says. They’d tell you that she was very bossy.
“She used to get the mums, sort of boss them around.”
She loved working with Meals on Wheels and Sydney COA, a volunteer service for Jewish seniors.
“Twice a week, she was off driving around … making meals for those who needed them,” Benuska told mourners at Marika’s funeral at the St Joseph’s College Chapel in Hunters Hill.
“She was welcoming. She would take you in and have a chat. That person you know is always there. Now I look back, that is the part you miss.”
Friend Susie Berger described Marika, 82, as happy to help anybody without being asked.
“I spoke to her on the Saturday before that terrible Sunday,” Berger recalled. “It makes my sorrow so much more bearable to know I told her 24 hours before her death that I loved her.”
Describe a social butterfly, and like the kaleidoscopic patterns of a butterfly’s wings, the refracted hues of Marika’s identity (Australian, Hungarian, Slovenian, Jewish, Catholic, non-religious) drew all manner of people to her.
“It didn’t matter who you were. She would welcome you into her circle,” Berger says.
“She would never just have coffee with one or two friends. You would arrive and find that she would have invited 10 or 15 more.
“Now we have to find a new boss.”
Reuven Morrison
To his three grandchildren, his name was “Zaida”. To them, he was everything.
When they won awards at school, he was the first person they would call. He let his twin granddaughters wrap him in bandages when playing doctor. They told their mother they liked to go shopping with him, “because Zaida had no budget”.
“He would move heaven and Earth to get them what they wanted,” daughter Sheina Gutnick says. “But at the same [time] … he gave them so much of their heritage and their identity.”
Reuven Morrison, born in 1963 in the former Soviet Union, knew the cost of that identity. At school, he was singled out by classmates as a “dirty Jew”. Teachers stamped his school reports with marks branding him Jewish. His family shared an apartment overlooking the schoolyard and, when Reuven’s mother saw him in a scuffle with other children, she came down and beat them with a rolling pin.
Seeking safety, Reuven emigrated with his parents to Australia. He was 14. On a visit to Bondi Beach, he met another young Jewish refugee from the Soviet Union. Her name was Leah. They were wearing the same Levi’s jeans. The teenage Reuven playfully suggested that, one day, “that ass is gonna be mine”. They were married two years later.
With Leah by his side, Reuven built an empire from the ground up. He started as a 14-year-old locksmith’s apprentice, then sold cigarettes at Kings Cross. He ran a potato processing plant in Queensland, an apple orchard, a printing and fax business, and then a petrol station. Slowly, he built a sprawling development empire across Sydney.
Reuven and Leah were blessed with one daughter, Sheina, “born after many years of praying and waiting”, friend Chanie Hebel says. Sheina was the centre of his universe, and “Papa Morrison” to her friends. The family moved to Melbourne in 2006, but Reuven commuted to Sydney for work and stayed close to the city’s Russian Jewish community. He was part of a group of philanthropists who built and donated the $30 million Chabad synagogue in Bondi, which opened in 2024. “His other baby,” Sheina calls it.
Sheina grew up, got married, and moved into the house across the street. When the twins were born, Reuven gave the couple a walkie-talkie to call them during the night.
“I have this image of him and Mum on the couch at like 2am, each with a baby in their hand, giving them a bottle,” Sheina says.
Reuven’s upbringing under Soviet rule gave him a relentless work ethic and moral compass. The 62-year-old worked between Sydney and Melbourne. Sometimes, he was gone for weeks at a time. His grandchildren reminded him it was worth it.
“Having the kids walk in the door after school and jump into his arms just meant the world to him,” Sheina says. “They meant the whole world. They were [his] continuation. They were the light.”
Adam Smyth
The two oldest children of 50-year-old Adam Smith, Harry and Matilda, shared these words about their Dad.
“We are not able to speak at this time because of grief, but we would like to share these words in writing. They can be printed exactly as written:
“Adam was a devoted father. He was proud of us, his children – Harry (27), Matilda (21), Angus (17) and Olivia – and of who we were becoming. He showed up – coaching junior sport, helping at schools, at clubs, at charities – not because he wanted praise, but because he believed that being part of a community meant carrying some of the weight.
“Dad was hardworking. One of our earliest memories of this was when Harry got his first job at 11 years old, delivering newspapers. It meant 5am starts, riding a heavy bike loaded with newspapers – more than a young kid could easily handle. Dad woke him up every morning and rode alongside him the whole way. He didn’t just tell him he could do hard things – he showed him.
“Dad valued effort, movement, and showing up – especially in sport. He ran multiple marathons, Oxfam Trail 100km events, triathlons, played junior soccer for Avalon, senior soccer at college, and later for Old Melburnians in Melbourne. He loved his teams – Liverpool and the Sydney Swans – and followed them with loyalty. But more than any of that, there was nothing better for him than watching us play our sports. On sidelines, in cold mornings and hot afternoons, he was there either as coach, team manager or cheerleader.
“In Dad’s passing, we hope that his life was not lived in vain – that from this horror we take away a true desire to be more compassionate, more aware of our community, and more willing to stand with one another. Not only the grieving, but all Australians.
“We hope we become more grateful for the freedoms we have, and more respectful toward those of every faith, colour, and creed. For our generation – and for the children who come after us – we must build this culture.
“If this is read in 10 years, we want people to know this: Adam’s life mattered. It should be remembered for what he gave, not how he died.
“Adam believed in helping. He believed in showing up. He believed in community.
“His life will not have been lived in vain if we choose to become more compassionate, more aware, and more respectful of each other – not just in grief, but always.”
Tibor Weitzen
Tibor Weitzen was fond of saying, “Life is too short, eat ice-cream”. And so he did. Every evening, wife Eva Weitzen says.
She has plenty of ice-cream in the home she shared with her devoted husband of 56 years.
Eva never doubted his love for her: “For him, I was something very special”.
Tibor, 78, was born in 1947 in the Soviet Union and migrated to Israel, then to Australia in the late 1980s.
He was the proud father of two, with 11 grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
“He was [an] absolutely crazy grandfather,” Eva says of his doting ways.
“Family was everything to him,” daughter Hanna Abesidon said in the commemoration video. “He was a selfless person. Everybody [else] came first.”
For 18 years, Tibor ran a weekly club called Friends of Refugees of Eastern Europe (FREE), which brought elderly Russian-speaking members of the Jewish community together to foster a sense of belonging.
In 2015, he was honoured with an award for his commitment and volunteering at a Chabad Bondi Gala dinner.
Grandson-in-law Mendy Amzalak says Tibor brought joy to everyone he met, especially the children at the Bondi Shul.
“In every Shul, there’s someone called the ‘lolly man’ whose job is to keep the kids quiet by giving them lollies so as not to disrupt the sermons,” Amzalak says. “In the Bondi Shul, that was Tibor.”
Tibor would be remembered for the light he brought to others.
“My wife’s pregnant and to think my second child won’t meet their grandfather is heartbreaking,” Amzalak says.
“He was a very warm person,” Abesidon says. “Don’t judge anybody. Give everybody the benefit of the doubt. He didn’t want anybody to be harmed; he didn’t want anybody to suffer. And I think these days, with what we’re going through. I think he would say: stop it.”
Matilda Bee Britvan
When Michael and Valentyna Britvan named their firstborn Matilda, they chose a middle name that captured her spirit: Bee. She was as bright and busy as her namesake, bringing sweetness and joy wherever she went.
Her first toy was a bumblebee, and for special events, she could often be found in her favourite yellow dress with zebra patterns.
The 10-year-old had wavy brown hair, her face framed by a fringe, and bright blue eyes. She wore a gold necklace bearing her name and loved the colour purple.
Her parents, who moved separately from Ukraine to Australia before settling in Sydney’s east, remembered her at an emotional memorial at the Sydney Opera House. “[The sisters] love to sing, they love to dance,” Michael said. “She was very, very peaceful and kind.”
Matilda was a devoted older sister. Her sibling shared memories of the pair racing scooters and playing games in the park. That adventurous streak defined Matilda; she was an active child who spent her time rollerblading, practising acrobatics, and training in judo. She loved to travel.
Matilda had started a diary “talking about ‘my crush’ and pages about capybaras”, Michael says. “It was all happy stuff.”
At La Perouse Public School, Matilda was so beloved by her classmates that they gave her an Indigenous nickname: “wuri wuri”, meaning the little ray of sunshine. Her favourite subject was maths.
It was a sentiment echoed by Valentyna, who remembered her daughter as the light of their lives.
“Her smile was bringing the light. She lights up everyone who walks past and she was bringing the light in this world. No one seen her with no smile on her face.”
Alex Kleytman
Alex Kleytman gave his family a new life when he uprooted them and left his home of 54 years in the former Soviet Union.
“It was a gift to our family,” daughter Sabina says. “My dad fell in love with Australia. You couldn’t say anything bad about it.”
Alex, 87, survived the Holocaust and a Siberian work camp during World War II. In the former USSR, the family were deemed refuseniks – the word for the Russian Jews who were prevented from migrating to Israel and spied on.
Larisa, Alex’s wife, was forced out of a teaching job. “She was no longer ideologically approved,” Sabina says.
Just as the family thought life was improving after the collapse of the USSR, a death threat prompted them to leave Lviv.
“Dad applied to migrate to Australia the next week. He was so proud to be able to bring us here,” Sabina recalls.
His family – his wife, two children and 11 grandchildren – want Alex to be remembered as more than the oldest person to die. He died a hero, trying to save Larisa, his wife of 57 years.
Alex was an engineer known for ingenious solutions, a daredevil, a near-daily swimmer, a champion table tennis player, a ballroom dancer, a teller of bad dad jokes and an author. He loved to travel, and the family’s favourite place was Katoomba in the Blue Mountains. After he was killed, Sabina and Larisa returned there for three days.
As a small child, Sabina remembers asking her father the questions she is asking herself now: “Why am I here? What does life mean?”
Her father would answer seriously. Nearly 50 years later, she doesn’t remember his answers.
Later, she asked: “Dad, are we Jewish?”
This answer she remembers. “He told me to be proud of being a Jew. It has stuck with me for the rest of my life. Being Jewish at the Hanukkah family event was what killed him.”
Life in Australia brought peace and joy. In the past decade, Alex researched and wrote two books, interviewing survivors of the Holocaust and others on the impact of antisemitism. He wanted to record it and prevent it.
When antisemitism increased in Australia, Alex was distressed.
“It was like he was travelling back in time,” Sabina says. “We came here to be safe. And my mum saw my dad bleed to death at Bondi Beach.”
Tania Tretiak
Tania and Pavel Tretiak moved to Bondi Beach the day they migrated from Tashkent, Uzbekistan, with their two children, Dennis and Julia, in 1992. The couple bought a home in Randwick six years later, but returned most weeks to stroll by the sea.
“They loved Bondi Beach. Isn’t it [ironic], my mum started her life here in Bondi, and her life ended at Bondi Beach,” Dennis Tretiak says of his mother’s death.
Tania, 68, was born in Chechnya, Russia, and moved to Tashkent as a child. She trained as a nurse and met her husband of nearly 50 years, Pavel, a tram driver, on her way to work. They were in their mid-30s when the family moved to Sydney.
“They were very brave to leave everything – their friends, everything they built,” Dennis says.
“It’s a big change, they had to start from scratch – new jobs, new friends, new culture. But they did very well here. They never regretted one day that they had left. They knew what they were going for. They wanted to build a better life, and they knew it would be a better future for us.”
Dennis says his parents were devoted to each other. The couple was together at the fateful Hanukkah event with their granddaughter, Amelia, 4.
“She really loved my dad. They were always together. I don’t remember one day when they were apart. My sister says they were joined by the hip. She adored him.”
Pavel, 70, sustained head injuries and remains in hospital. “She would not be able to live through what he’s going through now, she wouldn’t be able to take it,” Dennis says.
Pavel was Jewish; Tania was not. But she embraced Jewish traditions and celebrations. The couple had enjoyed taking their grandchildren to the Chanukah by the Sea event each year.
“It wasn’t the religion so much, it was more about family and the community. It was all the people they knew who came here at the same time in the ’90s. Mum really enjoyed it all.”
Dennis said his mother had filmed a video, which they found on her phone, of her granddaughter getting her face painted during the festivities that afternoon.
“Mum asked if it was a princess, and Amelia said: ‘Baba … this is a unicorn’. She was so serious about it,” he smiles at his young niece’s comment to her grandmother.
“It must have been just a few minutes before the shooting started.”
Tania and Pavel worked full-time providing community transport for people who were elderly or had a disability. Dennis says his mother loved entertaining and “cooking up a storm”, particularly traditional Uzbek cuisine such as plov (pilaf). She adored Dennis and his wife Tammy’s children, Gabriel, 16, and Liana, 9, and Julia’s daughter Amelia.
Tammy says her mother-in-law was always busy and loved going to events. The couple travelled to Korea last year and went on cruises; they often visited Tashkent. “They were very active and healthy people. They were travelling a lot and enjoying life, and their grandkids.”
Edith Brutman
Edith Brutman was a principled, gracious, caring and passionate woman devoted to her family, community and tackling discrimination, say those who knew and loved her.
Her family was adamant their “beloved Edith” should be remembered as “a woman of integrity who chose humanity, every day”.
“She met prejudice with principle, and division with service,” they said in a statement.
“Our family mourns her deeply, but we ask that her life, not the senseless violence that took it, be what endures. We hope her memory calls us as a nation back to decency, courage, and peace.”
Edith was a member of the NSW branch of B’nai B’rith, an international Jewish organisation that aims to combat antisemitism and discrimination, and provides humanitarian aid.
She was “a gracious woman and a devoted member” of the NSW chapter, the group said after the shooting. B’nai B’rith International said in a tribute:
“Edith was a cherished leader in the community and a devoted member of B’nai B’rith NSW, where she led the organisation’s anti-prejudice and anti-discrimination committee – work that now carries an even more painful and profound significance.”
Ernie Friedlander, the president of the organisation’s Alfred Dreyfus Unit, worked closely with Edith and described her as a “good, caring human being”.
“She was a very clever lady, and she was very, very passionate about dealing with prejudice and discrimination. She was always there, and she had very strong opinions.”
Rabbi Yehoram Ulman knew Edith for nearly two decades. It was “truly difficult for me to imagine she isn’t here”, he said at her funeral at All Souls Chapel at Rookwood Cemetery on December 19.
“Edith wasn’t just a part of our lives, she was a very, very vocal part of our lives. But her love, her loyalty, her devotion, was really unique in every way.
“Edith was a person who did everything in a very full way. She wanted to be charitable in every way.”
Dan Elkayam
French national Dan Elkayam, 27, played his beloved football in much the same way he approached his life off the field: with lightning speed, an insatiable sense of adventure, and a ready smile.
His partner, Krystal Troyano, whom Dan met at a Sydney hostel soon after arriving in Australia in 2022, said his outlook made her feel the pair’s time together would never run out.
“You made me think we were infinite. Death? Not a word for us. We only knew how it [was] to be alive, and very, very fully alive,” Troyano said at his funeral at Ashdod Cemetery in Israel on December 25.
“With you, [no] day was like the other. I dare to say that we were immortals, and that we are forever … Even living so much, your bucket list only grew and grew and grew.
“You were thirsty for living, and you were running for life like you were hungry for it. You lived intensely, but in fast and slow motion at the same time. I love you so much. More than I can say. Thank you for the adventure. Now, go live your next one.”
Dan was an IT engineer at NBC Universal, a travel enthusiast, and a passionate footballer who played for Rockdale Ilinden FC’s Premier League side. His family said he had played at the 2022 Maccabiah Games and for various teams in France and Australia, including Waverley. He was in the process of signing with Dolls Point before he died.
He was born and raised in Le Bourget in Paris, where his parents, brothers, nieces and nephews still reside. In a statement after his death, his family said Dan “loved life – fully and intensely”.
“He travelled the world and was known for his gentle, kind, fun and loving nature, making friends wherever he went. Alongside football, he had a deep connection with nature. He was a certified scuba diver and an explorer at heart, always eager to discover new places, cultures and experiences.
“Dan brought light wherever he went and inspired countless people through the way he lived. His smile could light up any room. He was pure joy – a beautiful and humble soul.
“To say that Dan will be missed is not enough. He was a person who truly wanted to do good in the world, to share his love of life and his sense of adventure with everyone around him.”
His close friend, Jesse Singer, recalled how Dan spent his final hours doing what he loved: playing football in the sun by Bondi Beach with his friends, and celebrating his Jewish faith. “People meeting [Dan] for the first time would say he’s shy but happy, always smiling,” Jesse says.
“When all this happened, my wife and I spoke, and we just said we have to live life to the fullest. That’s what we have to do because that’s what Dan did.”
Boris and Sofia Gurman
The public knows Boris, 69, and Sofia, 61, as two of the bravest heroes at Bondi Beach, having confronted one of the attackers, only to be killed for their courage.
To Alex Gurman, they are the parents he would choose a million times over.
“Every good characteristic that I embody now I owe entirely to them,” he says.
“I would choose the same upbringing, the same parents, the same value set. Nothing would change because, candidly, I think I’d hit the jackpot.”
Boris was roughly his son’s age when he fled Ukraine with Sofia and Alex.
“They kind of took the ultimate risk moving to a foreign country, no money, no language, with a child and no idea how they were going to make it work, but their values and principles guaranteed success,” he says in his parents’ commemoration video.
“Their view of what having a fulfilling life would look like is to just have a positive impact on those around you.”
Family was the core of everything they did. They had planned to celebrate Sofia’s birthday the day after the terror attack. The couple would have celebrated their 35th wedding anniversary in January.
Alex describes his mother as the “go-to person” who always seemed to have the most sensible answer to a problem, even if it took you weeks or months to realise she had been right all along.
“From a young age, Sofia was always the one a little further ahead,” Alex shared in a statement read at his parents’ funeral by Rabbi Yehoram Ulman at the Chevra Kadisha in Woollahra. “The first up the tree, the one you trusted with responsibility, the one others instinctively followed. That instinct followed her through life.”
Sofia would cook recipes from myriad cuisines, from Africa to Asia, but every year, her family looked forward to savouring her traditional Soviet wafer cake.
Boris, a retired mechanic, was a calming presence within the family. He was “very organised, tremendously handy” and loved his garden of lemons, chillies and a banana tree.
“In his younger years, he was something of a troublemaker,” Alex’s statement says. “But over time, that energy matured into a deep sense of responsibility and care for the world around him.
“He loved a chat, and it didn’t matter how well he knew you or [how] fluent the shared language was, Boris always found a way to connect. His English was sometimes broken, but his meaning never was.”
Alex says that even in their final moments, the couple showed the depth of who they were.
Peter Meagher
It is hard to find someone who doesn’t wish they had known “Marzo” once they hear about him.
A former police officer and Randwick Rugby coach, Peter Meagher was fulfilling his dream working as a photographer at Bondi on December 14.
His death was violent and horrific, yet Peter was “none of those things”, says his widow, Virginia Wynne-Markham. “He was an honourable man, thoughtful, generous with his time and energy, and he was a considered human being. That is how he should be remembered. He was compassionate, day in and day out.”
In 34 years with the NSW Police, Peter rose to become a much-decorated detective sergeant, yet he never drew his gun. He would have preferred to police without one. “He didn’t like it,” Virginia says.
The last image she has of Peter is a screengrab of a video of the terror attack showing her late husband – wearing his hat backwards – trying to save someone.
“Peter was right there. I found a video that shows Peter face down, trying to help someone, pretty much in full view of those bins and that bridge. In the next photo, he is on his haunches, moving a fellow into a recovery position.
“There’s red on the white shirt that Peter has his hand on.
“In the next shot, Peter is down.
“And in the video, I can see his leg move. Then he is still.”
A woman called her on Christmas Day to say she had seen Peter being shot. That made her stay down and protect her four-year-old daughter. “I believe your husband saved my life,” she said.
Virginia says, “With his last breath, he was being selfless. He was an unassuming sort of chap, but he was a good egg.”
To encourage players at Randwick Rugby to aim high, Peter stuck photos of those who had worn the club’s myrtle green and later played for the Wallabies to the lockers.
“On Monday, Tuesday, [and] Thursday nights, he’d go to rugby training,” Virginia says. “He’d be there before anybody else to help set up the cones and make sure everything was where it should be. The water bottles were filled. He’d been doing it for so long that it was kind of effortless for him.”
Had Peter survived, he would have turned 62 on January 18. On that day, Virginia fell apart and sobbed. Her body broke from sadness.
Together since 2009, it was the first significant relationship for both. They met on the matchmaking site eHarmony in 2009, and after months of emails and talking, their first date was the Waratahs v the Hurricanes on May 14, 2010, Virginia says, recalling the exact date.
“We were going to be on the life journey together as companions, as best friends, as lovers of the same things.”
Their chocolate Labrador, Vada, brought him joy every day. And when Virginia walks Vada, the loss of Peter hits her, and she has a good cry. “Other times, I think I should have told him more that I loved him, hugged him more. So I hug her instead.”

There is a foolproof way to get rid of hiccups. It’s not pretty

There is a foolproof way to get rid of hiccups. It’s not pretty
Each week, Good Weekend’s how-to column shares expert advice on how to navigate some of modern life’s big – and small – challenges. This week: How to cure hiccups.
“There is an effective cure, but it’s not pretty,” warns Dr Sarah Holper, neurologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital and author of What’s Wrong with You? An Insider’s Guide to Your Insides.
Hiccups are a disruption in the rhythmic tightening and relaxing of the diaphragm during normal breathing. “The diaphragm is like a layer of ham – a meaty parachute – between the intestines and gut,” explains Holper. “When you breathe in, it flattens downwards, creating a vacuum that pulls air into your lungs. When you exhale, it relaxes upwards, the lungs shrink, and air is expelled.”
A hiccup happens when the diaphragm suddenly flattens at the wrong time in the breathing cycle, yanking air into the lungs. This “really startles” your vocal cords, which respond by “snapping shut, exactly 35 milliseconds after that sudden intake of air. That’s what creates the ‘hic’ sound.”
This diaphragm spasm is caused by an irritation of the vagus nerve. Vagus is Latin for “wandering”, and the vagus nerve wanders all over the body, from the brainstem to eye muscles, eardrums, vocal cords, heart, lungs, diaphragm, stomach walls and intestines, all the way to the rectum. An irritation at any point – even a single hair tickling an eardrum – can cause hiccups.
Related Article
Curing hiccups involves – bizarrely – more stimulation. Says Holper, “Like if a kid’s having a tantrum, you stop it by distracting them: if you flood the vagus nerve with other messages, it resets itself.” Press your eyeballs; induce a gag reflex; rub your earlobes. Or try the Valsalva manoeuvre – close your nose and mouth and forcefully “exhale”, as if blowing up a tight balloon or having a bowel movement.
Admittedly, it’s all a bit of an inexact science. But there is another way: a case study in the medical literature entitled Termination of intractable hiccups with digital rectal massage. “The author put on gloves – he really emphasised that – and performed a circumferential rectal massage with his finger. And it cured the hiccups.”
This result has been replicated and, apparently, there’s “plenty of anecdotal evidence” that it works. “Basically, the vagus nerve forgets about the hiccups,” concludes Holper. “It forgets about the diaphragm. It just thinks, ‘What is going on?!’ And then it resets very effectively.”
Both Holper and the literature suggest this procedure is best undertaken by medical professionals. For the rest of us, try the eyeballs, the earlobes or the old standby: a glass of cold water.

How digital data is giving airlines the power to sell you the fares they want

How digital data is giving airlines the power to sell you the fares they want
There is a behind-the-scenes tug of war going on between airlines and customers over the vast amounts of data people generate when they search for and purchase tickets.
And whoever best exploits this information in coming years will gain an advantage – even as artificial intelligence begins to rewrite the rules of the game again.
To understand this shift, you have to understand how flight booking systems have mirrored the internet’s growth.
Thirty years ago, during the dotcom era, the emergence of online ticket sales gave an edge to low-cost carriers like JetBlue in the US and Virgin Blue (today’s Virgin Australia). Passengers, empowered to book their own fares and compare prices, disrupted the old business models of travel agents and the airlines themselves.
“Online booking moved the work to the customer,” said UNSW senior aviation lecturer Ian Douglas. Since those bookings required immediate payment, the “practice of the airline holding the reservation pending later ticketing pretty much vanished.”
Today, online habits have spread from desktop computers to phones and social media. The troves of personal and consumer data online are a rich source of marketing information that airlines can layer with insights from loyalty programs to build nuanced profiles of customers.
During the late 1990s, companies like Expedia, Travelocity, and Booking.com (all founded in 1996) allowed savvy and patient consumers to find and book their own tickets, cutting out travel agents. Passengers were incentivised to show up for the flights they purchased and the risk of empty seats for airlines “significantly reduced”, Douglas said.
The boom in low-cost carriers, with passengers in their seats, helped drive up industry average load factors — the number of passenger miles on global flights as a share of available seat miles. They jumped from about 68 per cent in 1998 to about 83 per cent in 2020.
Then, in 1998, Webjet joined the fray, selling cheaper fares directly to consumers, allowing passengers to bypass expensive ticket-selling processes based on the global distribution system (GDS) that underpinned the Amadeus, Sabre and Travelport booking systems that agents relied on.
“[Business] must make the system work for everyone but at the individual level, the lone, savvy consumer only needs to score a win for themselves.”Travel futurist Carolyn Childs
At the time, GDS had “green screen” interfaces (which weren’t always green) with complex text-based codes that were incomprehensible to the average person. “Fare buckets” existed with codes like F or A for full-fare first class. Discounted economy tickets were coded K, L, or Q.
Airlines in the US were among the first to create apps for the iPhone, and they soon established direct business-to-consumer relationships through their own company apps and websites. The website-based online distribution model “really fostered low-cost airlines”, Douglas said. JetBlue in the US launched in 1998 and grew rapidly by offering point-to-point, no-frills flights.
Eventually, consumer behaviour changed for all airlines, including larger, legacy carriers such as Qantas, American, Delta and United. As consumers and the aviation industry embraced the internet more deeply, a tug of war played out in the background: consumers, and then the industry, variously benefited from successive waves of tech innovation.
Eventually, larger legacy carriers used their real-world scale to fight back and gain an advantage. Qantas, for example, started flights on low-cost carrier Jetstar in 2004.
At the dawn of air travel, tickets included things like luggage, meals and seat selection. With online booking, airlines started charging separately for meals, luggage and different seat choices. Customers accepted the change and embraced the control over – and savings on – their purchases.
Since then, the information revolution has, if anything, only intensified for aviation. And the industry must now face the impact of AI.
Former Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce alluded to the challenge in a speech in August: “If airlines don’t own the customer interface in the age of AI, someone else will, and we’ll become just the plumbing behind the platform.”
The launch of Google Flights in 2011 brought the power of the internet closer to ticketing by providing aggregate price comparisons, alongside Skyscanner (dating from 2002) and Kayak (created in 2004).
The next year, the International Air Transport Association introduced the new distribution capability (NDC), a travel data transmission standard designed to supersede the long-standing GDS, which could not handle the amount of personalised detail becoming commonplace on orders.
GDS also held back airlines from bundling together detailed offers — the kind that online travel agencies specialised in.
While the emerging NDC allows airlines to communicate more effectively with travel agents, it has, to the degree it’s been implemented, benefited larger airlines. Corporate Traveller said that more than 95 per cent of its corporate travel customers today use NDC. The uptake elsewhere is less clear.
Travel futurist Carolyn Childs said the significance of NDC in a time of technological disruption was not clear. “I wonder if NDC is going to get overtaken by AI but creates a common language and architecture to let other things operate.”
Accelya, an aviation retail software provider, in January said almost 50 per cent of airline NDC programs failed because they weren’t scaled up or given a dedicated team, among other reasons.
NDC promised airlines greater control over inventory and pricing strategies. NDC shifted the balance of power away from intermediary travel agencies and websites and gave it back to the major airlines. Airlines were no longer blindly issuing tickets to be sold on online travel agents’ websites. They were controlling more of the selling.
Major airlines adopting NDC could then change prices instantly based on current demand, bypassing the limitations of the old fixed-price model.
NDC aimed to transform the way airline products are sold, making the process more like modern online retail.
The current era is defined by AI, which enables automated pricing shifts without human oversight. This has given rise to the concept of offer-order.
In this model, a unique offer (flight, specific class bookings, et cetera) is made to an individual customer, which becomes an order when the customer selects it.
Childs describes offer-order as the “point where consumer need and market’s need really combine”.
Will this prompt worries from travellers about privacy-crushing “surveillance marketing”? Experts like Australian Travel Industry Association chief executive Dean Long are sceptical that the technology will lead to “surveillance” targeting of passengers.
While airlines could identify customer “personas” – such as a “young adventurer” or a “parent travelling during school holidays” – they still struggled to achieve a truly individual marketing experience, he said.
As technology continues to evolve, questions remain on who will benefit most between airlines and passengers.
“There will continue to be this tug of war between the consumer and the airline that won’t go away.” But as we get into the era of AI and large language models, business has the advantage, Childs says.
At the same time, the airlines’ advantage is ripe for disruption by AI. “[Business] must make the system work for everyone but at the individual level, the lone, savvy consumer only needs to score a win for themselves,” he says. And so, the tug of war continues.

The Melbourne suburbs with the best chance of auction success

The Melbourne suburbs with the best chance of auction success
Leonie Bawden has lived in Dingley Village in Melbourne’s south-east since 1989, and describes her neighbourhood as “just a nice vibe”.
“I feel safe, it’s quiet, I’ve never had any trouble with neighbours or anything like that. And where my home is, it’s just a short walk to the shopping centre, and there are three schools around all within walking distance,” the 73-year-old retiree said.
Her home of 23 years is her third property in the suburb since 1989, and when she takes it to auction on Saturday, she will have reason to be hopeful.
Dingley Village is one of Melbourne’s most successful suburbs for auctions, recording a clearance rate of 89.7 per cent during 2025.
A string of Melbourne suburbs recorded ultra-high clearance rates last year, topped by Yallambie in the north-east with a 95 per cent clearance rate and just 20 auctions reported between January and November, on Domain data.
Clearance rates of 90 per cent-plus were achieved in Chelsea Heights, Jacana, Gladstone Park and Notting Hill. Melbourne’s overall clearance rate hovered in the high 60 to low 70 per cent range over the same period.
Bawden used to work in real estate and has been watching the local market. She thinks prices are on the mark, and not overinflated.
“I think auctions work better in this area, better than private sales,” said the Richmond Football Club Former Players and Officials Association secretary and treasurer. “It’s a bit of a sought-after area and there’s quite a bit of interest in every home that goes up for sale in the area.
“There has not been many times when things have been passed in around here.”
Domain’s chief of research and economics Dr Nicola Powell said most of the suburbs with high clearance rates were established, family-oriented areas in the middle to outer north-west corridor, offering an accessible price point.
“These areas would be popular with first home buyers, upgraders from neighbouring suburbs or families trying to get into a detached house,” she said. “When you’ve got a high clearance rate, it is telling us that there is high levels of demand relative to a tight supply that is there.”
While there are not enough home sales in Yallambie for Domain to calculate a median price (it is also one of the most tightly held suburbs in Melbourne) Powell said Chelsea Heights was a good example of the kinds of suburbs with high auction success rates.
“The median at Chelsea Heights is $980,000 – this is kind of a prime [price point], particularly in Melbourne,” she said.
“When you think about some of these suburbs, like Chelsea Heights, Caulfield East, Gladstone Park, Aspendale Gardens etc, they are all lifestyle-orientated, school zone-driven areas with infrastructure and connectivity.”
Ray White chief economist Nerida Conisbee said the mid-range pricing of the suburbs was consistent with what she was seeing in Melbourne more broadly.
“The top end of Melbourne is still fairly flat, not really seeing much price growth there,” she said. “Where we are seeing price growth is more at the cheaper end.”
Conisbee added that while Yallambie was a difficult suburb to characterise – “it does have a mix of homes, some beautiful big properties but some diversity in pricing” – it broadly fit in with the other suburbs, which have homes that fit into the 5% Deposit Scheme cap.
“This may also be a factor driving higher clearance rates,” she said.
Bawden’s selling agent, Nathan Arrowsmith of Buxton Real Estate Dingley Village, said the area’s schools were a drawcard, as well as its easy transport links to Brighton and the Mornington Peninsula.
“It is just a great community and a big attraction for first home buyers and also families, which is a big chunk of the market,” he said.
He said some potential buyers arrive in the area for its value for money after realising the nearby Cheltenham market is “quite heated”.
“They see value by rolling into the neighbouring suburb which is Dingley Village,” he said.
In Yallambie, there are also interested buyers who have expanded their search from better-known nearby suburbs such as Viewbank, Jellis Craig North East’s Daniel Cobern said.
“Obviously I think it is a great suburb. It has strong clearance rates for good reasons. It is pretty tightly kept,” he said.
“You do get a bit of overflow from larger suburbs around the area … that trickles into Yallambie.”
He thought the neighbourhood had become better known over the past few years, as it will benefit from the North East Link tunnels under construction.
“A lot of buyers would not have even known where it was even if they were looking in Greensborough and Montmorency,” he said.
“It is a great area now but it is going to be even better in a few years to come.”

Thinking of selling in Sydney this year? Why your postcode could make all the difference
By Robyn Willis
For Danielle Dalvi, buying a house in Marrickville is a dream come true.
“We used to come to Marrickville to do op shopping and visit the Vietnamese restaurants but I thought it was a bit out of reach,” Dalvi said. “We had been looking for six months. I was getting a bit overwhelmed.”
She and her partner, Khalil, were keen to move on from the one-bedroom apartment in Eveleigh they shared with their baby. And their eyes were firmly fixed on the popular inner west suburb.
In January 2025, the couple secured an unrenovated, single storey three-bedroom cottage in the heart of Marrickville.
“This is our forever home,” Dalvi said. “I really like being close to the main shopping strip – there’s a dentist, doctor’s and places to eat but Marrickville Library is unbelievable. We have a two-year-old so it’s a great place to spend time. The community here has been wonderful.”
Marrickville recorded one of the highest auction clearance rates for suburbs in Sydney in 2025, comparable to properties sold, with 298 reported auctions resulting in a 81.9 per cent success rate, according to data from Domain.
Some suburbs of Sydney experienced an even higher clearance rate, as much as 100 per cent in Airds where just 20 properties were auctioned in 2025. In North Strathfield, the clearance rate was 93.9 per cent based on 33 reported auctions.
Nicola Powell, chief of research and economics for Domain, said three cuts to the cash rate in 2025 were reflected in greater buyer confidence with stronger bidding and more activity at auctions.
“As the cash rate reduced we saw the positive influence on the market and buyers,” Powell said.
While the year ended quietly, with a Sydney clearance rate of 56.6 per cent in December, Powell said it bounced back to 77 per cent last month.
“We tend to find clearance rates bounce earlier in the year which is reflective of lower volumes of stock,” she said. “We are likely to see clearance rates soften this year but I am expecting them then to firm. So I would not expect to see them in the 50s but they could be finding the floor in the low 60s.”
She said the reasons some areas had higher clearance rates than others were not universal.
“[For suburbs] like Airds and Bangor [it] would be about affordability, appealing to first home buyers and upgraded families looking for larger land sizes versus inner city unit alternatives,” she said. “Sales volumes aren’t huge in many cases, so a strong run of successful auctions can lift the clearance rate quickly.”
Buyer’s agent Penny Vandenhurk, who helped the Dalvis buy their home last year, said the high clearance rate reflected the popularity of the area, which has been further boosted by promised infrastructure, with construction of Marrickville metro station under way.
She said the style of housing in Marrickville also meant sellers tended to be well informed about the market.
“There are a lot of comparable sales and a lot of scrutiny about under quoting,” Vandenhurk said. “There are not as many unique properties [in Marrickville] so if your neighbour sold an unrenovated house for $2.5 million and you’ve renovated, you might reasonably expect $2.7 million.”
Nearby Newtown reported even higher auction clearance rates in 2025, with 82.6 per cent of properties going to auction resulting in a sale. That outcome is based on 235 reported auctions.
Property partner at The Agency Inner West, David Barndon, recently sold a property in Newtown just two weeks after it hit the market. While buyer demand was consistent, he said it was important to set a realistic price.
“It’s about supply and demand pressures. You see property sitting there if you don’t price them right.”
Buyer’s agent Bianca Field said the promise of a Metro station for Marrickville meant buyers who might have opted for Newtown are looking further west.
“Marrickville is becoming an extension of Newtown,” Field said. “Interest in Newtown is fairly consistent due to things like lifestyle, connectivity to the city is exceptional and a lot of people are employed around the university and the hospital so you can get good investor return.”
At the other end of the scale, Greenhills Beach near Cronulla experienced a 25 per cent clearance rate in 2025, one of the lowest recorded in Sydney.
Sales agent at Pulse Property Agents, Luke Lombardi, said while Greenhills Beach was a “niche” market, much of The Shire was experiencing limited interest in properties more than $2.5 million.
“We’re not worried by that auction clearance rate,” he said. “It’s an awesome area to live and reside in. You cannot develop much in the area so you have that peace and quiet. You can wake up in the morning and smell the salt from Elouera Beach.”

The science of sunlight: Why the new Footscray Hospital is built differently
For 104 days, as he fought for his life in an intensive care unit, Rama El Souki didn’t know if it was night or day.
“It was a pretty dark place,” the father of four said of his lengthy stay at the old Footscray Hospital.
“I kept on asking, ‘What day is it? What is the time?’ I asked my wife to buy me a little digital clock that I put next to my bed.”
El Souki spent a total of six months in the dimly lit hospital in Melbourne’s west in 2024 after suffering a life-threatening bout of pancreatitis, a rare side effect of a popular weight-loss drug he was using. The 53-year-old lost most of his pancreas, his lung collapsed and he experienced kidney failure.
Next Wednesday, that “dark place” will be replaced by the new Footscray Hospital, a $1.5 billion health service on the corner of Ballarat and Geelong roads that harnesses natural light to help patients heal faster.
The design is backed by extensive research showing natural light helps patients establish a healthy circadian rhythm, leading to better sleep and a faster recovery time.
The Age this week toured the intensive care unit, which has sweeping views of the city and western suburbs. Unlike a traditional ICU set-up where the foot of the bed faces inwards, the ward’s 11 beds have been turned 90 degrees so that patients can see outside.
Professor Craig French, the intensive care unit director at Western Health, jokes that one of the rooms will be reserved for keen Bulldogs fans.
“It has a view directly over Whitten Oval,” said French, who treated El Souki during his hospitalisation.
The new hospital will accommodate more than 500 beds, with ICU patients able to be wheeled outdoors while in the comfort of their beds. More than 55,000 plants line the hospital’s balcony and ground level gardens.
A “medical services panel” housed in a glass box extends the ICU’s reach into the outdoors. It allows patients to remain tethered to oxygen and other medical equipment while experiencing natural light and fresh air. There’s also an outdoor button they can press if they need a nurse.
“They will be able to feel the sensation of having a breeze across their face,” French said.
French said intensive care units had traditionally done a poor job of providing a quiet place where patients can sleep.
“This will change that,” he said of the new hospital, which is just over a kilometre away from the old hospital on Gordon Street.
Every bed in the intensive care unit is located in a private, sound-proofed room. At the touch of a button, the windows running along the corridor can be frosted for privacy.
International research has found that hospital patients average only five hours of sleep per night, and fail to reach the seven to nine hours recommended for healthy cognitive and immune function.
This shortfall is often driven by environmental stressors such as noise. An Australian study found that noise levels in shared rooms in hospitals sometimes reached more than 100 decibels, which is comparable to the roar of a lawnmower.
Poor access to natural light has also been identified as an issue in hospitals.
Research has found that patients with beds near a window spend less time in hospital than those near a door. And those with access to high levels of natural light experience less distress. Light has also been found to prevent viral and staph infections and decrease a patient’s heart and pulse rates.
The 12-storey hospital, which was designed by Billard Leece Partnership and COX Architecture during the height of the pandemic, also includes a pandemic pod in the ICU. This pod can be used for patients with infectious diseases and is the only ICU room in Victoria that can be transformed into a completely negatively pressured space.
“It’s an insurance policy,” French said of the design. “It means that in a pandemic we’ll be able to completely separate the critically ill, infectious patients from the non-infectious patients.”
The growing prevalence of obesity in the community has also informed the design. The corridors and doorways have been widened for patients, and there’s a bariatric room with a larger chair and bed, and hoists in the ceiling that can be used to lift patients who weigh up to 500 kilograms.
Health Minister Mary-Anne Thomas said the new Footscray Hospital was one of the largest health investments in Victoria’s history.
“[It] will support families in the west for generations to come,” she said.
Footscray MP Katie Hall has strong family ties to the old red-brick Footscray Hospital. Her great-grandmother was on the hospital’s fundraising committee in the 1950s, and many of her relatives were born and died there.
She said while the old site had done a wonderful job servicing the community, the building was no longer fit for contemporary healthcare.
“To have this new hospital in the heart of Footscray is really important,” Hall said.
El Souki is now in a much better place with his health, and also visited the new hospital this week.
He’s a fan of the new family rooms, where people can be privately briefed by doctors about the condition of their loved ones. Medical scans can be flashed up on large screens in these rooms, to help families understand what is going on.
“It is a good environment for families,” El Souki said. “There are plenty of windows, and it is very spacious.”

An alleged child rapist was arrested. Your DNA might have helped

An alleged child rapist was arrested. Your DNA might have helped
Robert Wayne Kwan’s thumbs, forced together by handcuffs, twiddled in fits as detectives marched him down the long curve of a grassy driveway towards waiting police cars in South Kempsey, north of Port Macquarie, on Wednesday.
The alleged child rapist, 77, has been charged over a raft of historical sex crimes spanning more than a decade, from the targeting of an 11-year-old girl in Sydney’s west in 1991 to the sexual assault of a 26-year-old woman at Devil’s Hole Reserve near Dubbo in 2002.
His arrest is the latest chapter in the story of a technology that has jailed fabled serial killers, set those wrongfully convicted of murder free and granted anonymous bones the dignity of personhood.
The investigative tool, called Forensic Investigative Genetic Genealogy (FIGG), relies on people who have spat in a tube for commercial DNA tests choosing to dismiss privacy concerns and make their data available to investigators.
They become “genetic informants”, helping police build sprawling family trees that lead them to alleged perpetrators such as Kwan. His was the first arrest in NSW made using the technology.
Here’s how it works. Traditional genetic profiling targets sections of human DNA where sequences of the four base letters – A, C, G and T – always repeat. Everyone, for example, has a repeating sequence of “AGAT” on their third chromosome. But the number of times that sequence repeats varies between people, acting as a kind of genetic “fingerprint”.
Standard DNA testing focuses on about 20 of these sequences – called short tandem repeats, or STRs – and the pattern of those repeats can match a suspect’s DNA to a drop of blood at a crime scene.
A problem arises, however, when investigators don’t have a reference sample of DNA. Police held DNA samples from Kwan’s alleged crimes, for example, but had nothing to match them to.
That’s where FIGG comes in. Instead of zeroing in on a handful of STRs, the test picks up a different kind of DNA variation called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced “snips”). These are single-letter differences at specific points across our DNA – where you might have an A, someone else has a G – and we can detect over a million of them using specialised sequencing technology.
The key advantage for detectives is that this DNA map of more than a million SNPs is sensitive enough to identify someone’s very distant relatives – their third or fourth cousins, for example. (Think about that – do you even know who your fourth cousins are?) Finding family can help tie anonymous DNA to an actual person.
To do that, investigators match up the DNA profile of a perpetrator or victim to distant relatives using online genealogy databases, made up of people who have used commercial ancestry tests and consented to law enforcement using their data. The databases have about 1 million to 2 million genetic profiles. That’s exponentially larger than DNA databases owned by law enforcement.
Once police find a relative, they turn to investigative genealogy – part genetic analysis, part family history sleuthing – to build a family tree linking the owner of the DNA and their distant relatives in the database.
Experts trawl back through the generations to find the last direct ancestors shared by the person of interest and their identified relatives, narrowing the search to a specific branch of the family tree. The process might take days or, in some cases, years. It’s how detectives can now find the owner of an unknown bone or semen sample.
This is how FIGG caught Kwan. An SNP profile was made using DNA gathered after his alleged crimes more than two decades ago. That profile matched a relative in the genealogy databases. Then police used what they knew about Kwan’s sex, age and location to prune the branches of the family tree until he was the only person left as a suspect.
This process famously busted the Golden State Killer, unveiling the serial murderer in 2018 as former California police officer Joseph James DeAngelo Jr. As put by human identification specialist Dr Jodie Ward, FIGG turns decades-old cases from cold to solvable.
FIGG has solved cold cases and tragic mysteries across Australia too.
Take the example of the “woman in the wall”. Her decade-old remains were discovered in 2022 by cleaners behind a wall in a Brisbane unit complex. She left a glass eye, prescription glasses, and size 10 clothes. But there was no DNA match in the police database and no linked missing persons report.
Using FIGG, police and forensic experts, including Ward, identified the remains as those of 38-year-old woman Tanya Glover. A woman was arrested over Glover’s death last year.
“What price can you put on restoring someone’s identity?” Ward, a DNA forensics expert, said. “You are providing answers to families, you are providing the deceased with a dignified burial, you are keeping the community safe because criminal investigations can ensue.
“At the moment, DNA testing is only offered by law enforcement or government forensic labs in Australia and not everyone can access those technologies, unfortunately.”
The process is expensive – about $10,000 compared to routine DNA testing which might cost $100, she said. That’s why, in 2024, Ward founded the Forensic Human Identification Co., a social enterprise which provides the only independent end-to-end FIGG service in Australia.
Through the enterprise, Ward aims to help families find missing loved ones, exonerate those wrongfully convicted of crimes, advance cases of disappeared First Nations people, and use techniques borrowed from the study of ancient DNA to identify forgotten and degraded remains.
“Our goal is to make sure that it’s not just agencies with deep pockets that can access this technology, because we want to see every unknown deceased person given the opportunity to be identified,” she said.
Following Kwan’s arrest, police have called for people to consider uploading their DNA profiles to databases investigators can use for FIGG, including GEDmatch PRO and FamilyTreeDNA.
People can choose to upload their genetic information to those databases after using a commercial service like 23andMe or AncestryDNA, which police cannot generally access. About 5-10 per cent of the profiles on the databases are believed to be Australian.
There were privacy issues when FIGG first came to prominence. Some genealogy services automatically opted users in to have their data used by police. A lack of transparency meant some of the “genetic informants” used to catch the Golden State Killer did so unwittingly – they uploaded data to track down relatives and ended up identifying a murderer. Since then, most databases have switched to a more transparent opt-in system, although in Germany, FIGG remains largely banned due to privacy concerns.
Any DNA data uploaded to GEDmatch PRO is opted in to identify human remains, but users must opt in manually for their data to be used to find the perpetrators of violent crimes.
“FIGG is only used for homicides, sexual assaults or unidentified human remains,” Detective Superintendent Jayne Doherty, Sex Crimes Squad Commander at NSW Police, said after Kwan’s arrest.
“People thinking about opting in – you could be helping us to solve those serious problems.”

Trump brings Epstein island-tarred Cabinet member Lutnick with him on visit to troops
President rewards Commerce Secretary for giving conflicting accounts of his Epstein ties with coveted seat on Air Force One
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Donald Trump on Friday offered a strong show of support for embattled Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick by bringing him along on a visit to special forces troops at Fort Bragg en route to his Palm Beach, Florida home.
The whisk-away on Air Force One comes despite calls for Lutnick to resign over his ties to and misleading comments about his relationship with dead sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Trump declined to answer a reporter’s question as he departed the White House on whether he would ask Lutnick to step down or outright fire him after the Cabinet secretary confirmed having made a 2012 visit to Epstein’s infamous private island — seven years after he claimed to have cut ties to the notorious underage sex trafficker.
But a list of the people traveling with Trump to North Carolina and then Florida this weekend shows Lutnick as one of the president’s guests, along with North Carolina Sen. Ted Budd, Reps. Richard Hudson, Brad Knott and David Rouzer, plus first lady Melania Trump and a range of White House staff.
Lutnick has been under sustained fire since Tuesday, when he admitted to the Senate Commerce Committee that he’d made the trip to Epstein’s home on Little Saint James (part of the U.S. Virgin Islands) for lunch with his wife and children 14 years ago.
Documents released by the Department of Justice had revealed how Lutnick had been in contact with Epstein, his onetime nextdoor neighbor in New York, via email to arrange the visit.
The emails contradicted statements Lutnick had made to the New York Post during a podcast appearance in October when he said he’d cut off contact with Epstein — who died in a New York jail cell while awaiting sex trafficking charges in 2019 — after a 2005 encounter that he claimed had left him so unsettled that he’d vowed to “never be in the room with that disgusting person ever again.”
The commerce secretary has long been known to have had ties to Epstein, who was his next-door neighbor in New York at one point, years before he pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida as part of a sweetheart deal with a George W Bush-era prosecutor who later became Trump’s first Secretary of Labor during his first term.
But the documents reviewed by The Independent show that Lutnick not only planned to visit Epstein’s island in 2012 but maintained ties with Epstein as late as 2018 — the year before he was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges and long after he’d spent time in jail for state-level offenses related to his preying on young girls.
Trump’s decision to host Lutnick on board the presidential aircraft — a highly sought-after perk for cabinet members — comes a day after he claimed not to have known about Lutnick’s trip to the pedophile financier’s private getaway but moments later told a reporter he had heard about details of the trip.
Speaking from the Roosevelt Room during an event to announce the repeal of a longstanding climate rule reviled by the fossil fuel industry, Trump was asked if he’d been aware of Lutnick’s travel to Little Saint James and whether he still has confidence in the former bond trading executive.
“No, I wasn’t aware of it ... I actually haven't spoken to him about it ... but from what I hear, he was there with his wife and children,” Trump said, just days after Lutnick was forced to admit he had traveled to the notorious locale.
He added: “I was never there — somebody will someday say that I was never there.”
Trump notably did not answer the second part of the question as to whether he has confidence in Lutnick, a longtime friend who had pushed to become Treasury Secretary after serving as the finance chief for the president’s 2024 campaign.
But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that Trump “fully supports” Lutnick and described him as “a very important member of President Trump's team.”

Mandelson asked to testify to US Congress over Epstein links
Former Labour cabinet minister was sacked as US ambassador last year because of his ties to Epstein
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Peter Mandelson has been asked to testify to the US Congress over his relationship with the disgraced paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein.
In a letter, US politicians told the ex-Labour grandee they thought he had “critical information” that would assist their investigation into Epstein.
Two members of the House of Representatives, Suhas Subramanyam and Robert Garcia, have written to Mandelson asking him to answer questions from the House’s oversight committee.
They wrote: “While you no longer serve as British ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein’s operations.
“Given the appalling allegations regarding Epstein’s conduct, we request that you make yourself available for a transcribed interview with committee staff regarding the crimes of Jeffrey Epstein and his co-conspirators.”
Mandelson has been given until the end of the month to respond.
He has previously said he was “wrong to believe Epstein following his conviction and to continue my association with him afterwards. I apologise unequivocally for doing so to the women and girls who suffered.”
Last week, Sir Keir Starmer said he was sorry for believing Mandelson’s “lies” and for appointing him to the role of Britain’s ambassador to the US.
Following a barrage of criticism from his own MPs, the prime minister also issued a frank apology to the victims of Epstein.
He also admitted that he knew Mandelson had had contact with Epstein before giving him the job, but said: “None of us knew the depths and the darkness of that relationship.”
Mandelson is also being investigated by the Metropolitan Police after the government handed over a dossier of extraordinary emails that suggested the former Labour peer had leaked sensitive government information to Epstein.
Officials are also thought to be reviewing 25 years of records to find evidence linking Mandelson to Epstein. Civil servants are examining correspondence that dates back to his time as Northern Ireland secretary under Tony Blair between 1999 and 2002, as well as when he was business secretary under Gordon Brown nearly a decade later.
Mandelson was sacked in September when details about his relationship with Epstein emerged.
But the most recent release of documents, which indicate that he shared market-sensitive information with the financier in 2009 during the global financial crash sent shockwaves through Westminster.
The files also suggest that a year later, he tipped Epstein off about an imminent €500bn deal to prop up the European single currency. Payments reportedly totalling $75,000 from Epstein to accounts linked to Mandelson or his partner, Reinaldo Avia da Silva, are also revealed.
Since the scandal erupted, the prime minister has lost his chief of staff, his top civil servant and his director of communications. On Monday, Sir Keir himself also faced calls to resign from the leader of Scottish Labour, as the party tries to move on from the crisis.
A representative for Mandelson has been approached for comment.

Poroshenko urges deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine only way to stop war
Ukrainian MP and leader of the European Solidarity party Petro Poroshenko believes the deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine is the only way to end the Russian-Ukrainian war, the party said on the website on Friday.
"The only way to stop the war is 'boots on the ground' on Ukrainian territory. It is cheaper and more reliable to have NATO troops on Ukrainian soil than NATO troops in Poland," Poroshenko told reporters on the sidelines of Munich Security Conference, which is taking place on February 13-15 and in which he is participating.
He also stressed the importance of preserving transatlantic unity. "If we are divided, we will lose. "We' are NATO, Ukraine, the USA. And then Putin will win. But when we are united, Putin simply has no chance... We have no other way out but to reach an agreement, to stick together is our goal," the politician said.
Poroshenko also stressed that the future of not only Ukraine, but also Europe and global security in general is being decided now. He also warned the West against Vladimir Putin's illusion of appeasement. "This is impossible. I know this for sure, because I have five years of experience in negotiations with Putin. A great success was simply stopping the war by signing a ceasefire agreement, understanding that there can be no peace agreement with Putin, because this is impossible," he said.
According to him, it is impossible to stop the war simply with money or weapons, and without troops on the ground, instead, it is possible to do this using the mechanism of NATO's Article 5. "Day after day, month after month, more and more people understand this, including in the United States. They will not be able to avoid the presence of troops on Ukrainian territory if they want to stop the war," Poroshenko said.

University expels student who called for accountability over Hong Kong fire

A Hong Kong university student who had called for accountability over a deadly fire at an apartment complex in the city has been expelled by the school for disciplinary offences.
Miles Kwan, a politics student, was detained for two nights by the city’s national security police last year for “seditious intent” after handing out flyers calling for an independent investigation into a fire that killed 168 people in November.
After he was released on bail, his school, the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), conducted a disciplinary review and referred the case to a student discipline committee.
The committee decided to terminate him from studies on Thursday due to “multiple acts of misconduct”, according to a letter from the university.
CUHK said in a statement on Friday that it would not comment on individual cases, adding that a student who is given three demerits due to disciplinary actions may be terminated from studies.
Kwan, 24, said the university did not penalise him for the arrest in November 2025.
According to Kwan, he received demerits for calling the committee a “kangaroo panel” and a “disgrace”, and for being charged for “criminal damage” in 2023 after he placed stickers on lamp-posts in 2022 to mark the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown.
Kwan said he had completed his studies and was to graduate in March.
“It is shameful of CUHK to use graduation certificates to suppress its former students,” he said in a statement. “You can take away qualifications, but you can’t take away dignity.”
He was among several people behind a petition issued after the fire that broke out in high-rise towers of Wang Fuk Court housing estate in November, the world’s deadliest residential building fire since 1980.
The petition called for government officials to be held accountable, an independent investigation into possible corruption, proper resettlement for residents, and a review of construction oversight.
The Chinese city’s authorities have formed a judge-led “independent committee” to investigate the fatal blaze.

HUR intercepts another order by Russian commander to kill civilians
According to Ukrinform, the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine stated this on Facebook and released an audio recording.
The radio intercept obtained by HUR specialists documents new evidence of the deliberate destruction of civilians in Ukraine's temporarily occupied territories.
HUR identified the unit that received the criminal order as the Storm detachment, composed of former prisoners, within Russia's 57th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade.
The events took place in the Oleksandrivka sector, near the settlement of Zelenyi Hai in the Donetsk region.
"The intercepts once again confirm the systematic nature of war crimes committed by Russian occupiers against Ukraine's civilian population, with comprehensive support from the Kremlin authorities," HUR emphasized.
As previously reported, HUR intercepted an order from a Russian commander regarding Ukrainian fighters near Huliaipole.

Cardi B brings up Epstein files during online fight with White House
- Rapper Cardi B is engaged in an online dispute with the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) after she stated she and her fans would confront Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents at her concert.
- During a recent performance, Cardi B told her audience she would use “bear mace” if ICE agents attempted to detain her fans, a clip of which went viral on X.
- DHS responded on X, referencing Cardi B's past admission of drugging and robbing men, stating they would consider it an improvement if she didn't “drug and rob our agents.”
- Cardi B retaliated by invoking the DHS's own scandals, asking why they wouldn't discuss the recently released Epstein files concerning the drugging and rape of underage girls.
- The article also highlights a broader trend of celebrity political engagement, contrasting Cardi B's stance with Nicki Minaj's public support for Donald Trump.

Partner countries plan to provide Ukraine with military, energy aid packages by Feb 24 – Zelenskyy
President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reported on the preparation by partner countries of assistance packages that should arrive in Ukraine by the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion.
"We can now work on the largest energy package. Separately, we will work on missiles for air defense. Separately, we will work on some more things to strengthen our military – military packages. Now our diplomats and military advisers will work on this. We want in 10-11 days, by the 24th, and all partners have agreed that we will make such maximum support packages for Ukraine," Zelenskyy told reporters in Munich (Germany) on Friday, where he arrived to participate in a security conference and where he held meetings with representatives of European countries, the EU and the European Commission.
He also expressed hope for the introduction of a new package of sanctions against Russia by that date.

Three of The Independent’s journalists have been shortlisted for this year’s prestigious Press Awards.
The annual ceremony in London recognises the best of British national journalism, with The Independent nominated across four categories in total.
Judged by academics, editors, journalists and other industry figures, the awards – now in their 64th year – remain one of the most significant moments of recognition for UK news organisations.
The Independent journalists shortlisted are: health correspondent Rebecca Thomas, for health journalist of the year; chief international correspondent Bel Trew, for foreign reporter of the year; and global travel editor Annabel Grossman, shortlisted for travel journalist of the year.
Rebecca was shortlisted and won in the same category last year, and has since only added to her record of bringing in important and unflinching exclusives that get under the surface of the challenges healthcare in Britain faces. Judges previously noted her “contacts at all levels of the health service have allowed her to reveal the truth behind the spin as hospitals face increasing pressure”.
Bel, who has covered the Middle East since 2011 as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and more recently, the Trump administration's ICE operation in Minneapolis, has also previously won in her category, with the judges recognising that her work means she is often “risking her life to report from some of the most dangerous conflicts, focusing on lesser-reported stories and smashing damaging stereotypes”.
Annabel was promoted to global travel Editor in 2023, and her focus on adventure travel has seen her report on skiing in some of Japan's least-known resorts, how to escape the hordes on an Italian holiday, and the best way to road trip through the US.
The Independent has also been shortlisted for campaign of the year, for its Brick by Brick campaign, which, in partnership with the charity Refuge, has built two new safe homes for domestic abuse survivors fleeing the horror and fear of abuse.
The initiative has secured high-profile support, including from the Queen, as well as celebrities including Dame Helen Mirren, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Olivia Colman.

Florida couple arrested after country club pickleball brawl involving 20 people: cops
A Sunday morning pickleball game in Port Orange descended into chaos after a couple allegedly attacked their opponents
- Bookmark
A Florida couple are facing felony charges after a Sunday morning pickleball game allegedly descended into a huge brawl.
Cops were called to reports of a physical fight involving more than 20 people at Spruce Creek Country Club in Port Orange on February 8.
Obscenities were hurled, one person was hospitalized and even the fire department was in attendance when the chaotic scene unfolded at around 11 a.m, cops say.
An affidavit from the Volusia Sheriff’s Office obtained by The Independent states that one victim was left with “permanent scarring” after being hit.
Anthony Sapienza, 63, and his wife Julianne, 51, were arrested following the altercation and taken into police custody.
According to authorities, it all started when Anthony Sapienza accused his opponents of stepping into an area of the court where people are banned from volleying the ball, known as the “kitchen.” He used foul language to insult his opponent’s wife, the affidavit says.
Police claim he “approached [the opposing player] and punched him on the left side of the face and struck him with a pickleball paddle, causing significant bleeding.”
The victim was taken to hospital for treatment after receiving a laceration by his eye and is pursuing charges.
Authorities say Anthony Sapienza also pushed his opponent’s wife to the ground when she attempted to help her husband, and punched a 70-year-old onlooker in the face when he tried to break up the fight, resulting in his nose bleeding “profusely.”
Multiple witnesses spoke to police, per the affidavit, stating that they observed the verbal insults and the physical altercation including the paddle strike and punching.
The Sapienzas are accused of fleeing the scene, with police tracking them down to their residence in the nearby town of Ponce Inlet.
Anthony Sapienza is facing charges of aggravated battery causing bodily harm and battery on a person 65 or older. His wife is facing one count of battery on a person 65 or older. The couple’s charges are classed as felonies in the state of Florida.
Penalties for aggravated battery include up to 15 years of prison time and up to $10,000 in fines.

Can we make a plea for 'thank yous' | Letters

I do not agree with Sangeeta Pillai (The hill I will die on: Britons love saying thank you – I think we should ban the phrase, 7 February). I do not like sarcastic or passive aggressive “thank yous”, but what is wrong with thanking people in the service industry for the service they give? I do not believe that it is overworked or meaningless. I love to thank baristas, shop assistants, bus drivers or other people because they more often than not provide a very good service. They work hard and are not paid a lot of money. They are often people doing jobs that are difficult for one reason or another.
Why not be kind and appreciative? Isn’t there enough hardship and negativity in these febrile times?

Your article makes me incredibly sad. It most cases “thank you” does not mean “I’m infinitely grateful for your selfless act of service”. In most cases it just means “I see you”. It is a recognition that the other person matters and is not invisible.
It means, for example, that I see that the bus is driven by a person, not by a machine, and it means that I see that this person had to get up even earlier than me for driving this bus, facing a wind of ice cold air anytime they open the front door for new passengers. I hope we will never give up on too many “I see yous” during a day, as they do matter.

While I might agree with some of Sangeeta Pillai’s comments, I maintain that it’s necessary in a civilised society to show appreciation and gratitude. It’s nice to be thanked; and even nicer if one’s name is used. However, it can be excessive. I recently heard a shop assistant in New York say: “Thank you so very much, now you enjoy your underwear.” I assert that we as a nation apologise far too much. I lived on and off in France for nearly 20 years. I think I heard “je suis désolé” maybe three times. But they are generous with “merci”.

I enjoyed Sangeeta Pillai’s piece. Have you noticed that, these days, a simple “thank you” will no longer suffice? It’s now “thank you so much”?

I am sorry, Sangeeta, people in this country say “sorry” a lot more than they say “thank you”!

Israel determined to disarm Gaza, ready for offensive operations — top brass

TEL AVIV, February 13. /TASS/. The objective of Israel’s actions in the Gaza Strip - to demilitarize the enclave - remain unchanged and the Israeli army is prepared to proceed from a defensive posture to offensive operations, if necessary, Chief of the General Staff Lieutenant General Eyal Zamir said.
"We are not relinquishing the objectives of the war - the full demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas. We are operating in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, while maintaining military plans for their defeat and we stand ready to act defensively as required," he said while visiting the Rafah area.
According to Zamir, Israeli forces deployed in the Gaza Strip are safeguarding the security at border crossings and are "precisely dismantling terror infrastructure" in the enclave. "We are prepared to transition from a defensive posture to an offensive one. For any violation, we will respond and degrade their capabilities," he warned. Recently, we eliminated numerous terrorists, including senior operatives from the terrorist organizations."
He stated that the Israeli army has achieved serious successes in all arenas over the past two years. "There is no immunity for terrorism. What applies to terrorists in Gaza applies to the terrorists in other arenas as well. We will continue to remain focused and remove threats, with determination and a proactive approach," he pledged.
Tensions flared up in the Middle East on October 7, 2023, when militants from the Gaza Strip-based radical Palestinian movement Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel, killing residents of border settlements and taking more than 250 hostages. In response, Israel initiated a military operation in the Palestinian enclave to dismantle Hamas' military and political structures and free all hostages.
Israel and Hamas resumed Egypt-, Qatar-, United States-, and Turkey-mediated indirect talks on settling the situation in the Gaza Strip on October 6, 2025. On October 9, the parties to the conflict signed an agreement on the implementation of phase one of US President Donald Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan. The ceasefire came into effect on October 10. Under the agreement, Israeli troops withdrew to the so-called Yellow Line but retained control over more than 50% of the enclave’s territory. On October 13, Hamas released 20 living hostages and handed over the bodies of four out of 28 deceased hostages. The remains of the last Israeli hostage were handed over to Israel on January 26.
Phase two of the Gaza peace plan envisages the disarmament of Palestinian radical, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the enclave, and the deployment of an "international stabilization force," as well as the launch of the enclave administration structures. US special presidential envoy Steve Witkoff announced the beginning of the implementation of the second phase of the plan on January 14.

Trump’s ‘wrecking-ball politics’ are center stage at Munich Security Conference
- World leaders at the annual security conference in Munich have been greeted with a report warning about President Donald Trump’s “destruction” of the international order.
- The Munich Security Report 2026, titled “Under Destruction,” warns that the world has entered a period of “wrecking-ball politics.” It heavily criticizes the Trump administration, stating it is actively undermining global security structures and international law, leading to transactional deals over principled cooperation.
- “Sweeping destruction – rather than careful reforms and policy corrections – is the order of the day,” the report reads. “The most prominent of those who promise to free their country from the existing order’s constraints and rebuild a stronger, more prosperous nation is the current US administration. As a result, more than 80 years after construction began, the US-led post-1945 international order is now under destruction.”
- The view is widely shared in Europe and among America’s allies in Canada, Japan, and above all, Ukraine. Surveys across G7 nations indicate low public trust in governments, with no surveyed country believing the US administration's policies are beneficial for the world.
- The report sets a discordant tone for the weekend of discussions between world powers, which will include the US.

Swiss-based CAS turns down Ukrainian athlete Geraskevich’s appeal against IOC

MILAN, February 13. /TASS/. The Swiss-based Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has turned down an appeal from Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladislav Geraskevich contesting his recent disqualification from the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy, the court said in a statement on Friday.
"The CAS Ad hoc Division has denied an application by Skeleton athlete Vladislav Geraskevich (Ukraine) against the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC)," the court’s statement reads.
"The Sole Arbitrator, whilst fully sympathetic to Mr Geraskevich’s commemoration, is bound by rules in the IOC Athlete Expression Guidelines," the statement continued. "The Sole Arbitrator considers these Guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play."
"The Sole Arbitrator is bound by such proportionate rules and has no means to override them. As a consequence, the application was dismissed. The Sole Arbitrator adds that it was unfair to withdraw Mr Geraskevich’s accreditation in these circumstances and supports the decision of the IOC to return it," according to the CAS.
The IOC announced in a statement on February 12 that Geraskevich had been barred from participating in the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy for wearing a prohibited helmet, also revoking his Olympic accreditation.
However, later that day the IOC Disciplinary Commission partially amended its verdict regarding the competition ban and Olympic accreditation revocation, allowing Geraskevich to stay at the 2026 Winter Games, while still barring him from competing.
Earlier in the week, the IOC prohibited Geraskevich from wearing the controversial helmet. His helmet featured images of fallen Ukrainian athletes which, the IOC claimed, breached the regulations of the Olympic Charter. The athlete, nevertheless, wore it again for the final test runs before the start of the competitions.
After that, the IOC representatives held a second meeting with the skeleton racer, and he declared that he intended to race wearing this helmet. He also had a meeting with IOC President Kirsty Coventry on Thursday morning to discuss the same issue.
Following his meeting with Coventry, Gerskevich demanded that the IOC apologize and also finance the installation of power generating units at sports facilities across Ukraine.
Geraskevich, 27, has never medaled in international competition. The Ukrainian athlete finished fourth at the 2025 IBSF World Championships; on two occasions he also finished in 4th place at the IBSF World Cup stages, and his best result at the Bobsleigh and Skeleton European Championships was 8th place, which he accomplished earlier this year.
The Ukrainian participated in the last two Olympics before this year's Games, finishing 12th at the 2018 Winter Games and 19th at the 2022 Winter Games. Geraskevich was the Ukrainian national team’s flagbearer at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games Opening Ceremony.
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026.

Sahara autonomy plan revealed after Morocco-Polisario meeting

Morocco autonomy plan for Western Sahara unveiled after secret Madrid meeting with Polisario
Morocco has released details of its autonomy plan for the disputed Western Sahara region after attending a secret US-sponsored meeting in Madrid with the participation of delegates from Algeria, the Polisario Front, and Mauritania.
The meeting that took place behind closed doors in the Spanish capital beginning on Sunday was coordinated with the effort of Morocco’s King Mohamed VI and presented by the country’s foreign minister, Nasser Bourita.
The framework envisioned working on the basis of UN Security Council resolution 2797, which recognises Morocco’s autonomy plan as the primary basis for resolving the decades-long Sahara conflict.
According to reports, the meeting extended to Monday after failing to conclude on schedule.
From broad political framework to detailed autonomy statue
Morocco’s 40-page proposed plan for Western Sahara was seen by Madrid-based outlet Atalayar, which outlined its shift from the original 2007 proposal into a detailed, quasi-constitutional autonomy statue with precise institutions, powers and safeguards.
According to the Spanish outlet, the plan aims to distance itself from previous broad political frameworks vis-à-vis Western Sahara into a highly detailed, legally structured autonomy statue, tightly anchored in the constitutional order and sovereignty of the State.
The plan includes legal definitions, interpretive clauses, transitional provisions, and detailed mechanisms of constitutional and judicial control.
Where the 2007 plan spoke in general terms about autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty, the new Rabat-proposed plan envisions a national referendum involving the entire Moroccan electorate and the integration of the statue into the Constitution.
The text lays out stronger constitutional principles and safeguards, where the principle of constitutional loyalty is stated as a strictly guiding norm.
Constitutional safeguards would allow the State, in exceptional and temporary circumstances, to suspend certain regional powers in case of serious harm to the territorial integrity. Atalayar argues this is far more elaborated than in 2007.
Furthermore, the report says an entire section of the plan is centred around the concept of reconciliation and return of native populations, which envisions regulating registration of the Tindouf camps through an established permanent return committee working alongside a disarmament and demobilisation mechanism.
The protection of Hassani identity is further strengthened through its explicit recognition as part of the wider Moroccan heritage.
The new plan also aims to close any ambiguity on the community’s security by stating that regional security will remain limited to local police powers under national coordination.
Shift of mediation efforts from UN to US
Director of the Center for Sahara and Africa for Strategic Studies, Abdelfattah El Fattah El Fatihi, told The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby al-Jadeed that the event marked a milestone in the negotiations due to previous failed attempts by the UN for the parties to take part in meetings to "produce a roadmap and an agreed political solution on it".
The fact that both Algeria’s and Mauritania’s foreign ministers, as well as a delegation from the Polisario independence movement, sat around the Spanish roundtable, "reflects a qualitative shift in the way this file is managed at the international level", the head of the Maghreb Centre for Research and Strategic Studies, Nabil Andaloussi, said in an interview with Al-Araby Al-Jadeed.
"The discussion is no longer confined to the traditional international corridors in New York, but the centre of gravity has begun to tilt towards direct American leadership from Washington", Andaloussi said, emphasising that this shift carries deep political implications for Morocco and the region.
Algeria has for years refused to participate in discussions previously supervised by the United Nations during the era of former special envoy for Western Sahara, Horst Köhler.
Sahrawi activist and former official of the Polisario, Mostafa Salma Ould Sidi Mouloud, told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that he was sceptical of the American-led process due to US President Donald Trump’s keenness to add another dispute settlement to his list of achievements.
To achieve this, Mouloud argues, the Americans "may jump a lot of steps, and impose what they see as serving the American interest first, reducing tension to a minimum and leaving the final outcome to the time".
The former member of the Polisario, which is backed by Algiers and claims representation of the Sahrawi people, nevertheless welcomed the US ability to bring all parties to the table and "what [they] saw in the foreign ministers' leadership of the delegations as an affirmation of seriousness".

Epstein strongly advised Saudi against 2018 Aramco Wall St. IPO

'Cow to slaughter': Epstein strongly advised Saudi Arabia against 2018 Aramco Wall Street IPO
Jeffrey Epstein advised senior Saudi officials against the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco's planned 2018 IPO, an analysis by The New Arab of recently released emails has found.
Emails released by the US Department of Justice show that from 2016, Epstein frequently communicated with Saudi royal advisor Raafat Al-Sabbagh and Aziza Al-Ahmadi, another advisor to the kingdom about Aramco and the future of Saudi Arabia's economy.
Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), then Deputy Crown Prince, first spoke publicly about selling of parts of Aramco in January 2016. Saudi officials expected the company to be valued at $2 trillion, and investors thought it would be one of the biggest IPOs in stock market history.
Talk of an IPO for the ninety-year-old oil giant came shortly after MbS, son of King Salman bin Abdulaziz, became Deputy Crown Prince.
Then in April 2016, bin Salman announced Vision 2030, an initiative to diversify and reform Saudi Arabia's economy, society and culture.
Based on recently released documents, Epstein first discussed Aramco in an email sent to Al-Sabbagh on 26 May, 2016. Epstein suggested that, rather than selling parts of Aramco, Saudi Arabia should form a new currency based on oil.
Other documents show Al-Sabbagh was in the US at the time of this initial email and met Epstein the following day. He also tried to arrange a meeting with Al-Sabbagh's unnamed 'boss', to whom the pair often refer in their communications. Though this boss is not named, later communications suggest the pair may be referring to the then Deputy Crown Prince.
Epstein's communications with the Saudi official started long after he pleaded guilty to sexual offences against a minor. Though the full extent of Epstein's crimes was not publicly known at the time, messages from Al-Sabbagh suggest he maye have been aware of his reputation.
In one message from 2016, Al-Sabbagh said to Epstein, "I am sure you are opening so many legs" in Florida. In another, Al-Sabbagh sent a link to a news article titled, "Russian Beauty Queen Flees to Dubai to Sell Her Virginity for $13,000." Epstein responded, "finally you send me something worthwhile."
In August of that year, Epstein worked with Aziza Al-Ahmadi, a UAE businesswoman advising some Saudi government departments, to draft a letter to an unnamed person about the Kingdom's finances. Epstein said foreign investors would see an Aramco IPO as "taking a cow to slaughter," adding "shareholders are the last thing the kingdom needs." Instead, Epstein says Aramco's oil should be exchanged for "land, knowledge and currencies."
It's unclear who the intended recipient of this letter was, or indeed if it was sent. However, in October 2017, Epstein and Al-Ahmadi once again worked on a similar letter containing advice about Saudi Arabia's finances, this time explicitly to Mohammed bin Salman, now the Kingdom's Crown Prince.
In this letter, Epstein describes the IPO as "silly," saying a public listing would make Aramco's valuation volatile. He instead suggests selling options to China, or forming a "shariar [SIC] compliant" digital currency.
/
By the time Epstein wrote this second letter, plans for Aramco's IPO were clearer. Five per cent of the company would be sold at a valuation of $2 trillion in a listing planned for 2018.
The London and New York stock exchanges were vying to host the IPO. Major banks, including JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and HSBC, were acting as financial advisors. Yet Epstein repeatedly expressed his scepticism both to Saudi officials and to outside sources.
A key concern for Epstein was the potential for Aramco shares to serve as collateral in a lawsuit against the Kingdom. In September 2016, the US Congress passed the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA), which allowed foreign states to be sued in US courts for acts of terrorism.
The law was backdated to allow lawsuits for acts of terrorism from September 11, 2001, the date of attacks on the US by the terrorist group al-Qaeda, onwards. This was seen as opening Saudi Arabia up to liability due to allegations that the Saudi government were involved in the attacks, including by funding al-Qaeda. Saudi Arabia has repeatedly denied having any involvement in the attacks though 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi citizens.
In an email sent to Aziza Al-Ahmadi and former UN official, Terje Rod-Larsen, Epstein says it would be a "nightmare" if a lawsuit were brought against Saudi Arabia while Aramco was public.
As Epstein was communicating directly with Saudi officials, he was also discussing Aramco's IPO with other sources. From 2017 onwards, he shared news articles about the listing with several people, including Terje Rod-Larson, and former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon.
Though Epstein typically shared links without comment, replies to his emails suggest he often spoke about the Aramco IPO. In response to an August 2018 email with a link to a news story saying the IPO had been cancelled, former Kuwaiti Information Minister Anas Al-Rasheed said, "this was your opinion too."
Replying to a September 2018 email from Epstein saying Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund was borrowing money, then-New York Times journalist Landon Thomas Jr. said, "Why didn't MbS listen to you?
From August 2018 until Epstein's death the following August, there was little news about the IPO coming from Saudi Arabia.
Epstein continued discussing the listing with third parties, but after the 2018 cancellation, Epstein spoke to Raafat Al-Sabbagh about Aramco just once more before his death. On 8 April 2019, Epstein shared a link to a news story about Aramco selling bonds, to Al-Sabbagh, saying, "my idea from day one." Epstein was by then under investigation by the FBI.
Aramco was eventually listed on the Saudi stock exchange in November 2019, three months after Epstein's death. The company fell short of it's $2 trillion valuation, though it was the largest IPO in the stock market's history.
In the years since the IPO, Aramco briefly became the most valuable company in the world, after European sanctions hit Russia's oil industry following the country's invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the company's value has fallen by $800 billion, and its share price reached an all-time low in September 2025.
A class action lawsuit against Saudi Arabia by 9/11 survivors has been ongoing since March 2017, but in the nine years since it was issued, the court has been reluctant to find in the defendants' favour.
Saudi officials have previously denied Epstein advised the government on financial matters. Following the recent releases, they have decliend to respond to comments when approached by various media outlets.
On Friday, the Epstein scandal engulfed one of the biggest names in Gulf business, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, CEO of DP World.
Dubai's DP World named a new chairman and chief executive officer on Friday, replacing its former leader Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, after the Epstein files revealed frequent correspondence between him and the convicted sex offender.

- Ukrainian President Zelensky visited a new German-Ukrainian drone plant (QFI) aiming to produce 10,000 Linza 3.0 drones for Ukraine within a year.
- German Defence Minister Pistorius called joint ventures like QFI a "blueprint" for defence, providing crucial battle experience and boosting Germany's military.
- Zelensky called the co-production a "great result" for Europe, reflecting allies' rearmament and learning from Ukraine's conflict experience.

MUNICH, Germany - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb 13 visited a new drone production site established by a German and Ukrainian joint venture that aims to mass produce the equipment for Ukraine’s military.
Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, drones have become a crucial part of the conflict
Germany’s Quantum Systems and Ukraine’s Frontline Robotics announced in December the establishment of the joint venture, Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI).
The German plant, outside Munich, is in the early stages of manufacturing and is aiming to produce 10,000 drones for the Ukrainian armed forces within a year.
Mr Zelensky, paying a visit ahead of a security conference
“That’s great that we have the first production, big co-production in Europe,” Mr Zelensky said. “We’ve got today, I think, a great result.”
Kyiv’s European allies have also looked to learn practical lessons from the conflict as they rearm in the face of a perceived threat from Moscow and increasing disinterest in European security from the United States.
Speaking alongside Mr Zelensky, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said defence cooperation would boost his country’s efforts to rebuild its military.
“We are supporting Ukraine in its fight, but we are also benefiting ourselves, learning from the incredible amounts of data and the wealth of experience gathered on the battlefield in Ukraine,” he said.
“Joint ventures between German and Ukrainian companies are the blueprint, the right way to generate more bang for buck,” he added.
Over 60 of the Linza 3.0 drones, also in production in Ukraine, are already in service on the front lines. AFP

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The Russian government approved the principle of determining rates of seaport dues in 2026-2030 based on the "inflation minus" approach, the Federal Antimonopoly Service said.
"The Russian government approved the resolution developed by the authority on the annual indexation pace for rates of tonnage, navigation, canal, lighthouse, icebreaking, and seaport water area transport safety dues," the regulator said.
To ensure financial stability of companies, the service developed the approach to determining long-term indexation parameters for port dues at the level of "inflation minus 0.1 percentage point," the authority noted. "In 2026, rates of port dues will be adjusted upward by 5.02%," the regulator added.

It is not known whether his meeting with the US delegation will take place before or after the Geneva round of talks.
Background:
- Earlier on Friday, the Kremlin stated that the Russian delegation at the talks will be led by Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky. It is worth noting that Medinsky was not a member of the Russian negotiating team at the trilateral talks that resumed earlier this year in the UAE.
- The next round of Ukraine-US-Russia talks in Geneva on 17-18 February was announced by the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umierov.
- Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the new round of talks will include discussions of territorial issues.
- Zelenskyy also said earlier that the United States has proposed ending Russia's war against Ukraine by the summer, as they will have a different priority later – the US congressional elections.

Trump sends second aircraft carrier to Middle East in effort to increase pressure on Iran

Donald Trump has ordered the world’s largest aircraft carrier to sail from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East in an effort to increase pressure on Iran amid discussions over curbing its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The USS Gerald R Ford and its supporting warships should take about three weeks to return to the region, where they will join the USS Abraham Lincoln, dramatically increasing the military firepower available to the US leader.
On Tuesday, Trump said in an interview with Axios that he was “thinking” about sending a second carrier strike group to the Middle East, though at that point he said he believed Tehran was willing to strike a nuclear deal.
The US and Iran held a round of indirect negotiations in Oman last week, and further discussions were expected to follow, but so far no date has been scheduled.
Reports began circulating in US media on Thursday that the Ford was the carrier that had been nominated to set sail, a day after Trump met Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Washington to discuss the emerging negotiations with Iran.
Iran has indicated it is willing to curb its nuclear enrichment programme in return for sanctions relief, but has rejected other demands. Israel wants Iran to limit its ballistic missile programme and cut support for Hezbollah and other proxy groups.
Trump’s rhetoric about Iran has changed markedly over the past month. At first he appeared to suggest that he wanted to intervene – telling people protesting against the country’s regime that “help is coming”. But at the time the US had few military assets available.
That changed with the arrival of the Lincoln carrier strike group, but by then the Iranian regime had largely regained control of the streets by killing thousands of people, and possibly tens of thousands, in the most brutal crackdown in the country’s recent history.
Meanwhile, the US president’s focus appeared to have moved to curbing Iran’s nuclear programme – already set back in a summer bombing campaign by Israeli and US air forces during last summer’s 12-day war.
The Ford carrier strike group had been sent from the eastern Mediterranean at the end of October, and arrived in the Caribbean Sea in mid-November as Trump increased pressure on Venezeula’s former president Nicolás Maduro.
It played a central role in the extraordinary seizure of Maduro by US forces in early January, and had remained in the Caribbean. However, sending the carrier and its allied warships back to the Middle East makes for an unusually long deployment: it left the US in June 2025 and has no obvious date of return.
On Thursday Trump warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic” and said he hoped talks would conclude shortly.
“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear programme. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”

Farmers protest in Greek capital over rising production costs

ATHENS, Feb 13 - Greek farmers drove dozens of tractors into central Athens on Friday to protest over rising production costs and tough competition from abroad, saying that what the government had offered them so far was not enough to stay afloat.
People lined up and applauded as tractors arrived in front of the parliament building. The farmers said they would stay overnight.
Stavros Kozoutzis, a farmer from Komotini, in the north of the country, said: "Unfortunately, the summer cultivation period is about to begin, and we do not have the money to plant this year’s crops."
Last month, the farmers ended weeks of nationwide blockades over delayed farm aid payments. The Greek government says it has disbursed much of the overdue payments and announced cheaper fuel and cover for future output losses.
But the head of the farmers' union in the central agricultural region of Larissa said on Friday that many farmers had not yet received full compensation for last year's crop and livestock losses, while guaranteed minimum prices for their products and investment in irrigation and infrastructure against future floods were core demands the government has not met.
"We are giving a battle for our survival. We left the blockades... but our fight continues as our main demands have not been satisfied," Rizos Maroudas told public broadcaster ERT, hours before farmers reached Athens.
The sector has also been hit by rolling outbreaks of sheep and goat pox with hundreds of thousands of animals being culled since 2024.
Footage from local television showed veterinarians dressed in yellow uniforms spraying tractors with disinfectants before they reached the Greek capital. REUTERS

In an interview with FRANCE 24, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev declared that "peace is achieved" with Armenia following an August White House summit. "For me, it is done," he said. Aliyev however firmly refused to grant clemency to imprisoned Nagorno-Karabakh separatist leaders, an issue that was raised during a meeting he had this week with US Vice President JD Vance.
Speaking to FRANCE 24 on the sidelines of Munich Security Conference (MSC), the Azerbaijani leader compared the trial of Nagorno-Karabakh separatist leaders to the Nuremberg trials.
"These people committed serious crimes against humanity," he stated. When asked to "turn the page" and grant them clemency, Aliyev asserted: "Their crime was even worse than what the Nazis did during World War II."
Pushing the 'restart button' with France
Aliyev expressed confidence in the TRIPP project, a road and rail link through Armenia connecting Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to Europe. "I have no doubt that it will happen," he said, noting that it "carries the name of President Trump".
Asked about France, with which relations deteriorated sharply over the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict back in 2023, Aliyev confirmed progress after meeting President Emmanuel Macron in Copenhagen in October 2025: "We agreed to put a restart button. We are ready for that."

MUNICH, Germany — European countries need to create a “rapid reaction force” of up to 100,000 troops to replace American soldiers currently stationed on the continent, EU Defense Commissioner Andrius Kubilius said in an interview with POLITICO on Friday.
Kubilius shied away from calling such a force a “European army,” a term that is rejected in many countries and even causes deep dissent among his fellow European commissioners.
“We need to have clarity about what we are talking about, because this title of 'European army' has some kind of historical legacy and sometimes it's misleading," he said, speaking at the POLITICO Pub during the Munich Security Conference.

Risk of missteps hangs over US-backed ceasefire deal in northeast Syria
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 13 - A U.S.-backed ceasefire agreement in northeastern Syria leaves thorny questions unresolved, as Kurds seek to retain some authority despite a much weakened hand following the rapid advance of central government forces.
The progress of the deal tests the ability of Syria's new leaders to stabilise a nation fractured by 14 years of war, following several bouts of violence pitting it against minority groups who are suspicious of the Islamist-led government.
The struggle for Syria's northeast has brought the biggest shift in control since former leader Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December 2024. After months of deadlock, Damascus seized swathes of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) before agreeing to the plan that foresees its remaining enclave being integrated into the state.
Preliminary steps have gone smoothly since the January 29 agreement: small contingents of government forces have deployed into two Kurdish-run cities, fighters have withdrawn from frontlines, and Damascus on Friday announced the appointment of a regional governor nominated by the Kurds.
But a dozen government and Kurdish officials said core issues had yet to be tackled, including precisely how SDF fighters will be integrated, the fate of SDF heavy weapons, and arrangements for a border crossing to Iraq that has been an SDF lifeline.
For now, the SDF has a firm grip over areas it still holds. But the question of how much authority the SDF would retain had yet to be answered, said Noah Bonsey of International Crisis Group, a think tank.
He said further progress in implementing the deal currently looked like the most likely scenario, "but the risk ... of missteps, and thus ultimately the risk of renewed escalation is still high."
WASHINGTON PLEASED WITH PROGRESS, URGES FLEXIBILITY
President Ahmed al-Sharaa has now brought almost all of Syria back under central control.
A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington, which withdrew some forces from Syria this week, is pleased with progress toward integration and has urged Sharaa to be as flexible as possible with SDF requests.
The U.S. advice is: avoid taking a hard line as a sign of goodwill, since a degree of autonomy for Kurds is desirable as long as it does not threaten the core need for central authority in Damascus, the official said.
Asked for comment, the U.S. State Department referred to a statement by Syria envoy Tom Barrack in which he said the agreement paved the way for lasting peace for all Syrians. Syria's information ministry and the SDF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The agreement, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, foresees the defence ministry establishing a division for the northeast, integrating SDF forces into three brigades.
It stipulates that 15 government security vehicles would deploy into each of the SDF-held cities of Qamishli and Hasakah, and that "integration of SDF security forces" would begin.
Deployments this month were largely incident-free, in stark contrast to the government's attempt to enter Druze-majority Sweida last July, which led to deadly violence. The U.S., meanwhile, has moved thousands of Islamic State prisoners formerly guarded by the SDF to Iraq.
But there are also signs of friction on the ground.
The SDF accuses the government of besieging Kobani, a Kurdish-run town cut off from the main SDF enclave, while Arabs living in SDF areas are resentful of its continued control, notably in ethnically mixed Hasakah city, according to two Syrian security officials.
SDF commander Mazloum Abdi has said the three brigades comprising SDF fighters will be based in Qamishli, Hasakah and Derik, near the Iraqi border. But officials on both sides said that while there was a tentative understanding on a location near Qamishli, the other two had yet to be agreed.
The SDF wants one stationed on Mount Abdelaziz near Hasakah city, overlooking its southern approaches and an extensive network of tunnels, Syrian military sources said. Damascus objects to this.
KURDISH OFFICIAL SEES SECURITY IN KURDISH HANDS
Arab-majority areas fell quickly to the government advance, including Deir al-Zor province and its oil fields. But the deal requires the SDF to hand over two other fields near Qamishli - Rmeilan and Sweidiya - and Qamishli airport. This has yet to happen.
A regional intelligence officer described SDF concessions so far as symbolic.
Abdulkarim Omar, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters that government security forces would withdraw after coordinating and finalising "integration mechanisms".
Asayish (Kurdish security forces) will be part of the interior ministry, and they are the ones who will protect this region from within," he said, adding that "lengthy discussions" were needed on the agreement's implementation.
Turkey has also indicated lingering doubts. It views the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF's backbone, as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which staged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey before entering a peace process.
Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the YPG's withdrawal created a "healthier" security map, but Turkey's security concerns would only be fully addressed when YPG severs links to the PKK and undergoes a "historic transformation". REUTERS

Indian man pleads guilty in US over plot to kill Sikh separatist leader

An Indian man charged with orchestrating an unsuccessful alleged Indian government-backed plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City pleaded guilty to three criminal charges, a spokesperson for the US attorney's office in Manhattan said.
Nikhil Gupta, 54, on Friday pleaded guilty to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carry a maximum combined sentence of 40 years in prison, the spokesperson said.
Gupta entered his plea before US Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in Manhattan federal court.
Lawyers for Gupta were not immediately available for comment.
Gupta has been jailed in Brooklyn since his June 2024 extradition to the United States from the Czech Republic, where he had been arrested a year earlier.
He had pleaded not guilty immediately after his extradition.
US prosecutors accused Gupta of plotting with an Indian government official to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a US resident and dual US-Canadian citizen who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India’s Punjab.
India's government has dissociated itself from any plot against Pannun, saying it was against government policy.
The discovery of alleged assassination plots against Sikh separatists in the United States and Canada has tested relations with India, which has also denied involvement in such plots.
New Delhi has long been unhappy over Sikh separatist activity in Canada and the US.
Last year, Pakistan's top diplomat, in a news conference, claimed that his country has "credible evidence" of the Indian government's involvement in killings in the country.
The Washington Post reported last year that an officer in India's intelligence service was directly involved in a foiled plan and that Vikram Yadav, an officer of India's infamous Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), had orchestrated the failed assassination plot of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun by enlisting a "hit team" to carry out the operation.
British news outlet The Guardian also claimed in an investigation that agents of New Delhi's RAW had been involved in up to 20 extrajudicial killings of individuals in Pakistan since 2020.

Wendy's closes US restaurants and focuses on value to turn around falling sales

Wendy’s becomes latest fast food joint to close hundreds of locations
Many fast food chains are intensifying efforts to attract ‘inflation-weary customers’
- Bookmark
Fast-food giant Wendy's is embarking on a significant restructuring, announcing the closure of hundreds of its US restaurants and a renewed focus on value deals following a disappointing fourth-quarter performance.
The Dublin, Ohio-based company revealed plans to shutter between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of its US outlets – equating to 298 to 358 locations – in the first half of this year.
This follows the closure of 28 restaurants in the final quarter of last year, bringing its US footprint to 5,969 locations by the end of 2025. These actions come on top of 240 US Wendy’s locations that ceased operations in 2024, with the 57-year-old chain acknowledging many of its sites were simply "out of date."
The strategic shift comes after global same-store sales, for locations open at least a year, plummeted by 10 per cent in the October-December period, falling short of analysts' expectations of an 8.5 per cent drop. US same-store sales experienced an even steeper decline. Despite this, the company's revenue for the fourth quarter, at $543m, slightly exceeded forecasts, though it represented a 5.5 per cent decrease.
In response, Wendy's, much like rivals McDonald’s and Taco Bell, is intensifying its efforts to attract "inflation-weary customers" through more competitive pricing. Ken Cook, Wendy’s interim CEO and chief financial officer, stated in an investor call: "One learning from 2025 around value, we swung the pendulum too far towards limited-time price promotions instead of everyday value." The company has already launched a permanent "Biggie Deals" value menu, featuring three price points: $4 Biggie Bites, $6 Biggie Bags and an $8 Biggie Bundle. New products, including a chicken sandwich, are also anticipated this year.
Despite the challenges, Wendy's expressed confidence that its US turnaround plans and international expansion will help reverse its sales decline. The company projects global systemwide sales, encompassing both company-owned and franchised restaurants, to remain flat this year, an improvement from the 3.5 per cent fall recorded last year. Investors reacted positively, with Wendy's shares climbing nearly 5 per cent in mid-day trading on Friday.

Labour MP calls for NATO ‘neighbourhood’ model for decisions
United Kingdom

Labour MP Graeme Downie has argued that NATO’s consensus-based decision-making needs reform, warning that the pace of modern crises is outstripping the Alliance’s ability to respond.
Writing in PoliticsHome, Downie said: “Crises in Europe now develop faster than political structures respond. Decisions that could once take days are now needed in hours.” While describing NATO as “the most successful military alliance in history”, he argued its strength is also a vulnerability, writing: “Its greatest asset, 31 democracies acting together, is also its strategic Achilles heel.”
He warned that unanimity creates operational risk: “Unanimity binds allies politically, yet slows them operationally. Vladimir Putin believes he can exploit that gap.” Downie proposed what he called a “neighbourhood” model, where allies closest to a theatre are empowered to respond rapidly, stating NATO should embrace “regional leadership, a ‘neighbourhood’ model where the allies best placed to act in specific theatres are empowered to do so quickly.”
He argued the UK is well placed to lead this shift, writing: “This approach is already emerging organically. Nato now needs to formalise it, and the UK should be leading.” Highlighting the High North, he said: “The Greenland, Iceland, UK gap is once again central to Nato’s ability to track and deter Russian submarines.” He cited British anti-submarine capabilities including Astute-class submarines and RAF Poseidon aircraft, noting: “British P-8s have flown joint missions with US and Norwegian aircraft to shadow Russian submarines.”
He also raised concerns over NATO’s ability to respond quickly in the Baltic, asking: “How long could Nato take to respond to Russia seeking to occupy an uninhabited island in the Baltic…?” and warning: “The fait accompli would be that Russian troops now occupied Nato territory.” Downie suggested a smaller grouping response could prevent delay, writing: “What if there were a ‘neighbourhood’ response through a grouping such as JEF or just a small group of Nato members?”
He concluded that NATO must adapt to ensure deterrence remains credible, arguing: “If Nato wants to deter effectively in the decade ahead, it needs to embrace regional leadership, accelerate its decision-making, and turn speed into its advantage rather than its vulnerability.”

Zelensky meets exiled Crown Prince of Iran
Zelensky stated this on Telegram, according to Ukrinform.
He expressed condolences to the victims of the Iranian regime and noted that Ukraine supports the Iranian people in their struggle for their future.
"During our conversation, we focused on the situation in Iran and the areas where the Iranian people need support. We discussed the importance of strengthening sanctions against the Iranian regime and any other dictatorial regimes," Zelensky said.
The interlocutors condemned cooperation between Russia and Iran, in particular the supply of Shahed drones by the Iranian regime to Russia and the transfer of licenses for their production. They emphasized that such a partnership poses a real threat not only to Ukraine but to the entire region.
Zelensky thanked the Crown Prince of Iran for supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity. "It is vital to make every effort to protect human lives. Ukraine is ready to help on its part," he noted.
For his part, as reported by the Office of the President, the Crown Prince thanked Ukraine for recognizing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization.
As previously reported, the 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13 – a leading global forum for discussing key international security challenges.
About 1,000 representatives from nearly 120 countries are taking part in the three-day event, including nearly 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, more than 30 defense ministers, and leaders of over 40 international organizations.
The Ukrainian delegation is headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

CEO of Dubai's largest port replaced after ties to Epstein revealed
The head of one of the world's largest port operators has been removed from his position, following revelations from the Jeffrey Epstein files about the extent of his ties to the convicted sex offender.
On Friday, Dubai's government media office announced in a statement that it had appointed a new chairman of the board of directors and a new CEO of the company, DP World, replacing Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, one of the Middle East's most prominent business figures. The company, which is overseen by Dubai's ruling family, operates ports in the Gulf and all over the world.
Bin Sulayem has served as chairman of DP World since 2007 and was named joint chairman and CEO in 2016.
The statement does not mention bin Sulayem by name. CBS News has reached out to DP World for comment.
Bin Sulayem's ties to Epstein were well publicized during the newest release of Epstein files by the Justice Department. According to a department spokesperson, bin Sulayem's name appears in the files more than 4,700 times.
In one email from bin Sulayem to Epstein, he asked Epstein, "where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video." In a separate email exchange, Epstein called bin Sulayem "one of my most trusted friends in very sense of the word," and added that "I greatly appreciate the time we spend together."
"Thank you my friend I am off the sample a fresh 100% female Russian at my yacht," Bin Sulaymen replied to Epstein.
Documents indicate the relationship between the men dates back to the early 2000s and involved consulting each other for business input and arranging meetings with influential people, including former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (formerly Prince Andrew), and investor Tom Barrack, who is now the ambassador to Turkey.
Other email correspondence shows the men discussing different masseuses and a possible visit to Epstein's island. One exchange shows bin Sulaymen helping to arrange for one of Epstein's masseuses to be trained at a luxury hotel in Turkey, for "better experiences."
In one email to bin Sulayem from a redacted sender, the sender wrote "Jeffrey is wondering what time you would like your massage today in new york." Epstein offered to take him to his island after an event he referred to as "the Clinton Forum." Bin Sulaymen asked Epstein about Sept. 15-20, 2005, and that year, the annual Clinton Global Initiative took place from Sept. 15-17.
In a speech on the House floor Tuesday, Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna read the names of six "wealthy, powerful men" that the Justice Department had initially redacted in its most recent release of Epstein-related files. One of them was bin Sulaymen. The redactions have since been removed and all six names revealed.
The files referenced by Khanna and reviewed by CBS News do not appear to directly implicate the six men in any crimes, and Khanna did not allege any specific criminal wrongdoing.
When previously contacted about the communications between Epstein and bin Sulayem, DP World declined to comment.

Let the revelry begin: Rio mayor hands city's key to King Momo as Carnival kicks off
Rio de Janeiro has kicked off Carnival celebrations as the mayor hands the city key to King Momo for a playful five-day reign
- Bookmark
The mayor of Rio de Janeiro gave King Momo the key to the Brazilian city on Friday, ushering in the symbolic Carnival monarch’s five-day reign over the festivities.
Until Wednesday, Momo is charged with presiding over the revelry, participating in the parades and promoting the joy of partygoers. His ruling over the metropolis in the South American country symbolizes society being turned upside down during Carnival.
This year’s Momo is 30-year-old Danilo Vieira, a Rio native who will be taking charge of the celebrations.
“The rules still apply, of course," Vieira told The Associated Press before his symbolic coronation. "We have to follow the rules of our city, our country, but Carnival is run by me."
In 2024, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes issued a decree making the key ceremony an annual official event, obliging his successors to participate.
Rio City Hall expects about 6 million revelers to participate in the raucous street parties, where groups made up of musicians, percussionists and stilt artists draw thousands of partygoers, many scantily dressed and covered in glitter.
Many will head to Rio’s famed Sambodrome, where samba schools will showcase their parades — prepared diligently for months — complete with ginormous floats and elaborate costumes, to judges who will dish out points and eventually announce a winner.
This year's parades celebrate diverse themes including sex workers, late singer and songwriter Rita Lee and Black communities in the Amazon.
While Rio’s Carnival is the most well-known, the festivity is a nationwide phenomenon. Samba schools in the world’s largest tropical rainforest are also preparing parades, and festivities in the colorful, colonial city of Olinda began on Thursday.
In Rio, a recent wave of thefts by young people acting in groups have raised security concerns, with some calling on the mayor and Gov. Cláudio Castro to do more to guarantee revelers’ safety.
“Carnival is meant to be a time of joy, but what we’ve been seeing at the street parties in Rio, beyond the fun, is fear,” former councilwoman Luciana Boiteux said on Instagram earlier this month. She called for better lighting and preventive community policing.
Rio City Hall’s secretariat of public order and the municipal guard said that they have set up a special operation involving around 1,100 agents for patrols. The teams will monitor street parties from start to finish, when the risk of thefts tends to intensify.
Teams specializing in violence against women will also be present at key locations to offer support and guidance, City Hall said.
At Friday’s ceremony, Vieira said that Carnival is also about inclusivity.
“Carnival is love, carnival heals," he said. "A kind of magic happens, bringing joy to every heart, to all races, to everyone.”

EU says no shortcut to Ukraine reforms amid 2027 membership speculation
Unknown

02:37:07 KST

A top EU official said there is no shortcut to Ukraine carrying out reforms, amid speculation over Kyiv's accelerated entry to the European Union as soon as next year.
"Let's have this discussion, with one baseline — full membership comes only after full reforms," Marta Kos, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, said on Feb. 13 in Tallinn.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said at the end of January that the country would be ready to join the bloc by 2027, and membership of the EU would serve as an economic security guarantee in the event of an eventual peace deal with Russia.
Reports have since emerged that the EU is exploring a membership plan for Ukraine that would allow the country to join before completing all the necessary reforms required as part of the so-called accession process.
But some national leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, have pushed back on the speedy timeline.
In a speech highlighting the tensions between a fast moving and hostile geopolitical environment, and the lethargic pace of the EU, Kos said she was "glad" that debate around new models of membership was taking place, and appeared to leave the door open to a more flexible approach to membership.
"We need to reach citizens in our candidate countries much faster and more directly, by rewarding those who deliver on reforms and alignment with EU rules with faster integration into EU policies and structures," she said.
Her speech comes as Ukraine's parliament fails to vote through unpopular reforms required to unlock a new International Monetary Fund program — a necessary condition for receiving a 90 billion euros ($107 billion) lifeline from the EU.
One senior European Commission official, speaking to the Kyiv Independent this week on the condition of anonymity, expressed concern over Ukraine's weakened appetite to pursue reforms in recent months, saying it would undermine both European support for the country's membership and future private sector investment in the country.
Ukraine's record on aligning with the EU was tarnished last summer when Zelensky moved to strip the country's anti-corruption agencies of their independence. Although he backtracked after a fiery reaction from civil society, the episode looms large in the minds of EU policymakers.
Kos outlined five crucial "ingredients of success" for any future accession process, including safeguards to prevent democratic backsliding.
Ukraine was granted EU candidate status in 2022. The country completed the legislative screening process last year, and has advocated for a fast-track accession amid ongoing peace talks with Moscow, arguing that EU membership is essential for post-war recovery and security.
However, Hungary continues to block the opening of "accession clusters," the next stage in the protracted process of joining the bloc.

‘Handmaid’s Tale future’: Reform’s Matt Goodwin sparks outcry with fertility comments

Reform UK’s candidate in the Gorton and Denton byelection has been accused of wanting a “Handmaid’s Tale future” after unearthed YouTube footage revealed he called for “young girls and women” to be given a “biological reality” check.
In a clip posted to his personal YouTube channel in November 2024, Matt Goodwin stated that “many women in Britain are having children much too late in life”.
He said: “We need to also explain to young girls and women the biological reality of this crisis. Many women in Britain are having children much too late in life and they would prefer to have children much earlier on.”
The comments, first reported by the Independent, have sparked a furious backlash, with one MP describing it as an “alt right fantasy” and an equality campaigner calling it “truly troubling”. The revelations come days after the paper revealed Goodwin previously suggested people who don’t have children should be taxed extra as punishment.
Sarah Owen, the chair of the Commons women and equalities committee, said the comments were “deeply offensive” and appeared to blame women for the declining birthrate.
“For anyone with fertility issues, like me who struggled with miscarriage after miscarriage, to say [to them] we should be paying more tax for not having children or that it is our fault is deeply offensive, as it is for LGBT+ people or women who can’t afford to have kids,” she said. “It’s clear he didn’t run this grotesque idea past any women in real life.”
Natalie Fleet, the Labour MP for Bolsover, who was groomed and became pregnant as a 15-year-old, said her pregnancy had happened at a “biologically great age” and she had experienced a “physically perfect pregnancy and easy birth”. But, she added, she had been through “hell on earth”.
Addressing the former academic on social media, she wrote: “Is this the kind of thing you’ll be wanting to see in our Handmaid’s Tale future?” A reference to the Margaret Atwood novel set in a dystopian future.
In a separate podcast with the rightwing author and commentator Jordan Peterson, Goodwin also appeared to agree with the host’s claim that universities have become hotbeds of “politically correct authoritarianism” because they are full of “childless women”.
In a February 2025 clip, Peterson said there were three predictors of “politically correct authoritarianism”, of which the first was “being female”, at which point Goodwin interjected and added: “I was going to say that.”
Peterson added that an “ethos of harm avoidance” had proliferated because universities “became dominated by not only women – this is even worse, I might as well go in all the way – childless women”.
Goodwin responded: “Yeah, actually there are a couple of papers on that Jordan, I’m sure you’ve seen, I think Cory Clark. I’ve read a couple I think showing basically the feminisation of higher education over the last 50 years.”
A Reform spokesperson said the two men “were discussing peer-reviewed academic studies showing clear psychological differences between men and women, which influence their views of cancel culture”.
Responding to queries about Goodwin suggesting in 2023 that the government “remove personal income tax for women who have two or more children”, the party said Goodwin had not called for childless women to be taxed more but it was time for a “grown-up, mature debate about how we can encourage people to have more children and support British families”.
Hannah Spencer, the Green party candidate in Gorton and Denton, said women were struggling with the cost of living, caring responsibilities and health inequalities in NHS services. “I wish the Reform candidate put more time into addressing problems and less into looking for divisive, easy answers,” she said.
Penny East, the chief executive of the Fawcett Society, said the “idea that we should be telling young girls they have a moral obligation to have children earlier is both dystopian and deeply sexist […] Suggesting early motherhood is a civic duty is truly troubling.”
Writing on social media, the Walthamstow MP, Stella Creasy, said: “I long for the days when a midlife crisis for men like this meant getting a motorbike and a leather jacket, not trying to [get] elected so they could indulge their alt right fantasies about ensuring women were pregnant as soon as they were fertile and then didn’t go to university.”

‘Monumental victory’: Activists welcome High Court ruling against Palestine Action ban
Activists and rights groups in the UK have welcomed a "monumental victory" after the country’s High Court ruled that a ban on the Palestine Action group was unlawful, citing breaches of free speech and rights to protest.
On Friday, several prominent campaigners hailed the legal victory by Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori in her challenge against the government’s decision to proscribe the group under anti-terrorism legislation, although the organisation remains banned for the time being pending an appeal by the UK government.
In a statement, Ammori warned the government against any attempt "to try to delay or stop the High Court’s proposed Order quashing this ban", after Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed” by the ruling and intended to appeal the decision.
The judgment has prompted renewed calls for charges against protesters accused of supporting Palestine Action to be dropped.
Ammori raised alarm over "the futures of these thousands of people hang in the balance, many of whom are elderly or disabled and facing up to 14 years’ imprisonment for this entirely peaceful protest".
Since the ban came into force last July - following an incident in which Palestine Action activists entered a British military base and spray-painted two military aircraft - more than 2,700 people have been arrested for holding signs supporting the group, according to protest group Defend Our Juries.
Ammori added that "It would be a draconian overreach and a blatant affront to the rule of law for more people to be arrested today and in the coming weeks for defying a ban which has been ruled unlawful".
The new High Court ruling has been welcomed by groups including Greenpeace UK, Amnesty International and the Stop the War Coalition, all of which described the decision as significant for protest rights and civil liberties.
Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, also called for a "thorough and independent investigation" into the government’s decision to proscribe Palestine Action, stating that the ruling “reinforces what many of us having been saying all along - that the government’s misuse of terrorism legislation was a brazen and gross abuse of power that served to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel and those profiting from its atrocities".
Meanwhile, Defend Our Juries said in a statement provided to The New Arab that the ruling showed there was "no longer any reason for Palestine Action-linked prisoners, including those who went on hunger strike, to be held in prison without trial on unsubstantiated ‘terror’ charges. They should be released immediately."
Saeed Taji Farouky, a former Palestine Action spokesperson and filmmaker, rejected the government’s justifications for the ban prior to the ruling, describing them as "incredibly fake and unconvincing".
Speaking to The New Arab, Farouky pointed to the acquittal last week of six Palestine Action activists charged with aggravated burglary over a break-in at Elbit Systems UK as evidence of "a crumbling case before this High Court judgment was passed down".
"Now with this judgment passed down, we can see the extent of the government's lies and manipulation. We can see that the government lied to the people. They lied to Parliament. They lied to their own lawmakers," he said.
Farouky has also joined growing calls for former Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who authorised the proscription last year, to resign from her current position as Foreign Secretary.
"[Yvette Cooper] lied to the British public, she lied to the High Court, she lied to Parliament. She said there was secret evidence that would prove clearly and unequivocally that Palestine Action was violent, that they should be categorized as terrorists. The evidence was so secret, the British public weren't allowed to see it".
Farouky further accused Cooper of "constructing a framework for prescription", adding that "she should be humiliated”.
He continued: "And if she has any sense of self respect, she won't represent the UK as Foreign Secretary anymore." Cooper has not publicly responded to the ruling or the mounting criticism.
Despite this, Farouky expressed optimism that the judgment could influence other Palestine Action-related cases, including those of eight remand prisoners affiliated with the group who took part in what campaigners describe as the largest coordinated hunger strike in the UK since 1981.
Looking ahead, the filmmaker said the ruling could also "embolden people to take up their rights, their rights to protest and their rights to dissent from this government".
He added: "The government has tried not only to crush Palestine Action and the pro-Palestinian movement, but even more generally, to crush dissent and the right to protest and the more basic principles of democracy in this country."
Following the judgment, PA news agency reported that a senior judge postponed plea hearings at London’s Old Bailey for four alleged pro-Palestine protesters, granting a request from defence lawyers to allow time to consider the implications of the ruling.
The defendants face charges of criminal damage relating to protests last August.
In its decision, the High Court found that the then home secretary had made a "significant" error by focusing on the perceived benefits of proscribing Palestine Action without adequately considering the drawbacks- most notably the risk posed to the right to protest.
While the ban remains in force pending the appeal process, British police said on Friday they would prioritise gathering evidence of alleged offences linked to the banned direct action group rather than making arrests in the immediate aftermath of the ruling.

A nine-year-old unvaccinated child died of measles on Friday, the Health Ministry announced, in the 15th recorded death of an unvaccinated child caused by an ongoing measles outbreak.
The child was hospitalized in critical condition and was declared dead after several attempts by the medical staff to resuscitate him.
The ministry noted that the previous 14 children who died from measles were not vaccinated, with most of them being healthy before the disease and without underlying complications.
"The vaccine saves lives," the ministry added, assuring the population that the vaccines were safe and effective in fighting measles.
The statement also emphasized the importance of seeking medical treatment promptly when symptoms appear or an infection is suspected, and noted that early arrival may save lives.
Health Ministry recommends vaccinating children against measles
The Health Ministry's official policy recommends that all children be vaccinated against measles between the ages of 1 and 6 as part of the routine vaccination program.
In areas where a measles outbreak has been detected, the ministry recommends a second dose of the vaccine for children aged one and a half years and an additional dose for infants aged 6-11 months, especially before traveling to areas experiencing an outbreak.
In addition, the Ministry recommended that those who are not vaccinated, as well as parents of infants who received one dose at 6-11 months of age, avoid participating in large-scale events in outbreak-prone areas due to the risk of infection.

Main donor US unclear on UNRWA future, jettisoning it would leave black hole, agency chief says

The United States is still not clear about how it sees the future role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), its chief said on Friday, warning that jettisoning it would create a black hole similar to Iraq after 2003.
Washington was long UNRWA's biggest donor, but froze funding in January 2024 after Israel uncovered strong proof indicating that multiple members of UNRWA staff took part in Hamas's October 7 massacre.
"There is no definitive answer, because the interest of the US is also to be successful in this process, and if you get rid of an agency like ours before you have an alternative, you are also creating a huge black hole," UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini told Reuters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Remember what happened in Iraq in 2003 when the entire administration had been dismantled. There was no alternative, and people were left without any services," he said in an interview.
No more cuts foreseen, Lazzarini says
Lazzarini, who leaves his post at the end of March, said UNRWA did not foresee any more cuts in the immediate term and will continue to offer public health and education services.
He urged Gulf Arab countries to increase their support because their contribution did not match their strong expression of solidarity with Palestinian refugees.
Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with it.

Saudi Arabia scales back Red Sea luxury resort plans amid reassessment

Saudi Arabia is revising its ambitious Red Sea tourism strategy, scaling back plans to build 81 luxury resorts by 2030 as the kingdom reassesses the scope and pace of its multi-billion-dollar diversification projects, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Stubbornly low oil prices and patchy demand have forced a rethink of the flamboyant "giga-projects" – centrepieces of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 program to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy.
Red Sea Global (RSG) denied plans to downsize, saying the project would continue after the initial phase of 27 resorts is completed this year.
But sources with knowledge of the plans said construction would halt at the end of 2026, costing dozens of jobs at RSG and hundreds at contracting firms.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
"A decision was taken to stop work on Phase Two of the Red Sea projects," a senior RSG source told AFP.
"Current operating costs exceed revenues in a way that has become unsustainable," another source at the company added.
Seven sources at RSG, other giga-projects and related companies and consultancies said the Red Sea construction would be put on pause.
However, RSG insisted that it was pressing on with phase two of construction, including on the residential development of Laheq Island.
"As with any large-scale, long-term destination, Phase Two is being delivered through a sequenced approach," RSG said in a statement to AFP.
"Several projects are currently in design development, approvals, and commercial structuring, which is exactly where they should be at this stage."
Government officials acknowledge a pullback in the sprawling giga-projects after Saudi Arabia also took on board the large-scale infrastructure commitments of Expo 2030 in Riyadh and the 2034 World Cup.
"Some (giga-projects) will be scaled down. Some will be delayed," Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told AFP last month in Davos.
Low oil prices are also impacting Saudi budgets. Profits have fallen for 11 straight quarters at Saudi Aramco, the world's top oil exporter and the country's main earner.
"The consensus is that it's impossible to work on all these projects at the same time," a source at a company backed by the country's wealth fund told AFP.
"It was believed that the Red Sea project would attract more capital and generate huge returns, and that it would eventually become financially sustainable," another source working with a government project added.
"But this never happened."
The Red Sea developments include Amaala, envisaged to stretch along 68 kilometres (42 miles) of coast and cover 4,155 square kilometres (2,582 square miles), with 30 resorts and a yacht club all powered by renewable energy.
Further south, the Red Sea Project has an international airport and plans for 50 resorts, some of them on three islands.
Just north of the two sites lies another giga-project: Neom, the futuristic new city whose ambitious design is reported to have hit major problems.
The downscaling could deal a blow to Saudi hopes of transforming its Red Sea coast into a top destination for wealthy tourists, competing with the likes of the Maldives.
RSG sources said dozens of staff will lose their jobs when work stops at year's end. Dozens more are being transferred to the Diriyah and Qiddiya giga-projects in Riyadh, according to sources at those projects.
A senior employee at a project management company affiliated with the Public Investment Fund, which backs the giga-projects, said the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is "re-evaluating the whole Red Sea project."
"No more construction is approved. They are holding work on Phase Two and treating Phase One as 'proof of concept'," the source said.
RSG did not reveal occupancy rates at the 10 resorts completed so far. However, one consultant said they were "mostly sitting empty".
"The lack of alcohol played a role,m but it wasn't the main factor," the consultant said.
"High pricing and the enormous scale of the projects was a problem. They massively overestimated how many people would pay these prices."
Problems have been seen with other giga-projects. In Riyadh, work has halted on Mukaab, a cuboid skyscraper 400 meters (1,300 feet) high and wide, an architect on the project told AFP.
"From the very start, this project was unrealistic. It was just a fantasy," he said.
Neom has also pulled out of hosting the 2029 Asian Winter Games at Trojena, its under-construction ski resort, after reported problems in building it.
However, RSG said it was in "strong operational and commercial shape". The company hired more than 3,000 people in 2025, including over 900 in the last four months of the year, it said.

Rain or shine, Jerusalem’s new indoor tennis courts are a game changer

There was no better time to check out the new indoor tennis courts at Jerusalem’s Tennis and Education Center than on a rainy Wednesday afternoon.
The 14 wet outdoor courts and the padel court didn’t look very happy on this rainy day. In contrast, the indoor courts were bustling with happy children who were doing drills and playing games with their coaches.
I would have never even known about this gym had a fellow passenger in the elevator of a Jerusalem hotel, who thought I looked like his tennis coach, not mentioned it to me!
I ventured to the somewhat hard-to-get-to tennis center on that rainy day right after the school day ended, when the buses were painfully slow.
I hadn’t been back to the Jerusalem Tennis Center in the Katamon Tet neighborhood – founded in 1981 – since I spent a year of college here in 1986-1987.
What a difference 40 years makes!
The Jerusalem center is located near many buildings and complexes, such as Teddy Stadium, the Arena, and the Malha Mall, which did not exist in the mid-1980s.
To get to the new Stuart Weitzman Tennis Complex from the bus stop near Malha, I had to walk around and through the massive light rail station construction site – very much a work in progress.
When I finally found my way in, through a side entrance, what I discovered was very impressive: 18 illuminated tennis courts, a 2,000-seat stadium, a spectator gallery, a multi-purpose room, a fitness room, a practice wall, dressing rooms, offices, a sporting goods store, and a snack bar.
Beautiful gardens and plaques paying tribute to the many donors who made this fabulous complex possible were also very visible.
The four new courts at the Stuart Weitzman Tennis Complex bring the total number of indoor courts in the country to under 10. Indoor courts (like clay courts) in Israel are, simply stated, not a thing.
However, given the country’s extreme summer heat and the occasional winter rain, indoor courts make sense.
According to Dani Mizrahi, who has been manager of the tennis center for two years, indoor courts in Israel exist only in Haifa and Kiryat Shmona. In contrast to the courts in the complex, he said, “Those are under a balloon!”
Mizrahi is pleased that these courts are not fully enclosed (they have slatted facades), so they provide ventilation. However, by not being fully enclosed, they let rain come in, to which Mizrahi offered, “We are working on solutions.”
Sports facility is multipurpose
The two-story sports facility features six tennis courts on the upper level, four of which are covered. The ground floor is dedicated to other sports and provides various spaces such as a gym, four squash courts, judo facilities, and sports accommodations.
It also houses a wide range of supporting amenities, such as sports clinics and multipurpose spaces for athletes.
In addition to tennis, and very much in line with the mission of ITEC – the Israel Tennis and Education Centers, which are located in 25 centers and satellite locations throughout Israel – the Jerusalem center operates programs for children at risk, those with developmental disabilities, and Ethiopian immigrants from local absorption centers.
It also offers the Living Together Program, a national effort to bring Arab and Jewish children together through the medium of sports and informal education. And the center operates the Twinned Kindergarten Program that brings together classes of Arab and Jewish children aged four to six years and their teachers to participate in weekly motor skill development games and activities.

Former Shin Bet chiefs, officials call out Netanyahu, Zini for 'conspiracies against Ronen Bar'

Several retired Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) chiefs and 31 former department heads issued a public letter on Friday opposing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's comments about former Shin Bet head Ronen Bar and calling out "the silence from the current Shin Bet chief, David Zini."
"We express astonishment at the silence of the head of the Shin Bet, David Zini, in light of the unprecedented slander against former head of the service, Ronen Bar, and managers, fighters, and employees who served in the organization on 7/10, from the Prime Minister's entourage and members of the coalition," the letter read.
They also demanded a "strong response from Zini" against the comments attacking Ronen Bar, intelligence officials, soldiers, and Shin Bet employees who served in the organization before and during the October 7 massacre.
"With his actions and behavior, the Prime Minister is harming the entire security establishment and, in particular, the General Security Service - this is despicable and vile behavior," they added.
The letter mainly cited the "spread of conspiracy theories" against Shin Bet officials and the document that Netanyahu submitted to the State Comptroller.
Netanyahu's pre-October 7 intel documents
Netanyahu's office published a selection of intelligence documents, which aimed to shed light on Israel's strategic blindness leading up to the October 7 massacre, some of which were also read aloud during the Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee meeting.
The documents, spanning from February 2023 to an hour before the attack, indicate that Israel's defense echelon misread Hamas’s intentions, characterizing the terror group as deterred and seeking long-term economic arrangements.
He reportedly said during the Knesset discussion that the events of October 7 “were a severe intelligence failure, but not a betrayal.” The meeting sparked outrage among opposition MKs on the panel who left the discussion early. It went on for approximately five hours.
Among the quotes Netanyahu reportedly read were those from former prime minister Naftali Bennett. party leader and ex-IDF chief of staff Gadi Eisenkot, and former Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) director Ronen Bar.
The Knesset confirmed that Netanyahu dedicated a significant portion of the discussion to the state comptroller’s review regarding October 7, and presented the committee with materials he had shown to the comptroller.

Ukraine's Zelensky meets Iran's Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi in Munich, demands end to dictatorships

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Iran's opposition leader Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi on Friday during a trip to Munich, Germany.
"Ukraine supports the Iranian people as they are fighting for their future; we also express our sympathy to all the victims of the Iranian regime," Zelensky said in a statement.
"During our conversation, we focused on the situation in Iran and the areas where the Iranian people need support. We discussed the importance of strengthening sanctions against the Iranian regime and any other dictatorial regimes," he disclosed.
Pahlavi has been a central figure in the current round of anti-regime protests in Iran, which began at the end of December, pushing for regime change and the establishment of a democratic government.
Zelensky points out Russia-Iran cooperation
In his statement, Zelensky also called out the Russian-Iranian cooperation agreements, which include the exchange of resources and the development of military equipment.
"We condemned the cooperation between Russia and Iran, in particular the supply of 'shaheds' [drones] by the Iranian regime to Russia and the granting of licenses for their production," Zelensky wrote.
The Russian army has been using the Iranian drones for the last couple of years, with the most recent models being developed in Russia instead of Iran.
The Iranians have also been developing weapons with Russia's help, with their existing ballistic missile arsenal being recently increased amid the threat of a potential US or Israeli strike, foreign reports have said.
Among other systems, Tehran possesses a missile series with ranges of about 2,000 kilometers that place all of Israel within reach, as well as a missile that carries an especially heavy warhead and is considered among the most accurate in Iran’s arsenal.
Since Operation Rising Lion, Iran has been working intensively to rehabilitate its ballistic missile arsenal on several fronts to ensure its capabilities in a future confrontation.

Ukraine’s Heraskevych has appeal for Winter Olympic reinstatement dismissed
Ukraine’s Vladyslav Heraskevych had his appeal dismissed as images on his helmet breached an Olympic ‘sacred principle’.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday dismissed an appeal by Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych to be reinstated in the Milano Cortina Olympics after he was disqualified over his “helmet of remembrance”.
The 27-year-old was removed from the Olympic programme on Thursday when the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation jury ruled that imagery on the helmet — depicting athletes killed since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 — breached rules on political neutrality.

“The CAS ad Hoc division dismissed the application and found that freedom of expression is guaranteed at the Olympic Games but not on the field of play which is a sacred principle,” CAS Secretary-General Matthieu Reeb said, reading from a statement following an eight-hour hearing.
Heraskevych, who was seeking reinstatement or at least a CAS-supervised run, pending a decision by sport’s highest court in advance of the final two runs set for Friday evening, said he would look at his legal options now.
“CAS has failed us. We will consider our next steps,” Heraskevych told Reuters.
The case has dominated headlines in the first week of the Olympics, with the International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry meeting the athlete on Thursday morning at the sliding venue in Cortina d’Ampezzo in a last-minute attempt to broker a compromise and have him race without the specific helmet.
The IOC instead offered that he wear a black armband and display the helmet before and after the race, but said using the helmet in competition breached its rules on political protests and slogans in the field of play.
In a statement, CAS said the IOC guidelines for athletes’ expression in the Games were fair.
“The Sole Arbitrator found these limitations reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness,” CAS said.
“The Sole Arbitrator considers these Guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes’ interests to express their views, and athletes’ interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.”
Ukraine’s Olympic Committee has backed their athlete, who is also the team’s flagbearer for the Games and also displayed a “No War in Ukraine” sign at the Beijing 2022 Olympics, days before Russia’s invasion. Heraskevych has also received support from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
CAS was established in 1984 by the International Olympic Committee as an independent judicial authority to settle sports disputes worldwide.
The case has dominated headlines in the first week of the Olympics.
Before the ruling, Heraskevych accused the Milano-Cortina Games as acting as “propaganda” for Russia.

UK set to increase spending on long-range missiles
United Kingdom

The UK will spend more than £400 million this financial year on long-range precision and hypersonic weapons, as the government moves to scale up joint missile development programmes with key European allies.
In a statement issued on 13 February, the Ministry of Defence said the investment will support a range of collaborative projects with France, Germany, and Italy, with a focus on developing next-generation deep strike weapons intended to strengthen NATO deterrence and improve the UK’s ability to engage high-value targets at range.
Central to the effort is the Stratus programme, a joint UK-France-Italy initiative intended to develop a stealthy replacement for the Storm Shadow missile. According to the MOD, the project is working on both stealth and high-speed missile variants and already sustains more than 1,300 high-skilled jobs in the UK. The MOD said the missiles under development are intended to defeat high-value targets, strike enemy warships, and suppress hostile air defence systems.
Alongside this, the government said work is also progressing on a long-range strike programme with Germany, with a new joint study phase expected to begin shortly. This effort is linked to the Trinity House Agreement, signed in 2024, which established a framework for closer UK-German defence cooperation. The future weapon system, described as “Deep Precision Strike”, is expected to have a range exceeding 2,000 km and is planned to enter service in the 2030s. The MOD described it as likely to be among the most advanced weapons systems ever designed by the UK.
Defence Secretary John Healey said the new spending reflects the lessons of Ukraine and the need to strengthen allied capability in the face of rising threats. “To meet this new era of rising threats, we need hard power, strong alliances and sure diplomacy.” He added: “We can see from the war in Ukraine the decisive impact of long-range precision weapons, so the UK is stepping up, investing more than £400 million for long-range and hypersonic weapons this year.”
Healey said the UK’s cooperation with Germany, France and Italy would help deliver advanced new capabilities for NATO. “Alongside Germany, France and Italy, we will deliver the cutting-edge weapons that will keep the UK and NATO safe, boost deterrence, and build a new deal for European security.”
The MOD said hypersonics funding will cover critical technology development, ground and flight testing, and support for academic training, including postgraduate study.
The announcement comes ahead of the Munich Security Conference, where Healey is expected to hold discussions with European and international partners on long-range weapons programmes, industrial cooperation, and continued support for Ukraine.

Egypt targets dissidents abroad, punishes families at home: report
Cairo is increasingly using transnational repression to target political dissidents and activists abroad, while also persecuting their families inside Egypt, a new report published by the Egyptian Human Rights Forum on Wednesday warned.
The report draws on primary and secondary data collected between January 2022 and September 2025, as well as surveys and testimonies from 34 Egyptian dissidents living across multiple countries. It sheds new light on how Egyptian authorities are tightening their grip on critics beyond the country’s borders.
EHRF documented systematic violations, including the denial of passports and identity documents, revocation of citizenship, prosecutions in absentia based on fabricated charges, placement on terrorism lists, cyber harassment, digital surveillance, hacking, and coordinated smear campaigns.
Almost two-thirds of those surveyed had been denied passports, identity papers, or basic consular services, the group said, leaving many in precarious legal situations in their host countries. This reflects a recurring and deliberate pattern rather than isolated incidents, the report added.
Around 72 percent of respondents said their relatives in Egypt had been subjected to police summonses, home raids, or travel bans in retaliation for their activism abroad.
Nearly half of those surveyed reported receiving direct threats via phone calls or messages, or being prosecuted in absentia.
Abdelrahman Ayyash, the lead researcher for the rights group, told The New Arab: "The regime has realised that they don't need to physically arrest a dissident in Europe or the U.S to silence them by putting them on a terror list, denying them a passport, or arresting their family members back home, they can create an open-air prison for activists anywhere in the world.
"And when an authoritarian regime uses international policing tools like Interpol diffusions to silence human rights defenders and journalists with European passports and residencies, it isn't just an Egyptian human rights issue, it is a direct violation of the host countries' sovereignty."
The report also highlights a growing trend of countries allied with Cairo arresting or deporting Egyptian activists despite being aware they could face persecution. EHRF named Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE among the states accused of cooperating with Egypt in such cases.
According to the report, the repression is carried out by several Egyptian state bodies, primarily the Security Agency and the General Intelligence Directorate, which it says work closely with the foreign ministry to "exploit diplomatic missions as tools of pressure against Egyptians abroad".
"Diplomatic missions have been weaponised and used as organs of intimidation, while smear campaigns and online trolling have escalated, targeting families inside Egypt to silence voices abroad," the report said. "This is not a series of isolated incidents, but a deliberate strategy to suppress dissent wherever it may be found."
EHRF said the targeting of activists has left some individuals stranded without citizenship or valid travel documents, placing their legal residency at risk. Others live in constant fear of surveillance or physical attack.
The rights group said Egypt’s actions violate its obligations under international human rights law, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention Against Torture, and the 1951 Refugee Convention.
A growing concern, the report added, is that law enforcement authorities in host countries often fail to recognise these cases as transnational repression, instead treating them as personal disputes or isolated incidents of harassment.
One case cited is that of Germany-based Egyptian journalist Basma Mostafa, whose situation has been documented by the UN. While the threat she faces has been acknowledged, EHRF said, institutional responses have failed to keep pace with the level of risk.
Kuwait was singled out as the country that has allegedly worked most openly with Egypt on the issue.
"In June 2023, Kuwait showed the same cooperation in the case of engineer Sayyed al-Shuwayhi, an Egyptian-Turkish dissident residing in Istanbul," the report said.
It said that similar cooperation was seen in June 2023, when Kuwait deported engineer Sayyed al Shuwayhi, an Egyptian-Turkish dissident who had been residing in Istanbul.
Turkey, which has long served as a refuge for Egyptian exiles, was also criticised for tightening residency and work permit procedures for some activists, particularly those with political or media profiles, creating what the report described as a climate of fear and uncertainty.
EHRF further accused Egyptian authorities of misusing Interpol by issuing Red Notices against dissidents based on politically motivated charges.
The report calls on the Egyptian government to end its intimidation practices, halt violations of international law, and stop punitive consular measures that deny citizens passports or basic documentation. It also urges other states to guarantee the safety of Egyptian activists and to review cooperation with Cairo that could expose individuals to persecution.

Restaurant diners left hangry after Costco gift card vendor goes bankrupt
‘We fully recognize and sincerely regret the impact this decision has had on our cardholders and the many local restaurants,’ the company said

The bankruptcy of a gift card vendor in six states has left consumers hungry for redemption.
San Diego-based Synergy World announced on its website that it was shutting down its restaurant gift card program due to bankruptcy. The company, which had been in business for 19 years, offered gift cards through Costco. Restaurants in its network were located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas, according to its website.
“It is with a heavy heart that Synergy World has made the difficult decision to discontinue the Synergy Restaurant Gift Card Program,” the company said in an announcement on its website. “We fully recognize and sincerely regret the impact this decision has had on our cardholders and the many local restaurants.”
The Independent reached out to Synergy World and Costco for comment but did not receive a response.
Synergy World gave its restaurant gift card customers until January 31 to redeem their cards, but the rush of cardholders trying to use their balances before the deadline led the company to discontinue the program before the deadline arrived, according to a statement.
San Diego restaurant owner Joey Busalacci tried to redeem as many Synergy cards as he could before the deadline, but he told San Diego-based KUSI News that the company eventually stopped communicating with vendors and the cards no longer worked.
The decision to shut down operations led to confusion and urgency among customers, some of whom took to social media to find a solution.
Facebook group Albuquerque Foodies posted on January 30 that “Synergy gift cards are no more.” Several commenters noted that Costco was offering store credit or refunds for those with receipts, while others said at least one restaurant in the area was swapping the Synergy gift cards with the restaurant’s own gift cards.
Participants in a Costco subreddit on Reddit offered a flurry of responses to post alerting users to the Synergy shutdown. Several commenters confirmed that Costco was offering refunds on unused Synergy gift cards.
Synergy’s systems were slow in the final days of operation, alleged one commenter who said they returned 12 Synergy gift cards to a Costco on January 29. The Costco customer service associate handling the return had to verify over the phone that each of the 12 cards was unused and, allegedly, had to repeat some card numbers multiple times to get verification.

Review and forecast of hryvnia exchange rate against key currencies by KYT Group analysts
Issue No. 1 – February 2026
The purpose of this review is to provide an analysis of the current situation on the Ukrainian currency market and a forecast of the hryvnia exchange rate against key currencies based on current data. We consider the current conditions, market dynamics, key influencing factors, and likely scenarios.
Analysis of the current situation on the currency market
International context
After the Fed left its key rate unchanged at the end of January, the number of forecasts for the rate to remain at its current level for the next few months increased in the US. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that non-farm payrolls in the US rose by 130,000 in January, while the unemployment rate fell from 4.4% to 4.3%. This indicates that interest rates are likely to remain unchanged, because if the labor market is improving, there are no fears of a market slowdown, which was a major reason for the Fed's rate cuts last year.
Recall that at the end of January, the Fed Committee left the central bank's base interest rate in the range of 3.50-3.75% after lowering it at each of the last three meetings in 2025. Moreover, the higher-than-expected job growth in January may give the Fed confidence in the stabilization of the labor market and motivate the central bank to focus on controlling inflation, which remains above the Fed's 2% target. The US consumer price index rose 0.3% month-on-month and 2.7% year-on-year in December last year, which is stable compared to November 2025.
As for the economy, US GDP grew by 4.4% year-on-year in the third quarter, and this pace is expected to slow slightly during 2026, but still exceed 2%. Some economists believe that the next Fed rate cut is likely to occur no earlier than mid-June 2026. However, everything will depend on labor market indicators and inflation rates in the US. Interestingly, according to media reports, in his five speeches on the economy since December, Donald Trump has claimed that inflation has been overcome and prices have fallen almost 30 times, which, of course, contradicts the actual economic data.
As for the EUR/USD pair, during the first half of February, the dollar managed to strengthen slightly compared to January, reaching 1.1874. This was facilitated by both the Fed's decision to leave the rate unchanged and the optimistic US labor market indicators and investors' hopes that inflation would not exceed the forecast for this year. However, there is no certainty about the Fed's future policy, and some analysts have already suggested that the Fed may start cutting rates more aggressively, causing the dollar to fall by 10% during 2026. Among the risk factors that will affect the dollar is the change in the Fed's leadership, as many believe that the successor to current Chairman Jerome Powell will face pressure from President Donald Trump to lower borrowing costs, leading to several rate cuts in 2026.
Meanwhile, in Europe, the ECB is keeping key rates unchanged, and most economists say the central bank will stick to this policy throughout 2026. The fact is that inflation in the eurozone is considered to be under control, although there are risks of a decline amid the strengthening of the euro. With interest rates already low at 2% and inflation hovering around the ECB's target of 2%, the ECB is in no hurry to change its monetary policy. The strong euro is not particularly welcome news for Europeans, as it makes imports cheaper for buyers in the eurozone, which affects inflation, and further strengthening of the euro could potentially require changes in interest rates. However, the EU is currently stable, and the economy is performing even better than expected: GDP in the fourth quarter of 2025 grew by 0.3% compared to the previous quarter, exceeding Bloomberg's consensus forecast by 0.2%.
Internal Ukrainian context
In the first half of February, there was no stress on the Ukrainian currency market, and the hryvnia depreciated insignificantly against the US dollar: at the beginning of the month, the official exchange rate was 42.84 UAH/USD, and at the end of the second week of February, it was 43.03 UAH/USD. The slow fluctuation was traditionally facilitated by NBU interventions: since the beginning of January, according to official NBU data, the regulator has injected more than $4.33 billion into the market.
Inflation rates in Ukraine are declining. The NBU forecasts that inflation will be 7.5% at the end of 2026 and will remain close to the 5% target in the future, reaching it in 2028. The economy will grow by 1.8% in 2026, and in the following years, the recovery will accelerate to 3-4% per year. National Bank experts believe that inflation will decline in the coming months, primarily due to the residual effects of crop growth in 2025. At the same time, the consequences of large-scale destruction in the energy sector will put pressure on prices through both market and administrative mechanisms.
The NBU's Inflation Report for January 2026 states that international aid will be sufficient to finance the budget deficit without resorting to debt issuance. The NBU has left its assumption regarding the budget deficit in 2026 unchanged at around 19% of GDP, which is in line with the State Budget Law. The NBU assumes that Ukraine will receive $51.4 billion from international partners in 2026, $42.7 billion in 2027, and $21.6 billion in 2028. This will allow international reserves to be maintained at a sufficient level to support the stability of the currency market. The main hopes for supporting the state budget this year are linked to the EU Council's decision to allocate €90 billion to Ukraine in 2026 and 2027, as well as the current ERA Loans mechanism.
As of early February, Ukraine's international reserves had grown to $57.66 billion. According to the National Bank, in January, they increased by $357.8 million compared to December, primarily due to external financing, which offset the National Bank's net currency sales and the country's debt payments in foreign currency. The current volume of international reserves provides financing for six months of future imports.
US dollar exchange rate: dynamics and analysis
General characteristics of market behavior
During the first half of February, the US dollar strengthened on the Ukrainian currency market. At the beginning of the month, the interbank exchange rate was 42.9 UAH/USD, and on February 12, it was already at 43.05 UAH/USD.
On the cash market, there were slight devaluation fluctuations between February 1 and 13, and the purchase rate in mid-February reached a range of 42.59–42.85 UAH/USD, while the sale rate remained within the range of 43.15–43.4 UAH/USD. Meanwhile, at bank cash desks and exchange offices, the spread between the buying and selling rates changed only slightly compared to January, amounting to 0.5–0.6 UAH/USD.
Key influencing factors
· International context. The dollar began to strengthen against the euro due to growing investor optimism about inflation and the apparent trend toward improvement in the labor market, which promises predictable Fed policy and no sharp changes in rates in the near future.
· International reserves are at a high level: as of early February 2026, they reached USD 57.66 billion.
· The National Bank supports the currency market with regular interventions: the interbank exchange rate is gradually weakening without any sharp movements, and since the beginning of the year, the NBU has injected more than $4.33 billion into the market.
Forecast
· Short term (1–2 weeks): base range of 43.3–43.8 UAH/USD with possible fluctuations towards a weaker hryvnia.
· Medium term (2–3 months): 43.50–44.60 UAH/USD. The dollar is expected to gradually strengthen on the international market due to the stabilization of the labor market and decent macroeconomic data, as well as the absence of sharp changes in the Fed's policy on the base rate. In Ukraine, the hryvnia exchange rate will be influenced by the level of demand for currency on the interbank market, which may increase in February–March, in particular due to another series of massive enemy attacks on energy facilities, which will lead to the need to purchase expensive imported equipment. The exchange rate will also be influenced by the situation on the front lines and political statements and forecasts regarding the possible end of the full-scale war.
· Long term (6+ months): A gradual devaluation of the hryvnia against the dollar is expected, as well as regular and large-scale support for the market through currency interventions by the NBU. The benchmark for the first half of 2026 is 43.5–44.95 UAH/$.
Euro exchange rate: dynamics and analysis
General characteristics of market behavior
During the first half of February, the euro fluctuated on the Ukrainian market: initially, the hryvnia strengthened against the euro, and the official euro exchange rate at the beginning of February was 51.24 UAH/EUR, and five days later it was already 50.89 UAH/EUR. However, in the middle of the month, the euro began to strengthen and reached 51.20 UAH/EUR. In the cash segment, the euro also fell in January. While at the beginning of February, the euro purchase rate in banks and exchange offices was 51 UAH/EUR, and the sale rate was 51.95 UAH/EUR, in mid-February, the purchase rate was 50.8 UAH/EUR, and the sale rate was 51.45 UAH/EUR.
Key observations
· Exchange rate geometry: The selling rate for cash euros in mid-February 2026 is at the level of 51.29–51.50 UAH/EUR.
The dynamics of the euro exchange rate were influenced by the strengthening of the dollar on the international market, as well as the narrowing of the spread between the buying and selling rates to 0.2–04 UAH/EUR.
· Supply and demand: Demand for the euro fell slightly on the interbank market in February 2026, and demand for the euro also declined on the cash market in Ukraine. Between February 10 and 12 alone, the euro exchange rate on the interbank market fell from 51.37 UAH/EUR to 51.03 UAH/EUR.
Key influencing factors
· Global context: The euro is falling against the US dollar, which is strengthening in February amid optimistic forecasts for the development of the US economy.
· Domestic market: the euro continues to follow the dollar in strengthening, but the pace of the euro's strengthening is currently quite limited, which is explained, in particular, by the relatively low level of demand.
· Behavioral factor: in Ukraine, there is no rush demand for the euro in mid-February, and spreads between exchange rates are steadily narrowing. However, everything may change if the recent massive shelling of energy infrastructure leads to an increase in the need to purchase equipment in the EU for euros, which will play on the growth in demand and, accordingly, lead to new exchange rate jumps.
Forecast
· Short term (1–2 weeks): the euro on the interbank market will remain in the range of 51.2–51.8 UAH/€ with a tendency to move towards the upper limit.
· Medium term (2–3 months): No significant strengthening of the dollar is expected on the international market, so the euro will remain strong. In Ukraine, the euro exchange rate will be influenced by demand for the euro due to the need to import from the EU, but relatively low demand on the cash market will not allow the euro exchange rate to deviate significantly from the interbank market.
The exchange rate benchmark is 51.6–54.5 UAH/EUR.
· Long term (6+ months): the euro may rise to 54.8–56.5 UAH/EUR in the first half of 2026.
Recommendations: dollar or euro — buy, sell, or wait?
USD/UAH
The dollar is strengthening on the international market thanks to optimistic expectations and updated data on the labor market and inflation, which showed stable development of the US economy and a reduction in risks. However, “black swans” in the form of a change in the Fed's leadership and further pressure from Donald Trump on the central bank to implement a significant reduction in rates during 2026 cannot be ruled out.
Overall, the dollar looks quite vulnerable, given the unpredictability of President Trump's policies and possible new tariff surprises from the US. However, positive sentiment prevails for now, which is reflected in the value of defensive assets.
In Ukraine, the hryvnia is under strong pressure from increased demand for foreign currency, and economic risks associated with the war, destroyed energy infrastructure, and the lack of even partial predictability of further developments in the hostilities do not give the national currency much room for strengthening. Building up savings in dollars will remain the basis for investors throughout 2026 as part of both medium- and long-term strategies. The expected weakening of the hryvnia exchange rate only adds to the appeal of accumulating dollars. Speculative income can be obtained both from fluctuations in the hryvnia against the dollar and from frequent and irregular fluctuations in the euro exchange rate.
EUR/UAH
The euro has been losing ground in recent weeks, but this is not a signal to exit euro savings, as the main forecasts for 2026 are still linked to the strengthening of the euro, although significant fluctuations cannot be ruled out. It is precisely these fluctuations that will allow investors to profitably enter into investments in euros and also exit them with a profit, especially when it comes to a medium-term strategy. The liquidity of the euro will remain high thanks to the stable development of the eurozone economy and the ECB's predictable conservative strategy.
Overall strategy
The Federal Reserve is not currently planning any changes to the base rate, which was left unchanged at the last meeting at the end of January.
Optimistic sentiments about the active development of the US economy are motivating investors to return to dollar assets, and the dollar's exchange rate against the euro is gradually strengthening. However, the temporary stability is fragile, and further fluctuations in the other direction are possible in the near future. Unlike the US, the EU economy is moving slowly but surely towards growth, and inflation in the eurozone is more controlled and predictable. All this gives reason to expect uneven and multidirectional fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate in the coming months.
Ukraine has accumulated a large amount of international reserves, sufficient for six months of imports, and has planned amounts of aid from partner countries, which are positive factors that may somewhat curb the devaluation trend. However, in the long term, the hryvnia will weaken in 2026 due to the ongoing war of attrition, problems with the state budget deficit, and negative investor expectations regarding the economic situation. Nevertheless, the pace of devaluation will be controlled by the NBU, which will remain the main player in the currency market. The NBU will carry out currency interventions to the extent necessary to satisfy demand and prevent sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate. In this situation, investors should focus on their own currency strategies, planning to buy dollars and euros in a timely manner, which will be the base currencies of their portfolios and will allow them to carry out profitable currency exchange transactions at any convenient time.

A US shipment of medicines and medical supplies to Venezuela signals a new era of cooperation
The United States has sent a shipment of medicines and medical supplies to Venezuela, reflecting what many say is a new spirit of cooperation between the two countries
- Bookmark
A shipment from the United States of medicines and medical supplies arrived in Venezuela on Friday, reflecting the new spirit of cooperation between the two countries following the stunning capture last month of then-President Nicolás Maduro.
Laura Dogu, the U.S. top diplomat in the South American country, and Venezuelan diplomat Félix Plasencia, received the shipment containing 6 metric tons of medications at the airport outside Venezuela's capital, Caracas.
“It’s very important to stabilize the health system here in Venezuela,” Dogu told reporters at the airport in Maiquetía. She added that the shipment was “the first of many donations” that will arrive “in the coming days.”
Venezuela's complex crisis, which began more than a decade ago, led to the collapse of the country's public health care system. Hospitals are so poorly equipped that patients are asked to provide supplies needed for their care, from syringes to surgical screws.
Plasencia described the donation as a "message of cooperation among two sovereign countries.
"We’re doing the best for our people," he said.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The average maximal interest rate on ruble deposits with the ten Russian credit institutions having the maximal amount of private deposits declined to 14.49% per annum in early February 2025, the Central Bank of Russia said.
The rate was at the level of 14.88% per annum in the second ten-day period of January 2026 and 14.57% per annum in late January.
Deposit interest rates are monitored by the regulator in Sberbank, Sovcombank, VTB, Gazprombank, the Credit Bank of Moscow, Alfa-Bank, T-Bank, Promsvyazbank, Bank DOM.RF, and the Russian Agricultural Bank.
The regulator said earlier that it would keep an eye on cases when the bank’s interest rate for ruble deposits is more than 2 percentage points higher than the average one for ten monitored banks. The decision taken by the Central Bank is aimed at reducing the interest risk for banks arising when attracting retail deposits at rates above the market ones and contributes to financial stability of credit institutions, the regulator said.

Boots launches first high street service for weight loss jabs
Until now, almost all weight-loss prescriptions by Boots were issued after an online consultation, rather than face-to-face
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Weight-loss jab users will now be able to pop into Boots for their prescriptions on their lunch break after the high street pharmacy launched an in-store service.
The pilot scheme, which started this week, saw drugs including Wegovy and Mounjaro being prescribed to customers in 17 stores across Britain.
About 1.6million adults in the UK use weight-loss drugs. The medication – which works by mimicking the natural hormone that regulates blood sugar, appetite and digestion – can’t be bought over the counter and must be prescribed by a qualified healthcare professional, such as a GP or pharmacist, following a consultation.
Until now, almost all weight-loss prescriptions by Boots were issued after an online consultation, rather than face-to-face. But this new scheme will see patients have a consultation in a private room where their medical history will be taken, and weight and height measured, to determine if they are eligible.
Jamie Kerruish, chief healthcare officer at Boots, believes the scheme will make it more convenient for customers to access weight-loss jabs, because people can “pop into a store on their lunch break or after work,” The Times reported.
The move to in-store consultations follows safety concerns that people are lying about their weight or submitting fake photos to obtain the injections from some online pharmacies.
Weight-loss injections, also known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, are a prescribed drug and to access them on the NHS a patient needs to have a BMI of 40 or more, but private providers offer them to those with a BMI over 30. As a result the demand for weight-loss jabs from private pharmacies has soared.
Boots has been selling Wegovy, manufactured by Novo Nordisk, for three years. It also sells Mounjaro, which is offered on the NHS.
Prices start at £99.97 for the lowest dose of Wegovy and £176.97 for the lowest dose of Mounjaro. The in-store service will offer access to the same treatment as the Boots Online Doctor service, and at the same price.
“We know that people have different preferences for how they access healthcare services – some seeking online support and some wanting in-person conversations with their local practitioner,” Mr Kerruish said.
“The launch of our in-store weight-loss treatment service alongside our digital offer delivered through Boots Online Doctor means we can now deliver convenient care to people both online or in person,” he added.
Mr Kerruish explained the service is for anyone whose lives are affected by obesity and in addition to offering weight-loss jabs, they also provide support to help people make lifestyle and behavioural changes.
Here is a list of Boots stores offering the weight-loss drug service:
- Nottingham, Victoria Centre, Nottinghamshire
- Cardiff, Queen Street, Wales
- Durham, Market Place, County Durham
- Belfast, Donegal Place, Northern Ireland
- Edinburgh, Princes Street, Scotland
- Newcastle, Sidgate, Tyne and Wear
- St Albans, St Peters Street, Hertfordshire
- London, Liverpool Steet Station
- Leicester, Fosse Park, Leicestershire
- Brighton, North Street, East Sussex
- London, Piccadilly Circus
- Dartford, Blue Water, Kent
- Altrincham, Stamford Quarter, Trafford, Greater Manchester
- Chester-Le-Street, County Durham
- Middlesborough, Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire

Nuclear treaty that kept world peace just expired: What happens now?
Unknown

Washington DC — A cornerstone of global nuclear restraint has quietly fallen away.
With the expiry of the New START treaty earlier this month, the United States and Russia have entered unfamiliar territory, with no binding caps, no verified limits, and rising uncertainty over how the world’s two largest nuclear powers will manage their arsenals in the years ahead.
Noted political analyst Dr Stephen J. Farnsworth, Professor of Political Science at the University of Mary Washington, told TRT World, “The expiration of the treaty may lead to a dangerous and expensive expansion of the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the US.”
The New START treaty, signed in 2010 by Presidents Barack Obama and Russia’s Dmitry Medvedev, capped each side at 1,550 deployed strategic nuclear warheads on up to 700 delivery systems, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched missiles, and heavy bombers.
It included mechanisms for on-site inspections, regular data exchanges, and notifications that increased transparency and reduced the risk of deadly miscalculation.
These measures helped stabilise US-Russia relations after the Cold War, when earlier pacts like START I began reducing vast stockpiles.
The treaty entered into force in 2011 and was extended in 2021 for five years, running until February 5, 2026. Inspections halted during the COVID-19 pandemic and never resumed.
Voluntary limits continue
Russia suspended participation in 2023 amid tensions over Ukraine, though it said it would respect the numerical caps until expiration.
With the pact now lapsed, the US and Russia, which together hold nearly 90 percent of global nuclear warheads, more than 10,500 combined, face no binding restraints on deployments or modernisation.
China adds further complexity. Its arsenal, estimated at around 600 warheads, is growing by roughly 100 annually and could exceed 1,000 by 2030.
The expiration follows failed diplomacy.
In 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin offered to voluntarily observe New START limits for another year if the US reciprocated, warning that a lapse could destabilise global security and spur proliferation.
US President Donald Trump rejected the proposal, calling New START a “badly negotiated deal” and insisting on a “new, improved, and modernised” treaty that includes China.
Beijing has rejected that condition, citing its smaller arsenal and urging bilateral US-Russia talks instead.
Russia says it will continue to observe the limits set under the recently-expired New START nuclear arms reduction treaty if the US does the same, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday.
"We proceed from the fact that this moratorium, on our part, which was announced by our president, will remain in effect, but only as long as the United States does not exceed the aforementioned limits," Lavrov said, addressing the lower house of Russia's parliament.
Lavrov described personal relations between Putin and Trump as "excellent," saying that their "mutual sympathy and respect helped create the atmosphere that allowed them to reach understanding" on specific issues during their August summit in Anchorage, Alaska.
He emphasised that while the Kremlin hasn't yet launched a "strategic dialogue" with the Trump administration, "we are always open for such dialogue."
Wider ripple effects
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said last week that Russia would "retain its responsible, thorough approach to stability when it comes to nuclear weapons."
Even without treaty limits, both powers retain monitoring capabilities through satellites and intelligence systems. The absence of verified data sharing, however, raises the risk of misperception in an already low-trust climate.
A White House official told the US news network CBS News that Trump would decide the future course on nuclear arms control, adding he would clarify it "which he will clarify on his own timeline."
The end of New START closes a chapter that began with the 1972 SALT I agreement, when sustained dialogue gradually reduced arsenals from Cold War peaks.
Attention may now shift towards qualitative advances, more precise, survivable, or hypersonic systems, rather than sheer numbers.
Without renewed engagement among nuclear powers, experts fear a return to unchecked competition that could unsettle global stability for decades.
Farnsworth stressed the wider ripple effects, noting that “European nations and China, which were not part of the agreement, benefitted from the decades of reduced nuclear tensions between the US and Russia and before that the Soviet Union, when this treaty and others that existed earlier on were in place.”
He warned that “these nations may choose to expand their own nuclear arsenals in response to the greater international uncertainty that follows the end of the treaty.”

UAE harnesses AI to slash bureaucracy and speed up public services

The UAE is using AI to cut bureaucracy, speed up public services and test new technologies, presenting their work at the World Governments Summit in Dubai, which promoted global dialogue.
The United Arab Emirates has set out to be an innovator in implementing artificial intelligence and related new technologies to develop reforms in government services.
On the sidelines of the recent World Governments Summit in Dubai, where AI was one of the central focuses, Chief of Government Services of the United Arab Emirates Government Mohammed Bin Taliah, told Euronews that the global forum was a stage for governments to compare approaches to refining public services.
AI was the dominant theme across sessions on governance and digital transformation. Governments are increasingly using AI not only to automate workflows but to redesign how citizens interact with the state.
As reducing bureaucracy in public services has always been an objective for the UAE, the UAE government launched the zero-bureaucracy programme in 2023 as a practical attempt to remove unnecessary processes from public services.
“In 2023, the UAE launched the zero-bureaucracy program,” Bin Taliah said, adding that “this program is focused on eliminating bureaucracy and government procedures and processes in public services.”
From one week to 10 minutes
According to Bin Taliah, the programme's initial phase exceeded its targets.
Technology, particularly artificial intelligence, has played a growing role in enabling those changes, he said, allowing processes that once took days to be completed in minutes.
“With AI today, we have achieved improvement in services,” he said. “And in some cases, the services that take around one working week to be completed are now completed in less than 10 minutes.”
He said tools such as facial recognition and optical character recognition are now being used to automate processes that previously required multiple manual steps.
He pointed to everyday examples, such as airport processing, to illustrate how digital systems can reshape interactions between governments and the public.
“If you pass through Abu Dhabi or Dubai airport, you see that today our airports are queue-less,” he said. “Everything, you can pass through smart gates that use spatial biometrics, which allows you to pass through this.”
Bin Taliah told Euronews that the recent World Government Summit has grown into a convening platform for practical strategies to improve government services.
“The World Government Summit is a platform that brings everybody together in one place on a neutral platform to discuss how to make people's lives better, how to make governments more efficient, to serve people faster and deliver better value to citizens around the world," he said.
Not only innovate, accelerate
Meanwhile, UAE Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy and Remote Work Applications and Vice-Chair of the World Governments Summit Omar Sultan Al Olama told Euronews that the UAE want to deploy AI at record pace.
“Well, if the UAE has to be in the same conversation or in the sentence, I'll say the UAE innovates, but not just innovates, it accelerates,” he said. “We want to deploy AI the fastest.”
He said the country’s diversity and agile governance model enable it to serve as a testing ground for new technologies while remaining open to collaboration across geopolitical divides.
“We can work with east, west, north, and south,” he said. “To be a common place where everyone brings their best AI tools and deploys, and sees how they can compete with the others, but also collaborate with others.”
On the UAE’s wider diplomatic role, Al Olama said the country aims to act as a neutral convener amid increasingly fragmented global dialogue.
“The world requires a place where, whether it's adversaries, whether it is different geographies, to at least have dialog,” he said. “The UAE prides itself on being that, being a place where the world can convene.”
He pointed to past and continuing diplomatic efforts as evidence of that approach.
“All of these things are possible because the UAE does not choose sides,” he said. “We try to be in the middle. We try to work with everyone.”
'We don't preach'
Asked how the World Governments Summit can help navigate worldwide turbulence, Al Olama said sustained dialogue remains the only viable route forward.
“So, if we think about turbulence, the only way through turbulence is, especially when it comes to geopolitical turbulence, is increased dialogue, trying to find the commonalities between leaders, between countries, trying to understand where the pain points are, and finding the bridges to that gap.”
He said the scale of participation at the summit shows a global demand for such engagement.
“A platform like the World Governments Summit that brings together more than 45 heads of state and government, that brings hundreds of ministers, so we have around 600 ministers from around the world participating this year, and thousands of CEOs and international organisations and others, is a platform for dialogue.”
Al Olama added that the event is designed to expose governments to policy approaches and solutions from across the world, encouraging learning and adaptation rather than prescription.
“We don't preach,” he said. “We want to make sure that everyone's point of view is represented, that we have the best-in-class ways of solving problems, the best-in-class government opportunities that exist in every corner of the world presented at the World Governments Summit.”
AI, climate intervention, flying cars, and education reforms dominated discussions at the World Governments Summit 2026, where more than 45 heads of state and around 600 ministers, plus over 500 CEOs gathered in Dubai.

With Alvaro Arbeloa’s side still taking shape following the coach’s arrival in January, Alexander-Arnold has the chance to make himself a key part of the club’s battle for silverware.
Pellegrino Matarazzo’s in-form Real Sociedad visit the Santiago Bernabeu on Saturday in La Liga, in what promises to be an enticing clash.
Arbeloa’s Madrid are looking to move two points clear of Barcelona and take the lead in La Liga before the Catalans visit Girona on Monday.
Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at Saturday’s headline fixture in La Liga.
Will Alexander Arnold start for Real Madrid against Sociedad?
Former Liverpool full-back Alexander-Arnold, who came off the bench last weekend as Madrid beat Valencia, could potentially start for the first time since December 3.
After a decent early showing for Madrid at the Club World Cup last year, hamstring and thigh injuries have stopped him from settling in, limiting him to 12 appearances across all competitions this season.
“After [he’s had] a long time out, we will proceed with caution,” said Arbeloa after Alexander-Arnold’s return, with Spanish newspaper AS reporting Madrid’s aim is for him to start against Benfica in the Champions League playoff round on February 17.
Even if Arbeloa uses veteran Dani Carvajal or youngster David Jimenez to start against Real Sociedad, the expectation is for Alexander-Arnold to get more crucial minutes under his belt.
How are Real Sociedad faring in La Liga this season?
Real Sociedad are unbeaten in nine matches but are eighth in the table – 14 points off fourth place and the crucial UEFA Champions League qualification spots.
Matarazzo’s side did, however, defeat champions Barcelona last month and have one foot in the Copa del Rey final after a semifinal first leg win at rivals Athletic Bilbao this week.
Sociedad are also coming off a 1-0 win at Basque Country rival Athletic Bilbao in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semifinals.
Will Vinicius and Mbappe’s dinner give Madrid food for thought?
Real Madrid is counting on a team-bonding dinner reportedly paid for by its biggest stars to boost its late-season pursuit of the La Liga and Champions League trophies.
Vinicius Junior and Kylian Mbappe paid the bill at the restaurant in Madrid on Tuesday, midfielder Dani Ceballos told reporters. The tab ran in excess of 1,000 euros ($1,100), according to accounts by Spanish media.
Vinicius posted a photo of the entire squad during the dinner near the city centre in a fancy location that features an “Art Dining Club.”
Fans waited outside the restaurant to try to talk to the players after the dinner, which went well past midnight.
Coach Alvaro Arbeloa and his assistants were not part of the dinner, Spanish media said.
The show of unity came a week before Madrid faces Benfica in the first leg of the knockout playoffs of the Champions League. The team dropped out of the top eight that automatically qualified for the round of 16 after a 4-2 loss at the same as Benfica in the final round of the league phase.
Defender Raul Asencio told media that after the dinner, the team was “very united.”
Why has Real Madrid struggled this season?
Madrid went through turmoil at the end of last year, with some players reportedly not on the same page with coach Xabi Alonso.
Under Arbeloa, Madrid was eliminated by second-tier Albacete in the Copa del Rey round of 16, and lost to Benfica in the match that relegated the team to the Champions League’s knockout playoffs.
With the bad-tempered Bernabeu crowd on their own team’s backs in recent weeks, the chance to move top of the table could settle the natives.
How is the La Liga race shaping up for Real Madrid and Barcelona?
Madrid has won seven in a row to be one point behind leader Barcelona.
Barcelona will look to win its fourth in a row in the league against a Girona that was in 12th place and was winless in its last three matches.
Barcelona is coming off a resounding 4-0 loss to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey on Thursday, when it conceded all goals in a disastrous first half.
It had won 17 of its last 18 matches in all competitions before the defeat. The last setback had been losing 2-1 at Sociedad in the league last month.
Third-placed Atletico will face lowly Rayo Vallecano on Sunday, while fourth-placed Villarreal is at mid-table Getafe.
What happened the last time Real Madrid met Sociedad?
Los Blancos were 2-1 winners against Sociedad in September’s reverse fixture in La Liga.
Kylian Mbappe and Arda Guler scored either side of Dean Huijsen’s sending off in the first half.
Mikel Oyarzabal’s 56th-minute penalty offered the home side hope, but they were unable to further make the most of their numerical advantage.
Head-to-head
This is the 184th meeting between the teams, with Madrid winning on 103 occasions and Sociedad claiming the spoils in 38 of the contests.
The first fixture was played in April 1905, with Madrid winning the Copa del Rey meeting 3-0.
Real Madrid team news
Mbappe trained separately from the squad on Thursday because of a knee issue and became doubtful for Saturday’s game.
He had already been held to gym work on Wednesday. The club did not immediately give any details about his condition.
Vinicius was set to be back with Madrid after missing the previous league game because of a yellow card suspension, but Jude Bellingham will remain sidelined with a hamstring injury.
Predicted Real Madrid starting lineup (4-3-3)
Courtois; Alexander-Arnold, Asencio, Huijsen, Carreras; Valverde, Tchouameni, Camavinga; Brahim, Mbappe, Vinicius
Real Sociedad team news
Brais Mendez is suspended for the trip to Madrid, while Takefusa Kubo and Unai Marrero are both absent with hamstring and facial injuries, respectively.
Arsen Zakharyan, Ander Barrenetxea and Luka Sucic have slight niggles and face late fitness tests.

Saudi foreign minister says ‘dying in Gaza has not stopped,’ calls for reconstruction
Prince Faisal bin Farhan tells Munich Security Conference that ceasefire has failed to halt killings in Gaza, urging end to violence
ISTANBUL
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan called for an immediate halt to killings in Gaza and rebuilding the enclave, saying “dying in Gaza has not stopped” despite a ceasefire agreement with Israel.
Speaking Friday during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, the minister said the ceasefire had failed to end fatalities in Gaza, stressing the need to stop the violence and begin rebuilding the devastated territory.
Prince Faisal also emphasized the need to preserve the unity of Gaza and the West Bank, saying stability in Gaza is essential to that goal. He underscored the importance of addressing Palestinian rights, including the right to self-determination.
His remarks come amid heightened tensions in the West Bank, after Israel’s government approved measures on Sunday aimed at changing the legal and civil reality there, including expanding enforcement powers into areas designated as A and B.
An Oct. 10 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Munich is hosting the 62nd Munich Security Conference from Friday through Sunday under tight security, as diplomats describe the current period as the most turbulent since the end of the Cold War, marked by escalating conflicts and growing uncertainty over the future of the global order.

BEIRUT, February 13. /TASS/. A mechanized convoy of the Israeli army entered the Province of Al Quneitra in southern Syria to do a sweep of the area, the Al Mayadeen TV channel reported.
According to the broadcaster, Israeli armored vehicles raided the settlements of Ain Ziwan and Jubata Al Khashab and detained several people suspected of belonging to radical groups.
Al Mayadeen added that Israeli occupation forces fired numerous warning shots during the mop-up operation. There were no reports of casualties.
On February 12, an Israeli commando unit of 15 armored vehicles blocked the settlement of Ufania in southern Al Qunetira, where three Syrians were detained after searches.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) points out that the country's authorities believe all measures Israel has been taking in southern Syria since the change of government in Damascus on December 8, 2024, "have no legal force under international law." In January, the Syrian Foreign Ministry called on the UN Security Council to force Israel to respect the 1974 agreement on the disengagement of Israeli and Syrian forces on the Golan Heights.

Louvre leak: 19th-century ceiling painted damaged by burst water pipe

The burst water pipe is the latest in a string of setbacks for Louvre managers that have affected the museum's daily operations since the theft of France's historic Crown Jewels last October.
There's no respite it seems for staff at the world's most famous museum.
It's emerged that a painted ceiling, dating from 1819, was damaged by a leak on Thursday night.
Water from a heating supply pipe in a technical room hit a ceiling painted by Charles Meynier, Euronews has learned from the Louvre, confirming information from BFM.
The work occupies room 707, at the entrance to the paintings department in the Denon wing, which also houses the Galerie d'Apollon, the scene of the spectacular burglary last October.
"The fire brigade responded immediately and the leak was stopped at ten minutes past midnight_,"_ said the museum, revealing the initial assessment of a restorer dispatched to the site on Friday morning.
"The work on the ceiling shows two tears in the same area, caused by the water, and lifting of the pictorial layer on the ceiling and its arches_"_.
According to the chief architect of the Monuments Historiques, quoted by the museum, the ceiling _"_does not present any structural problems" while a "more detailed" investigation is continuing into both the ceiling and the work by Charles Meynier, a French neoclassical painter known for his large-scale historical and mythological compositions.
On Friday afternoon, some areas of the Louvre remained closed, according to an alert posted on its official website.
In a message to Euronews, the museum said that the room concerned (707) should reopen "in the next few hours".
The disruption could be prolonged, and Monday's opening to the public could be postponed.
A second flood in less than three months
Since the theft of eight jewels belonging to France's ruling families in the 19th century, life at the Louvre has been punctuated by a series of incidents.
This week, a police operation dismantled a suspected ticket fraud ring, following a tip-off from the museum itself.
Last November, a water leak in the library of the Department of Egyptian Antiquities damaged several hundred works.
The museum has also been hit by several days of industrial action, with employees protesting against deteriorating working conditions, including staff shortages and security shortcomings.

The best supermarket wines, picked by experts and perfect for Valentine’s Day
From orange wine to champagne alternatives, these are the bargain bottles to buy
- Bookmark
Valentine's Day is imminent which means, as well as sharing the love, many of us will be sharing delicious food with a bottle of top-quality vino to toast to the occasion. And, whether you’re looking for a full-bodied red, a crisp white wine or a bang-on-theme rosé to serve on your date, you definitely don’t need to splash out to enjoy something superb.
From the viral £10.99 “chicken wine” (La Vieille Ferme rosé) to Aldi’s award-winning sauvignon blanc and Asda’s playful alternative to Whispering Angel, Screaming Devil, social media has played a major role in opening up the wine world.
TikTok creators such as Lucy Hitchcock, aka @Partnerinwineuk, often see bottles from M&S and Waitrose vanish from shelves, while wine influencers such as Hannah Crosbie and Tom Gilbey are making wine feel more approachable and less intimidating.
“Wine is a whole aisle now, as people want more variety as well as value, and supermarkets have wisely chosen to invest in their wine buyers and relationships with producers – because this is how most of us buy our wine,” says Libby Brodie, wine consultant and columnist. A similar trend is happening with supermarket champagne and whisky, where growing demand has led to a wider selection and higher-quality offerings.
According to Sinead Murdoch, sommelier and co-founder of restaurant Tasca, supermarkets are increasingly appealing to more discerning drinkers. “Now top wine buyers are working for supermarkets, and the growing competition is raising the standard of what ends up on the shelves.” This means that shoppers can now find bottles that rival those in specialist wine shops, without having to spend a fortune or hunt for rare finds.
That said, picking a truly exceptional bottle can still be tricky. So I asked the experts for guidance, ranging from sommeliers to wine influencers. Whether you’re looking to impress with a cava or woo with an orange wine this Valentine’s Day, keep scrolling to discover the best supermarket wines recommended by experts.

4LB7 vinho verde

5Oxney Organic Estate brut rosé NV
- Best sparkling wine
- ABV 12%
- Country England
English wine has a bad reputation, but Murdoch describes this bottle from Sussex as “A wonderful fizz.” She adds that “There’s nothing better than enjoying something made closer to home,” Murdoch says. “This sparkling wine has a real energy to it. It’s full of exciting, racy lemon and green apple skin notes that are balanced out perfectly by raspberries and strawberries.”

- ABV 12.5%
- Country France
“If you're curious about orange wine but don’t know where to start, this is a fantastic introduction,” Murdoch says. “A blend of chardonnay, roussanne, viognier, and grenache blanc, it’s a true southern French mix. The white grapes are macerated on their skins, giving the wine a lightly spiced, citrusy character with a bright tangerine hum. It’s aromatic, textured, and a joy to drink alone or pair with grilled pork or fish.”
9Visio Vintners we the people Cape blend 75cl
- Best wine for barbecues
- ABV 13%
- Country South Africa
“It's barbecue season, and if there's anything the South Africans know how to do, it's cook over a fire,” Brook says. “This South African red blend is predominantly Pinotage - a bold grape native to the country. You'll find a bottle at every BBQ.”

Original Bramley apple tree ‘at risk’ after site where it grows is put up for sale
Unknown

The future of the original Bramley apple tree, which is responsible for one of the world’s most popular cooking apples, is at risk now that the site where it grows has been put up for sale, campaigners have warned.
The tree is situated in the back garden of a row of cottages in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which has been owned by Nottingham Trent University since 2018 and has been used as student accommodation.
The university said the site was for sale due to the “age and configuration” of the cottages, which made them no longer suitable for accommodation.
The great granddaughter of the man who first introduced the Bramley apple commercially said she was “very concerned” for the future of the tree and it needed to be protected.
“It’s a very famous tree. It’s a very well-loved tree and it means a lot,” Celia Steven, 85, said. “Sadly people are a bit prone to cut down trees and think about it later so I find it very disturbing.”
The more than 220-year-old tree was grown from a pip planted by Mary Anne Brailsford between 1809 and 1815. Its apples were discovered nearly 50 years later by local gardener Henry Merryweather in a garden owned by Matthew Bramley. Merryweather was given permission to take cuttings from the Bramley seedling as long as the apples he sold bore Bramley’s name.
Steven said her great-grandfather, Merryweather, “believed in that apple, he commercialised it, he marketed it, he promoted it … he called it the ‘King of Covent Garden’”. Since then, it has become one of Britain’s best loved cooking apples.
Despite the historic nature of the tree, it has never been granted a tree preservation order, which would protect it under law and prevent it from being chopped down.
It has, however, been recognised by the royal family. In 2002, the queen’s golden jubilee cited the Bramley as one of the 50 “great British trees” and two decades later it was recognised as part of a selection of 70 ancient trees dedicated to the queen for the platinum jubilee.
Steven said: “Our ancient trees are not protected in the way they should be. They’re not revered in the way they should be. They’re very special to this country and when we have got such things we do need to look after them and protect them for the future.”
Dan Llywelyn Hall, the founder of the Mother Bramley legacy fund, said such heritage trees should never be at risk like this. The 45-year-old artist, who is hoping to fundraise £400,000 with the Merryweather family to buy the site, said the tree had been “in a state of neglect” since the university bought the cottages.
Despite this, and the fact the Bramley was diagnosed with an incurable honey fungus, it is still alive and producing apples, he said.
“It can’t be understated, it’s the most important, most famous apple tree in the world. It’s produced a million-in-one apple which is highly regarded in the culinary world. The fact we have the original still alive is quite an extraordinary thing,” he said.
“It brings a bigger national discussion up here as to why we are terrible in this country at looking after our heritage trees,” he said.
A Nottingham Trent University spokesperson said: “NTU is proud to have been the latest custodian of the Bramley apple tree and to have played a part in helping to safeguard and celebrate its legacy.
“When the university became custodian it was well known that the tree had outlived its natural lifespan by quite some time. We have worked hard using our academic expertise to maintain it in the most careful and appropriate way for a tree of this age and condition and been delighted to provide access to members of the public and for annual events such as the Bramley apple festival and Heritage Open Days. Without the dedication and hard work of our colleagues, we believe it would have deteriorated significantly further.
“We were visited by an independent tree specialist last year who paid tribute to the work we have done to both maintain and celebrate it. We also reached out individually to people in Southwell with a special connection to the tree before the cottages were listed for sale and, again, people expressed support for the work we have undertaken.
“The university aims to ensure that the tree will remain in the care of a responsible custodian. We will also continue to provide expert guidance and support to them on how to care for the tree.”

Pro-Palestinian Jewish activists disrupt Nigel Farage event at London synagogue
Pro-Palestinian Jewish activists disrupted a speech by far-right politician Nigel Farage at London's Central Synagogue this week, accusing him of racism and warning against the normalisation of extremist politics within the Jewish community.
Farage was speaking on Tuesday night at the launch of the Reform Jewish Alliance (RJA), an initiative linked to his Reform UK party aimed at attracting Jewish voters.
The event, held in a function room at Central Synagogue and attended by around 200 people, marked what Farage said was a renewed effort to engage Jewish communities ahead of future elections.
As he began speaking, four activists from the group Na'amod stood up and interrupted him.
"The Torah says to love the stranger, for we were once strangers in Egypt," one protester shouted.
Another declared: "My grandmother fled Germany. You would deport her."
A third referenced the 1936 Battle of Cable Street, saying: "My mother didn’t fight the Mosley fascists for this."
Na'amod, which describes itself as a movement of Jews in the UK seeking to end support for Israel's occupation of Palestine and apartheid, said the disruption was intended to challenge Farage's anti-immigration rhetoric and the use of a synagogue as a political platform.
In a statement shared online after the event, the group said it would not "stand by while sacred spaces are used to sanitise the record of people who oppose everything our community stands for".
The group said it had carefully considered the decision to protest at a synagogue, particularly given heightened sensitivities around demonstrations at places of worship.
Na'amod said it confirmed no religious services were taking place at the time and sought to ensure that no one felt unsafe. While there were moments of tension between protesters and attendees, the disruption did not escalate into violence.
Footage from the event showed at least one activist being forcefully removed from the venue while attendees responded angrily.
Outside the synagogue, dozens of demonstrators from Jewish pro-Palestinian groups, including Jewish Anti-Zionist Action and the Jewish Bloc for Palestine, held placards reading: "Antifascism is a Jewish tradition" and "Reform UK are not your friends".
Josh Cohen, 32, one of the protesters, told the Guardian that he was "disgusted" by comments made during the event referring to Jews as "model immigrants", adding that such language had risked being used to marginalise other communities.
"We are disgusted by antisemitism," he said, "but we believe Reform are an active threat to the Muslim community and to immigrants and asylum-seeker communities in the UK.
Farage told attendees that "Judeo-Christian principles" formed the foundation of Britain's achievements and said the Reform Jewish Alliance could help the party secure up to 15 parliamentary seats in future elections.
Amy Kershenbaum, who attended the event, said: "Many of us would not be here if Reform policies were in place when our ancestors sought refuge".
Farage was introduced at the event by Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society thinktank.
Among those involved in heading up the Reform Jewish Alliance is Gary Mond, a former senior vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, who resigned from the organisation in 2022.
Research suggests a political divide is emerging among British Jews, with support for Reform rising in recent surveys, though still below the party's national polling figures.

Avalanche kills 3 skiers in French Alps
February 13, 2026Three skiers died in the French Alps after they went off piste and were caught in an avalanche, authorities said Friday.
They were part of a group of six that went into the mountains with a ski instructor in the Val d'Isere area in southeastern France.
The identities and nationalities of the victims were not immediately known.
According to local authorities, the group had mandatory safety equipment with them but set off despite a warning of increased avalanche risk.
Storm Nils brought heavy snow to the French Alps this week, prompting some ski resorts to close their slopes entirely on Thursday. Many ski areas in the region remained under the second-highest avalanche warning level on Friday.
The Val d'Isere municipality warned all skiers to stay on marked slopes and follow safety recommendations given the heightened danger.

UN Security Council gravely concerned over 'escalating violence' in South Sudan
Members 'strongly called on all parties to de-escalate and immediately cease renewed hostilities and to resolve issues through peaceful dialogue,' statement says
HAMILTON, Canada
The UN Security Council on Friday conveyed "grave concern" over the increasing violence across South Sudan, urging all parties to de-escalate.
"The members of the Security Council expressed grave concern at escalating violence in Jonglei and Eastern Equatoria, and throughout the country," a statement by the Security Council members said, recalling that "under international law, individuals who order the commission of war crimes may be held accountable."
"They strongly called on all parties to de-escalate and immediately cease renewed hostilities and to resolve issues through peaceful dialogue."
Emphasizing that ongoing "deterioration and continued violations of the peace agreement are undermining stability, worsening humanitarian needs," the members stressed that the escalation of violence also places "additional strain on UNMISS's (UN Mission in South Sudan) ability to carry out its mandate."
They expressed their "full support" for the UN mission in South Sudan, as they stressed "that continued constructive cooperation between the host government and UNMISS is essential to sustaining peace and stability, facilitating safe and timely humanitarian access, and ensuring the protection of civilians."
"The members of the Security Council have taken note of the recent developments in compliance with UNMISS’s Contingency Plans, including the near completion of the repatriation process," it said, urging the South Sudanese government to keep "full cooperation" with the UN "to complete these processes."
The members called on the South Sudan government to "address remaining impediments on UNMISS’s operations, avoid incurring additional costs, and facilitate the implementation of its mandate, consistent with South Sudan’s commitments in the Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA)."
"The members of the Security Council expressed concerns over demands to close critical bases in Wau and Bentiu, which would pose a serious threat to UNMISS and UNISFA, weakening their capacity to carry out their mandates, including protection of civilians’ component and facilitation of the delivery of aid," it said.
Reiterating their continued commitment to "South Sudan’s peace process and to work in partnership with the transitional government to achieve lasting peace and stability in the region," the members also called on the country's leaders to "engage in genuine inter-party dialogue about potential changes to the 2018 peace agreement, through an inclusive and transparent process."
South Sudan, the world’s youngest country, gained independence in July 2011 but descended into civil war in December 2013 after President Salva Kiir Mayardit dismissed then-Vice President Riek Machar, accusing him of plotting a coup.
Despite the 2018 peace agreement and the formation of a transitional unity government, clashes and political tensions have persisted.
Fighting between the SSPDF and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO), led by Oyet Nathaniel, deputy chair of the SPLM-IO, has intensified since December in northern Jonglei.
Tensions escalated in 2025, exposing deep divisions within the transitional government formed under the 2018 peace deal. Clashes were first reported in January in Western Equatoria State before spreading north.
First Vice President Machar has been under house arrest since March 2025 and is facing trial.

Justice Department sues Harvard for data as it investigates how race factors into admissions
The Trump administration is suing Harvard University, saying it has refused to provide admissions records that the Justice Department demanded to ensure the Ivy League school stopped using affirmative action in admissions

The Trump administration is suing Harvard University, saying it has refused to provide admissions records that the Justice Department demanded to ensure the Ivy League school stopped using affirmative action in admissions.
In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in Massachusetts, the Justice Department said Harvard has “thwarted” efforts to investigate potential discrimination. It accused Harvard of refusing to comply with a federal investigation and asked a judge to order the university to turn over the records.
Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the department's Civil Rights Division, said Harvard's refusal is a red flag. “If Harvard has stopped discriminating, it should happily share the data necessary to prove it,” Dhillon said in a statement.
Harvard officials did not immediately comment.
The suit is the latest salvo in President Donald Trump’s standoff with Harvard, which has faced billions of dollars in funding cuts and other sanctions after it rejected a list of demands from the administration last year.
Trump officials have said they're taking action against Harvard over allegations of anti-Jewish bias on campus. Harvard officials say they're facing unconstitutional retaliation for refusing to adopt the administration's ideological views. The administration is appealing a judge's orders that sided with Harvard in two lawsuits.
The Justice Department opened a compliance review into Harvard's admissions practices last April on the same day the White House issued a series of sweeping demands aligned with Trump's priorities. The agency told Harvard to hand over five years of admissions data for undergraduate applicants along with Harvard's medical and law schools.
It asked for a trove of data including applicants' grades, test scores, essays, extracurricular activities and admissions outcomes, along with their race and ethnicity. It asked for the data by April 25, 2025. The lawsuit said Harvard has not provided that data.
Justice Department officials said they need the data to determine whether Harvard has continued considering applicants’ race in admissions decisions. The Supreme Court barred affirmative action in admissions in 2023 after lawsuits challenged it at Harvard and the University of North Carolina.
Trump officials have accused colleges of continuing the practice, which the administration says discriminates against white and Asian American students.
The White House is separately pressing universities across the U.S. to providing similar data to determine whether they have continued to factor race into admissions decisions. The Education Department plans to collect more detailed admissions data from colleges after Trump signed an action suggesting schools were ignoring the Supreme Court decision.
Trump's dispute with Harvard had appeared to be winding down last summer after the president repeatedly said they were finalizing a deal to restore Harvard's federal funding. The deal never materialized, and Trump rekindled the conflict this month when he said Harvard must pay $1 billion as part of any deal, double what he previously demanded.

Lindsey Vonn says she will need at least 2 more surgeries after crash at Winter Olympics
American skier Lindsey Vonn said Friday she'll need at least two more surgeries after breaking her left leg in a crash during her downhill race at the Winter Olympics last weekend.
Vonn said earlier this week she was recovering from her third surgery for the injury.
The 41-year-old Olympic veteran from Colorado gave the latest update on her condition in a social media video, saying she expects to have another surgery Saturday. If that goes well, she can potentially leave Italy and return to the U.S., where she'll need another operation, she said.
Vonn said she's had a "hard few days" in the hospital and that she was "very much immobile."
"I'm finally feeling more like myself, but I have a long, long way to go," she said.
She thanked those who have been sending flowers, letters and stuffed animals while she is in the hospital. Friends and family members have also been visiting her while she's been receiving treatment.
"I feel very lucky and fortunate to have so many people around me that have really helped me get through this," she said.
Vonn said watching her fellow Americans compete in the Olympics has been lifting her spirits.
"Good job, team, and keep crushing it," Vonn said.
Vonn crashed seconds into her downhill Olympic race Sunday after she decided to compete despite rupturing her left ACL in a different crash during a World Cup event in the Swiss Alps last month.
The three-time Olympic medalist had come out of retirement to compete in the Milan Cortina Games, but said she felt confident she could still complete the race with the help of a knee brace.

Merz calls on EU to unlock its defense potential
According to an Ukrinforms correspondent, the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated this during the opening of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
"Europe must become a global political actor with its own security strategy. By the way, as a reminder to those who may not know: in Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union, we commit to mutually assist one another in the event of an armed attack on Europe. We must clearly define how we want to organize this in a European way. Not as a substitute for NATO, but as an independent, strong pillar within the Alliance," Merz emphasized.
He stressed that a sovereign Europe is the best response to a new era of great-power politics, in which the rules-based international order is under threat of destruction.
According to him, Europe must focus on what matters most: preserving and strengthening freedom, security, and competitiveness. To achieve this, it is necessary to stop the limitless growth of European bureaucracy and regulation that hampers innovation and entrepreneurship.
Merz said that the day before he had held intensive consultations with European leaders, including President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen, and that a joint roadmap for a strong and sovereign Europe is now being developed.
"Russia's GDP currently amounts to about EUR 2 trillion. The GDP of the European Union is almost ten times higher. And yet today Europe is not ten times stronger than Russia," he stressed.
"Our military, political, economic, and technological potential is enormous. But for a long time we have been unable to realize it due to restrictive measures. The most important thing now is to abandon the limiter in our heads. We have the potential. In the era of great powers, our freedom can no longer be taken for granted. It is under threat. Firmness and determination are needed to defend this freedom."
As previously reported, Merz earlier stated that the Bundeswehr would become the strongest conventional army in Europe.

Alan Dershowitz gets into shouting match on Piers Morgan and threatens to sue over Epstein claim
Conservative lawyer in angry spat with comedian Bassem Youssef as host left looking on
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Conservative lawyer Alan Dershowitz got into an angry shouting match with comedian Bassem Youssef on Piers Morgan Uncensored after the two men joined the show to discuss the Jeffrey Epstein scandal.
Dershowitz and Youssef began by examining the theory that Epstein, the billionaire pedophile who died in a New York City jail cell in August 2019, was secretly a Mossad agent, which the former rubbished as unlikely.
But the conversation quickly became bad tempered when the Egyptian, 51, accused the former Harvard Law School professor, 87, of practising “gaslighting”.
He invoked the lawyer’s own past connections to the disgraced financier, alleging that his fellow guest had once settled a lawsuit with a woman who accused him of sexual abuse for “nearly a million dollars.”
“Innocent men don’t pay. They go to trial,” the comic taunted Dershowitz, leading the latter to angrily deny the accusation and complain that Youssef was defaming him on live TV.
“You’re lying. You’re defaming me. You are now going to be sued for saying I paid a million dollars,” Dershowitz said, appealing to the host to cut Youssef off.
Morgan duly stepped in to try to make peace, only for the comedian to continue to press Derhowitz and shout over him, the situation becoming ever more heated.
“I’m instructing my lawyers to file a lawsuit against him for saying I paid a million dollars,” Dershowitz said. “What happened is a woman falsely accused me. She admitted she may have mistaken me and confused me for somebody else. She dropped all of her charges. Not a single penny was paid. Nothing.”
He was referring to a federal civil defamation lawsuit filed against him in the Southern District of New York in April 2019 by the late Virginia Giuffre, which was ultimately dropped in November 2022 when Giuffre conceded she may have wrongly identified Dershowitz as a past abuser. No fees were awarded to either side.
“You saying that I paid a million dollars is gonna result in you having to pay me many millions of dollars,” the lawyer continued, resuming his threat against Youssef, who, undeterred, insisted his information came from a New Yorker article about the case.
“The New Yorker never said anything like that,” Dershowitz fumed. “You know, you’re such a liar. You know, I thought you were a comedian. I thought at least you’d be funny. You’re just a liar.”
“You’re somebody who is prepared to make any kind of antisemitic, anti-Israel statement. Now I want you to justify the million. I want you to justify that I paid a million dollars. I want you to justify that. Will you justify it? Will you justify that I paid a million dollars?”
Youssef held his ground, prompting Dershowitz to challenge him to produce the New Yorker article in question while accusing him of “lying through his teeth.”
Youssef duly searched for and found an article entitled “Alan Dershowitz, Devil’s Advocate” published by the periodical in July 2019, but his readings from it only led to further inconclusive squabbling.
The conversation ended with Dershowitz speaking on genocide and the distinction between different 20th and 21st century atrocities, earning a sarcastic thumbs up from Youssef.
Dershowitz, who has a long history of representing controversial clients – from OJ Simpson to Julian Assange, Harvey Weinstein and President Donald Trump, whom he spoke in defense of at his January 2020 Senate impeachment hearings – is also well known for issuing legal threats.
Last summer, he announced his intention to sue a Martha’s Vineyard farmer’s market vendor for allegedly refusing to sell him pierogi, claiming he was being discriminated against because of his personal politics.

Ukrainian state postal service loses 418 vehicles since start of full-scale war

Ukrainian state postal service loses 418 vehicles since start of full-scale war
Since the start of the full-scale war, Ukraine's national postal service Ukrposhta has lost 418 vehicles, including 281 during the temporary occupation of Ukrainian territories by Russian forces in 2022.
Source: Ukrposhta
Quote: "Russia systematically attacks postal routes, primarily where a vehicle with the postal logo remains the only way for people to receive pensions, medicines, social payments and parcels. A strike on a postal vehicle here is not about equipment. It is an attempt to stop life near the front."
Details: The epicentre of attacks has been mobile branches known as "post offices on wheels". Since the start of the full-scale war, 103 such crews have come under fire, and 137 company vehicles in total have been affected.
In 2025 alone, Russian forces attacked 21 Ukrposhta mobile branches – civilian transport with no military purpose.
The highest number of vehicles, including mobile branches, were damaged in the following oblasts: Chernihiv – 29, Kherson – 25, Dnipropetrovsk – 24, Sumy – 18 and Donetsk – 13.
Another 281 vehicles were lost in 2022 during the temporary occupation of Ukrainian territories by Russian forces.
Quote: "The new year has not changed the tactics of terrorist attacks. In the first weeks of January, Russian forces struck postal crews in Sumy and Kherson oblasts twice. People survived. The vehicles did not. Each subsequent route departure is work under the constant threat of repeat strike."
Details: At the end of 2025, Ukrposhta received 160 new MAN and Iveco vehicles, partially compensating for vehicle losses. Thanks to team efforts and route restructuring, 95-98% of parcels are delivered on time even in regions where routes may change at any moment, the company noted.

Could Max Verstappen really quit F1? What we learned from second 2026 test in Bahrain
Verstappen’s critical assessment of the new generation of F1 cars is intriguing, just three weeks out from the season-opener in Australia - especially given the advantage Red Bull look to have over their rivals
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Two tests down ahead of the new Formula One season, a single three-day window remains. And one thing is for certain: it’s not the usual case of uneventful on-track stints and dour media sessions from pre-season testing at the Sakhir circuit in Bahrain.
Three weeks out from the season-opening race in Australia, there is plenty to digest. Not just the new rules and regulations – requirements which are overly complex according to Lewis Hamilton, entering his 20th season in F1 – but chit-chat about illegal engines and star driver unrest as well.
Max Verstappen’s comments on Thursday, despite Red Bull’s strong running so far, certainly threw a grenade into proceedings. The four-time world champion described the new cars as being “anti-racing,” elaborating on the energy management element by saying F1 was now “like Formula E on steroids.”
Hamilton, a seven-time world champion, concurred with his arch-rival. Yet others, notably reigning champion Lando Norris, insisted the new cars were “fun to drive”, simply posing a different challenge to the best drivers in the world.
So, after three days of running in Bahrain, what have we learned?
Max Verstappen refuses to rule out quitting F1
It’s not been uncommon for the outspoken Dutchman to air his views in piercing terms on a myriad of issues. His initial views of the debut event in Las Vegas in 2023, F1’s new flagship race, spring to mind, describing the circuit as like “National League compared to Champions League.”
Yet his words this week will also sting the executives in F1’s hospitality unit. Beyond the specifics of his car, his long-term view will send alarm bells. “A winning car, for me, that doesn’t matter,” he said.
“It needs to be fun to drive as well. I think, at this stage of my career, also explore other things outside of Formula 1 [i.e. endurance racing at the Nurburgring] to have fun at. I know that we’re stuck with this regulation for quite a while. So, yeah, let’s see.”
Ominous early views from Verstappen. While he does have a contract at Red Bull until the end of 2028, his interest in endurance racing is growing and if these cars are not to his liking, it’s not unthinkable that he could call it a day after 12 consecutive seasons.
But here’s the catch: Red Bull actually look like the strongest team. Their straight-line speed has stunned their rivals, with Toto Wolff and George Russell both calling them the “benchmark” outfit, while their race runs were also impressive, with their new Ford-partnered power unit efficient in gathering energy and delivering it. At least, much more so than rivals.
Red Bull have also not yet utilised the aero package they plan to use in Australia; that’ll be added to the car at next week’s final test. While Verstappen wants a fun car to drive, a competitive car feels more important for someone of his standing and drive, despite his words on Thursday.
As such, any threats to quit should be taken with a pinch of salt at this point. After all, it’s fun to win, right?
A Mercedes reality check
The Silver Arrows, who were the standouts at the Barcelona shakedown event, finished Friday with a one-two finish but were undoubtedly surprised by Red Bull’s performance level.
The added complication of Red Bull joining Ferrari, Honda and Audi in complaining to the FIA over the engine compression saga is also looming in the next few weeks, with further meetings expected next week.
A late regulation change could be curtains for Mercedes’s challenge, though that appears unlikely at this stage. They also had a power unit issue, which limited their running on Thursday and, as a result, they completed the second-least amount of laps across the three days, at 282.
Ferrari status report? We are checking…
Optimism is slowly bubbling in camp Scuderia.
While Lewis Hamilton also complained about the new cars – and rightly referred to his shambolic race engineer situation as “detrimental” to the start of his season – the Briton put in some solid times, both over one lap and race-trim, though he did spin on day one.
Promisingly, both Hamilton and Charles Leclerc appear in tune with the car and, to the excitement of the tifosi, a new floor, front wing and diffuser is expected to arrive for the final test next week. That could put them right up with Red Bull and Mercedes.
Aston Martin are in trouble
It’s hard to make a decisive judgement on the front-of-the-pack during testing, but what often becomes clear is who is languishing at the back. Cadillac’s issues, as the slowest team throughout as well as a few mechanical problems, were expected. Aston Martin’s were not.
For the striking design implemented by Adrian Newey, it’s been a torrid testing period so far for the team decked in royal green. Just one day of running in Barcelona, a launch plagued by live-stream issues and, now, talk that they are “four seconds” off the pace.
That’s not a rumour, either. That’s a direct quote from driver Lance Stroll, son of team owner Lawrence. They also completed the least amount of laps by some distance – just 206 over 24 hours of on-track activity.
Some serious work to do over the next fortnight.
Williams bounce back
Having missed the shakedown in Barcelona, team principal James Vowles was keen to downplay the significance of the decision, saying he wanted to push the potential of the car’s capability.
It has been a strong rebound in Sakhir. Williams completed the joint-most amount of laps over three days – 422, alongside fellow Mercedes-engine user McLaren – and Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon have look enthused by the machinery beneath them.
In fact, they look ahead of Aston in the pecking order right now. Whether they can make a leap in performance to challenge the big boys, ahead of race one, is another matter altogether.

Europe's role in NATO leadership grows, with US maintaining its military presence — Rutte

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. Europe's role in NATO leadership will grow while the US maintains its military presence and nuclear forces on European territory, the organization’s Secretary General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Over the coming years, we will more and more see a NATO that is more European-led, but at the same time with the US absolutely anchored in the organization," Rutte said.
He pointed out that there has been a "shift in mindset," with "Europe really stepping up, Europe taking more of a leadership role within NATO, Europe also taking more care of its own defense."
At the same time, according to the NATO chief, the US is committed to maintaining its nuclear and conventional military presence in Europe.
Earlier this week, NATO decided to transfer command positions in three regional NATO headquarters to European generals. However, the command of NATO’s Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe and the position of NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe remained with the US.

US Homeland Security chief ends temporary protected status for Yemen
Allowing beneficiaries to remain temporarily in US is contrary to national interest, Kristi Noem says
WASHINGTON
US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem on Friday announced a decision to end temporary deportation protections for Yemenis living in the country.
"After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate U.S. government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Noem said in a statement.
Allowing the beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the US is contrary to the national interest, she added.
The decision will take effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register and after the effective date of the termination, the department may arrest and deport any Yemeni national without status once their TPS has been terminated, according to the statement.
It was not immediately clear how many individuals could be impacted by the decision.
Yemen was first granted Temporary Protected Status on Sept. 3, 2015, due to ongoing armed conflict threatening the safety of returning nationals. The designation was subsequently extended or redesignated multiple times through 2024.

US allows oil majors to resume Venezuela operations
The authorisation does not allow transactions with companies in Russia, Iran or China
The US eased sanctions on Venezuela’s energy sector on Friday, issuing two general licences that allow global energy companies to operate oil and gas projects in the Opec member and for other companies to negotiate contracts to bring in fresh investments.
The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control issued a general licence allowing Chevron, BP, Eni, Shell and Repsol to operate oil and gas operations in Venezuela. Those companies still have offices in the country and stakes in projects, and are among the main partners of state-run company PDVSA.
The authorisation for the oil majors’ operations requires payments for royalties and Venezuelan taxes to go through the US-controlled Foreign Government Deposit Fund.
The other licence allows companies around the world to enter contracts with PDVSA for new investments in Venezuelan oil and gas. The contracts are contingent on separate permits from OFAC.
The authorisation does not allow transactions with companies in Russia, Iran, or China or entities owned or controlled by joint ventures with people in those countries.
The move was the biggest relaxation of sanctions on Venezuela since US forces captured and removed President Nicolas Maduro last month.

Israeli extremists enter southern Lebanon, call for settlements

Israeli extremists cross into southern Lebanon, call for settlements
Dozens of Israelis crossed the border into southern Lebanon on Thursday, calling for the establishment of Jewish settlements in the area, in a brazen violation of sovereignty.
Israeli Channel 12 reported that dozens of extremists from the far-right settler movement Uri Tzafon, which receives significant financial and ideological support from pro-Israel groups in the US and Europe, crossed the border fence near the Lebanese town of Yaroun.
The settlers, who included women and children, attempted to plant trees inside Lebanese territory in a staged act promoting Israeli settlement expansion, calling for the alleged "resumption" of settlement in Lebanon, framing it as a "historical correction".
The Israeli army confirmed that a group of around 20 Jewish settlers had gathered near the border, and said two individuals crossed the fence before being apprehended and returned to Israeli territory.
The army described the incident as "serious" and a criminal violation that endangered civilians and soldiers.
However, Israeli media reports and videos shared online showed that more than two individuals crossed into Lebanese land during the action.
Beirut MP Melhem Khalaf condemned the incident, saying that "when crossing the fence and violating sovereignty turns into a tree-planting outing, we know that audacity has reached its peak".
"Lebanon is not vacant land for correcting historical delusions, nor a backyard for sick settlement projects," Khalaf wrote on X. "Lebanon is not for sale, not for annexation, and not for bargaining."
Uri Tzafon has previously publicly advocated for Israeli annexation of parts of southern Lebanon. In recent months, it has circulated maps of south Lebanon labelled with Hebrew names and promoted plans for future settlements in areas south of the Litani River.
Settlement construction in occupied territory is considered illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention.
Israel occupies five Lebanese hilltop points near the border despite a ceasefire deal in November 2024 outlighting the full withdrawal of its forces.
The incident follows previous attempts by extremist settler groups to cross into Syria and southern Lebanon, where they have staged provocative incursions and called for expansion under the banner of so-called "Greater Israel".
Some settler activists invoke alleged biblical claims to Lebanese and Syrian territory, pursuing expansionist ambitions which members of the far-right Israeli government have openly advocated recently.
Strike in al-Tiri
The border crossing came as Israel carried out another strike in southern Lebanon killing one person on Thursday in the town of al-Tiri.
Despite a November 2024 truce that ended more than a year of cross-border hostilities and two months of full-scale war between Israel and Hezbollah, Israeli forces have continued near-daily strikes in parts of Lebanon.
Al-Tiri lies south of the Litani River, the zone that Lebanese authorities and the UNIFIL say has no Hezbollah activity and is weapons-free.
In January, Lebanon's army announced it had completed the first phase of its plan to disarm Hezbollah in the area south of the Litani, roughly 30 kilometres from the Israeli border. The government is expected to meet on Monday to review further progress.
Israel has repeatedly said its strikes target Hezbollah positions, without presenting evidence.
Lebanon argues that the continued attacks and Israeli military presence in the south obstruct the Lebanese army's deployment south of the Litani River, disrupt reconstruction efforts, and prevent displaced residents from returning to their homes.

FTSE 100 closes in the green as UK plans big missile spend
The FTSE 100 index closed up 43.91 points, 0.4%, at 10,446.35.

Stock prices in London closed mostly higher on Friday following the news that US consumer inflation slowed more than expected last month.
The US annual CPI rate stood at 2.4% on-year in January, lower than 2.7% in December and below the FXStreet-cited consensus of a softer deceleration to 2.5%.
Monthly, consumer prices rose 0.2% after a 0.3% increase in December, below the consensus for another 0.3% increase.
The annual core index that strips out food and energy was up 2.5% as expected in January, slowed from 2.6%. Monthly, core goods prices were up 0.3%, also as expected, and accelerated from 0.2%.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 43.91 points, 0.4%, at 10,446.35. The FTSE 250 ended up 122.28 points, 0.5%, at 23,427.27, and the AIM all-share closed up 0.69 points, 0.1%, at 811.85.
NatWest was the lowest blue-chip, down 4.1% despite reporting better-than-expected annual results.
The Edinburgh-based lender reported £16.64 billion in total income for 2025, up 13% on-year and ahead of analyst consensus of £16.53 billion. Operating pretax profit increased 24% to £7.71 billion, also surpassing the consensus estimate of £7.49 billion.
Noting that NatWest’s results were “strong”, Shore said: “The print reinforces NatWest as a high‑teens‑return on tangible equity, capital‑generative UK franchise with growing tangible net asset value, benign credit trends, disciplined cost control and clear headroom for dividends and buybacks.”

UN urges parties to uphold commitments, resolve differences peacefully in Syria
'We shall never lose sight of the immense suffering and loss Syrians have endured over 14 years of conflict and decades of dictatorship,' says envoy Claudio Cordone
By Merve Aydogan
HAMILTON, Canada (AA) - The UN on Friday urged Syrian stakeholders to uphold their commitments and resolve differences peacefully, stressing that the country's transition period requires cooperation, respect for sovereignty and sustained humanitarian support.
"We encourage the parties to continue to uphold their commitments and resolve any implementation-related differences peacefully and expeditiously," UN Deputy Special Envoy for Syria Claudio Cordone said in his first address to the Security Council.
He said the UN looks forward to the "full and swift implementation" of efforts aimed at the peaceful integration of northeast Syria, the protection of the rights of Syrian Kurds, and the safe, dignified and voluntary return of displaced persons so that people can live "in dignity and free from fear."
Addressing developments in the south, Cordone said Israeli military activity remains a concern.
"Still in the south, Israeli incursions and search operations have continued. There are reports of the aerial spraying of herbicides by Israel, causing damage to crops and pastures," he said.
"We reiterate our call for full respect for international law, Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. We also call on Israel to withdraw from areas it occupies in violation of the 1974 Disengagement of Forces Agreement," he added, voicing support for "the pursuit of mutually acceptable security arrangements between Israel and Syria."
Israeli forces have been carrying out near-daily incursions into Syrian territory, particularly in rural Quneitra, detaining civilians, setting up checkpoints, questioning those passing through, and destroying farmland.
After the fall of the Assad regime in late 2024, Israel expanded its occupation of Syria's Golan Heights by seizing the demilitarized buffer zone, a move that violated the 1974 disengagement agreement.
Syrians say the continued Israeli violations are undermining efforts to restore stability and hindering attempts to attract investment to boost the economy.
On the political track, Cordone said: "The next step in the political transition is the formation of the People's Assembly."
He reiterated the importance of ensuring that Syria's regions and diverse groups are meaningfully represented in the new body.
Highlighting the human toll of the conflict, Cordone said: "We shall never lose sight of the immense suffering and loss Syrians have endured over 14 years of conflict and decades of dictatorship."
He said Syrians hold "both hopes and fears, perhaps in equal measure," as the country moves forward in what he described as a new era that began in December 2024.
Cordone also stressed the need to maximize practical impact, avoid duplication and ensure that international efforts deliver tangible results, pointing to recent flash flooding in displacement camps in Idlib as a stark reminder of continuing humanitarian needs.
Briefing on behalf of UN relief chief Tom Fletcher, Lisa Doughten, director of the financing and outreach division at the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said recent clashes in the country forced tens of thousands to flee their homes last month.
"Over 90% of those displaced are women and girls. Two-thirds are staying with host communities, straining already stretched households and services," she said.
Despite persistent challenges, Doughten said "encouraging indicators of real, if modest, improvements in the humanitarian situation."
According to the 2025 Food Security Assessment, food insecurity has eased, but "some 700,000 people are still facing severe food insecurity, while 6.4 million are moderately food insecure."
She added that since December 2024 more than 3 million refugees and internally displaced persons have returned to their home areas.
Heavy rainfall earlier this week caused severe flooding across parts of Idlib and northern Latakia, killing two children and affecting more than 5,000 displaced people, she said.
"Syria can turn the corner on humanitarian need, but only with decisive support" in diplomacy, recovery investment and sustained humanitarian funding, Doughten stressed.

Netflix quietly scraps show after just one season, creator reveals
The series was cancelled due to low viewing numbers
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Netflix has canceled one of its shows after the first season, leading the creator of the series to share the news on X.
Mattson Tomlin shared a post on social media announcing that Terminator Zero was axed by the streamer due to low viewing numbers, despite the series being well-received by critics.
“It was cancelled,” Tomlin wrote in a post on X, responding to a fan question about the status of season two of the series. “The critical and audience reception to it was tremendous, but at the end of the day not nearly enough people watched it. I would’ve loved to deliver on the Future War I had planned in seasons 2 and 3, but I’m also very happy with how it feels contained as is.
“Maybe someday I’ll do a big thread about the plans I had for the full five season run,” he continued. “The series finale was special and it was part of my pitch to get the job. I’ve written all of the season two scripts and outlined pretty much all of season three…Maybe I will return to that world in a different form. I really do love it, and it was extremely gratifying to see so many people connect with it the way they did.”
The show’s creator also explained that he had no ill will toward Netflix and were “good partners” to work with based on the amount of creative freedom they let him have. The streaming platform also offered him the option to make a final two or three episodes to properly wrap the series, which he declined.
“I felt the story I wanted to tell was much longer, and the finale of season one actually left things in a good place,” he wrote. “But they didn’t have to offer that. Good partners here.”
The show was a science-fiction anime series set in the Terminator universe originally created by James Cameron and Gale Anne Hurd. It followed the story of Malcolm Lee, who was developing an AI system in 1997. However, as he deals with the system’s creation, Lee is also being hunted by an assassin from the future who is after his three children.
The news of Terminator Zero’s cancellation comes as Netflix recently revealed the new films and TV series arriving every day throughout the month of February.
Among the new original releases are the return of smash hit series The Night Agent, the next show from Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee (How to Get to Heaven from Belfast) and the concluding chapter of Bridgerton season four. There will also be documentaries about Gordon Ramsay, Lucy Letby and Pearl Jam frontman Eddie Vedder (Matter of Time).
But the biggest addition is the long-running medical drama ER, which has seen a resurgence thanks to the Emmy-winning success of The Pitt, both starring Noah Wyle.

Angry passengers left high and dry after Star Cruises cancels Hong Kong sailing
Star Voyager’s two-night cruise cancelled because of ‘unforeseen technical issue’
Star Cruises cancelled a scheduled departure from Hong Kong on Friday evening because of “an unforeseen technical issue”, leaving angry passengers who had waited for hours to board complaining they had been treated like “refugees”.
The cruise operator apologised, offering customers the choice of rescheduling or a full refund.
“Star Cruises regrets to inform [passengers] that the Star Voyager sailing scheduled on February 13, for the ‘2 Night High Seas Cruise’ departing from Hong Kong Ocean Terminal, has been cancelled due to an unforeseen technical issue,” a spokesman said.
“Star Cruises remains fully committed to delivering a safe and enjoyable travel experience. We appreciate the understanding and patience of our guests and partners.”
The firm did not disclose details of the technical issue or when it was identified.
According to a social media post by “Longman Lo” at around 5.20pm, hundreds of passengers were already queuing at Ocean Terminal in Tsim Sha Tsui, with staff handing out water to those waiting to board.
Another post at around 9.20pm showed that crowds were still waiting at the boarding area.

Rubio: 'Future linked to Europe' as US attacks hang over Munich
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said transatlantic ties faced a "defining moment" in a rapidly changing world but struck a warmer tone ahead of the Munich Security Conference on Friday after a year of unprecedented upheaval.
At the same gathering of top security officials last year, Vice President JD Vance had attacked European allies, triggering a series of confrontations, with the US seemingly set on dismantling much of the international order it helped to build.
In response, Washington's partners have been pushing to chart a more independent course while preserving the basis of the alliance, as they face myriad threats from Russia's war in Ukraine to massive ructions in global trade.
"I think it's at a defining moment ... the world is changing very fast right in front of us," Rubio said before departing for Munich.
"The Old World is gone, frankly, the world I grew up in, and we live in a new era in geopolitics, and it's going to require all of us to re-examine what that looks like and what our role is going to be," he said.
"(The US is) deeply tied to Europe, and our futures have always been linked and will continue to be," said Rubio, who is a potential rival to Vance for the 2028 US presidential race. "So we've just got to talk about what that future looks like."
'Wrecking-ball politics' threaten alliance
This year's meeting comes against a backdrop of multiple conflicts, including wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan. Transatlantic ties have long been central to the Munich Security Conference, which began as a Cold War forum for Western defence debate. But the unquestioned assumption of cooperation that underpinned it has been upended.
Wolfgang Ischinger, the former German diplomat who heads the forum, spoke this week of "wrecking-ball politics" in which "sweeping destruction – rather than careful reforms and policy corrections – is the order of the day".
Underscoring the damage, a YouGov poll on Friday of the six largest European countries showed favourability towards the US in Europe hitting its lowest since tracking began in 2016.
The latest figures are broadly comparable to – and in some cases higher than – the perceived threat from China, Iran or North Korea, although behind Russia, YouGov said.
US President Donald Trump has toppled Venezuela's leader, threatened other Latin American countries with similar military action, imposed tariffs on friends and foes alike and talked openly about annexing Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark - a move that could effectively end the alliance.
"No one in Europe or in the United States wins from any kind of conflict between old allies," said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who said she would meet Rubio in Munich.
"So we must do what we can to keep the Americans close to us, but this is a new world disorder that we live in. And that is why the most important thing for us Europeans is that we arm ourselves as quickly as possible."
The Trump administration's harsh new tone, including a dire warning that Europe faces "civilisational erasure", has shaken its allies, which have pledged to step up spending on their own militaries after decades of neglect.
Europe's dependence on US military support will take years to undo, however, leaving it vulnerable as the standoff with Russia over the Ukraine war persists.
Germany's foreign minister said on Friday that recent comments by US officials have caused irritation within NATO.
"This alliance is also under pressure. There is alienation, there is irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to talk about this here together," Johann Wadephul told German broadcaster ARD.
In another striking sign of the shifting rhetoric, the head of Germany's industry association BDI, Peter Leibinger, said in Munich that Europeans had to prepare their defence sector "with, without and possibly against Washington".
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will open the conference with a speech on Friday afternoon, while around 70 heads of state and government and more than 140 ministers are expected under tight security in Munich.
Prominent attendees include Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and French President Emmanuel Macron, who this week warned: "We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side."

Ukrainian troops defeated opponent with drones at 2025 NATO exercise – WSJ
During military exercises in Estonia in spring 2025, a group of Ukrainian drone operators demonstrated that drones and battlefield analysis systems are changing the approach to modern warfare.
Source: an opinion piece by Jillian Kay Melchior for The Wall Street Journal
Details: The article describes the Hedgehog 2025 exercise, which involved more than 16,000 service members from 12 NATO countries. Ukrainian drone experts also trained alongside them, including soldiers deployed from the front.
Quote: "In Ukraine the front line is largely frozen, but Hedgehog envisioned a battlefield where tanks and troops still have some ability to move. During one scenario, a battle group of several thousand troops, including a British brigade and an Estonian division, sought to conduct an attack. As they advanced, they failed to account for how drones have made the battlefield more transparent, several sources say.
The NATO battle group was 'just walking around, not using any kind of disguise, parking tents and armored vehicles', recalls one participant, who played an enemy role. 'It was all destroyed'."
Details: Melchior notes that during the exercise Ukrainian personnel used the Delta system, which gathers battlefield intelligence in real time, analyses it, identifies targets and coordinates strikes between command and units.
Quote: "A single team of some 10 Ukrainians, acting as the adversary, counterattacked the NATO forces. In about half a day they mock-destroyed 17 armored vehicles and conducted 30 'strikes' on other targets."
Details: One participant stated that the team managed to "eliminate two battalions in a day".
"Still, Hedgehog showed how visible the battlefield has become – and how vulnerable that makes anyone or anything moving on it. NATO will need to adjust its tactics and find better ways to protect its tanks and armoured vehicles," Melchior concluded.

Democrats say Trump’s foreign deportation deals cost taxpayers millions
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON, Feb 13 - U.S. President Donald Trump's immigrant deportation agreements with foreign governments cost American taxpayers millions of dollars - at times more than $1 million per person shipped out of the country - and produce little benefit, according to a study from Senate Democrats released on Friday.
Trump aims to deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally and his administration has sought to ramp up removals of immigrants to third countries that are not their country of origin.
Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said in their report that the total cost of third-country removals is unknown, but that more than $32 million has been sent directly to five countries - Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, El Salvador, Eswatini and Palau.
As of January 2026, the five countries received only about 300 third-country nationals - 250 of them Venezuelans sent to El Salvador - from the United States, the majority of whom have already been returned or are set to return to their home country, the report said.
In one example cited, a Jamaican was sent to Eswatini at a cost of more than $181,000 despite a U.S. court's finding that he should be returned to his homeland. Weeks later he was flown 7,000 miles back to Jamaica, also at U.S. expense, the report said.
The Jamaican government said it never objected to his return to his home country, according to the report.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. The White House has said that its mass deportation program was a central campaign promise in Trump's successful 2024 campaign for reelection and that it "is freeing up resources, revitalizing opportunity and restoring safety."
The 30-page report was released by Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on the foreign relations committee, and also signed by committee Democrats Chris Coons, Chris Murphy, Tim Kaine, Chris Van Hollen, Cory Booker, Tammy Duckworth and Jacky Rosen.
“This report outlines the troubling practice by the Trump Administration of deporting individuals to third countries — places where these people have no connection — at great expense to the American taxpayer and raises serious questions,” Shaheen said in a statement.
Critics say Trump's third-country deportation policy aims to stoke fear among migrants and encourage them to "self deport" to their home countries if they are in the United States and to stay home or go elsewhere if they are not.
But the administration has not provided detailed information about its plans or arrangements with third countries to accept migrants removed from the U.S. but unable to return to their home countries.
Reuters reported in January about people who are deported to their home countries despite fears of political persecution in their homelands. That included a woman from Sierra Leone first sent to Ghana and then forcibly returned to her home country from there despite a U.S. judge having granted her request to go elsewhere.
The Democrats' report said there is no evidence that the State Department is conducting follow-up oversight on the use of taxpayer funds, even with governments that have records of corruption and human rights abuses.
The report covers agreements and reported third-country removals through January 31, 2026, but said the Trump administration was expected to pursue more agreements.
"Minority Committee staff understand the State Department is pursuing third country removal agreements with 70 to 80 countries," the report said. REUTERS

‘They escaped!’: NGOs sound the alarm as families flee Islamic State camp
Unknown

Most of the foreign families of suspected Islamic State fighters have left al-Hawl camp since the Syrian government took control of the facility, prompting security and humanitarian concerns over their whereabouts.
About 6,000 women and children from 42 different countries were previously held in the foreigners’ annexe of al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, which housed some of the most radical former members of the extremist group. The foreigners’ annexe was separate from the part of the camp that contained about 20,000 Syrians and Iraqis.
All of those held in the camp are arbitrarily detained as they have not been tried or charged for their alleged involvement in IS, and many of the residents are young children.
On Friday, humanitarian groups said the foreigners’ annexe had been emptied almost entirely of its former residents and that most of the families left for Idlib. They said foreign women and children had been gradually leaving the foreigners’ annexe since the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) abandoned the facility to the advancing Syrian government forces on 20 January.
“All of the foreign women have escaped in this period,” said Jihan Hanan, who directed the al-Hawl camp until its takeover by Damascus last month. “Every day, cars would come and take them at night and take them to Idlib. It wasn’t done in an organised way.”
The escape of IS-linked individuals from al-Hawl and other detention facilities was a long-running concern for the international community, which warned that a mass-exodus could help IS reconstitute itself across Syria and Iraq. The US military had transferred about 3,000 IS detainees to prisons in Iraq over the past month and was expected to finish the transfer of about 4,000 more over the coming days, which could facilitate the exit of US military forces from Syria.
It was unclear how exactly the families left al-Hawl, whether they were let out or they escaped. A camp resident of central Asian descent told the Guardian that she was able to escape by “crawling through the fence” and that she was now in Idlib.
An NGO worker said they were aware of at least one case where a woman who escaped the camp crossed into Turkey and suggested others may have done the same, but cautioned that the lack of oversight made it impossible to know where residents ended up.
The Syrian government has been approached for comment. It has previously blamed escapes on the SDF, which it said abandoned the facility without coordinating with Damascus.
Beatrice Eriksson, a spokesperson for the rights organisation Repatriate the Children, said: “The past two weeks, children and mothers have been moved or released in a highly chaotic context, without clarity on who is responsible or what protection measures are in place.”
During two visits to the camp in the week after its handover to Syrian government forces, the Guardian saw cut fences and frequent escape attempts by residents of the foreigners’ annexe. Fighters of central Asian descent were taking women from the annexe into their cars, with their destination unknown, while others clamoured at the outer walls of the camps, arguing with guards to let their relatives out.
Of the dozen or so women the Guardian spoke to in the camp, almost all expressed their desire to be released to Idlib, where they said relatives were waiting for them. Security guards and fighters expressed sympathy for the detainees, saying their continued detention was an injustice.
Outside the camp’s gates, security officers from the interior ministry guarded the gates. Some took off running as their walkie-talkies squawked: “They escaped, they escaped!” Their supervising officer laughed as the men ran, joking that if it were up to him, he would just open the gates.
It was unclear where the families who left the camp would go next. Some women told humanitarian workers they believed they would be repatriated – something that would require the consent of the home government.
Eriksson said the disorganised nature of the release left women and children vulnerable to trafficking or recruitment to violent extremist groups and urged states to intervene to repatriate their citizens.
She added: “Ending arbitrary detention is necessary, but the immediate priority must be to identify and protect these children and families, and to move them through safe, dignified processes involving international cooperation – not to leave them to navigate a conflict zone on their own.”
Many states have refused to take back their nationals, despite the pleas of Kurdish forces who guarded the camp and humanitarian groups who said detention conditions were substandard and unlawful.
“We’ve lost everything, all those years that we’ve been working on this issue,” said Hanan. She shared a video of a camp resident standing in her ransacked office, with the man vowing to find and kill her, referring to her by name and calling her a “pig”.
“I know this man. I tried to get him released from the camp, but the security agencies said he was a risk. Now that he’s out, I and all the humanitarian workers are in danger,” Hanan said.

YEREVAN, February 13. /TASS/. Armenia has requested Russia to provide an onsite briefing to an Armenian expert delegation on Russia’s floating modular reactor technology, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan announced at a news conference.
"We also discussed this topic - the construction of a modular nuclear power plant - with our Russian colleagues," Pashinyan explained. "Russia possesses this technology, which is uniquely characterized by its floating design, adapted from submarine reactor technology. If I’m correct, this technology is implemented in Chukotka (at the world’s only floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, located in Pevek - TASS). We have asked our Russian counterparts to facilitate a visit for our expert delegation, so we can gain direct access to this innovative technology," he added.
Pashinyan also highlighted that during US Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Yerevan, Armenia joined the 123 Agreement on civil nuclear energy cooperation. This agreement enables Armenia to access comprehensive information about various modular reactor technologies developed in the United States.
"For countries not party to this agreement, such information remains classified. This means that outside the framework of the 123 Agreement, no one has access to the details of US modular reactor development," Pashinyan noted.
Nuclear power in Armenia
On February 3, Armenia's Minister of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure David Khudatyan announced that Armenia has decided on a modular reactor option for its future nuclear power plant (NPP), which will replace the current Metsamor facility. The country is currently reviewing proposals from Russia, the United States, China, South Korea, and France.
During Vice President Vance’s visit to Yerevan on February 9, an agreement was signed between Washington and Yerevan concerning civil nuclear energy cooperation. This agreement is expected to enable US companies to provide Armenia with approximately $9 billion worth of products and services in this sector, including small modular reactors.
The operation of Armenia’s existing Metsamor NPP is being extended through cooperation between the government and Russian firm Rusatom Service. This decision was finalized in December 2023 following a meeting of the Armenian-Russian intergovernmental commission. The Armenian government allocated $65 million to extend the lifespan of the plant’s second power unit until 2036.
Furthermore, on February 11, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated that the Metsamor NPP’s operation could potentially be prolonged until 2046, ensuring Armenia’s continued nuclear energy capacity in the coming decades.

Cardi B and DHS get into online feud after she threatens to ‘jump’ ICE if they come to her concert
‘Why [y’all] don’t wanna talk about the Epstein files?’ Cardi B asked the Department of Homeland Security
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The U.S. is at a point in its history where a federal agency is having an online slap flight with a famous rapper on a website that was spite-bought by the richest man on the planet.
Let's examine.
Cardi B is now feuding with the Department of Homeland Security on X after she said she and her fans would "jump ICE" — Immigration and Customs Enforcement — agents if they came to her concert to detain her fans.
ICE, which is under the umbrella of the DHS, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection have been the vanguard of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns during his second term. Their heavy-handed tactics — like brutalizing protesters and stalking around workplace, schools and courthouses to try to catch migrants at their most vulnerable — have left them deeply unpopular with a majority of Americans.
During a recent show in Palm Desert, California, the Grammy-winning Cardi B told her fans what they'd do if ICE agents showed at the event.
“If ICE come in here, we’re gonna jump they a****… I got some bear mace in the back. They ain’t taking my fans, b****. Let’s go!” she said, before launching into her hit song "I Like It."
A clip of Cardi B's comments went viral on Elon Musk’s X social media app and eventually made it back to the DHS.
“As long as she doesn’t drug and rob our agents, we’ll consider that an improvement over her past behavior,” the agency wrote on X, referencing that the rapper had previously admitted to drugging and robbing men before she made it big.
Cardi B fired back, invoking the DHS's own scandals.
“If we talking about drugs let’s talk about Epstein and friends drugging underage girls to rape them. Why yall don’t wanna talk about the Epstein files?” she wrote back, referencing the recently released — and in some places heavily-redacted — tranche of Epstein documents.
The black hole of modern politics has not only vacuumed up Cardi B, but her longtime nemesis Nicki Minaj. The two have had issues for nearly a decade, and now find themselves on opposite sides of national politics as well.
While Cardi B wants her fans to "jump" federal agents, Minaj has been literally holding hands with Trump on stage and insists he will not be bullied.
In December, Minaj appeared at a TurningPoint USA event with Erika Kirk, the widow of the organization's founder, Charlie Kirk.
Then, on January 28, Minaj spoke at the U.S. Treasury Department’s "Trump Accounts" Summit, where she held the president's bruised hand and promised no one would bully him.
“We’re not going to let them get away with bullying him, and … the smear campaigns," Minaj told the crowd. "It’s not going to work.”
She insisted at the time that she is “probably the president’s No. 1 fan, and that’s not going to change. And the hate, or what people have to say, does not affect me at all.”
Cardi B has been less vocal about politics over the last year. In September, she explained her reluctance to speak on political topics in a Billboard magazine interview.
"You know the reason why I've been so silent about politics?" she said. "There's a president that knows I've never supported him and it's like if I say something, he's not going to care. I tried to give people warnings and it is what it is. What I can do? What I can say?"

Attack on Muslim prayer protest ‘demands full explanation’: Albanese

Attack on Muslim prayer protest ‘demands full explanation’: Albanese
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has demanded an explanation from NSW police after officers broke up Muslim prayers at a chaotic protest in Sydney, also rebuking hard-left activists for defying laws designed to keep the protests peaceful and Jewish Australians safe.
Violent skirmishes broke out between demonstrators and police on Monday at a Sydney protest against the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog, which was criticised by pro-Palestine Labor backbenchers, the Greens and some independent MPs.
They said Albanese should not have invited a head of state who represents a nation accused of war crimes, and whose visit would compromise social cohesion.
In an interview on this masthead’s Inside Politics podcast, Albanese took a harder line on police actions at the protest than NSW Premier Chris Minns, who has repeatedly defended police. Nearly 30 people were arrested and 10 were charged. The police watchdog will investigate the actions of officers. Vision showed kneeling worshippers being pulled to their feet and then thrown to the ground.
“I’m concerned at the great deal of hurt which the Muslim community are feeling about the disruption of prayers,” Albanese said. “I think that is something that needs a full explanation. I know that that has caused a great deal of distress.”
In what turned into the latest flashpoint in more than two years of domestic brawling over the conflict in Gaza, the prime minister was condemned by a handful of teal independents this week for allowing the Herzog visit. The Jewish community asked for the head of the Jewish state to visit Bondi to mourn one of the deadliest attacks on Jews outside Israel in modern history.
The heat surrounding Herzog’s visit prompted NSW to use extraordinary powers to ban protests from the Sydney CBD to the eastern suburbs, where Sydney’s Jewish community is based. The rules give police more powers to move people on, to close specific locations and to search people.
The protesters were offered a nearby venue of Hyde Park, but Palestine Action Group organiser Josh Lees said that was inadequate because Town Hall was the most visible location. “We will not be shunted off to some park – out of sight, out of mind – on a dark weeknight,” he said this week.
Albanese described Lees as “far left” and sought to contrast activists from the many mainstream protesters who are peaceful and who hold genuine concern. The more hardline activists, Albanese said, had repeatedly shown disregard for social cohesion since October 7, 2023, including by picketing outside his Marrickville office and forcing it to be moved.
“The organisers were engaged with the police. They chose not to come up with or participate in a sensible way that would have ensured separation by having the meeting in Hyde Park and then walking to Belmore Park. It is beyond my comprehension why that would not be taken up, that suggestion by the New South Wales Police,” Albanese said.
“They need to comprehend that sometimes the actions don’t actually advance a cause. They undermine it, and that is what has occurred.
“You can have a strong position on the Middle East and on justice for Palestinians. And I support a Palestinian state being alongside the Israeli state, and my government is the first government to recognise Palestine. That doesn’t mean that you can’t empathise and understand that the Jewish community are really hurting in Australia.”
Albanese, who has also been criticised by conservatives for recognising a Palestinian state and for his response to the massacre, has passionately defended his decision to invite Herzog. He was compared unfavourably to Minns during the Bondi response. The NSW Labor figure was perceived to have acted with greater speed and more direct rhetoric, a charge Albanese rejects.
Herzog has no role in the military chain of command, although he has spoken in favour of the war effort, which one United Nations report found to constitute a genocide.
Herzog is a centre-left politician in Israel and “not a member of the Netanyahu government”, Albanese said, making him “the equivalent of Governor-General Sam Mostyn”.
“It doesn’t mean that, you know, I endorse all views or anything else. That’s not what it was about. Overwhelmingly, President Herzog, and I might say Ms Herzog as well, were comforting ... women who were grieving. That … was very moving,” he said.
“Can you imagine the message that that would send to the world, frankly, that we denied the head of state of Israel the opportunity, upon invitation, particularly from the families at Bondi, to come and grieve with them?”

I Watched 10 Wuthering Heights Adaptations.  Here’s What’s Worth Your Time
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

The mark of a great, tough book may not be how many literature classes it’s taught in but how many film or TV adaptations you can drape on its branches without breaking them. Dramatizations are tricky business: No film-viewing experience can match the way an individual imagination—yours or mine—brings a writer’s words to life. Yet dogged faithfulness isn’t the goal, either. A film can be spiritually faithful to a book even when it jettisons whole shards of plot. A good adaptation is a lover, not a fighter; it entwines itself with a work, rather than clawing away at it.
Emily Brontë’s 1847 wind-thrashed sycamore of a novel, Wuthering Heights, holds power even over those who haven’t read it. No wonder filmmakers have been drawn to it almost since the advent of movies, beginning with the first known version—a 1920 British silent, now lost—and ending, for now, with Emerald Fennell’s candy-colored bodice ripper starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi, which barely holds a dripping, gothic candle to any of the others (but more on that later). That means, whether you’ve read the middle Brontë sister’s novel or not, there’s a Wuthering Heights film or TV dramatization for you.
In fact, there are dozens, including a 1988 Japanese incarnation, a 2015 retelling set in a California high school, and several versions from India, a Bollywood musical among them. That said, not everyone loves Brontë’s book: For every reader who adores its intricate plot and discomfiting view of humanity, there’s at least one more who trudged through it in high school or college, never to return. Yet its polarizing effect may be the key to its magnetism; even those who dislike it have certainly absorbed some of its fragrant dolorousness into their bones. And although scholars are still debating whether Brontë set out to write a romance—she may have been more fixated on dissecting Victorian societal strictures—nearly everyone connects with the romantic, if dangerous, allure of the lovers at the heart of this story.
There’s Cathy, the spirited Yorkshire lass who’s fully in tune with the brutal, beautiful landscape in which she was born, though she also yearns for genteel comforts; and Heathcliff, the outsider of low birth who grows into a vengeful young man and, let’s just admit it, a smoldering symbol of unattainability and hotness. Did I mention that their imperishable bond involves necrophilia and an angry ghost? Though Brontë couldn’t have imagined the idea of movies in her lifetime, she created two characters—living, breathing phantoms of our own faults and desires—who were made for this particular interplay of shadow and light.
Let’s start with a Wuthering Heights that’s not for neophytes: Peter Kosminsky’s 1992 film features two dazzling stars—Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes—but it’s curiously inert on the screen. It also highlights some of the problems of adapting this elaborately plotted work, a highwire act on Brontë’s part that involves a multigenerational revenge scheme enmeshing Cathy’s daughter and Heathcliff’s son, individuals born of the two lovers’ mixing with outsiders. Unless you’re mounting a 10-episode miniseries, some plot points will have to go, but Kosminsky’s reading is just too truncated. And though Robert Fuest’s 1970 version, starring future James Bond Timothy Dalton, has the nastiest psychosexual undertones of the 10 adaptations addressed here, it’s still a dud: Dalton’s wily Heathcliff, though handsome, is not particularly alluring. For a compact yet full-bodied blast of the Wuthering Heights experience, try the relatively faithful 2009 BBC adaptation starring Tom Hardy and Charlotte Riley, who met on set and became a couple in real life. Their scenes together have an erotic earthiness unmatched by almost any other onscreen Heathcliff-Cathy combo.
Which Wuthering Heights best matches the story’s jagged, haunting landscape to the fighting spirit of its central lovers? That would be Andrea Arnold’s 2011 version, starring James Howson and Kaya Scodelario. Though Brontë described Heathcliff as being “dark,” and it’s generally assumed that he’s meant to be Romani—or perhaps Irish—Arnold entertains another possibility: in this chilly, bracing reading, Heathcliff is a Black man, a choice that reinforces his outsider status. And for sheer spookiness, Peter Sasdy’s 1967 made-for-BBC-TV Wuthering Heights—starring Angela Scoular and Deadwood’s Ian McShane—is calling across the moor. This four-part series—whose director would go on to make several Hammer horror films—demands patience; it’s one of the few adaptations that attempts loyalty to Brontë’s plot, and it sometimes feels stiff and stagy. But the fact that it exists only in a spectral black-and-white version (the original color version no longer exists) makes it weirdly haunting. And its sound design is killer: The howling winds of the countryside figure in nearly every scene, indoors and out. This is also the version that inspired Kate Bush to write “Wuthering Heights,” a song that captures, like the flame inside a well-cut jewel, the story’s romantic obsessiveness.
Brontë’s novel has so much atmospheric power that it can survive translation to settings beyond hardscrabble Yorkshire. New wave master Jacques Rivette’s languorously alluring 1985 version sets the story in the sun-dappled Cevennes region of France. And Luis Buñuel’s deliciously named 1954 adaptation, Abismos de pasión, generates even more heat: Irasema Dilián and Jorge Mistral bring shimmering midcentury glamour to a story set in a hot, shrubby yet frequently rainswept desert.
Yet of all the Wuthering Heights adaptations, two stand tall—if, befitting the story, they’re still admirably twisted. David Skynner’s 1998 version, made for British TV and starring Robert Cavanah and Orla Brady (as well as a young, pre–Pride and Prejudice Matthew Macfadyen), leans into Heathcliff’s cruelty by including crucial details—the way, for instance, he confesses to having killed a nestful of baby lapwings by placing a net over their nest, preventing their parents from reaching them. This Wuthering Heights is visually gratifying (you’ve never seen more fabulous moonlit curls than on Cathy’s ghost) while also being a little florid and suitably sick.
But the finest Wuthering Heights is also perhaps the most famous—and, in terms of plot, possibly the least complete. In his 1939 version, William Wyler shaves away huge chunks of the story. But his lead characters breathe on the screen as they do in no other adaptation: Merle Oberon captures both Cathy’s capacity for earthbound delight and her desire for earthly finery; you might disapprove of her, but you can’t hate her. And Laurence Olivier may be the most sympathetic of all onscreen Heathcliffs. With his stern brow and unyielding gaze, you know he’s bad news, but his vulnerability is implied. Olivier’s Heathcliff is the ultimate “I can fix him!” boyfriend—not a good model for reality, but deeply alluring in fiction.
Which brings us to Emerald Fennell’s fan-fiction Wuthering Heights. Fennell has said that her version is intended not as a faithful re-creation but a reimagining, a good starting point for any adaptation. (As the critic Robin Wood once put it, “To reduce a great novel to its plot is merely to reveal a total incapacity for reading it.”) But that doesn’t mean you have to love Fennell’s creation. Her Cathy and Heathcliff, played by the admittedly gorgeous Robbie and Elordi, play slapstick jokes on one another, including a bit involving raw eggs: this, and some running to and fro through the craggy countryside, is supposed to indicate their connection to nature’s raw power. There’s lots of clandestine sex—after being separated and reunited, this Heathcliff and Cathy go at it like cartoony rabbits—but no carnality. Their assignations bump along methodically, PowerPoint-style. Even Cathy’s wardrobe disappoints: after she leaves the gloomy homestead where she and Heathcliff were raised and moves into her rich husband’s house, she’s decked out in a series of stiff, shiny dresses that look to have emerged from the $1.99-per-yard fabric bin, beloved by broke community-theater costumers everywhere.
Fennell also doesn’t bother dramatizing the way Heathcliff digs up, and embraces, Cathy’s corpse, a missed cinematic opportunity if ever there were one. And there are no ghosts here, though you will see a random hanged corpse with an erection. Brontë’s Wuthering Heights is a bleak book, but it’s not an ugly one: beneath its cloud cover of misanthropy, there’s feral, wildflower grace. Fennell has tossed all of that out, substituting her own unimaginative vision, plus a bunch of crappy dresses. A pretty dismal Valentine to a book a filmmaker ostensibly loves, this Wuthering Heights is hate-reading in movie form.

UN Security Council strongly condemns deadly mosque attack in Pakistan
'The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,' says statement
HAMILTON, Canada
The UN Security Council on Friday condemned in the "strongest terms" the Feb. 6 suicide bombing that targeted a Shia mosque in Pakistan's capital Islamabad.
"The members of the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms the heinous and cowardly suicide bombing terrorist attack ... This reprehensible act of terrorism resulted in the grievous loss of at least 32 Pakistani nationals and 92 injured," a statement by members of the Security Council members said.
Extending condolences to the families of the victims and wishing a "speedy and full recovery" to those injured, the statement said: "The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security."
"The members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organizers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice," it added, urging all member states "to cooperate actively with the Government of Pakistan in this regard."
Reiterating that "any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed," the members also noted "the need for all States to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts."
At least 32 people were killed, and 169 others injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Khadija Tul Kubra Imambargah last week.
Pakistan said it arrested four facilitators, with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi saying "terrorist organizations are operating from Afghanistan," and accused India of providing them financial support.
Both India and Afghanistan have denied any involvement in the attack.
The bombing was the second major attack in Islamabad in less than three months.

One in three French car manufacturing jobs was lost in dramatic 13-year decline

Employment in the French automotive industry fell from 425,500 in 2010 to 286,800 in 2023, representing a loss of nearly 139,000 full-time jobs or 33%.
According to a report released Thursday by the French National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the workforce in the country's automotive industry diminished by a third between 2010 and 2023.
This includes manufacturers, equipment makers and other suppliers, with the bulk of the disruption being caused by car manufacturers who cut 46,000 jobs during the 13-year period observed in the study.
Falling sales due to Chinese competition, among other factors, exacerbated the issue and led to consequent factory closures and relocations.
Renault and Stellantis, which includes over a dozen car brands such as Citroën, Fiat and Peugeot, set up operations in other parts of Europe where labour is cheaper such as Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Portugal and Slovakia.
The research conducted by the INSEE was the first to identify all types of industrial production related to the French automotive sector and depicts a bleak scenario.
The data becomes far worse when contrasted with the numbers from the non-automotive industry, where the workforce remained stable with only a 1% decrease.
Dire future for the French automotive industry
The contraction and consequent relocation of the French car manufacturing business has negatively affected several associated industries in the country and since 2023 the trend has only accelerated.
Parts suppliers in France were even more impacted by the relocation of the car manufacturers, with equipment and component makers reducing their workforce in the country by 31.5%, representing a loss of 92,700 full-time jobs.
Additionally, Michelin, Valeo, Forvia, Bosch, Lisi and Dumarey are all in the process of closing sites in France.
The contrast is stark between the jobs dependent on the success of the French automotive industry and the employment numbers for the non-associated sections of the same industrial sectors.
Manufacturers of rubber and plastics for the automotive industry have lost 43% of their workforce, while those outside the automotive sector only saw a 3% decline.
The same disparity can be observed in the metallurgy sector, where a 42% decrease in jobs was noted for car-related production but, again, only a 3% decline in employment for other parts of the same sector.
For metal products there is a 27% fall in the automotive-based sector but jobs are virtually stable in other areas.
Even more striking, in chemicals there is a 29% decline in employment for automotives but a 19% increase in jobs servicing other businesses.
Ultimately, these clear-cut disparities underscore a deepening structural crisis, illustrating how the French automotive sector is rapidly decoupling from the stability of the broader industrial landscape, with no signs of recovery and many indicators of aggravation.

Czech president says Europe cannot yet replace US role in NATO defense
Pavel calls for stronger European pillar with coordinated timelines to avoid security gaps if Washington reduces presence
MUNICH
Czech President Petr Pavel said Europe is currently unable to replace the US' military role within NATO if Washington were to withdraw its forces, warning that closer coordination is needed as transatlantic defense ties face growing strain and uncertainty.
Speaking to Anadolu on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Pavel said the US remains central to the alliance’s security architecture.
"The United States is presenting significant part of NATO defense, and if all US presence and capabilities are withdrawn today, then we could say Europe will not be able to substitute this gap," he said.
His remarks come amid renewed debates in Europe about strategic autonomy and concerns that Washington could scale back its commitments, increasing pressure on European allies to boost their own capabilities.
Still, Pavel stressed the 32-member alliance operates through partnership and consultation rather than abrupt shifts.
"As partners and allies, we always work in coordination," he said.
He voiced support for strengthening what he described as the European pillar of NATO, provided any transition is carefully managed and communicated in advance.
“I truly believe that the idea of strengthening the European pillar of NATO will be well coordinated in a way that whatever capacity United States would like to withdraw, they will inform us about the timeframe, which will be realistic enough for European countries to build our own enabler so that we can effectively defend ourselves even if United States decide to withdraw partially or totally their presence from Europe," he said.
He indicated that with realistic timelines and preparation, Europe could gradually assume greater responsibility for its own defense even if the US decides to reduce its presence.

UK ad agencies undergo their biggest exodus of staff as AI threatens industry

UK advertising agencies had their biggest annual exodus of staff last year, led by younger workers, as artificial intelligence tools threaten to replace workers and force the industry to cut jobs and costs.
Staff numbers at creative agencies, which are facing acute pressure from the rollout of AI tools that reduce or even replace the need for agency staff, fell more than 14% in 2025.
The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising (IPA), which has been reporting on staffing in the UK ad industry since 1959, said it was the biggest year-on-year slump since it started separately reporting staff numbers at creative and media agencies in 2004.
The IPA, which is made up of member agencies that handle more than 85% of the UK’s £22bn annual ad spend, said the total number of employees fell to 24,963, down from 26,787 in 2024.
At creative agencies, many of which are based in the industry’s heartland of London, staff numbers fell by more than 2,000, from 14,775 to 12,659.
The decline has been particularly pronounced among younger workers, with the number of employees aged 25 or under falling by 19.2% last year, as the march of AI either cost jobs or led many to re-evaluate their long-term prospects in the industry. Staff numbers in that demographic fell from 3,632 to 2,936.
The overall figures showed that almost 60% of staff that left agencies last year chose to resign.
The IPA said 24% of agencies expected to cut jobs directly as a result of AI this year – a threefold increase on the number that did owing to the technology in 2025.
There was a 41% decrease in advertised jobs across all levels of seniority in the industry last year, led by a reduction of almost half at creative agencies.
Creative agencies are also giving up on graduate recruitment – as trainees, apprentices or school-leaver apprentices – with just 43% saying they took on any as employees last year. This is a considerable slump from the 56% reported in 2024.
“These numbers confirm that the agency model is gasping for air,” said James Kirkham, the founder of the agency Iconic. “The mistake everyone is making is still treating AI like an efficiency play – shave a few numbers, strip some cost, reduce headcount to get the same output but with fewer people.”
He added: “Death by a thousand cuts with a spreadsheet is not the transformation needed. The real, and only, move is proper creative coexistence. Agencies need to learn to co-create with AI, not outsource the process to these tools, and then they will find they can punch above their weight.”
WPP, which dropped out of the FTSE 100 last year for the first time in almost three decades as it struggles to retain clients and catch up with the AI and data capabilities of rivals, is expected to announce sweeping changes to its creative agency operations later this month.
The group, which has already scrapped prestigious agencies such as J Walter Thompson and Young & Rubicam, is to bring its three remaining ones – Ogilvy, VML and AKQA – together under the banner of WPP Creative.
After the publication of the IPA figures, Trent Patterson, the chief executive of Publicis London, turned to LinkedIn to remind the ad sector that the French-headquartered group continued to perform strongly compared with rivals.
He said the IPA figures were a reminder of how challenging the market was for “many talented people at the moment”.
“We’re fortunate to be in a moment of real momentum and we don’t take that for granted,” he added, in a post that contained information about a range of roles for which the London agency was hiring.
Paul Bainsfair, the director general of the IPA, said the fall in staff numbers, the rate of staff turnover and the steep fall in entry-level roles “raises real questions about future capability, particularly as AI reshapes skills and ways of working”.

Man admits rape of former Conservative councillor’s ex-wife
Wiltshire Police said Hamilton’s offences relate to wider criminal proceedings involving Joanne Young, who has waived her right to anonymity

A man has admitted raping and sexually assaulting the ex-wife wife of a former councillor.
Dean Hamilton, 47, admitted one charge of assault by penetration, two of sexual assault and one of rape relating to June 30 2015 at Winchester Crown Court on Friday.
Wiltshire Police said Hamilton’s offences relate to wider criminal proceedings involving Joanne Young, who has waived her right to anonymity.
Judge Christopher Parker KC granted Hamilton conditional bail ahead of sentencing at a later date.
He told the defendant, of no fixed abode, to expect a “very lengthy prison sentence in due course”.
Her former husband, Philip Young, 49, previously admitted multiple charges including rape, sexual assault, assault by penetration and voyeurism.
Young, formerly of Swindon, but now of Amberley Road, Enfield, also admitted multiple counts of administering a substance to his then-wife with intent to stupefy her – with all offences taking place between 2010 and 2023.
He admitted 48 of the 56 charges against him, pleading guilty to 14 counts of voyeurism, 11 of rape, 11 of administering a substance with intent, seven of assault by penetration, four of sexual assault and one of publishing obscene articles.
Young also published more than 500 intimate images and videos of his ex-wife and recorded her doing private acts for his own sexual gratification without her consent between 2010 and 2024.
Young, who served as a Conservative Swindon borough councillor for Covingham and Nythe between 2007 and 2010, pleaded not guilty to eight further charges.
He denied three charges of making indecent images of children, alleged to have occurred in July 2024.
Young also pleaded not guilty to possessing a prohibited image and four charges of possessing an extreme pornographic image between January 2019 and January 2024.
Four other men have appeared in court charged with sexual offences against Ms Young.
Norman Macksoni, of Wood End Close in Sharnbrook, Bedfordshire, 47; and Richard Wilkins, 61, of Toothill, Swindon, Wiltshire, have both pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and one charge of possessing an extreme pornographic image.
Wilkins has also denied one charge of assault by penetration.
Connor Sanderson Doyle, 31, of Crofton Road, Swindon, has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault by penetration and sexual touching.
Mohammed Hassan, 37, of Torun Way in Swindon, has pleaded not guilty to sexual touching.
Police are also appealing for help to identify another man wanted in connection with the case, describing him as being of large build, with scarring on the back of his head and a distinctive tattoo on the left side of his chest.
Young, Macksoni, Wilkins, Doyle and Hassan are due to stand trial in October.

Stubb: Putin fails strategically
This was stated by the President of Finland, Alexander Stubb, during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform’s correspondent reports.
As Stubb noted, he would not give advice to Ukrainians, but he believes they will win this war.
"First of all, Putin has failed strategically. He wanted to make Ukraine Russian, it became European. He wanted to prevent the enlargement of NATO, he got Finland and Sweden. And he wanted to keep our defense expenditure down, and it's now going up to 5%," Stubb emphasized.
He stressed that Russia is also losing in the military dimension. He noted that Russia's territorial gains on the front in Ukraine are minimal. At the same time, in December last year alone, Ukraine managed to eliminate about 34,000 Russian soldiers in just one month, while Russia was unable to compensate for these losses with new recruitment.
"So my answer is – just keep on what you are doing, and at the end of the day you will prevail and win this war," Stubb addressed Ukrainians.
As previously reported, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for a reset of the transatlantic partnership, acknowledging a deep divide between Europe and the United States.
The 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13, a leading global forum for discussing key international security challenges.
About 1,000 representatives from nearly 120 countries are taking part in the three-day event, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, and more than 30 defense ministers, as well as leaders of over 40 international organizations.
The Ukrainian delegation is headed by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Boss of P&O Ferries owner DP World leaves over Jeffrey Epstein emails
- DP World, the global logistics and transport giant and owner of P&O Ferries, has removed its chairman, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, following the publication of messages exchanged with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
- Essa Kazim has been appointed as the new chairman of the Dubai-based firm, which also operates major container ports in London and Southampton, with Yuvraj Narayan named as the group chief executive officer.
- The decision followed intense pressure on DP World after the US justice department released fresh files detailing communications between Sulayem and Epstein.
- These messages included an email from Epstein referencing a 'torture video', and Sulayem's emails discussing attempts to meet a supermodel, sending links to fetish porn websites, and describing women.
- DP World stated the new appointments support its strategy for sustainable growth, while the company had previously faced criticism in 2022 over P&O Ferries sacking 800 staff.

US inflation cools more than expected, kindling hopes of Fed rate cut
The consumer price index rose 2.4 per cent year-on-year, the lowest level since May, though affordability concerns still weigh on households
Consumer inflation in the US cooled slightly more than expected in January, government data showed Friday, as energy prices dipped.
Analysts say the figure allows the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates again later this year, but warn that policymakers need to see sustained improvement to do so – despite US President Donald Trump’s insistence that there is virtually no inflation.
The consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.4 per cent year-on-year, the Department of Labour said, down from December’s 2.7 per cent and slightly below analysts’ median forecast. This was the lowest level since May 2025.
The White House swiftly lauded the report, with deputy press secretary Kush Desai saying it proves that Trump “has defeated” an uptick in inflation that took place under his predecessor Joe Biden.
Yet, affordability worries have come to the fore in recent months as price increases in areas like food weighed on households, and as Trump’s tariffs flowed through the world’s biggest economy.
Although tariffs have not triggered a broad inflation surge, firms have reported higher business costs. Many companies, however, tried to soften the blow by stocking up on inventory ahead of planned levy hikes and avoided passing on additional costs in full to consumers.

MSC: Germany's Merz urges new 'trans-Atlantic partnership'
February 13, 2026German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged a new "trans-Atlantic partnership" during his address at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday.
He stressed not even the US was powerful enough to go it alone in an increasingly tough world.
'The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours'
Merz referenced a speech by US Vice President JD Vance during last year's MSC, where Vance chided Europeans over the state of free speech on the continent and migration.
"A rift has opened up between Europe and the United States. Vice President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago," Merz said.
"He was right. The culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours," Merz said, referring to US President Donald Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan. "Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade."
The Trump administration in December imposed visa entry bans on five prominent European figures over accusations they are "censoring" Americans online. Trump in his second term also announced 20% tariffs on EU goods until a trade framework deal was reached later in the year between the two sides.
Trump's push for the US acquisition of Greenland, a territory of NATO member Denmark, has also prompted alarm in Europe. Merz said that Danish Prime Minister Mette Fredriksen "knows that she can rely on European solidarity. There is no limitation to that."
US not powerful enough to go it alone in era of 'great power rivalry'
Merz said the old international rule-based order was being destroyed.
"This order, however, imperfect it was even at its best, no longer exists in that form," Merz said, speaking of a dangerous new era of "great power politics" where freedoms are "endangered."
Merz's comments come as Russia's invasion of Ukraine will soon enter its fifth year. China is also becoming more aggressive toward the self-governing island of Taiwan, which Beijing views as its territory.
"Being a part of NATO is not only Europe's competitive advantage," Merz said. "It's also the United States' competitive advantage. So let's repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together."
"In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone," the German chancellor said.
Merz meets with Rubio on MSC sidelines
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is leading a group of officials from the Trump administration to the Munich Security Conference. Rubio is often seen as more diplomatic and less abrasive towards Europe than JD Vance.
Merz and German Foreign Minister Wadephul met with Rubio on the first day of the MSC.
"The United States and Germany are close friends & steadfast partners," Wadephul said in a post on X. "Today's meeting with Secretary Rubio and the chancellor reaffirmed our strong trans-Atlantic ties, based on our shared interests, and our agreement on many key issues — including a strong NATO & a strong Europe."
Also in attendance at the MSC are Democrats such as California Governor Gavin Newsom, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Arizona Senator Ruben Gallago who may push for the Europeans to take a tougher stance towards the Trump administration.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will also take part in this year's MSC.

A sexually transmitted ringworm is spreading in one US state
It can take months to treat the fungal infections, which were first reported in the U.S. in 2024
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Minnesota is seeing the largest outbreak of sexually transmitted ringworm in the U.S., with infections disproportionately affecting men who have sex with men.
More than 30 confirmed or suspected cases of the fungal infection have been reported in the state since last July, according to the Minnesota Department of Health, and all were within the Twin Cities metropolitan area.
The ringworm - known as trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII, or “TMVII” - was first reported in New York City in June 2024.
Minnesota’s Health Department said that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is aware of other sporadic cases in larger cities across the U.S.
California’s Department of Public Health previously said the first patient with TMVII had traveled to California before he was diagnosed in New York.
TMVII has been circulating in Europe and among people who traveled to Southeast Asia for sex tourism for several years, but is not currently considered widespread in the U.S.
A coin-like rash
TMVII is the only known sexually transmitted fungal infection, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
Sometimes confused for eczema or psoriasis, TMVII spreads through skin-to-skin contact or exposure to fungal spores. The ringworm can spread through genital contact, as well as to the face, bottom, torso, arms and legs.
It can cause painful and itchy red, coin-like rashes, sometimes with bumps or pimples on top.
Infections can vary in severity, sometimes leading to complications even with treatment.
Patients may see lesions and open sores that increase the risk for secondary bacterial infections and lead to harmful inflammation.
“Some patients might develop painful and persistent rashes that can lead to scarring or worsening infections that need to be treated with antibiotics,” health officials warned last month.
A lengthy treatment process
Diagnosing TMVII infection requires advanced testing, although most labs have trouble distinguishing TMVII from two other fungal infections known as T. mentagrophytes and T. interdigitale, according to the CDC.
Patients may require weeks or even months of oral medication, and people should avoid using steroid creams, as they will worsen TMVII infection.
To prevent exposure, people should avoid sexual contact if they or their partner has a new rash and avoid sharing personal items, such as clothing, towels, bedding and razors.
Items should be washed and dried on high heat, and fungal spores can be killed with common disinfectants or strong detergents.
People who believe they have a rash should make sure it is covered with bandages or clothing and wash their hands with soap after touching the infected area to reduce the risk of spread to other areas of the body.
“While the overall public health risk is low, state health officials say MSM, people who use anonymous apps, and people with a history of sexually transmitted infections may be at higher risk,” according to the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.

From Arena Mexico to the World Cup, a wrestling-mask boom is taking shape
A Mexico City mask maker is gearing up for a World Cup sales boom
- Bookmark
Guadalupe Zuñiga has been around wrestling masks for as long as she can remember.
It is a relationship that began when she watched her father performing in the ring and she has now transformed it into a business eagerly awaiting the start of soccer's 2026 World Cup.
The 42-year-old Zuñiga, daughter of the famous late wrestler Angel Azteca, owns a factory in the popular barrio of Iztapalapa on the outskirts of Mexico City, where her team produce an average of 300 wrestling masks a week.
“We expect a very large increase in sales with so many foreigners because wrestling and masks are a Mexican symbol. We hope the stores we work with will ask us for more of this product,” Zúñiga told The Associated Press.
Zuñiga works closely with well-known wrestlers like Tinieblas, Blue Panther, Ultimo Guerrero and Mascara Sagrada. She produces customised masks that are hand made and can take up to two days to make.
“There are more collectors now. Fifteen years ago there were not many people saying, ‘I have 30 masks at my place’, now you have fans with 50 or 100 masks at home,” she said. “I think in the past six years the business has grown. You have tourists coming and they stop by the shops that sell them to get one.”
Around the Arena Mexico wrestling venue, and other tourist spots around the city like the Angel de la Independencia, there are cheaper versions of the masks that sell for as low as 50 pesos (around $3). Custom-made versions can sell for hundreds of dollars depending on design.
Like Zúñiga, the street vendors outside the Arena Mexico are also aware sales are going to go up during the World Cup.
“We always have many foreign customers, but we expect many more during the World Cup. We’ll try to give them a nice souvenir to take back to their countries,” said Clementina López, who sells masks near the Arena Mexico.
Mexico will host 13 World Cup matches. Guadalajara and Monterrey have four games apiece and the capital Mexico City has five.
Authorities expect five million tourists during the tournament.
History behind the masks
Late Mexican writer Carlos Monsivais, a fan of Lucha Libre freestyle wrestling, said wrestlers liked to use masks because it provided them with an intimidating face.
“The mask has magic. It’s like having two identities,” wrestler Star Black said. “We can lead a double life, one in the ring and another outside of it.”
It is believed the first person to wear a mask in Mexico was American wrestler Corbin James Massey, who in 1933 lost on his debut under the nickname “Cyclone Mackey”.
A year later he wanted to fight again but did not wish to be recognized so he asked for a mask made by Antonio Martinez, a local craftsman.
Massey then started wrestling under the alias “Maravilla Enmascarada” (Masked Marvel) to start a tradition that was followed in 1938 by fellow competitor Jesus “Murcielago” Velazquez of Mexico and then in the 1950s by icons Santo, Blue Demon and Huracan Ramirez.
Crossover to other sports
It is still unclear the exact moment when fans started wearing masks at soccer matches, but that sport and the lucha libre are two favorite pastimes for Mexicans.
Adidas, the German clothing company that sponsors the Mexican national team, created a jersey inspired by Rey Mysterio, a Mexican-American wrestler popular on both sides of the border, for the 2014 World Cup.
But soccer stadiums are not the only places where masks are popular. At the Mexican Formula 1 Grand Prix two years ago, local driver Sergio Pérez and Max Verstappen wore one and George Russell did the same last year.
For the 2024 race, Perez also wore a special helmet that featured a wrestling mask.
“This helmet is special because I really love Mexican culture and lucha libre. We love lucha libre, I’m a wrestler and I wanted to add a mask to it,” Pérez said at the time.
The helmet featured a blue mask with a red-eye mask on top. It also displayed the words “Minister of Defense” and “Never Give Up.”
“When I showed it to my children, they really liked it,” Perez added.
Another high-profile athlete known for donning a wrestling mask is the Seattle Mariners outfielder Randy Arozarena, who wore Ignacio Uribe Mistico’s mask in the dugout during Mexican team games as a lucky charm. He said the wrestler's “mystical magic” could help them win.
Professional wrestlers who wear them in Mexico are aware of the euphoria surrounding the marks outside the ring.
“It’s no secret that where you see a person wearing a mask, you see a Mexican," professional wrestler Magnus said. "You see it in soccer and baseball. People wear masks because that’s what characterizes us.
“It’s a great gesture that lucha libre is crossing borders. It’s a sign of respect because they see us as heroes and it also helps them express their emotions.”
Zúñiga’s factory made the masks for Perez, Verstappen and Russell and more work is coming her way.
“I’ve already had special requests for the World Cup, there are several designs that we are working on. We’ve ordered certain fabrics to make special products, special models for the World Cup,” Zúñiga said. “I cannot show them to you, but they are going to be very special”.

In Munich, IAEA Chief Says Nuclear Inspection Regime With Iran 'Technically Possible'

01:54:42 KST

Developing a inspection regime to underpin any new Iran nuclear arrangement is "absolutely possible," though extremely difficult, the head of the United Nations atomic watchdog said.
Speaking at a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Raphael Grossi, of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said Iran's nuclear landscape had changed drastically following the US bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities in Fordow, Isfahan, and Natanz last year.
"This is absolutely possible, and it is terribly difficult, but it is technically possible and it is politically even viable," Grossi said on February 13, referring to the challenge of establishing a credible inspection regime.
The physical infrastructure of Iran's nuclear program has been largely damaged, he said, and that future monitoring would need to focus not only on what remains but on how Tehran's nuclear capabilities could evolve going forward.
Grossi noted that while agency inspectors have returned to Iran and are monitoring all undamaged facilities, they still lack access to sites struck during the bombing.
His remarks come as diplomatic engagement between Tehran and Washington continues. The United States, meanwhile, has bolstered its military presence, deploying a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East in preparation for a potential strike.
Grossi underscored the delicate balance facing negotiators: upholding Iran's right to peaceful nuclear activity under the Nuclear Non‑Proliferation Treaty while ensuring robust verification to build confidence and avoid escalation.
"We know perfectly well what needs to be checked and how to check it," he said, adding that light may be visible "at the end of the tunnel" if progress continues.
Iran insists that any agreement with the United States can only focus on the nuclear program, rejecting demands to negotiate restrictions on its ballistic missiles.
White House special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi held indirect talks in Oman on February 6. Both sides said more talks would be held soon, though no date has been set.

The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has rejected Vladyslav Heraskevych’s claim against the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, Suspilne Sport has said.
The court’s decision was made at 17:15 local time: Heraskevych’s claim against the IOC and IBSF has been rejected.
"We confirm that freedom of expression is allowed at the Olympics, but not at the competition venue. The judge listened to the arguments of both sides and made a decision in accordance with the IOC guidelines," CAS Secretary General Matthew Reid said.

Heraskevych loses appeal, but already knew his chance of racing in Olympics is over
CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy (AP) — Ukrainian skeleton athlete Vladyslav Heraskevych took his case to sport’s highest court on Friday, detailing the reasons why he wanted to race at the Milan Cortina Olympics in a helmet that paid tribute to his country’s war victims.
The arbitrator was moved by his story but ruled against him anyway, denying him his last chance for a win of any kind at this year’s Olympics.
The Court of Arbitration for Sport denied Heraskevych’s appeal of his disqualification from the men’s skeleton race, agreeing with the International Olympic Committee and the sliding sport’s federation that his plan to wear a helmet showing the faces of more than 20 Ukrainian coaches and athletes killed since Russia invaded their country four years ago would violate Olympic rules.
“The court sided with the IOC and upheld the decision that an athlete could be disqualified from the Olympic Games without actual misconduct, without a technical or safety threat, and before the start,” wrote Yevhen Pronin, Heraskevych’s attorney.
CAS said the sole arbitrator who heard the case sided with IOC policy about what athletes at an Olympics can say on a field of play — and that the “memory helmet” Heraskevych brought to the Milan Cortina Games would not align with the rules.
The arbitrator, CAS said, “found these limitations reasonable and proportionate,” especially since Heraskevych could show his helmet away from the racing surface, such as in interview areas and on social media. Heraskevych also wore the helmet in training runs.
CAS added that the arbitrator “is fully sympathetic to Mr. Heraskevych’s commemoration and to his attempt to raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people, and Ukrainian athletes because of the war.”
The appeal, which Heraskevych felt he would win, was largely moot anyway. He was disqualified from the competition 45 minutes before its start on Thursday, and whatever CAS said on Friday wouldn’t have changed that.
“Looks like this train has left,” Heraskevych said after Friday’s hearing, knowing there was no way he could race. He left Cortina d’Ampezzo’s Olympic Village on Thursday night with no plans to return.
He was blocked from racing by the IOC and the International Bobsled and Skeleton Federation on Thursday after the slider and his father emerged from a last-minute, last-ditch meeting with IOC President Kirsty Coventry — who was unable to get Heraskevych to change his mind.
His disqualification was justified, Coventry reiterated Friday. The IOC made its decision, one that moved Coventry to tears, off the guidelines for athlete expression at the Olympics.
They say, in part, “the focus on the field of play during competitions and official ceremonies must be on celebrating athletes’ performances.” Heraskevych never made it to the field of play — not in competition, anyway.
“I think that he in some ways understood that but was very committed to his beliefs, which I can respect,” Coventry said. “But sadly, it doesn’t change the rules.”
The IOC contends the rule is in place for multiple reasons, including protecting the athletes from pressure from their own countries or others about using Olympic platforms to make statements.
“I never expected it to be such a big scandal,” Heraskevych said.
He also said he found his accreditation for the games being taken away, then returned in short order on Thursday in what seemed like a goodwill gesture, was puzzling.
“A mockery,” he said.
CAS did agree that Heraskevych should keep his accreditation.
Heraskevych said he felt his disqualification fed into Russian propaganda, noting he and other Ukrainian athletes have seen Russian flags at events at these games — even though they are not allowed by Olympic rule. He has previously spoken out against the IOC’s decision to allow Russians and Belarusians to compete at Milan Cortina as “neutral” athletes and said the IOC empowered Russia by awarding it the 2014 Sochi Games.
He also wondered why other tributes from these Olympics, such as U.S. figure skater Maxim Naumov displaying a photo of his late parents — killed in a plane crash last year — have been permitted without penalty.
Italian snowboard competitor Roland Fischnaller had a small Russian flag image on the back of his helmet during these games and Israeli skeleton athlete Jared Firestone wore a kippah with the names of the 11 athletes and coaches who were killed representing that country during the 1972 Munich Olympics.
Pronin wrote that IOC representatives at Friday’s hearing said “they were not punished because they did not declare this in advance, but did it after the fact, so there was no point in disqualifying them.”
The IOC said those cases were not in violation of any rules. Naumov showed his photo in the kiss-and-cry area and not while he was actually on the ice, Fischnaller’s helmet was a tribute to all the past Olympic sites he competed at with Sochi included, and Firestone’s kippah “was covered by a beanie,” IOC spokesman Mark Adams said.
The IOC offered Heraskevych the chance to compete with a different helmet and bring the tribute one through the interview area after his runs. He also could have worn a black armband, which the IOC typically bans. It just didn’t want him making a statement by competing in the helmet.
“I think it’s the wrong side of history for the IOC,” Heraskevych said.

Top Saudi diplomat points to breakdown of Eurocentric rules-based world order

01:50:59 KST

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The breakdown of the Eurocentric rules-based order became clear to many countries long before the current conflicts, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud said, addressing the Munich Security Conference.
"Obviously it came out of the crisis in Europe and World War I that World War II is what gave us the United Nations and the foundations of that world order, so fair enough, there was a certain Eurocentric or transatlantic focus. But the reality is, many of us have seen the breakdown of that rules-based order and the reality that might makes right being very much front and center well before the crisis," he pointed out.
According to the top Saudi diplomat, many countries have long been convinced that the current system of international relations "isn’t working, that it hasn’t delivered." He noted that the breakdown of international law had largely affected developing nations in the past two decades, while Europe and the US could stand aside. In his view, the conflict in Ukraine made it clear.

Palestinian paramedic detained in Gaza dies in Israeli prison
A Palestinian paramedic from Gaza has died while in Israeli detention amid reports of torture and medical negligence.
Hatem Ismail Rayyan, a 59-year-old paramedic, was pronounced dead at the Negev prison, a press statement from the Commission of Detainees’ Affairs and the Palestinian Prisoners Society announced on Thursday evening.
Rayyan was detained by Israeli forces on 27 December 2024 from the premises of Gaza’s Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahia, alongside his injured son Moaz Rayyan who remains in Israeli detention.
The hospital had been under siege by the Israeli military and then was forcibly closed by Israeli authorities after they stormed the premises at the end of December. Israel set the facilities on fire, forcibly removing and arresting dozens of patients and staff.
At the time, Kamal Adwan Hospital had been the last major functioning medical facility serving northern Gaza.
Dr. Hussam Abu Safia, the hospital’s director, was detained on the same day as Rayyan.
According to his family, Rayyan had suffered a stroke shortly before his detention, yet chose to continue delivering medical assistance until his detention.
The two Palestinian organisations that announced his death said they hold Israel "fully responsible" for what happened to him, renewing calls for international human rights organisations to investigate mounting evidence of torture and abuse at the hands of Israeli authorities.
Dr. Muneer Alboursh, the director of Gaza’s health ministry, condemned Rayyan’s death and said, "Prisons have become another arena of suffering, marked by allegations of torture, starvation, medical neglect, and prolonged detention without trial".
Israeli prison authorities have not issued an official statement detailing the circumstances around his death.
Rayyan is the third medical officer to have died in Israeli detention.
At least 88 Palestinian detainees have died since Israel’s war on Gaza began in October 2023, 52 of whom were arrested in Gaza.
Mounting evidence of torture and violations
Human rights organisations have raised concerns over signs of torture seen on prisoners’ bodies after they were returned to Gaza by Israel during prisoner exchanges. Dozens of other bodies of deceased detainees are still being withheld by Israeli authorities.
Israeli NGO B'Tselem says many detention facilities have turned into "torture camps" with Palestinians subjected to sexual, physical and psychological abuse, inhuman detention conditions, deliberate starvation and denial of medical care.
At least 325 Palestinian detainees have died since 1967, not including the toll among prisoners reported to have been killed in the field, something which groups like the PPS argue amount to conclusive evidence of systematic field executions.
Rayyan’s death comes amid accelerated efforts by the far-right government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to push for a bill formalising the execution of Palestinian detainees.
The bill mandates the death penalty for prisoners convicted of murder on crimes that Israel defines as having a "terrorist motivation" as part of a legal framework that applies exclusively to Palestinians.
More than 9,300 prisoners are currently being held in Israeli prisons, an estimated 50% of whom are currently held without trial, either under arbitrary administrative detention orders or under the classification of being so-called "unlawful combatants".

Inflation expectations to decline slowly, gradual rate cut needed — Bank of Russia

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The decline in inflationary expectations will occur rather slowly, requiring a smoother trajectory for reduction of the key rate, Russian Central Bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said.
"Over the past four years, when inflation targets were not met due to inflationary shocks, inflation expectations became entrenched at elevated levels. Their decline will occur quite slowly, including due to the increased rate of adjustment of regulated services and tariffs in the coming years," she told a press conference following the meeting of the regulator’s Board of Directors.
"All this will require us, all things being equal, to pursue a smoother trajectory for reduction of the key rate. It will enable us to return stable inflation to 4% in the second half of the year, and to bring the economy back to a balanced state," Nabiullina added.
Meanwhile Russian households’ inflation expectations remained unchanged this January, while the price expectations of businesses, after the January surge, fell significantly in February and even returned to October levels, she noted.

Palestinian FM urges empowerement of govt to run Gaza administration

Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shaheen on Friday called for empowering the Palestinian Authority to govern the Gaza Strip, saying the government is prepared to take over responsibilities and warning that continued marginalization would undermine any postwar arrangements.
Speaking during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Shaheen said the Palestinian leadership has long been planning for the "day after” in Gaza and is not starting from scratch.
"Yes, we’re ready,” she said in response to a question about timelines for taking over Gaza’s governance. "We’ve been thinking about the day after in Gaza for some time. We’ve had plans that were endorsed by the Arab League, the Muslim world and the international community at large.”
Shaheen said the key requirement is for the Palestinian government to be empowered to carry out its responsibilities, arguing that the current sidelining of the Palestinian Authority is "unsustainable.”
"Today, the Palestinian government is marginalized, and you cannot continue marginalizing a government,” she said, adding that developments in Gaza are inseparable from those in the West Bank.
She pointed to practical governance issues, including population records and passport issuance, which are administered through the West Bank, saying this underscores the need to involve the Palestinian Authority from the outset.
"If you talk about the population registry, you need to go to the West Bank. If you talk about issuing passports, you need to go to the West Bank,” she said. "So you might as well bring in the Palestinian Authority early on, rather than in the middle of the process or at the end.”
Her remarks come as senior Palestinian officials stress that Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem constitute a single political and geographic unit and reject alternative governance arrangements that bypass the established Palestinian leadership.
Last week, Bassem al-Salhi, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), said that there is "no political communication” between the PLO and the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG).
"The PLO, as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, sees that its political and legal jurisdiction over the West Bank and Gaza has not changed, even under Trump’s Gaza plan or the establishment of the ‘Board of Peace’”, he told Anadolu.
"Gaza, the West Bank and Jerusalem form one political and geographic unit that cannot be divided,” he added.
The NCAG is a nonpolitical body tasked with overseeing daily civil services in the enclave.
It comprises 11 Palestinian figures and is led by Ali Shaath. The committee began operating from the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in mid-January but has yet to start work inside Gaza, where about 2.4 million Palestinians face severe humanitarian conditions.
The committee is one of four bodies proposed to manage a transitional phase in Gaza, alongside a Board of Peace, a Gaza Executive Council and an International Stabilization Force, under a plan put forward by US President Donald Trump.
It was part of Trump’s plan to end Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, which has killed more than 72,000 people, mostly women and children, injured over 171,000 others, and destroyed about 90% of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure.

I’ve found the best portable power stations for home and outdoor adventures
From camping trips to home blackouts, these are my tried-and-tested picks
- Bookmark
Portable power stations have become hugely popular with outdoor enthusiasts, campers, remote workers, and those living off-grid. They also offer reassurance to homeowners who regularly experience power outages or blackouts. But which one should you buy? As a tech expert with more than 15 years of experience, I’ve tried, tested and chosen my top picks.
While power stations can be expensive, they’re useful in so many different scenarios. Imagine being able to use the hedge trimmer to the home projector outside without long extension leads, or to work and charge all your gear in your car off-site. You can also enjoy safer, cleaner and quieter camping trips without the noise and fumes from a heavier generator.
Better yet, you can pair a portable power station with solar panels for cleaner and cheaper off-grid living. And in the event of a power cut in your home, you can keep the household going by charging phones, boiling kettles, keeping the lights on and ensuring frozen food stays frozen.
However, choosing the right model requires some consideration of your power needs and balancing that against cost and weight. To get a head start in your search, keep reading for the portable power stations that passed my tests.
The best portable power stations for 2026 are:
- Best overall – EcoFlow delta 3 plus: £599, Amazon.co.uk
- Best budget buy – EcoFlow river 3 plus: £219, Amazon.co.uk
- Best for camper vans – Jackery explorer 2000 V2: £899, Amazon.co.uk
- Best for off-grid living – DJI power 2000: £959, Amazon.co.uk
- Best for home backup – Anker solix F3000: £1,799, Amazon.co.uk

How I tested
For this review, I tested each model by plugging in a range of everyday devices, including smartphone chargers and laptops, to see how they performed and how long they lasted on a full charge. I also ran high-power appliances such as hairdryers and tower fans to stress-test the units, paying close attention to fan noise and any signs of overheating. You can find my full testing criteria at the end of this article.

1EcoFlow delta 3 plus
- Best portable power station overall
- Capacity 1024Wh
- Outputs Four x 1800W AC, two x 140W USB-C, two x 36W USB-A, one x 126W 12V
- Recharge time 56 minutes
- Dimensions 15.6x7.8x11.1in
- Weight 12.5kg
- Why we love it
- Ideal capacity for most people
- Good selection of ports
- Take note
- Socket arrangement can lead to messy wiring
The delta 3 plus is a top-notch performer, being reasonably portable and offering plenty of power and versatility. It also features lots of ports, including fast-charging USB-C ports, and will charge completely in under an hour. Plus, its 10ms uninterruptible power supply (UPS) feature helps ensure a constant and reliable power supply when you need it, whether for computers, fridges or security systems.
I plugged in my laptop, monitor, phone charger and hair dryer simultaneously, and it maintained its composure without overheating, though the wiring isn’t super neat as the sockets are arranged perpendicularly to fit its tall frame better. I could get around 18 to 20 hours with my laptop and monitor plugged in, which is what I’d expect for a station like this. The fan only kicks in beyond heavy loads of around 1,500W, and I found it fairly quiet and non-intrusive.
There’s very little difference between this and the Solix C1000 as far as performance and stats go, and while the latter has slightly better portability and design, the delta 3 plus beats it for its expandable batteries and quieter fan. It’s still not enough for proper home backups, but for pretty much everything else, this is a solid power station at a reasonable price.
2EcoFlow river 3 plus
- Best budget portable power station
- Capacity 286Wh
- Outputs Three x 300W AC, Two x 12W USB-A, One x 100W USB-C
- Recharge time One hour
- Dimensions 9.21in x 9.13in x 5.75in
- Weight 4.7kg
- Why we love it
- Super compact
- Decent light
- Take note
- Not for high usage appliances
- Socket placement not ideal
If you need power quickly at your fingertips, the dinky river 3 plus is for you. It impressively packs in three AC sockets, three USB ports, and even a light to use should you find yourself by the roadside in the dark. Its battery is expandable if you need to bulk out the capacity without buying another power station.
It displayed around two and a half hours of runtime with my laptop and phone on fast charge (when not in the trickle charge mode). So while it’s not suited for long trips away from an electrical outlet or for high-wattage appliances, it’s good for less demanding jobs such as powering a cooler for a garden party or a TV for a few hours. And like most power stations, there’s a digital display showing your output, battery level and remaining runtime.
I’m also really impressed with its portability and compact form. You can easily carry it around, courtesy of its large handle, and it can even slip into a backpack without much fuss. It’s handy for keeping in the car or shed when you need power outdoors in a pinch. The low price adds to its charms, too. I’d advise getting the plus model, as the standard version only carries one AC output.
3Jackery explorer 2000 V2
- Best portable power station for camper vans
- Capacity 2042Wh
- Outputs One x 2200W AC, one x 100W USB-C, one x 30W USB-C, one x 18W USB-A, one x 126W 12V
- Recharge time 102 minutes
- Dimensions 13.2in x 10.4 x 11.5in
- Weight 17.5kg
- Why we love it
- Lots of power for its size
- Great value
- Take note
- Limited mains sockets
- Small light
I recommend the Jackery explorer for camping enthusiasts in vans or estates with limited space to work with, as I’m astounded that a 2,000Wh power station is the size of a small cooler box. And, with a lightweight rubberised handle, most people will be able to shift it around a short distance unassisted.
The longest runtime was around 26 hours when fast-charging a laptop and phone, which is fairly impressive. And when I plugged in a hairdryer at maximum power and heat, that swiftly went down to one hour (assuming continuous use), which is par for the course, considering the load.
The fan tends to turn on even with lighter loads, but it’s nearly silent, so it’s fine to work around. Its display is a little small and simplistic, but it provides a clear picture of your use, runtime and charge status. My only gripe is that there are only two mains outlets, when rivals offer three or even four.
Still, the explorer 2000 V2 is great to bring camping, in trucks and when you need to power energy-sapping appliances such as kettles and stoves, particularly where space is at a premium.
4DJI power 2000
- Best portable power station for off-grid living
- Capacity 2,048Wh
- Outputs Four x mains AC, two x 140W USB-C, two x 65W USB-C, two x 24W USB-A, two x SDC
- Recharge time 45 minutes from zero to 80 per cent, 75 minutes for a full recharge
- Dimensions 17.64in x 8.86in x 12.76in
- Weight 22kg
- Why we love it
- Plenty of ports
- Fast-charge for drones
- Quiet fan
- Take note
- Strange charger port placement
It makes total sense for a company heavily focused on drones and action cameras to get involved in the portable power station game, so here comes DJI with the power 2000.
This 2,048Wh station comes with a massive number of ports, including four mains, four USB-Cs, four USB-As and two of DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast charging drones. It displayed 15 hours of runtime while fast-charging a laptop and phone, and with trickle charge the runtime extended to around 33 hours, though the number did sporadically fluctuate. I then plugged in a hairdryer on max power and heat, and it had just over an hour of runtime.
It’s got lots of power to run almost any appliance, and you can combine it with a DJI solar panel for living independently off the grid, provided you get enough sunshine. Plus, its generous ports ensure everyone’s power-hungry devices get charged.
It’s also excellent for videographers and photographers who want to charge multiple devices such as laptops, drones, cameras and phones simultaneously while on the go. However, the placement of the main charging port at the front of the unit is a questionable choice. It kind of spoils the neatness of the machine, and restricts the reach and practicality of the station.
5Anker solix C1000 gen 2
- Best portable power station for remote work
- Capacity 1,024Wh
- Outputs Four x 2,000W, two x140W USB-C, one x15W USB-C, one x12W USB-A, one x120W 12v
- Recharge time 49 minutes
- Dimensions 15.1in x 8.2in x 9.6in
- Weight 11.3kg
- Why we love it
- Rapid charging
- Lots of outputs
- Take note
- No battery expansion
Well designed and both modern and robust in look and feel, the second-gen C1000 boasts the 2025 Guinness World Record for the fastest recharging portable power station, able to fully charge its 1,024Wh battery in just 49 minutes.
I tested it with my laptop and mobile, which it could comfortably keep powered for more than 16 hours. When they both reached more than 90 per cent capacity and reverted to a slow charge, that time further extended to more than 20 hours. I also tested the fan by running my laptop, second monitor, mobile charger, tower fan and hairdryer simultaneously – this vastly cut down its battery longevity to about 30 to 40 minutes – and while it wasn’t too loud, it’s definitely audible.
It’s fairly weighty to carry, and it lacks the capacity to keep multiple household appliances running for long periods during a power outage, so it’s best to look elsewhere if you need that high-capacity backup. But this is a great little unit for weekend work or overnight remote use, with plenty of plug outlets and USB ports to charge your camera, phone and laptop with no hassle.
6Anker solix F3000
- Best Portable power station for home backup
- Capacity 3,072Wh
- Outputs Four x 2,400W, two x 100W USB-C, two x 12W USB-A, one x120W 12v, one x Anderson DC output
- Recharge time 120 minutes
- Dimensions 25.6in x 11.8in x 14.8in
- Weight 41.5kg
- Why we love it
- Wheeled design is great
- Huge capacity
- Take note
- Pricey
- Not many USB-C ports
This absolute beast of a power station can keep a home running in the event of a blackout. I could run my standing fridge-freezer for more than four days – so no more melted peas. It could fast-charge my phone and laptop for 23 hours, extending to more than 42 hours once it hit trickle charge mode, and with a fully cranked hairdryer added into the mix, you get one and a half hours of runtime. Still, with only two USB-C ports, if the power goes down, you might have a fight on your hands deciding who gets to charge their phones.
The F3000 is also super heavy, so I’ve never been more thankful for Anker incorporating a retractable long handle and a pair of wheels into the design, making shifting it about far more doable. However, clearing high thresholds and stairs is often a two-person job.
The inflated price tag of £3,000 makes it a tough sell, but with a discount, it becomes more tempting, particularly for off-grid users, campervan owners or those who need high-capacity and reliable power backup at home. However, note that its 20ms UPS switch time (how long it takes for the battery to take over once the mains fails) is on the slow side, meaning you may need to look elsewhere if you have critical appliances.
7Bluetti elite 200 V2
- Best portable power station budget home backup
- Capacity 2,073Wh
- Outputs Two x 2,600W AC, two x 100W USB-C, two x 15W USB-A, two x126W 12V
- Recharge time 66 minutes for up to 80 per cent, two hours 24 minutes for a full charge
- Dimensions 13.78in x 9.84in x 12.74in
- Weight 24.2kg
- Why we love it
- Quick charging
- Quiet operation
- Compact for a 2000Wh station
- Take note
- Could do with more mains sockets
- Uncomfortable to carry
The elite 200 V2 is as compact as the Jackery explorer 2000, another 2,000Wh station mentioned above. In my test, I got 22 and a half hours of runtime while fast-charging a laptop and mobile, and one hour of concurrent use with a hairdryer. Once fast-charging was complete (and without the hairdryer), that extended to more than 37 hours in trickle charge mode.
I also plugged my fridge into the elite 200, which yielded very efficient results, with barely any power draw when idle and a reported runtime of at least 75 hours (as there’s no days option on the display readout).
However, its 24kg weight and the angle of its handles make it uncomfortable and awkward to carry. Some wheels and a retractable handle would have made this a great choice for mobile use, as moving it from a car or camper can be hard work. Still, it’s a solid home backup option, but I’d have liked to see one or two more mains sockets added to the existing two alongside the four USB ports.
Your questions on portable power stations answered
What is the best portable power station?
While I prefer the modern stylings of the Anker solix C1000, the EcoFlow delta 3 plus pips it. Stats and performance-wise, there’s very little separating them, though the latter features expandable batteries, a quieter fan and a slightly cheaper price tag. Still, both have great portability, affordability and versatility and should do fine for most users.
What kind of power station do I need?
It really comes down to what you need it for. If you need it for the odd night or weekend away, consider a 500Wh station for easy portability. If you’re on the road a lot and have lots of devices hungry for power, plump for a 1,000Wh device for more power and versatility. And if you love to live off-grid or need solid, reliable home power back-up, a 2,000Wh or even 3,000Wh station is your best bet.
How the best portable power stations were tested in full
I tested these devices according to the following criteria:
- Capacity: Easily the most important aspect, a station’s capacity determines how much power they store, directly translating to how long it can run your electrical devices. It’s measured in Watt-hours (Wh). I examined how much power the power stations store, how well they retain that capacity over time and how long they can keep going when using certain devices.
- Portability: Many stations have handles, but the bigger varieties are often bulky and cumbersome to carry. During testing, I looked at their size, weight and how easy they were to carry, and balanced that against how much power they offer. When choosing from my top picks, it’s also worth considering where you’ll be storing it, as they take up lots of room.
- UPS: If you have critical appliances, such as medical devices or servers, you’ll want a power station with a low switch time, which is how long it takes for the battery to “take over” once the mains fails. Ideally, you’d want a switch time of less than 10ms for crucial gear. This was something I paid attention to when testing.
- Outputs: If you have lots of devices, you’re going to need several AC plugs and USB ports. And the more devices that need charging, the bigger your power draw, so you’ll need a higher capacity model. In my tests, I explored whether the power stations had enough ports for their intended use and whether they were capable of fast charging.
- Charging speed: I looked at how fast they could get to 100 per cent under typical inside conditions. If you’re living off grid, solar panels are your friend here, but make sure they’re compatible with your station – some manufacturers sell adaptors if you’re going to be mixing brands. Otherwise, you’ll be looking at charging off a mains or 12V vehicle socket.

'EU energy infrastructure is as vulnerable as European defence,' industry warns

Industry bosses warn Europe's energy infrastructure is as vulnerable as the continent's security after a series of attacks and sabotage to networks.
Europe’s energy security should be treated with the same urgency as defence, industry bosses said Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
The call for action follows Russia's barrage of attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which have exposed the European Union's own weaknesses.
“We live in a new reality of increasing threats. This requires a fundamental shift in our mindset,” the electricity industry’s Eurelectric president Markus Rauramo said.
“Preparing for, responding to and recovering from both physical and hybrid attacks must be a key element of power companies’ strategies going forward.”
Europe's energy infrastructure must be reinforced and its repair capabilities strengthened, they added, noting that cyber resilience should be embedded by design.
Europe has been facing a rising number of hybrid threats, including sabotage, cyberattacks, and disinformation, with experts suggesting Russia is testing Europe's resilience.
In 2024, at least 11 attacks damaged critical infrastructure. Since 2022, 23 cyberattacks have targeted Europe’s energy sector, according to the industry.
Early this year, approximately 45,000 households in Berlin were left without electricity after high-voltage power lines were damaged in a fire.
Regardless of who is behind, Eurelectric said these incidents are increasing in scale and frequency, putting pressure on power utilities to maintain a reliable supply.
Clean power, inverters and cybersecurity
As the bloc moves toward clean power production, inverter devices have become essential as they convert direct current electricity from sources like solar panels, batteries and wind systems into alternating current electricity that can be used as power.
Without inverters, it's not possible to integrate clean power into the grid, making these devices a key pillar of Europe’s energy security and power system stability.
However, China's dominance in inverter production is a source of concern for Europe.
EU lawmakers urged the European Commission last November to restrict Chinese solar inverter manufacturers’ access to the bloc’s energy infrastructure, due to cybersecurity concerns.
Through companies such as Huawei, Sungrow and Growatt, China controls the majority of inverter installations in Europe — roughly 70–80% of the market — while European producers compete for the rest, according to data from PV wholesale platform sun store.
Energy and security 'hand in hand'
The urgency to protect energy infrastructure is palpable.
For the first time, last December, NATO officials have joined EU energy ministers at the last Council to discuss the link between energy and security amid current geopolitical tensions and Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Discussions centered on protecting critical energy infrastructure, in response to attacks on underwater cables and pipelines. The goal is to foster cooperation between defense and energy policies, increasingly linked by common threats.
Attending the meeting, NATO's deputy secretary general Radmila Šekerinskavsaid maintaining contact with energy ministers is "crucial" to ensure the integrity of critical infrastructure, which the alliance says it will protect.
"We're worried seeing the Russian industry more entangled with China as well as its ties with Iran and North Korea. It's time to shift to a more war mindset," Šekerinska said, according to an EU diplomatic source familiar with the discussions.

Peter Murrell: Nicola Sturgeon’s estranged husband accused of embezzling £459,000 from SNP over 12 years
Peter Murrell is accused of embezzling the funds between August 2010 and January 2023
- Bookmark
Former Scottish National Party (SNP) chief executive Peter Murrell is accused of embezzling £459,000 from the party over more than 12 years, according to reports.
Mr Murrell, who is Nicola Sturgeon’s estranged husband, is alleged to have used the money to buy items including a motorhome and luxury goods, and to partially fund the purchase of two cars.
He is accused of embezzling the funds between August 2010 and January 2023, according to an indictment seen by the BBC and first reported in The Sun.
The 61-year-old, who became the party chief executive in 1999, is expected to appear at the High Court in Glasgow for a preliminary hearing on 20 February. He was first arrested in April 2023 as part of the police investigation into the SNP’s finances, and was charged in April 2024.
Mr Murrell, who was responsible for the day-to-day running of the SNP, entered no plea when he appeared at Edinburgh Sheriff Court in March 2025 on a charge of embezzlement.
The indictment is said to include allegations that Mr Murrell used party funds to buy a £124,550 motorhome for his own personal use.
It is also alleged that he used £57,500 of SNP money in the purchase of an £81,000 Jaguar I-Pace in 2019, and £16,489 towards a £33,000 Volkswagen Golf bought in early 2016, according to the reports.
Until he stood down in 2023 during the leadership race to succeed Ms Sturgeon, Mr Murrell had been chief executive of the SNP for more than 20 years.
In January last year, Ms Sturgeon announced that she and Mr Murrell had “decided to end” their marriage. The former SNP leader said at the time: “With a heavy heart I am confirming that Peter and I have decided to end our marriage. To all intents and purposes we have been separated for some time now and feel it is time to bring others up to speed with where we are.”
The Crown Office warned against commentary and speculation on the case, saying: “Commentary, analysis or conclusions about evidence, witnesses or the accused risks prejudicing proceedings and may amount to contempt of court.”
Police Scotland launched an investigation into the SNP’s finances in July 2021 after receiving complaints about how donations were used.

US pressure on Hungary, Slovakia goes against ‘Anchorage spirit’ — Russian senator

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s statement about his plans to discuss with Hungarian and Slovak authorities the abandonment of Russian energy supplies runs counter to the de-escalation efforts initiated at the meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump in Anchorage, Deputy Head of the Russian Federation Council Committee for Defense and Security Konstantin Basyuk told TASS.
"Statements about intentions to persuade Hungary and Slovakia to abandon Russian energy supplies run counter to the de-escalation trend set in Anchorage. If on one hand there is a declared readiness for dialogue, and on the other hand steps are taken to exert further economic pressure, this inevitably casts doubt on the real willingness of the US to reach agreements," Basyuk said.
According to the senator, the energy sector is a matter of sovereign choice for states and their economic security. "Attempts to politicize it and force decisions on allies do not contribute to stabilizing the situation or to restoring trust in international relations," Basyuk added.

Low expectations as Ukraine, Russia confirm new round of talks with U.S.

As Ukraine and Russia confirm new round of peace talks with U.S., Zelenskyy says its up to Trump
Kyiv — The governments of Russia and Ukraine confirmed Friday that they would participate in a third round of U.S.-mediated peace talks next week, on Feb. 17 and 18 in Geneva. There have already been two rounds of talks under this trilateral format so far this year, held in Abu Dhabi, but next week's session will be the first on European soil, and it will come just days before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine enters its fifth year.
Neither side has voiced any optimism that the negotiations will yield a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, but there has been some progress on other issues. Most notably, both sides agreed to a temporary pause in attacks on energy infrastructure in late January, and then after the last round of talks, they carried out the first prisoner exchange in five months.
The mere fact that the negotiations continued, with relative continuity in the teams sitting around the table, had also suggested room for progress.
But there has been plenty to fuel doubt in Kyiv since the discussions began.
President Trump said the pause in strikes on each other's energy infrastructure would last a week. But it ended after just four days, with Russia hitting Ukraine with a fresh barrage of 450 drones and more than 60 missiles.
The Free Press: Meet the Ukrainian Refugees Being Forced Out of the U.S.
Asked by journalists in Kyiv this week whether future talks could at least yield a more enduring truce, even if it was still limited to strikes on power infrastructure, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said: "We have not received any response from the Russians. If anything, one could say the opposite — we received responses in the form of drones and missile attacks. This indicates that, for now, they are not ready for the energy ceasefire."
The composition of the negotiating teams, which some analysts have looked to as an indicator of potential progress on more technical issues, has also changed.
During both of the meetings in Abu Dhabi, Ukraine's team included Kyrylo Budanov, the former head of military intelligence who now serves as Zelenskyy's chief of staff, while the Russian delegation was led by Igor Kostyukov, the head of the GRU military intelligence service.
"When military guys meet military guys, they can make progress, they speak the same language," Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's Ministry of Strategic Industries, told CBS News last week. "The concrete measures and steps within security guarantees — the military guys on both sides are well placed to discuss."
Next week in Geneva, however, presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky will replace Kostyukov as the head of the Russian delegation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday.
Medinsky led the Russian team for a round of talks with Ukrainian officials in March 2022, in Belarus and Istanbul, that went nowhere as his team made sweeping claims to occupied Ukrainian territory and demanded that Kyiv effectively give up its sovereign military power. He is known for writing ultra-nationalistic school textbooks questioning Ukraine's right to exist, and for his close relationship with President Vladimir Putin.
Zelenskyy has said the Trump administration wants both sides to agree to a deal to end the war by June. But in Kyiv, officials question whether Washington is prepared to exert the kind of pressure on Moscow that would make such a timeline feasible.
"As for whether I believe the war can be brought to an end," Zelenskyy told journalists this week, "it does not depend only on Ukraine. It also depends on the United States, which must put pressure — forgive me for saying 'must,' but there is no other way to put it — must put pressure on Russia."

PARIS - An avalanche killed three off-piste skiers, including two Britons, in the French Alps on Feb 13, prosecutors said a day after several ski resorts shut down due to the risk of snowslides.
The avalanche in Val d’Isere swept away six skiers, killing one French national and the two Britons, prosecutor Benoit Bachelet said.
A third British citizen suffered minor injuries, he added.
Emergency services responded quickly but could not prevent the deaths, a resort official said, noting that all of the victims had avalanche transceivers.
There have now been at least 25 avalanche deaths in France this winter season, with the majority occurring since January.
The deaths followed a rare, day-long red alert across the southeastern Savoie region on Feb 12 – a danger level issued only twice before since the system was introduced 25 years ago.
The warning prompted several resorts to close all or part of their pistes.
On Feb 13, the red alert was lifted in Savoie but the risk level remained high across the Alps, with “very unstable snow cover” especially above 1,800 to 2,000 metres altitude, according to the Meteo France weather service.
Storm Nils, which passed through France on Feb 12, dumped 60-100 centimetres of snow, according to the weather service. AFP

Trump, Musk and now UK billionaire Jim Ratcliffe – they are the enablers, making racists feel great again | Jonathan Freedland

It lacks the elegance of “greed is good”, but as a distillation of the spirit of the age, it’s right up there. “I feel liberated,” a top banker told the Financial Times shortly after Donald Trump’s victory in the 2024 US presidential election. “We can say ‘retard’ and ‘pussy’ without the fear of getting cancelled … it’s a new dawn.”
So that’s what they meant by “vibe shift”. Though, as the Epstein files reveal daily, the top 0.01% were hardly primly biting their tongues before Trump’s win, at least not in private. Those with telephone-number fortunes and great power felt able to speak, and write, to each other about women in language so vicious, so filled with hate – women discussed as body parts, as “less than human”, in Gordon Brown’s apt phrase – that they didn’t need the encouragement of a “grab ’em by the pussy” president to cast off their inhibitions.
Still, as that unnamed banker made clear to the FT, women are not the only group the powerful and privileged have been itching to disparage. This week it was migrants who were the target, accused by the billionaire Monaco resident Sir Jim Ratcliffe of having “colonised” Britain.
He may have got his stats wrong – he was in quite a muddle about the size of the UK population – but he did usefully debunk one stubbornly persistent assumption. For a while, it was taken as read that anti-immigrant sentiment was a function of economic anxiety: indeed, that was the instant explanation offered for Trump’s victory in 2016. But Ratcliffe, whose fortune is estimated at £17bn, won’t be feeling too much angst in the economic department. That is truer still of Elon Musk, who is simultaneously the backer of anti-immigration parties across Europe and the world’s richest man.
Indeed, the data shows no correlation at all between hostility to immigration and income. In January, Ipsos found that it was the most affluent fifth of voters in Britain who, more than any other group, named immigration as their most pressing concern.
The increasingly uninhibited musings of the super-rich are, alas, just one factor in a shift that is becoming ever more apparent. While of course we must say that Sir Jim’s comments did not specify the racial origins of immigrants, that’s inevitably how they were heard. We are, in the words of Sunder Katwala, who as the director of the British Future thinktank observes these trends more keenly than most, “going backwards on racism”.
The evidence is all around you. It’s there in the 116,000 hate crimes recorded by police in England and Wales, but excluding London, for the year to March 2025 – up on the previous year, and a fifth of it involving violence.
It’s there in the “ugly”, 1970s-style racism directed at NHS staff, incidents of verbal and physical abuse based on skin colour so frequent that the health secretary, Wes Streeting, warned last November that it was becoming “socially acceptable to be racist”.
It’s there in a changed public discourse, where the bounds of acceptability have shifted to include notions that most thought had been left behind two generations ago. Suddenly there’s a debate, drawing in mainstream commentators, over whether Rishi Sunak is English. A former cabinet minister, Robert Jenrick, can lament not seeing “another white face” in a Birmingham neighbourhood. A former prime minister, Liz Truss, appears as a guest on an online show where she chats with Connor Tomlinson, who believes, among other things, that British citizens from ethnic minorities should not be allowed to become members of parliament. The Sun’s Harry Cole hosts that same far-right figure on his online show.
It’s there on social media, where it has become routine to hurl the P-word at politicians from the Tories’ Priti Patel to Labour’s Shabana Mahmood, from onetime Corbynite Zarah Sultana to Reform’s Zia Yusuf. And it’s there in the daily, lived experience of Britain’s minorities, measurable in both data and anecdote. Figures released this week, for example, showed yet another rise in antisemitic incidents, including a spike straight after October’s deadly attack on a synagogue in Heaton Park, Manchester, which left two dead on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar – more than half of that spike made up of incidents directly referring to, or celebrating, the killings at Heaton Park. Last autumn, Katwala wrote: “I personally get so much more racist abuse most weeks in 2025 than I ever did in 2005.”
Of course, there will be multiple and varied explanations for all this, but there are a few common threads. When it comes to the discourse, the shaping effect of online influencers is unmistakable. The likes of Tomlinson would once have been handing out badly stencilled leaflets in pub backrooms. Now he can reach millions, with TV production values previously the exclusive preserve of the major broadcasters. But the medium affects the message.
Put simply, the loudmouths of the far right are competing in an attention economy. Saying something shocking wins attention, but to keep it they have to say something more shocking still. There is a ratchet effect, which ensures the conversation becomes ever more extreme. Note the latest effusion from the white supremacist US influencer Nick Fuentes. Holocaust denial worked for him for a while, but his audience demands more. This week, he provided it by directing his fire at women, whom he castigated for encouraging sympathy for the poor and minorities. “The number one political enemy in America is women,” he told his audience on the Rumble platform. And so, “Every woman and girl is sent to the gulags. We will determine who the good ones are after the fact.” But first, to the gulags. “They go to the breeding gulags.”
These figures should be far beyond the fringe, but they keep getting amplified. Tucker Carlson hosted Fuentes on his show; Musk regularly promotes some of Britain’s most extreme voices, including Advance UK, a political party that now includes Tommy Robinson and that vows to ban indefinite leave to remain, ban the foreign-born from becoming British citizens and encourage all settled migrants to leave. Musk seems to think Advance is the real deal, preferable to the “weak sauce” of Nigel Farage. All the while, his X platform barely stirs as users racially abuse others, in the foulest language.
Throw in the brain-boiling effect of the pandemic period, when a small, extremely online minority became radicalised by conspiracy theories of every flavour, with anti-vax talk as the gateway drug, and you have some of the causes of this retrograde shift.
It’s important to hold on to the fact that most people do not think this way, that attitudes of tolerance are now deeply embedded in Britain: the data shows that too. Still, that led too many to become complacent, to assume that this was a problem of our past, one that we’d solved. But racism and prejudice are not like that. The battles against them have to be fought, and re-fought, in every generation. They are light sleepers – and some loud, powerful voices are determined to shake them awake.

Ukraine struck $100 million Russian Nebo-U radar system in occupied Crimea, General Staff claims
Ukraine struck a Russian 55Zh6U "Nebo-U" long-range radar station, estimated to cost around $100 million, near Yevpatoriia in occupied Crimea, the General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces reported on Feb. 13.
The Nebo-U is a strategic early-warning radar designed to detect aerodynamic and ballistic targets at long distances and forms part of Russia’s layered air defense architecture. Similar systems have previously been targeted by Ukrainian forces in an effort to weaken Russia’s surveillance and air defense capabilities.
The General Staff said the strike took place on Feb. 12 as part of "systematic measures to reduce the offensive potential of the Russian aggressor."
"Each of the targeted facilities ensures the energy, aviation, or communications stability of enemy groupings in the temporarily occupied territories. Systematic strikes on such infrastructure disrupt command and logistics, reducing the Russian army’s ability to sustain combat operations," the military said.
In addition to the radar strike in Crimea, Ukrainian forces reported hitting multiple targets in occupied territories overnight on Feb. 13.
In Zaporizhzhia Oblast, areas of Russian troop concentration were struck near Solodkovodne and Liubymivka. Positions of Russian drone operators were also reportedly targeted near Tokmak and Mykhailivka.
In Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian forces struck a logistics warehouse near Selydove and a concentration of military equipment near Komyshuvakha, according to the General Staff.
The military said the extent of the damage and Russian losses is being clarified. The claims could not be independently verified.
Kyiv has stepped up strikes on Russian military assets on Russian and occupied territories.
Earlier today, Ukraine’s Unmanned Systems Forces also reported strikes on a Russian airfield in occupied Crimea, an electrical substation in Luhansk, and an ammunition depot in Zaporizhzhia Oblast.
Ukrainian long-range drones struck the Ukhta oil refinery in Russia’s Komi Republic on Feb. 12, approximately 1,750 kilometers (1,087 miles) from Ukraine’s border – a new record for a Ukrainian strike inside Russian territory, according to a source in the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU).

Ukrainian slider's Olympics over as helmet appeal dismissed
- Published
Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych will not compete at the Winter Olympics after the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) dismissed his appeal to wear a helmet depicting images of athletes killed during Russia's invasion of his home country.
Heraskevych asked Cas to reinstate his place at the Olympics after he was banned by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) before the first heat of the men's skeleton on Thursday.
Having worn the helmet, which the IOC say breaks rules in the Olympic charter, during training sessions this week, IOC president Kirsty Coventry visited him at Cortina's sliding track in a final attempt to convince him not to wear it in competition.
But the 26-year-old refused to back down, believing the helmet to be within the rules and an emergency ad-hoc Cas meeting took place on Friday.
Cas said while they are "fully sympathetic" to Heraskevych's case and his right to "freedom of expression", it is not permitted "on the field of play".
The IOC said Heraskevych could show his helmet in mixed zones, news conferences and on social media, but that "the field of play is sacrosanct".
Initially, the IOC had withdrawn his accreditation but eventually returned it and Cas agreed it was "unfair" to rescind it "under these circumstances".

Heraskevych's appeal to Cas asked for his ban to be overturned, to be able to wear the helmet and to complete the two skeleton runs he missed out on on Thursday under the supervision of Cas.
He said his disqualification was "disproportionate" and claimed other athletes had been able to express their grief during competition at the Games.
For example, American figure skater Maxim Naumov held up a photograph of his parents, who were killed last year in a plane crash in Washington DC, as he waited for his score to come in earlier this week.
But the IOC say Heraskevych has contravened the 'athlete expression' guidelines, external, which were drawn up in 2023 and are part of Olympic law, which state "focus at the Olympic Games must remain on athletes' performances".
The law states: "It is a fundamental principle that sport at the Olympic Games is neutral and must be separate from political, religious and any other type of interference."
On Thursday, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams said that if the committee allowed athletes to wear kit commemorating those killed in war, it would open the Games up to exploitation.
But Heraskevych has accused the Milan-Cortina Games of acting as "Russian propaganda" while Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelensky, said, external the IOC are "playing into the hands of the Russian aggressor".
Heraskevych, who was his nation's flag bearer in the opening ceremony, has received support from his compatriots at the Games with Alpine skier Dmytro Shepiuk displayed a note reading "Ukrainian heroes with us" after competing while the Ukrainian mixed relay luge team took the knee and held their helmets aloft in a display of solidarity.

Trump administration ends temporary protected status for Yemen
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 13 - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has ended temporary protected status for Yemen, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on Friday, the latest move targeting immigrants.
The decision to end humanitarian protections that grant deportation relief and work permits to more than a thousand Yemeni nationals was taken after determining that it was against the U.S. "national interest", Noem said.
TPS provides relief to people already in the U.S. if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. The Trump administration has sought to end most enrollment in the program, saying it runs counter to U.S. interests.
"After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate U.S. government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law's requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status," she said.
Around 1,380 Yemeni nationals were covered by the temporary protected status as of March 31, 2025, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The status was last extended in 2024 and was set to expire on March 3 this year. REUTERS

Island visit, NYC flat and 'Belarusian girls': Ex-Israel PM Ehud Barak addresses Jeffrey Epstein ties
Unknown

01:40:46 KST

Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak addressed his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Thursday, after a trove of official documents revealed the scope of their ties, including repeated and extended stays by Barak and his wife at an apartment owned by the disgraced financier in New York in the years following Epstein's initial conviction.
In an interview with Channel 12 News, Barak, who served as Israel's prime minister from 1999 to 2001 and as defense minister from 2007 to 2013, said he "regrets" not "having exercised better judgment," while reiterating that he never encountered anything improper and was unaware of the nature of Epstein's offenses until his second and final arrest in 2019.
However, Barak acknowledged that he had known since 2008 that Epstein was on trial and had spent over a year in prison. Despite Epstein's conviction for soliciting underage sex, Barak said, "I saw the American elite treating him as someone who had committed an offense, been punished, paid his debt to society and returned to operate within that very society."
"Only in 2019," Barak said, "did the depth of this man's truly abhorrent crimes become clear. That was when I cut off contact with him."
"I am responsible for my actions and regret ever having met him. But regret is not enough, so I sincerely apologize to my friends, supporters and citizens who feel deep discomfort," he added.
According to hundreds of messages reviewed by Haaretz, Barak's visits to the apartment in Manhattan took place between 2015 and 2019. Emails between Barak's wife, Nili Priel, and Epstein's personal assistant show that the financier's staff referred to the apartment as "Ehud's apartment."
Barak said in the interview that "from time to time, when we visited the U.S., we stayed in an apartment belonging to Epstein. I never hid the fact that I met him dozens of times. The apartment was in an old residential building with 100 or 120 units, at least a dozen of which were Epstein's. He would make them available to people he chose to host from time to time."
He added: "I am a private citizen; I was not holding office. … A private citizen can stay in a house or apartment offered by someone with whom he has social or business ties. … It was not a financial matter. It was about convenience… There is nothing else to it."
He later said, "I should have exercised better judgment, and I regret that I did not."
Barak also addressed a visit he made to Epstein's island, Little Saint James, a small private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands that has been alleged to have served as a base of operations for underage sex trafficking.
Barak said: "There was one visit to the island, during the daytime, for three hours, accompanied by my wife and three security guards. On the island, there was only Epstein and a number of local employees who worked in gardening and maintenance."
Barak also responded to recordings that were published of conversations between him and Epstein, as well as with former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers.
In one such conversation in 2014, that lasted three and a half hours, Barak discussed Jewish immigration to Israel, saying that "we can control the quality much more effectively, much more than the founding fathers of Israel did," adding, "They took whatever came. They had to save people. Now, we can be more selective."
The recording also captured Barak saying: "We need, dramatically, the million Russians. I see that many prefer to be Belarusian, or maybe young, handsome girls will come."
The former prime minister said in the interview that "it was certainly an unfortunate choice of words and metaphor, with associations of inappropriate stereotypes," but added, "I suggest that anyone watching us now look in the mirror and ask themselves whether they speak that way in private conversations. This was not a speech delivered in an official capacity."
He further claimed that "the way it was described in our media is distorted, based on excerpts taken out of context from a conversation," adding, "It is a fragment taken from a conversation… concerning the long-term demographic challenge facing Israel."

CAS dismisses Ukrainian skeleton racer Heraskevych's appeal against IOC
The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has dismissed an appeal by Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych against the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).
Source: Ukrainian public broadcaster Suspilne Sport
Details: The decision was announced at 17:15 local time.
CAS Director General Matthieu Reeb said that freedom of expression is allowed at the Olympics, but not at the competition venue, and that the judge had heard the arguments of both sides and made a decision in accordance with the IOC guidelines.
CAS has published the arguments put forward by Judge Annett Rombach from Germany, who took the decision to dismiss Heraskevych's appeal.
Key points:
- The IBSF disqualified Heraskevych due to his intention to "wear in competition a helmet displaying portraits of Ukrainian athletes who lost their lives in the war". As confirmation of this intention, Heraskevych is cited as saying on 10 February that he would compete wearing his helmet.
- The helmet was deemed by the IBSF and IOC to be "inconsistent with the Olympic Charter and Guidelines on Athlete Expression".
- The CAS Arbitrator considered the limitations proposed by the IOC for Heraskevych – highlighting the issue in the mixed zone, at press conferences and on social media, and wearing the helmet during training runs – to be "reasonable and proportionate".
Heraskevych's lawyer, Yevhen Pronin, provided more details on the ruling, stating that "the case was far broader than an individual dispute".
Quote from Pronin: "The court sided with the IOC and confirmed the decision that an athlete may be removed from the Olympic Games without committing an actual violation, without posing a technical or safety threat, and even before competing. This case was far broader than an individual dispute. It concerned athlete freedom of expression, the limits of discretion of sports bodies, and the very understanding of Olympic values."
Background:
- Heraskevych was disqualified from the 2026 Olympics after wearing his "remembrance helmet", which features portraits of 20 Ukrainian athletes killed due to Russian aggression, at several official training runs. He was not allowed to compete in his first race.
- The Ukrainian athlete appealed the suspension. On 12 February, the day before the verdict was announced, he met with IOC President Kirsty Coventry, but they were unable to reach an agreement. The IOC later restored his accreditation, but Heraskevych was still not allowed to participate in the competition.

Apple secures trademark rights in Russia until 2036
US tech giant extends legal protections for iconic logo and brands despite halting official sales in the country
ISTANBUL
US tech firm Apple has extended its rights to at least eight trademarks in Russia through 2036, according to records from the Russian Federal Service for Intellectual Property (Rospatent) released on Friday.
The document showed that the California-based corporation successfully renewed the validity of its iconic "bitten apple" logo alongside several established brand names, including iWeb, Time Machine, and Mac Pro.
Under the renewed registrations, Apple maintains the legal framework to sell a range of products and services in Russia, including mobile phones, computers, headphones, software, and games, as well as the provision of communication services.
Apple continues to navigate a complex legal landscape in Russia, where it suspended all official product sales and exports in early 2022 due to the war in Ukraine.
Despite the absence of official retail operations, Apple devices remain available in the country through parallel import mechanisms authorized by the Russian government.
In January, the company also registered a new trademark in Russia for the first time in over a year, following an application process that is said to have begun in late 2023.

Energy workers restore power to critical infrastructure facilities in Odesa region, with 130,000 customers remaining without electricity
According to Ukrinform, Ukraine's Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko stated this on Telegram, following a daily energy coordination meeting.
"The situation remains difficult after last night’s shelling in the Odesa and Mykolaiv regions following the nighttime attack, as well as in Kyiv and the Dnipropetrovsk region after yesterday's strikes," Svyrydenko wrote.
In particular, more than 60 crews are working in Kyiv to restore electricity supply, and repair work is also ongoing to restore heating.
"In the Odesa region, energy workers are working to restore power to more than 130,000 customers who were left without electricity. Critical infrastructure facilities have already been reconnected," she noted.
She also drew attention to the return of freezing weather next week. According to Svyrydenko, repair crews are doing everything possible to speed up repairs at all energy facilities.
"I have instructed the relevant ministries and heads of regional military administrations to prepare all necessary resources for a rapid response to possible new attacks amid severe cold. If necessary, additional invincibility centers and high-capacity generators will be deployed," she added.
As reported, Russian forces have been attacking energy infrastructure in the Odesa region for the second consecutive day. A facility in Odesa targeted in the attack on the night of February 13 sustained significant damage.

AI video of Russian attack on Brussels and Davos shown at Munich Conference – video
The Ukraine House, operating within the framework of the Munich Security Conference, is welcoming visitors with an exhibition featuring a real Shahed drone and a generated video of its possible use.
Source: European Pravda correspondent
Details: The exhibition is located at the entrance to the Ukraine House, one of the venues of the Munich Conference, where part of its official events are held, arranged so that all visitors must pass by a downed Russian drone. Behind the unmanned aerial vehicle, from which the warhead has been removed, a two-minute AI-generated video is shown on a large screen on a loop.
The video, created using artificial intelligence, begins with the large-scale launch of Shahed drones somewhere in Russia.
It then shows combat drones flying over the streets of Munich and Vienna (including shots of St. Stephen's Cathedral, Allianz Arena and the Bayerischer Hof, where the Munich Conference is held).
The AI video then depicts drones striking targets in Davos and Brussels. In the Belgian capital, one of the targets hit multiple times is the building of the European Parliament.
The footage is interspersed with quotes from Western politicians, media publications, and a statement by Russian propagandist Vladimir Solovyov: "We will once again have to destroy Berlin; we will have to enter Paris and Vienna."
Background:
- The Ukraine House, where this exhibition is displayed alongside anti-drone systems and several artworks dedicated to the war, was organised in Munich by the Viktor Pinchuk Foundation. This year, the Munich Conference agreed for the first time to the creation of a Ukraine House, making it one of the official venues.
- At the opening ceremony, Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha stated that the reason for this is that Ukraine plays a decisive role in Europe's security.
- Germany's ambassador at the ceremony stated that Russia is committing war crimes during its war against Ukraine.

The diet experts suggest could help people with diabetes
Vegan diets can cut daily insulin use by almost 30 per cent for people with type 1 diabetes
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Switching to a low-fat vegan diet can cut daily insulin use by nearly 30 per cent for people with type 1 diabetes, a new study has found.
Insulin is a hormone that moves glucose, a type of sugar, from the bloodstream into muscle and liver cells, where it is used for energy. People with type 1 diabetes must inject insulin because their bodies do not produce enough of it.
Researchers compared the effect of a low-fat vegan diet and a portion-controlled diet on type 1 diabetics. They found the vegan diet reduced their total needed daily insulin dose by 28 per cent or 12.1 units per day, whereas the control group experienced no meaningful change.
A reduced insulin requirement likely means the body has improved insulin sensitivity, which refers to how effectively the body responds to insulin, according to the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, which published the study in the journal BMC Nutrition.
Dr Hana Kahleova, the lead author of the study, said: "People with type 1 diabetes should consider a low-fat vegan diet, which can help improve their insulin sensitivity and reduce the amount of insulin they need.”
The new analysis was a follow-up to a 2024 study also conducted by the Physicians Committee, which found additional benefits to having a vegan diet.
Participants lost an average of 5kg and showed improvements in insulin sensitivity and glycemic control. Cholesterol levels and kidney function also improved among those following the plant-based plan.
Previous studies have also shown that plant-based diets had a 32 per cent lower incidence of type 2 diabetes and 18 per cent lower greenhouse gas emissions linked to their diets.
Professor Louise Goff, from the Leicester Diabetes Centre, told The Independent: “The reduction in insulin dose seen in the vegan group is certainly noteworthy — but it’s crucial to understand why that likely occurred.
“Over the 12 weeks, participants following the vegan diet lost weight. Even in people with type 1 diabetes, weight loss improves insulin sensitivity. When the body becomes more insulin sensitive, less exogenous insulin is required to achieve the same glucose control.
“So, the reduced insulin dose is very likely a reflection of improved insulin sensitivity secondary to weight loss, rather than a direct effect of eliminating animal products per se.”
Ms Goff also noted a significant increase in fibre intake in the vegan group, which is strongly associated with weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity — both of which would naturally reduce insulin requirements.
“This doesn’t diminish the potential benefits of plant-based eating, but it suggests that the mechanism is metabolic (weight loss and improved insulin sensitivity), not specific to veganism itself,” she added.
“It would be interesting to see whether similar results occur with other high-fibre, calorie-controlled dietary patterns.”
Professor Stefanie Baldeweg, former clinical lead of the department of diabetes at University College London, said: “Nutrition can be a powerful adjunct in diabetes management. But it is one tool among many – and should be approached thoughtfully.
“The findings are promising but preliminary. Patients should not alter insulin regimens without medical supervision, and clinicians should view this as an area for continued research.”

Pentagon adds Chinese firms to military list, then withdraws filing
Move weeks before Trump-Xi summit highlights mixed signals from Washington and injects fresh uncertainty into fragile US-China truce
Giants like Alibaba Group Holding, Baidu and BYD are among the firms added to the list. Alibaba is the parent company of the South China Morning Post.
Released on Friday, the updated designation also names firms spanning the biotech, AI, drone and semiconductor sectors, including WuXi AppTec and RoboSense Technology. Chinese memory chip manufacturers Yangtze Memory Technologies and ChangXin Memory Technologies were removed from the list.
The document was removed from the Federal Register on Friday morning upon agency request for withdrawal. The Pentagon told the SCMP in an email that it has nothing to announce at this time.
Friday’s move underscores the inconsistency and mixed messaging emanating from the Trump administration.
Washington’s Section 1260H list identifies companies the US government believes are “Chinese military companies” or contributors to China’s military-civil fusion efforts.

Indian man pleads guilty in New York over alleged plot against Sikh separatist

NEW YORK, Feb 13 - An Indian man charged with orchestrating an unsuccessful Indian government-backed plot to kill a Sikh separatist in New York City pleaded guilty on Friday to three criminal charges, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said.
Nikhil Gupta, 54, pleaded guilty to murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to commit money laundering, which carry a maximum combined sentence of 40 years in prison, the spokesperson said.
Gupta entered his plea before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn in Manhattan federal court.
Lawyers for Gupta were not immediately available for comment. Gupta has been jailed in Brooklyn since his June 2024 extradition to the United States from the Czech Republic, where he had been arrested a year earlier. He had pleaded not guilty immediately after his extradition.
U.S. prosecutors accused Gupta of plotting with an Indian government official to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a U.S. resident and dual U.S.-Canadian citizen who advocated for a sovereign Sikh state in northern India.
India's government has dissociated itself from any plot against Pannun, saying it was against government policy.
The discovery of alleged assassination plots against Sikh separatists in the United States and Canada has tested relations with India, which has also denied involvement in such plots. REUTERS

Trump's repeal of climate rule opens a 'new front' for litigation
The Trump administration's repeal of an Obama-era scientific finding that greenhouse gases pose a public health threat could open up a new pathway for filing lawsuits against power-plant operators and other companies.
Legal experts said the policy reversal could lead to a surge in lawsuits known as "public nuisance" actions, a pathway that had been blocked following a 2011 Supreme Court ruling that regulation of greenhouse gas emissions should be left in the hands of the Environmental Protection Agency instead of the courts.
Now that the EPA has abandoned that regulatory effort, the legal shield created by the 2011 decision will likely unravel, legal experts said.
"This may be another classic case where overreach by the Trump administration comes back to bite it," said Robert Percival, a University of Maryland environmental law professor.
The Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday repealed a 2009 scientific determination known as the endangerment finding, which has been the foundation for federal climate regulations.
The endangerment finding is what led the EPA to take action under the Clean Air Act of 1963 to curb emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and four other heat-trapping air pollutants from vehicles, power plants and other industries.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has called the rescission of the endangerment finding "the largest act of deregulation in the history of the United States." Power companies have generally favoured President Donald Trump's deregulatory agenda, but have expressed concern about the repeal of the endangerment finding, triggering a wave of lawsuits.
The Edison Electric Institute, which represents publicly traded electric utilities, said in September that rescinding the endangerment finding comes with the "potential for increased litigation alleging common-law claims, regardless of the merits of those suits."
'New front' opening
US courts have long recognised a legal theory known as "public nuisance," which prohibits activities that unreasonably interfere with the health and safety of a community.
Public nuisance lawsuits are typically brought by state and local governments and seek to make the party responsible for the nuisance pay to abate, or fix, the condition.
The cases are hard to win, in part because of difficulties in proving direct causation between a specific defendant's emissions and particular climate harms. But legal experts have said they are one potential tool for environmental activists to hold greenhouse gas emitters liable for climate harms.
In a 2004 lawsuit, California and five other states alleged that big power companies had created a public nuisance by contributing to climate change. The defendants included American Electric Power and Xcel Energy.
The case eventually ended up before the US Supreme Court, which ruled against the six states in a unanimous 2011 decision.
Writing for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said regulating greenhouse gases should be left to the EPA under the Clean Air Act. That law and subsequent EPA actions like the endangerment finding, Ginsburg wrote, "displace the claims the plaintiffs seek to pursue."
That 2011 decision allowed power companies to escape public nuisance lawsuits filed in federal courts, though some cases brought in state courts have survived.
The policy reversal could give public nuisance cases a new lease on life, legal experts said.
"This has the potential to change the stakes of the game," said University of Pennsylvania law professor Sarah Light. "If the Clean Air Act no longer applies to greenhouse gas emissions, then there's no comprehensive statutory scheme in which Congress intended to displace nuisance claims, so they would likely be able to proceed in court."
Jenner & Block environmental lawyer Meghan Greenfield agreed that a "new front" for lawsuits may be opening up.
"This is an area where things had been settled for the past 15 years, and, especially as the EPA steps out of this space for regulation, you can imagine others wanting to push those fronts ever harder," Greenfield said.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. A storage building housing art pieces at the Kiev-Pechersk Historical-Cultural Preserve has been flooded due to a burst pipe, Ukraine’s Liga-net media outlet reported, citing the Culture Ministry.
According to the news outlet, a water heating pipe burst in the building’s attic, flooding the first and second floors, where exhibits in the Negatives, Drawings and Paintings categories are stored. A total of about 4,000 pieces were at risk.
The water largely affected the outer surface of cabinets and caused plaster to crumble in some places, while support structures weren’t damaged. After the accident, the humidity level reached 90% on the second floor and 69% on the first floor, while the temperature stood at about 4.5 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Fahrenheit).
Efforts are now underway to deal with the aftermath of the burst pipe. Workers have started to dry the premises, temporarily removing the sodden exhibits to safer areas, while art restorers and custodians are examining all items one by one to figure out the level of damage and make a plan to restore and conserve the works.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia’s pipeline gas supplies to Turkey slightly increased in 2025 compared with the previous year to 21.2 bln cubic meters (bcm), according to TASS’ calculations based on figures provided by Turkey’s Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EPDK).
In December, Turkey imported a total of 2.3 bcm from Russia via the Turkish Stream and Blue Stream, according to the agency.
In 2025, Russian gas shipments to Turkey reached 21.16 bln cubic meters (+0.4%). Including liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments (none were made in 2025), overall Russian gas supplies to Turkey fell by 2% last year.
Russia supplies gas to Turkey via two pipelines through the Black Sea. Blue Stream was commissioned in early 2003. The design capacity of the pipeline spanning 1,213 kilometers is 16 bln cubic meters per year. The export gas pipeline TurkStream consists of two lines, one of which is designed for delivering gas to Turkish consumers, while the second one supplies gas to southern and southeastern European countries. The total capacity of TurkStream commissioned in January 2020 amounts to 31.5 bcm, with its operation starting in January 2020.
Turkey's gas consumption in 2025 set an all-time record, according to TASS calculations based on data from the Turkish EPIAS exchange. Last year’s domestic gas demand in Turkey approached 64 bln cubic meters (+13% compared to 2024).

UN accuses paramilitary RSF of committing war crimes in Sudan’s el-Fasher
UN rights chief urges probe as new report details mass killings, sexual violence and targeted attacks against civilians.
The Sudanese paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) carried out war crimes and a possible crime against humanity in its takeover of Sudan’s western city of el-Fasher last year, the United Nations human rights office has said.
In a report (PDF) released on Friday, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said “there are reasonable grounds to believe” the RSF and allied armed groups committed acts amounting to war crimes.

Those acts include murder, intentional attacks against civilians, sexual violence such as rape, torture, and the use of starvation as a weapon of war, the report found.
“If committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, these acts may also amount to a crime against humanity,” it said.
The RSF seized control of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, on October 26, 2025, after the withdrawal of the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), which have been fighting the paramilitary group for control of Sudan since April 2023.
The takeover came after an 18-month siege that cut el-Fasher off from food, medicine and other critical supplies and prompted warnings of mass starvation.
Tens of thousands of residents fled the city after the RSF took control, according to UN figures, with many describing widespread violence on their journeys out of el-Fasher. Human rights advocates and other experts also warned that mass killings had taken place.
‘Like a horror movie’
Friday’s report, which the UN said was based on interviews with more than 140 victims and witnesses, described the mass killing of hundreds of people at an El Fasher University dormitory called Al-Rashid.
According to survivors of the attack, RSF fighters besieged the building, which had been sheltering about 1,000 civilians, and opened fire with “heavy weapons”, the report found. About 500 people were killed, and many others were wounded.
“One witness described how bodies were thrown into the air by the force of the assault, ‘like a scene out of a horror movie’,” the UN rights office said.
The report also documented several instances of summary executions, with survivors and witnesses describing how the RSF killed civilians accused of collaborating with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and allied groups.
In one case, on October 26, a witness reported seeing RSF fighters round up about 300 young men in el-Fasher’s Daraja Oula neighbourhood before dividing them into groups of 30.
“The RSF fighters then opened fire on each group until there was no longer any movement, lobbed grenades at some groups, and deployed a gas burner against others, systematically executing all of those that had been detained,” the report said.
The RSF and its supporters initially tried to downplay the atrocities committed in el-Fasher, accusing allied armed groups of being responsible. The group’s leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti, has also promised an investigation.
UN calls for probe
Volker Turk, the UN human rights chief, on Friday called for “credible and impartial investigations” into what happened in el-Fasher.
“These must lead to meaningful accountability for perpetrators of exceptionally serious crimes, through all available means,” said Turk, including in Sudanese courts, third states, or at the International Criminal Court or other mechanisms.
Turk also called on all parties to the conflict in Sudan to end human rights violations and on third countries “with influence” to take action to prevent further atrocities.
“This includes respecting the arms embargo already in place, and ending the supply, sale or transfer of arms or military material to the parties,” he said.
Deadly violence has continued in several regions of Sudan, with a Sudanese doctors’ group saying this week that at least two children were killed in an RSF drone attack on a mosque in North Kordofan state.
Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of providing military and financial support to the RSF, an allegation that Abu Dhabi has vehemently denied.

Russia Stops Publishing Officials’ Salary Data

Russia’s state statistics agency Rosstat has stopped publishing data on the salaries and headcount of federal and municipal officials, the independent research platform To Be Precise reported, in the latest move to limit the public’s access to information about the public sector.
Rosstat has also removed data on the share of women among municipal employees, an indicator previously used to track progress toward the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.
Salary information for the social sector and academia has also been made unavailable, the project said, with pay data for medical personnel, teachers, university lecturers, orphanage staff, cultural workers and scientists vanishing.
Statistics for the third quarter of 2024 were due at the end of November, but the platform instead carried a notice of a temporary suspension of publication.
Rosstat has not disclosed salary data for civilian employees of government agencies, which were previously published annually, since 2022.
According to the latest available figures, these officials’ average monthly income stood at 79,800 rubles ($1,040), rising to 197,000 rubles ($2,570) in federal bodies.
By comparison, the nationwide average monthly salary in 2022 was 65,300 rubles ($850), while the median wage was 40,300 rubles ($526).
Sberbank CEO German Gref said Wednesday that Russian civil servants live in “impoverished conditions” and called for them to be paid more, arguing this would reduce the number of “corrupt fools” in government.
At the same time, Gref acknowledged that “It’s human nature to always be figuring out how to get rich.”
The exiled news outlet Faridaily reported that 246 million rubles ($3.2 million) had been allocated in the 2025 federal budget to cover the salaries of Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and his 10 deputies. On average, each received a post-tax income of around 1.3 million rubles ($17,000) per month.
President Vladimir Putin allowed himself, lawmakers and other officials to stop filing public income declarations in December, scrapping rules in place since 1995.
Declarations are now required only upon entering public service, appointment to a new post, transfer to another government body or for inclusion in higher-level federal management bodies.
Officials must also report income when conducting transactions exceeding their family’s combined earnings over three years.
Transparency International has ranked Russia 157th out of 182 countries for public-sector corruption.

US expects Europe to spend more on defense, world order — envoy to UN

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The Washington administration expects its European allies to increase spending on defense and maintaining the current world order, US permanent representative to the UN Mike Waltz said at the Munich Security Conference.
The diplomat assured that Washington would actively seek to preserve the existing world order but questioned the willingness of its European allies to do so. "Are the Europeans willing and able to take tough financial steps necessary?" he pointed out.
Waltz argued that Washington has shouldered the main financial burden of maintaining "the rules-based order since World War II." "However, with 37 trillion [dollars] in debt and counting the massive debt load that the Western world is facing, I think it is fair on their behalf to ask 450 million Europeans with the same size economy as the United States, to be more self-sustaining in their own defense," he added.
"We’re asking the rest of the world to be there with us in a fair way financially, because there is a cost of the status quo, and the status quo is not sustainable anymore," the diplomat emphasized.

Europe's regions are in danger of being squeezed as the EU considers sweeping changes to the way its 27 member states spend their money, warns the European official tasked with reducing inequalities among the bloc's hundreds of towns and regions.
Kata Tütto, a Hungarian socialist, and president of the European Committee of the Regions, tells Talking Europe's Douglas Herbert that the EU's next long-term budget, which runs from 2028 to 2034, risks quietly shrinking the money that underpins local investment under the EU's region-focused Cohesion Policy.
At the centre of the controversy is a proposed "mega-fund" worth roughly €865 billion, which would pool money for farmers and poorer regions in a single pot.
That may sound vast. But spread across seven years and 260 regions, the reality is far less impressive, Tütto says. Under the current proposals, funding for regions would fall to roughly half of today's level. It's a shift that could hollow out the EU's cohesion policy, the main tool designed to reduce economic gaps between Europe's cities and regions.
The timing, Tüttő argues, could hardly be worse. Every region – rich or poor – is undergoing a demographic, climate and technological transition. In a world of constant crisis and mounting threats, she warns, governments are tempted to sacrifice long-term investment for short-term fixes, centralising decisions and draining attention and money away from the local level.
While Tüttő accepts that defence and security now dominate the political agenda, she challenges the definition of what security means. It is not only about tanks, borders or drones, she says, but also about safe drinking water, affordable housing, clean energy and resilient infrastructure – the everyday needs that allow societies to function when shocks hit.
Tütto's message to Brussels is blunt: Europe cannot project strength abroad if it allows inequality and instability to grow at home.
Undermining Cohesion Policy, she warns, would weaken the very base that allows the European Union to act together economically, politically and strategically.

Are your Valentine’s chocolates costing more this year? Blame Trump and a weak supply chain
Chocolate makers such as Mondelez and Hershey hedge cocoa months in advance, so they still pay above market rates, limiting how much savings reach shoppers

Skyrocketing Valentine’s Day chocolate prices are turning gift-giving into a bittersweet affair for lovers across the U.S., even though global cocoa prices have dropped sharply from record highs.
A recent study by online loan marketplace Lending Treefound that boxed chocolate assortments have risen 11.8 percent on average since last February, with some products nearly doubling in price.
There are a couple of factors experts say are responsible - the Supply claim and policy coming from the White House.
Not many commodities have dropped as sharply this year as cocoa, the main ingredient in chocolate. After hitting record highs that really hurt West African exporters, prices have been falling for months. A few years of tight supply had pushed cocoa costs to eye-popping levels, peaking at $10,000 per metric ton in May, far above the $2,500-$3,000 range seen for most of the 2010s, Axios reports.
While supply has begun to loosen, pushing prices downward, nearly 30 percent over the past month alone, much of the chocolate available to consumers today was manufactured with cocoa purchased at these record-high rates.
Large chocolate makers hedge their cocoa purchases months in advance to protect against market swings. As a result, companies such as Mondelez, maker of Cadbury and Toblerone and Hershey are still paying above current spot-market rates. This lag between commodity prices and retail costs limits how much manufacturers can pass on savings to shoppers.
Consumers may see relief in the future seasons rather than this Vanetine’s Day, Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put suggested to investors this week, Axios reports.
“There’s not a lot we can do anymore, but 2027 certainly will benefit from this,” Van de Put said.
Hershey CEO Kirk Tanner said last week that last year’s price increases didn’t fully cover “cocoa price inflation in 2026,” according to the outlet. He added that if cocoa prices continue to fall, the company may not need to raise prices further in the future.
Trade policy has also played a significant role in the price of Valentine’s Day chocolate. Some chocolate manufacturers say inventory purchased under Trump‑era tariffs added to their cost burdens.
The administration lifted tariffs on cocoa beans, paste and butter in mid-November, giving companies such as Ghirardelli and Hershey some year-end relief. However, imported brands such as Cadbury, Valrhona, Nestlé, and Lindt still carry an additional 15 percent cost, according to the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist think tank in Washington, D.C.
Despite these higher costs, consumers are largely absorbing them, and Valentine’s Day spending is expected to rise by $1.4 billion, showing that demand for chocolate remains strong even amid tariffs, weather-driven shortages and modest declines in confectionery employment.

Fire in Budapest suburb kills at least 3 and injures 22
Hungarian authorities say a fire has killed at least three people and injured 22 others near Budapest
- Bookmark
At least three people died and nearly two dozen others were injured after a building used as temporary lodgings for workers caught fire early Friday in a suburb of Hungary's capital, authorities said.
Firefighters extinguished the fire in Budakeszi, about five miles (eight kilometers) west of Budapest, after it engulfed the two-story building in the early morning hours, according to Hungary's National Directorate General for Disaster Management.
More than 40 paramedics and 18 emergency vehicles were dispatched to the scene. Firefighters pulled several survivors and three gas cylinders from the building. The bodies of two men and a woman were found beneath the collapsed roof of the building, a spokesperson for the disaster management authority said.
In a news conference Friday, a spokesperson for the Pest County Police Headquarters said an explosion in one of the rooms likely caused the fire. He added that several irregularities were discovered in the building, including gas usage that was out of compliance with regulations.
A criminal investigation has been launched in the case, police said.
Paramedics treated 22 people for injuries sustained during the fire, including four whose injuries were life-threatening. The injured were transported to eight hospitals in Budapest for further treatment.

How Emerald Fennell Changes the Villain of ‘Wuthering Heights’
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

01:25:34 KST

Warning: This post contains spoilers for "Wuthering Heights."
If you go into Emerald Fennell's "Wuthering Heights" expecting a faithful page-to-screen adaptation of Emily Brontë's classic 1847 gothic romance novel, you may come away from the film, now in theaters, feeling a mix of confusion, shock, and, depending on your sensibilities, maybe even a little disgust.
Fennell's maximalist bodice-ripper instead embodies the story the Promising Young Woman and Saltburn filmmaker felt she experienced when she first read Wuthering Heights at age 14. Starring Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff, the star-crossed lovers/tormenters at the center of Brontë's timeless tale of all-consuming yearning turned monstrously vengeful obsession, Fennell's "Wuthering Heights" (quotation marks intentional) is a conspicuously loose interpretation of its source material.
"I wanted to make something that made me feel like I felt when I first read it, which means that it's an emotional response to something. It's, like, primal, sexual," Fennell told the BBC. "I know that if somebody else made it, I'd be furious. It's very personal material for everyone. It's very illicit. The way we relate to the characters is very private, I think."
Knowing this was Fennell's approach may make it easier to digest the significant liberties she took with the book, including casting age-inappropriate—and in Heathcliff's case, arguably race-inappropriate—leads, eliminating Brontë's use of unreliable narrators to relay the events of the story, and cutting the entire second half of the novel in order to bypass the suffering inflicted on the next generation of characters. These choices allow Fennell to indulge in a raunchy, BDSM-infused version of the narrative that centers on the tumultuous love-hate relationship between Cathy and Heathcliff. They also raise questions surrounding Fennell's framing of the true villain of the windswept English drama.
In Brontë's Wuthering Heights, Heathcliff is the overt antagonist of the story. Described in the novel as black-haired, black-eyed, and dark-skinned—characterizations that, while racially ambiguous, are widely interpreted by scholars as intended to convey otherness—Heathcliff is introduced as an orphan of unknown origins who is adopted into the Earnshaw family by Catherine's father and raised alongside her. Following Mr. Earnshaw's death, Heathcliff is forced to endure extreme physical and psychological abuse at the hands of Cathy's alcoholic, gambling degenerate of an older brother, Hindley (a role that is subsumed by Martin Clunes' Mr. Earnshaw in Fennell's film).
Heathcliff flees Wuthering Heights as a teenager, in the wake of overhearing Catherine's apparent rejection of him and announcement that she has accepted a proposal from the wealthy, fair-haired, and fair-skinned heir to the neighboring estate of Thrushcross Grange, Edgar Linton (played in the movie by English, Scottish, and Pakistani actor Shazad Latif). Heathcliff then returns, years later and bearing a mysterious windfall of newfound wealth, with the express goal of inflicting as much cruelty and pain as possible on the remaining members of the Earnshaw and Linton families. He behaves abominably, manipulating Edgar's naive sister Isabella into a loveless and severely abusive marriage, and later mercilessly tormenting Hindley's son, Hareton; his own son with Isabella, Linton; and Cathy and Edgar's daughter, also named Catherine, up until nearly the moment of his death.
Of course, this is only the full truth of the matter if you take the word of Catherine's handmaid and confidante, Nelly, at face value. As a longtime servant of the Earnshaw and Linton families—and Wuthering Heights' primary narrator—Nelly offers a firsthand but highly biased accounting of the events of the novel. While she presents herself as the story's voice of reason and morality, she frequently interjects her own opinions, prejudices, and emotions, leaving the reliability of her retelling up to reader interpretation. And these interpretations certainly vary. While some see Nelly as an empathetic and motherly caretaker, others view her as a manipulative, calculating instigator who shapes the narrative to justify her own actions. Fennell, for her part, seems to side with the latter sentiment.
Played by Vietnamese American actor Hong Chau, the Nelly of Fennell's film is reframed as the illegitimate daughter of a lord, and she is directly involved in the misunderstandings that drive the movie's central tragedies. First, in a moment of spiteful vindictiveness, she goads Catherine into confessing that it would "degrade" her to marry Heathcliff, despite having just heard Catherine's ardent profession of love for him and knowing he has begun eavesdropping on the conversation. This leads to the fracture in Catherine and Heathcliff's relationship that dooms them all to ruin.
Later, when a pregnant Catherine falls ill and subsequently tells Nelly she has lost the baby, Nelly doesn't believe she is actually sick and treats her as though she is playing up her heartbreak for attention. Nelly burns all the letters Heathcliff attempts to send Catherine, gets out of being fired by Catherine by using her infidelity against her, and convinces Edgar he shouldn't see her for months on end, a series of decisions that ultimately result in Catherine's death from sepsis.
Fennell doesn't portray this behavior as coming out of nowhere; Nelly's actions appear to be driven by her long-held bitterness at having been cast off as Cathy's closest friend as soon as Heathcliff entered the picture. As far as grudges go, this one runs dangerously deep.
Fennell's Heathcliff, on the other hand, is stripped of the majority of his villainy. Not only is there no next-gen of children for him to torture, but rather than a battered wife, Isabella (played by Alison Oliver) is presented as a seemingly willing participant in his sadomasochism. Introduced as Edgar's gleefully unhinged ward rather than his sister, Isabella enters into what appears to be a consensual dominant-submissive marriage with Heathcliff in which she gets off on his mistreatment of her. Heathcliff's greatest crime in Fennell's version? Loving Catherine with uncontrollably reckless abandon.
As far as true evil goes, that's not much of a crime at all. Manslaughter by neglect, on the other hand? Pretty unforgivable.

10 best supermarket wines for Valentine’s Day, according to sommeliers and experts

Experts share the best supermarket champagne and sparkling wine, perfect for Valentine’s Day
From award-winning Aldi to Co-op bottles of fizz, these are the bargain bottles to try
- Bookmark
If you're about to celebrate the big day of love (aka, Valentine’s Day) with a delicious dinner and a bottle of something fizzy, rest assured it doesn’t need to be a flute of Laurent Perrier or Veuve Clicquot to be special. The best supermarket champagne and sparkling wines are more than impressive enough to add to your shopping basket, and more budget-friendly, too.
Last year, Co-op’s champagne was crowned one of the world’s best at the International Wine & Spirit Competition, while Aldi’s £15 bottle won at the World Champagne Awards 2025, and Tesco was close behind with its Clubcard-favourite premier cru. Indeed, ask any sommelier or industry insider, and they’ll tell you that supermarkets and independent houses are producing some of the most exciting and award-winning bottles on the market.
“Supermarket own labels often offer a great entry point for Champagne,” explains wine critic Rosamund Hall, “as they’re working with highly respected producers to source high quality wines for the best value available – you won't find quirky ‘grower champagne’ finesse, but you can expect well made, highly enjoyable wines that will be a perfect pour for any occasion.”
The marrying of affordability and quality is thanks to better wine-making technology and warmer climates (particularly for English sparkling wine from Dorset, Kent and Sussex), but also higher consumer demand. “Consumers are becoming more knowledgeable, more savvy; they can look anything up on the internet,” says Libby Brodie, wine consultant and columnist. This doesn't just apply to champagne – the supermarkets are brimming with fantastic prosecco, sommelier-approved wines, premium-quality whisky.

So, when faced with a giant supermarket aisle, where do you start when selecting a fizz? “I personally like to look outside of champagne when it comes to value for money, as even with supermarket own brands, I find you get much more bang for your buck,” says Lucy Hitchcock, the wine influencer behind the @Partnerinwineuk social media account. “To find those hidden gems, look out for words like traditional method, crémant, and method cap classique (MCC) on the label. All of these wines are made in the same way as champagne, often using similar grape blends.”
To narrow down your search further, Hitchcock highlights South Africa for wine-making. “The very best is Graham Beck's pinot noir rosé 2018/19, which has this richness and depth of flavours that rivals Laurent Perrier rosé.”

Also offering stellar value for money are regions just outside of Champagne, including Hitchcock’s favourite, crémant from Limoux. “This vintage from Laithwaites is made from champagne grapes but is a fraction of the price of your usual vintage champagnes. Five years ageing for £13.99 on offer is a very good deal indeed.”
Whether you’ve got a special occasion in the calendar or are stocking up for 2026, I’ve asked industry experts to choose their favourite bottles of supermarket champagne and fizz.

1Graham Beck pinot noir rosé 2018/19
- ABV 11.5%
- Grapes Pinot noir, chardonnay
- Region Western Cape, South Africa
Graham Beck is fast becoming one of the world’s best independent sparkling wine brands, and this is “South Africa’s answer to rosé champagne – all pinot noir with four years ageing,” says Hitchcock. Describing it as having “creamy bubbles, juicy strawberry and raspberry with a pink grapefruit twist, plus that champagne-style brioche note”, it sounds delicious. “If you love Laurent Perrier rosé, you’ll love this.”
2M&S Collection St Gall champagne brut
- ABV 12.5%
- Grapes Pinot noir, chardonnay
- Region Champagne, France
“This gorgeous champagne is made by one of the best cooperatives, Union Champagne, whose members are working across some of the best sites in the regions of Côte des Blancs and Montagne de Reims,” Hall explains. “A chardonnay-heavy blend alongside pinot noir, you can expect a wine that delivers an uplifting bite of fresh green apples alongside warming buttered toast and a delicate nutty note.”
3Les Pionniers vintage champagne brut 2013
- ABV 12%
- Grapes Pinot noir, chardonnay
- Region Champagne, France
Co-op’s own champagne, the Les Pionniers vintage brut 2013, was the only supermarket champagne to win an IWSC trophy this year. “It outperformed wines nearly three times the price and hugely over-delivers for the price,” says Brodie. “They've taken their time, ageing it for over a decade, resulting in these gorgeous, delicate brioche and lemon curd notes, crisp citrus and refined bubbles.”
Hall agrees: “I am consistently impressed by all of the Co-op’s Les Pinonniers range, and this vintage champagne is no exception.” The blend of pinot noir and chardonnay is made for the supermarket “by Compagnie Champenoise, aka Piper & Charles Heidsieck, and it feels effortlessly luxurious with a rich, creamy mousse which delivers abundant notes of delicate twists of lemon alongside soft baked brioche and toasted hazelnuts”.
4Tesco English sparkling wine
- ABV 12%
- Grapes Chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier
- Region Kent, England
“I am all for championing English sparkling wine and Tesco’s Finest [bottle] is great value, especially as it’s created at award-winning Balfour Estate in Kent by one of the loveliest winemakers, Fergus Elias,” says Brodie. “The same grapes as champagne, it has whispers of shortbread and hazelnut alongside glorious English green apples and fun fizz.” Easily rivalling champagne at a fraction of the price, it’s well worth a try on your next weekly shop.
5Roche Lacour cuvée de réserve crémant de Limoux 2018
- ABV 12.5%
- Grapes Chardonnay, chenin blanc, pinot noir
- Regions Limoux, Languedoc‑Roussillon, France
Roche Lacour’s cuvée is “made like champagne but from Limoux, with chardonnay and pinot noir [grapes]”. With “five years on the lees, it gives it real depth – a classy alternative to champagne at a brilliant price,” says Hitchcock. “Think crisp apple, peach and citrus with a toasty richness from oak ageing”. Owing to popularity, the bottle is currently sold out – but sign up for an email notification when it's restocked.

Nigeria to hold presidential election in February 2027

Nigeria to hold presidential election in February 2027
February 13, 2026Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, will hold its presidential and parliamentary elections on Febuary 20, 2027, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced on Friday.
Joash Ojo Amupitan, the INEC chairman, also said the governorship and state legislature polls are scheduled for March 6, 2027, calling the upcoming elections a "significant milestone in (Nigeria's) democratic journey."
He said the elections will cover the offices of president and vice president; governors and deputy governors (except in Anambra, Bayelsa, Edo, Ekiti, Imo, Kogi, Ondo and Osun states); and members of the Senate, the House of Representatives and state Houses of Assembly.
Although INEC has introduced technology over the past decade to improve the integrity of election outcomes, it has had little success boosting public confidence, and post-election litigation remains commonplace.
Earlier this week, the Senate, the upper house, passed an amendment authorizing the real-time electronic transmission of election results. It had initially rejected the measure in the face of popular and political pressure.
Tinubu under pressure at home and abroad
The announcement comes as Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu faces mounting international pressure, particularly from the United States, over deteriorating security and rising jihadist attacks and kidnappings.
Many Nigerians are also criticizing Tinubu's economic reforms because rampant inflation, rising costs and the plummeting value of the naira against the dollar have divided the country.
The president is seeking reelection, and his supporters argue the reforms were necessary to stimulate long-term investment.
Tinubu was first elected president in February 2023, winning the first round with about 36% of the vote against Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi. The latter has already announced his intention to run again in the 2027 election.
Voter turnout was just 26%, eight percentage points lower than in the previous election. To win in the first round, a presidential candidate must secure at least 25% of the vote in more than two-thirds of the country's 36 states and the federal capital.

BUDAPEST, February 13. /TASS/. Russian oil supplies to Slovakia through the Druzhba oil pipeline have been suspended, Bloomberg reported, citing the Economy Ministry of the country. Earlier Hungarian media reported disruptions in crude oil transportation through the pipeline running through Ukrainian territory.
TASS has compiled the main information on the situation.
Ukraine blocked supplies of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary to create difficulties for the Hungarian government ahead of parliamentary elections, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Economic Relations Peter Szijjarto said following reports in Hungarian media about the pipeline's oil flows being blocked from going through Ukrainian territory.
Russian oil supplies to Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline have been suspended, Bloomberg reported, citing the republic's Economy Ministry.
Statements from Hungary and Slovakia
- Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Economic Relations Peter Szijjarto said that Ukraine had blocked supplies of Russian oil via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary to create difficulties for the government ahead of parliamentary elections. He noted that the Ukrainian authorities hope to give a leg up to the Hungarian opposition party Tisza, which seeks to take over power from the ruling party Fidesz - Hungarian Civic Union.
The minister called Kiev's actions gross interference in the elections and assured that even if Ukraine does not allow oil supplies to Hungary to resume via the Druzhba pipeline, the government will guarantee the security of energy supplies for all consumers.
- Russian oil supplies to Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline have been suspended, Bloomberg reported, citing the country's Economy Ministry. As the ministry noted, Slovakia has 90 days worth of strategic reserves of oil and petroleum products.
The Slovakian Economy Ministry of expects oil supplies via the Druzhba pipeline to resume in the coming days. According to the ministry, the situation does not pose a threat to the republic's energy security.
According to Bloomberg, oil has not been delivered to Slovakia via the Druzhba pipeline since early February. A significant reduction in supply volumes occurred already in January.
Kremlin statement
- Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he didn't have all the facts about the halt in oil transit through the Druzhba pipeline.
Ukraine's actions
- The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry summoned the Hungarian ambassador in Kiev to demand an explanation regarding Prime Minister Viktor Orban's recent statement that Ukraine is an enemy of Hungary because it is blocking Russian energy supplies, Szijjarto said noting that his government will not change its position.
- Ukrtransnafta, which provides oil transit through Ukrainian territory, is technically ready to resume oil transportation via the Druzhba pipeline to Hungary and Slovakia, but the company's management is not giving permission for the resumption of deliveries, several sources in the oil industry told TASS. According to the sources, the Ukrainian company completed the liquidation to the emergency situation at the Brody linear production and control station in Ukraine on February 6.
At the end of January, at the request of the Ukrainian side, oil transportation via the Mozyr-Brody main oil pipeline towards Hungary and Slovakia was suspended, but the exact reason for the shutdown is unknown.
About the pipeline
The Druzhba oil pipeline supplies oil to Belarusian refineries and transits it to Europe.
The pipeline starts in Russia’s Samara region, passes through Bryansk, and then branches into two sections: northern and southern.
Hungary and Slovakia receive oil directly via the southern branch.
Through Hungary oil goes further on to Serbia.

Top 10 Pay By Mobile Casinos
How We Rate Pay By Phone Bill Casinos
We have numerous stringent factors when it comes to evaluating pay by mobile casinos, ensuring that we only recommend the best online casinos to our readers. These include:
Licensing
We will only recommend gambling sites that carry a licence to trade which has been awarded by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC). The UKGC exists to enforce the rules set by independent review bodies such as eCOGRA, so any UK casinos that are not regulated by the UKGC are considered unsafe and should be avoided.
Security
Our recommended pay by phone casinos will all use up-to-date security features to protect customer details and data. Examples of such features include SSL encryption and two-factor authentication.
Reputation
We judge casinos by reputation and our impressions after using them. We consider established brands, such as Duelz, and new pay by phone casinos that have caught our eye for the quality of their overall product.
Game Variety
The best casino sites will provide plenty of variety for their users, whether that be slot games and roulette options or table games such as online poker. These games must be provided by a range of quality operators, such as NetEnt and Playtech.
Customer Experience
What is the customer getting out of the casino? Are there enough games, such as slots, table games and live casino? Does it have a reputation as a high payout casino? There should be a variety of options and themes to satisfy all users.
Usability
How easy is the pay by mobile casino site and app to use? We only want to use sites that offer sound usability and functionality across the board, whether you’re using the desktop site, Apple or Android app, or a mobile browser.
Payment Methods
Along with Pay By Mobile, users should have access to a variety of payment options to reflect modern transactions. Bank transfers and debit cards are staples, but we want to ensure that newer methods are available, such as e-wallets and Apple Pay casinos.
Welcome Bonus
New customers should be rewarded with a quality casino sign up bonus. If we’re not satisfied with the casino bonuses on offer we won’t recommend the pay by phone bill casino site.
Promotions
Promotions should not end after the welcome bonus. Users should have options such as free spins, free play games, free bets and prize draws, among others.
Payout Rates
When recommending pay by phone casinos, we check that their games have a reasonable volatility and RTP, and chances for users to win fairly.
Responsible Gambling
We only recommend pay by mobile casino sites that promote responsible gambling and provide the requisite tools to help players manage their gambling habits.
Online casinos should take responsible gambling seriously, offering a range of support methods to aid users who require assistance. Deposit limits, loss limits and self-exclusion should all be on hand and easily accessible.
How to Deposit to a Pay By Mobile Casino
Pay by mobile makes it easy to fund your casino account without needing a debit card or e-wallet. Instead, your deposit amount is added to your mobile phone bill or deducted from your pay-as-you-go balance.
- Choose a Casino - Pick one of our recommended pay by mobile casino sites and follow the link to sign up.
- Select Pay by Mobile method - During the deposit process, choose pay by mobile (or a branded version like fonix) as your payment method.

- Complete Deposit - Once confirmed, the funds will appear in your casino account instantly. The charge will then show up on your next phone bill or be deducted from your prepaid credit.
How to Withdraw From a Pay By Phone Bill Casino
Unfortunately, you cannot use pay by mobile to withdraw funds from casino apps or sites.
- Fast withdrawal casino sites offer alternative banking methods, including debit card, bank transfer, PayPal, Skrill, Neteller and Payz.
- Debit card is the easiest withdrawal method, with users simply needing to enter their card details before the money arrives within 12 hours (and often as quickly as two hours).
- With a PayPal casino, customers can withdraw funds in a similar manner, though the processing time is a little longer – usually around 24 hours.
- A Payz, Neteller or Skrill casino work in a similar manner to debit card withdrawals. Your bank account and card are linked to your account, so you simply withdraw into that.
The withdrawal system works in a similar way to deposits:
- Select your withdrawal method.
- If required enter your details. Financial details are protected by the latest security software.
- Enter the withdrawal amount and confirm your withdrawal.
- Depending on your chosen withdrawal method, your funds will be returned within 24 hours to 72 hours.
Types of Pay By Mobile Deposits
Pay by mobile casinos will differ on the type of method they use to take pay by mobile deposits. These include:
Boku: Boku is one of the most recognisable brands online for accepting mobile payments. This method simply adds the payment to your mobile bill or removes i from your pre-paid credit. It’s simple, safe and secure, ensuring that no financial details are shared with the online casino.
Fonix: Fonix permits pay by mobile deposit up to £40 at a time, with a minimum £10 deposit required. It’s a common method available on most pay by phone casinos and allows you to add the deposit to your mobile phone bill to be paid at the end of the month. Fonix is reliable and straightforward, making the process seamless.
PayForIt: PayForIt is notable for its partnerships with major mobile networks in the UK. Sky, O2, Vodafone, Virgin, EE and Three are among the brands available for customers to simply deposit, with those funds added to their mobile bill at the end of the month. It has simple aesthetics and straightforward instructions to complete deposits quickly.
Pay By Mobile Slots
Slot games are the pathway for new customers to integrate their way into life with pay by mobile casino sites. Here are the most popular pay by mobile slots that new users will come across after signing up.
Rich Wilde and Book of the Dead: Rich Wilde and Book of the Dead is featured across many welcome offers for new UK casino sign ups. This pay by mobile slot was created in 2016 by Playn’ Go and offers a simplistic gameplay for new users, needing simply to match up three symbols across a 5x3 grid to win prizes, including free spins and cash. It stands for its high RTP, ranging from 96.21 per cent to 94 per cent depending on your chosen casino site. Other notable slot games in the Wilde series include Wildest Gambit and Rich Wilde and the Tome of Insanity.
Big Bass Bonanza: The Big Bass series is arguably the most notable slot games available from pay by mobile casino sites. From Pragmatic Play, Big Bass Bonanza provides new customers with a simple gameplay system where they can learn and understand the rules of basic slots before progressing further should they wish. Big Bass Bonanza is one of the many Big Bass titles available and features only behind Big Bass Splash for longevity. Users play on a 5x3 grid and can play on 10 paylines to secure prizes such as cash and free spins. Big Bass Bonanza has a high RTP of 96.71 per cent, making it a perfect slot game for new customers to get the most out of their first gameplay experience online.
Secrets of Phoenix: Created in 2017 by Roxor Gaming, Secrets of Phoenix is part of the welcome offer from Bally Casino where new users can secure 30 free spins to use on this pay by mobile slot. It follows a theme from other online slots available for new customers where it is simple, allowing users to match symbols using an Aztec-theme to unlock prizes. Unlike more complex slots, players only need to track symbols on a 5x3 grid with up to 25 paylines. It has an RTP of 94 per cent, highlighting its appeal for new customers learning their way with online slots. The payouts from gaming are not as high as other slots, but still offer a good chance of regular wins.
Pay By Mobile Casino Sites: What are the Pros & Cons?
Pay By Mobile Casinos: Responsible Gambling
Gambling should be seen as a form of entertainment, not a reliable way to generate income. Set a clear budget before you play, never exceed it, and avoid the temptation to chase losses.
All reputable casinos offer responsible gambling tools to help maintain healthy habits. These include options like deposit caps, loss limits, cooling-off periods and full self-exclusion if needed.
These tools are also available on betting sites, bingo sites, new slot sites, or any other type of regulated online gambling platform.
Be sure not to get too carried away by free spins and free bet offers, which may seem valuable on first glance, but can become addictive.
Should you wish to seek help for gambling-related issues, there are several charities and healthcare providers who offer support and information:

Nearly 5 million people missing out on £220 a year, broadband experts warn

Nearly 5 million people missing out on £220 a year, broadband experts warn
One expert describes the issue as a ‘cost of living scandal’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Millions of people are missing out on easy-to-access discounts worth an average £220 on their broadband despite being eligible, experts have warned.
Broadband social tariffs are generally available to low-income households, or those in receipt of certain benefits like Universal Credit. Exact eligibility varies between providers, with many major firms now offering some form of cheaper product.
Around 5.3 million UK households are eligible for the lower tariff, research by Broadband Genie found, but around 4.8 million aren’t currently claiming.
This means £1.05bn is “left on the table,” the broadband experts say, urging those who may be eligible to look into the scheme.
Georgina Colman, founder of Purpl, a platform which helps connect disabled people with discounts, said the issue was a “cost of living scandal hiding in plain sight”.
She added: “Millions of people on low incomes, including disabled people and those on Universal Credit, are overpaying for broadband simply because they don’t know help exists”.
There are several social tariffs currently on the market. BT has three offerings for people depending on their income and needs, called the ‘Home Essentials’ tariff.
This starts at from £16 a month for 12 months of 36Mb broadband for those with no income. The next level is £22 a month for 36Mb for those on low-income, and finally there is an offering for 67Mb at £25 a month. Each comes with an £11.99 installation fee.
Other big-name providers offering social broadband tariffs include Now, Sky, Virgin and Vodaphone, all costing £20 a month at most.

There are also some smaller-name providers that offer social tariffs that aren’t available nationwide. This includes Community Fibre, Hyperoptic, and Kcom.
Ms Colman added: “Broadband is an essential service, and when households could be saving around £220 a year, the lack of awareness around social tariffs is letting people down. Providers need to do far more to actively tell customers what they’re entitled to.
“If broadband becomes unaffordable, disabled people don’t just lose an internet connection, they lose a vital lifeline. For many, it’s how they stay in touch with family, access support, manage their health and avoid isolation. Disabled people are already more likely to experience loneliness, and pricing them out of broadband risks cutting them off from the world at a time when digital access is no longer optional.”
Around £24bn of support is estimated to go unclaimed in 2025/26, according to research unit Policy in Practice, due to reasons like stigma, complexity lack of awareness. Broadband represents the biggest social tariff that is missed out on, with missed Universal Credit claims being the leading missed benefit at £11.1bn unclaimed.

'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture

'Modern Ukrainian technology, battle-tested' — Zelensky unveils 1st drone produced by German-Ukrainian joint venture
President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 13 unveiled the first strike drone produced by a newly launched German-Ukrainian joint venture ahead of the Munich Security Conference, as he said in a statement published on X.
The launch marks the first Ukrainian drone production line in Germany and is part of Kyiv's broader effort to expand arms manufacturing in Europe, as the war with Russia drives sustained demand for unmanned systems.
"Today, I received the first jointly made attack drone. We saw the production line and the first flight of the drone," Zelensky wrote on X.
"This is modern Ukrainian technology. Battle-tested. Powered by AI. It will strike, it will scout, it will protect our soldiers," the president added.
Zelensky, accompanied by German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, visited Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI), a joint venture between Germany's Quantum Systems and Ukraine's Frontline Robotics.
During the visit, the Ukrainian-German Linza 3.0 multi-purpose drone was demonstrated and then handed over to Zelensky.
The facility is expected to produce up to 10,000 drones within a year, all of which will be delivered to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, according to the president.
The Linza 3.0 drone, developed by Frontline Robotics, is the latest version of the company's multi-purpose platform. The manufacturer said it features AI-enabled visual-inertial navigation, can carry up to 4 kilograms of payload, operate up to 15 kilometers (9 miles), and can stay in the air for up to 60 minutes.
The parties announced the start of joint production in December 2025, and Ukraine plans to open 10 more joint ventures by the end of 2026, Zelensky said. The president did not specify which countries the ventures would be located in.
The German production line builds on broader defense agreements signed between Kyiv and Berlin in December, when Germany committed 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in new defense deals.
The package included long-term sustainment support for Patriot air defense systems currently used by Ukraine, procurement of Ukrainian-made drones, and co-production initiatives between Quantum Systems and Frontline Robotics.
Zelensky previously announced that Ukrainian drone production would expand into Europe, noting that similar production lines are already operating in the U.K.
In October 2025, Zelensky instructed the Defense Ministry to launch a "controlled export" program for Ukrainian weapons, aiming to export surplus military equipment and reinvest profits into urgently needed systems.
Ukraine's drone industry has grown rapidly since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, with hundreds of companies producing reconnaissance and strike systems that now play a central role on the battlefield.
Establishing production lines in partner countries allows Ukrainian-developed systems to be manufactured at scale while deepening defense-industrial cooperation with European allies.

U.S. military says transfer of ISIS suspects from Syria to Iraq complete

U.S. military says controversial transfer of thousands of ISIS suspects from Syria to Iraq complete
The U.S. military said Friday that it had finished moving thousands of ISIS suspects from prisons and jails in Syria to facilities across the border in neighboring Iraq, completing a mission sparked by security concerns amid lingering unrest in post-war Syria that saw a mass-escape from one facility in late January.
"Central Command (CENTCOM) completed a transfer mission following a nighttime flight from northeastern Syria to Iraq on Feb. 12 to help ensure ISIS detainees remain secure in detention facilities," the U.S. military command responsible for operations in the Middle East said in a statement, adding that the 23-day operation, "resulted in U.S. forces successfully transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS fighters from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody."
"Job well done to the entire Joint Force team who executed this exceptionally challenging mission on the ground and in the air with great focus, professionalism, and collaboration with our regional partners," CENTCOM commander Adm. Brad Cooper said in the statement. "We appreciate Iraq's leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security."
"The successful execution of this orderly and secure transfer operation will help prevent an ISIS resurgence in Syria," added U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kevin Lambert, commander of the U.S.-led military coalition in the region tasked with the ongoing fight against ISIS remnants.
It's not clear if any of the prisoners have been charged with specific crimes, or even been confirmed as ISIS members. So, the decision by the U.S. to move them to Iraq — which has offered to put the detainees on trial — has drawn concern from rights groups citing a history in the country of "totally sham trials."
The concern, as voiced to CBS News by Sarah Sanbar, a researcher with the New York-based Human Rights Watch, is that many of the detainees could face terrorism charges in an opaque justice system that, just seven years ago, saw alleged ISIS militants, including European nationals, convicted and sentenced to death.
She said the last time such a large number of people were put before courts in Iraq, the "system was completely overwhelmed."
After Iraq defeated local elements of ISIS at the end of 2017, it put thousands of suspected members of the group on trial. According to the United Nations mission in Iraq, between January 2018 and October 2019, the Iraqi judiciary processed more than 20,000 terrorism-related cases.
Iraqi officials never released details on how many people convicted in these cases were sentenced to death during that period, but Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have said around 8,000 people remain on death row in the country, including non-Iraqi citizens.
Several news outlets, including The Wall Street Journal, reported in 2019 that seven French nationals were among the hundreds of people sentenced to death.
"They were totally sham trials," Sanbar told CBS News earlier this month. "Confessions obtained under torture, people being tortured in detention centers, trials that lasted 10 minutes without a lawyer present, where they were sentenced to death, on the basis of an anonymous informant and no corroborating evidence."
Responding to questions emailed by CBS News, an official with the Iraqi National Center of Justice and International Judicial Collaboration, rejected the accusations, saying the "Iraqi judiciary categorically rejects torture" and noting that "extracting confessions through coercion is a crime punishable under Iraqi law."
"Terrorism trials in Iraq are conducted in accordance with current laws and within a constitutional framework that guarantees the right to a fair trial, the defendant's right to a defense, and the eligibility of rulings for legal appeal," the official said, adding that all such proceedings were "overseen by specialized judges working under extraordinary circumstances imposed by the scale and nature of these crimes."
Iraq's judiciary announced on Feb. 2 that it had begun investigations into more than 1,300 ISIS suspects among those who had been transferred from Syria by the U.S.
Sanbar, of Human Rights Watch, said Iraq's justice system had "come a long way" since the 2019 trials, as the country itself has continued to stabilize, "but that being said, a lot of those core systemic issues still persist."
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the plan to transfer the prisoners months ago, saying they would "be in Iraq temporarily," and urging the detainees' home countries to repatriate their nationals.
But Iraq's top legal official, the President of the Supreme Judicial Council, Judge Dr. Faiq Zidan, said in a televised address on Jan. 23 that his country was fully prepared to handle the cases of ISIS suspects, foreign and domestic.
"While some countries refuse to receive their nationals involved in terrorist crimes, the Iraqi judiciary confirms its full readiness to try terrorists detained in camps within Syrian territory, in accordance with national laws and international obligations, ensuring fair and decisive trials, achieving justice for the victims of terrorism, and preserving security in Iraq and other countries," he said.
"We don't know who is there," Sanbar told CBS News of the detainees, who have now been moved to Iraq by the U.S. "Part of what we would call on authorities to do in Iraq, and the coalition, is to be very clear about who they're transferring, inform the families, give them access to legal representation, so that first and foremost, we know who's even there."
During a 2019 visit to a prison housing ISIS suspects in Hasaka, northeast Syria, CBS News found mostly Iraqi and Syrian inmates, but there were also many Europeans, Asians, Turks and citizens of other Arab countries. There was also one American man, but CBS News learned later that he had been repatriated.
So far, no third country has commented on the transfer of any foreign nationals to Iraq or the possibility of them being put on trial in the country. That came as no surprise to Sanbar.
"We've seen these countries whose citizens left to join ISIS completely washing their hands of any sort of responsibility. They've let them languish there for the last 10 years," said Sanbar. "We would hope that now they would take them home, and we call on them to do so."
The Iraqi National Center of Justice and International Judicial Collaboration told CBS News in early February that it was in communication with multiple countries regarding the matter, though it did not identify them.

Why is it in Greece’s best interests to strengthen ties with Türkiye?
Unknown

01:16:02 KST

The sixth Türkiye–Greece High-Level Cooperation Council in Ankara, marked by Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s visit and multiple cooperation deals, represented more than a symbolic diplomatic gesture.
The meeting this week indicated that both countries are committed to preserving a workable framework of cooperation and expanding collaboration in areas such as investment, maritime trade, economic cooperation, earthquake preparedness, culture, science, and technology.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan emphasised after the talks that disputes between the two neighbours are “solvable,” reinforcing Ankara’s preference for dialogue.
Athens’ stance indicates it also recognises the importance of handling disagreements while increasing areas of agreement.
This approach is not driven by goodwill alone, but by strategic necessity, experts say.
Visne Korkmaz, an international relations professor at Istanbul’s Nisantasi University, tells TRT World that the transformation currently underway in transatlantic security has significantly altered Athens’ calculations.
“The political and strategic cost of adopting an overtly anti-Ankara posture has increased,” she says, pointing to Türkiye’s growing visibility and weight within NATO’s evolving deterrence architecture.
And as the United States recalibrates its approach to European security—seeking greater burden-sharing while remaining anchored to NATO—European allies are expected to enhance their defence contributions.
“In such an environment, Türkiye’s military capabilities gain renewed strategic value,” Korkmaz says.
Europe’s regional realities
According to an international relations academic at Middle East Technical University, Oktay Firat Tanrisever, Greece’s calculations are shaped by a shifting strategic environment.
As a NATO member, Athens would face higher costs within the Alliance framework if tensions with Ankara escalated into any confrontation.
He also notes that Washington values dialogue with Türkiye across multiple regions — from the Middle East to the Eastern Mediterranean — reinforcing the perception in Athens that prolonged polarisation with Ankara would receive limited backing from the current US administration.
“Both the United States and the European Union expect Greece to remain in constructive relations with Türkiye,” Tanrisever tells TRT World.
Within this broader context, Tanrisever argues that Greece’s push for cooperation with Türkiye is driven largely by strategic necessity.
At a time when Europe is reassessing its security architecture, Türkiye’s role in European security has become increasingly important.
Countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Spain have expressed interest in strengthening ties with Ankara.
“Greece does not currently possess wide latitude to draw European states into an overt anti-Türkiye polarisation,” Korkmaz says.
Moreover, the geopolitical landscape of the Eastern Mediterranean remains fluid.
Regional alignments—whether involving the European states, or North African actors—are constantly evolving.
In such an environment, for Greece, sustaining rigid polarisation risks diplomatic isolation rather than strategic advantage, experts say.
Domestic Strategic Pragmatism
Beyond international pressures, domestic realities also shape Athens’ approach.
Greece’s economy still needs stability, and increased tensions with Türkiye could lead to real economic consequences, analysts say.
The tourism industry, in particular, benefits from peaceful bilateral relations.
“The Prime Minister’s visit and the agreements signed show that both countries wish to maintain a reasonable basis for cooperation,” Tanrisever says.
In his assessment, avoiding escalation is necessary for Greece’s own national interests.
Korkmaz notes that while Greece has historically followed what she calls a “mini-state strategy”—internationalising disputes with Türkiye and using third-party deterrence—it is now combining this approach with hedging.
“There are no significant gains in triggering an arms race or provoking Ankara,” she emphasises.
“If Greece wants to ensure that Türkiye remains in a position of strategic self-restraint, cooperation and confidence-building must be foregrounded.”
Taken together, the Ankara meeting suggests that Athens recognises the limits of confrontation in a rapidly evolving security order.
Strengthening ties with Türkiye is not just a diplomatic preference—it's a strategic decision shaped by transatlantic expectations, European realignments, and domestic economic realities.
The transatlantic security shift, Europe’s pursuit of a new strategic balance, and Greece’s economic sensitivities have reduced the scope for escalation while increasing the incentives for careful cooperation.
For Greece, the positive agenda emerging from Ankara is less a tactical pause and more a strategic necessity shaped by the realities of a changing regional and global order.

Use of NSR impossible without cooperation with Moscow — Russian envoy to Seoul

SEOUL, February 13. /TASS/. The use of the Northern Sea Route (NSR) is impossible without cooperation with Russia, and Moscow is ready for such interaction with Seoul, Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgy Zinovyev said.
"The Russian side is ready to engage with the Korean side on the issue. Cooperation is entirely possible under the current circumstances if there is a desire to do so," he said at a meeting with reporters. Meanwhile the diplomat indicated that he would not judge the extent to which the existing sanctions regime limits opportunities for cooperation in the Arctic, calling this issue an internal matter for the Republic of Korea itself.
At the same time, he noted growing interest in the Northern Sea Route from other countries, such as China and India. "There is no other route from Korea to Europe in the high latitudes. It cannot go through Alaska and Canada as there is no shipping there. In the Arctic Ocean, shipping is only possible along Russia's economic zone and territorial waters," Zinovyev noted. The ambassador reiterated that cooperation with Russia is essential to exploiting the short route from Asia to Europe via the Arctic Ocean. "Anyone who looks at a map will understand perfectly well that cooperation with Russia is necessary," he said.

Get over 25 free spins on registration no deposit UK casinos
- Bookmark
No deposit offers with 25 free spins were once common on casino sites, but they’ve largely disappeared in recent years, with only a handful of UK casinos currently offering free spins on registration with no deposit.
Nevertheless, some online casinos do run no-deposit and no-wagering free spins as well as the chance to land further spins when depositing for the first time.
Such offers are popular with both gambling novices and experienced punters alike as they often provide plenty of value.
As such, we have put together a guide on UK casinos offering more than 25 free spins, with no deposit required on any of the recommended casino offers in this article, and no wagering on the free spins either.
Best UK casinos offering over 25 free spins on registration no deposit
Below, you’ll find concise reviews of the best online casinos offering over 25 no deposit free spins, with additional detail on each casino and their respective offers.
1. Paddy Power Games: 60 free spins on registration, no wagering
The Paddy Power no deposit free spins offer is part of the overall Paddy Power Games bonus on offer to new customers, which provides users with 60 totally free spins for use across standard slots and Mansion Heist.
In addition, there are an extra 100 spins available after making a £10 deposit, while there is no wagering on winnings, meaning they can be instantly withdrawn as cash.
This is the highest number of no-deposit spins available across UK casinos.
2. Sky Vegas: 50 no deposit free spins, no wagering
The Sky Vegas welcome offer is another sign up promo that provides no-deposit spins, with new users landing 50 free spins on registration. No deposit is needed, and spins have no wagering, with each spin valued at 10p.
Spins are auto-credited to the first eligible game that a user loads, and customers can claim an optional extra 200 spins after making a £10 stake later on.
3. Betfair Casino: 50 free spins no deposit + optional 100 Spins
The Betfair Casino bonus offers 50 free spins on registration for use on Jackpot King slots, with no wagering requirements on any cash winnings.

Compare over 25 free spins on registration no deposit 2026 offers
This section offers a brief look at the relevant casino sign up bonus offers with no deposit free spins, so users can get a quick comparison of the offers detailed above.
Other free spins on registration no deposit UK offers
Some new online casinos provide fewer than 25 no deposit spins on registration, and while these offers are less valuable than some provided by competitors, they can still be useful for casual or first-time players.
As mentioned above, NetBet Casino is a prime example, so we have provided a summary of their popular offer below.
NetBet – 11 free spins no deposit
New NetBet users can pick up 11 free spins when they register using the code KINGKONG. The no deposit free spins are worth 10p each and are only playable on King Kong Cash.
Players can earn a maximum of £10 cash in winnings, and winnings are paid in cash with no wagering requirements.
While the NetBet casino offer has a lower value compared to top offers from Sky Vegas, Paddy Power and Betfair, it is great for players wanting a small, low risk sample to test slot games without having to risk their own cash.
Meanwhile, sports bettors may also be interested in NetBet’s betting product, where they’ll find a very accomplished bet builder tool.
How to choose a 25+ free spins no deposit casino
When evaluating the best 25 free spins on registration no deposit offers, punters should remember to consider the following factors before choosing an offer or casino:
- UKGC licensing: Remember to make sure the casino is fully licensed by the UK Gambling Commission. All our recommended sites meet this standard, but double-checking protects both your funds and personal data.
- No wagering vs wagering spins: Review wagering rules before opting in to offers. The best no-deposit bonuses have no wagering requirements, or very low ones, making winnings easy to withdraw.
- Maximum win limits: Check the maximum payout to understand the real value of the bonus.
- Game restrictions: Free spins are usually tied to specific slots, though some offers include half a dozen or more eligible slots. Make sure to check the eligible games to evaluate if the offer suits your tastes.
- Bonus expiry windows: Most no deposit bonuses expire within seven days, but this varies. Ensure you’re comfortable with the time limit before you claim.
Responsible gambling
It’s important to gamble responsibly at all times. Our recommended 25 free spins on registration no deposit 2025 casinos promote safe play and offer deposit limits, session reminders and self-exclusion tools.
Free spins can be fun, but remember to treat them as a form of entertainment, never a way to make money.
When using a 25 free spins on registration no deposit 2026 promo or any other free spins offer, be aware that gambling can be addictive, so please take steps to remain in control of your time and budget.
The same applies whether you’re using casino sites, betting sites, betting apps, slot sites or any other gambling medium.
It’s particularly important not to get carried away by any free bet offers or casino offers you might receive, both of which are available in abundance on gambling apps, but must be approached with caution.
You can stay in control by making use of the responsible gambling tools offered, such as deposit limits, loss limits, self-exclusion and time-outs.

FAQs
What are free spins in casinos?
Free spins are bonus plays typically offered for slot games on online casinos. They can be unlocked when you sign up and make a first deposit as a new customer to a casino site, or as ongoing promotions for existing customers. Some casinos offer free spins when you sign up even without depositing.
Which UK casinos currently offer no deposit free spins?
A small number of UKGC-licensed casinos still offer no deposit free spins. Paddy Power Games (60 spins), Sky Vegas (50 spins), Betfair Casino (50 spins) and Netbet (11) all provide free spins on registration with no deposit and no wagering on winnings.
Do free spins in the UK always have wagering requirements?
Some do, but the best UK no deposit free spins come with no wagering requirements, meaning any winnings can be withdrawn as cash. Always check the terms, as lower-value offers may include win caps or game restrictions.
Why are no deposit free spins hard to find on UK casino sites?
UK Gambling Commission regulations have made no deposit casino bonuses less common, as operators must ensure promotions protect players from developing addiction. As a result, many casinos now offer fewer free spins, tighter limits, or focus on no-wagering bonuses tied to a small deposit instead.

Climber dies and two in hospital after incident on Welsh coast
Police confirmed that one person was pronounced dead at the scene at St Govan’s Head

A climber has tragically died following an incident involving three individuals on the rugged Welsh coast.
Dyfed-Powys Police confirmed that one person was pronounced dead at the scene at St Govan’s Head in Pembrokeshire on Thursday afternoon. Two other climbers involved in the incident were taken to hospital with injuries.
Authorities stated the death is not being treated as suspicious, and the individual’s next of kin have been informed.
A police spokesperson added: "Dyfed-Powys Police were contacted by the ambulance service around 4.25pm, Thursday February 12, reporting concerns for the welfare of three individuals at St Govan’s Head, Pembrokeshire."
“Officers were deployed to the location alongside multiple other agencies.
“Two were taken to hospital for treatment for injuries not believed to be life threatening. Sadly, one person was pronounced dead at the scene.”
A spokesman for HM Coastguard said the alarm was first raised at about 4pm on Thursday.
Teams from Fishguard, St Govan’s and Tenby were sent, alongside an HM Coastguard helicopter, an Irish Coastguard helicopter, Wales Air Ambulance and an RNLI lifeboat from Angle.
Last year, a social media influencer with more than 10,000 followers died plunging 65ft when she lost her grip climbing a rocky mountain face in Snowdonia, North Wales.
An inquest heard that adventure-loving engineer Maria Eftimova, 28, was tackling the notorious Tryfan mountain when the accident happened.
Maria was climbing with friends and trying to get a handhold when she tumbled - and went into "freefall" down the mountain.

Israeli artillery, gunfire target several towns in southern Lebanon despite ceasefire
Lebanese state media report shelling on Yaron, Aita al-Shaab, Beit Lif and surrounding areas
BEIRUT
Israeli forces carried out artillery shelling and opened fire on multiple towns in southern Lebanon on Friday, in the latest violation of a ceasefire deal in place since November 2024, Lebanese media reported.
The state-run National News Agency said five Israeli artillery shells struck the Wadi Mazlam area, while heavy machine-gun fire targeted the outskirts of the border town of Yaron.
An Israeli drone also dropped two sound bombs near the town of Aita al-Shaab in the Bint Jbeil district, NNA said.
Additional shelling with heavy-caliber artillery was reported on the outskirts of Beit Lif, while the towns of Aitaroun and Blida were also subjected to bursts of gunfire.
No injuries were reported.
The attacks came amid repeated Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement, killing and wounding hundreds of Lebanese. Israel continues to occupy five Lebanese hilltops seized during the latest war, in addition to other Lebanese areas it has held for decades.
Israel began military operations against Lebanon in October 2023 and escalated them into a full-scale war in September 2024, killing more than 4,000 people and wounding about 17,000 others.

Pentagon Brings ChatGPT into Its Official AI Tool Set
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
16:09:45 UTC
01:09:45 KST

The Pentagon’s adoption of generative artificial intelligence tools—including the recent addition of the world’s most popular model, ChatGPT—holds promise for more efficient work for Department of Defense personnel but also poses risks unless users remain vigilant, experts told Air & Space Forces Magazine.
The department announced Feb. 9 it was adding OpenAI’s ChatGPT to its GenAI.mil platform, which uses machine learning on large data sets to function as a chatbot and produce text, images, or software code based on unclassified information.
GenAI.mil launched in December, using Google’s Gemini for Government GPT and later adding xAI’s government suite, based on its Grok model. Already, the platform has surpassed one million unique users.
The addition of ChatGPT may fuel further interest and growth. OpenAI is largely credited with launching a boom in generative AI, and ChatGPT remains the most popular version of the technology. According to a January study of web traffic, ChatGPT accounted for nearly 65 percent of generative AI chatbot site visits among the general public, triple that of Google’s Gemini.
Gregory Touhill, a retired Air Force brigadier general who now serves as the director of cybersecurity at Carnegie Mellon’s Software Engineering Institute, told Air & Space Forces Magazine that expanded access to AI is important because Airmen and Guardians need it to be competitive.
“I think it’s important for our Airmen today, we want our Airmen to be well prepared for the future, and the future is racing toward us now,” Touhill said. “AI is a tool that our Airmen and our Guardians can use to obtain decisive capabilities in the cyber domain.”
Touhill and SEI are currently working with the Pentagon and other agencies to develop risk management processes for using AI in government settings, he said.
Touhill added that he’s confident AI can help service members automate and eliminate tasks to do more faster. But more importantly, AI can potentially free Airmen and Guardians from lesser tasks so they can apply more time to higher-order work.
Caleb Withers, a research assistant in the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, foresees AI benefiting prototyping, wargaming, research, and bureaucratic paper-pushing. “With wide adoption, I imagine these tools will quickly become some of the most used,” Withers said.
But Touhill and Withers cautioned that AI also poses real risks as its use grows. “The security challenge is the fusion of hardware, software, and wetware,” Touhill said, the last term referring to the humans using AI. “We don’t want our Airmen and Guardians disclosing information into a system not designed to process that information. Once it’s in, it’s part of the system; it’s not like you can back away and wipe it clean.”
Using official defense applications and not open commercial solutions is one step to protecting information loss. Good training, common sense, and protocols will also help, Withers said, as does a skeptical approach to AI use.
“These systems are not yet fully reliable, and in some cases can be quite unreliable or fail,” Withers said. “There’s a risk of overconfidence in them.”
In June 2024, the Air Force Research Laboratory rolled out its own generative AI for the Air Force, called NIPRGPT. NIPR stands for Non-secure Internet Protocol Router network, or the unclassified Internet for the military. Adoption was swift: 80,000 users in NIPRGPT’s first three months and 700,000 users before the pathfinder program was shut down in December to make way for GenAI.mil.
The Army had also developed its own generative AI tool, known as CamoGPT. The two services briefly clashed last April when the Army blocked NIPRGPT from its networks, citing cybersecurity and data concerns. Chief Technology Officer Gabriel Chiulli of the Army’s Enterprise Cloud Management Agency told Air & Space Forces Magazine at the time that blocking NIPRGPT was part of a wider move by the Army to shift from experimentation with AI tools to full implementation.
“The block was focused on getting us to a governance framework for AI used in a production state,” he said. “We were trying to make sure we had the guardrails in place for how we’re doing AI for real.”
Now the Pentagon-wide GenAI.mil platform is the only approved AI platform, enabling the military to absorb the latest models, tailored for government use at a uniform location.
Touhill called NIPRGPT a “bold initiative,” an early effort to get a specific large language model in the hands of Airmen and Guardians. “It’s like training on a simulator that actually has some live data,” Touhill said. “It was a good first step in getting Airmen and Guardians comfortable using AI.”
GenAI.mil is likely to expand to include other AI tools, Withers predicts, just as it has recently added ChatGPT. Different generative AIs excel at different tasks, he said, and no one single solution will enable DOD to maximize AI’s potential to tackle different problems.

Water leak strikes Louvre gallery where most valuable artworks are housed
This marks the second such incident in under three months for the Louvre, which has faced a series of recent challenges

A water leak struck the Louvre Museum's Denon gallery on Thursday evening, affecting an area displaying valuable paintings but sparing Leonardo Da Vinci's iconic Mona Lisa.
A spokesperson for the Paris institution confirmed the leak had been contained by early Friday morning, with the gallery expected to reopen shortly.
The incident occurred in room 707, home to works by 19th-century French artist Charles Meynier and 16th-century Italian Bernardino Luini. The leak caused damage to a ceiling painted by Meynier.
This marks the second such incident in under three months for the Louvre, which has faced a series of recent challenges.
Earlier on Thursday, prosecutors in Paris announced that nine people were detained in connection with a suspected decade-long ticket fraud scheme at the Louvre.
The alleged operation is believed to have defrauded the institution of more than €10m (£8.7m) over the past decade.
The arrests took place on Tuesday.
They are part of a judicial investigation that commenced after the Louvre lodged a formal complaint in December 2024.
Two museum employees, a number of tour guides and an individual suspected of being the mastermind behind the extensive fraud were among those taken into custody, the prosecutors' office.
The museum alerted investigators about the frequent presence of two Chinese tour guides suspected of bringing groups of Chinese tourists into the museum by fraudulently reusing the same tickets multiple times for different visitors.
Other guides were later suspected of similar practices.
It follows the high-profile heist of the museum on October, when a gang of thieves stole several items of jewellery from the venue.
The robbery gang's haul of loot was worth an estimated 88 million euros ($102 million) — a monetary value that didn't include their huge historical value to France.
The thieves took less than eight minutes to force their way into the museum and leave, using a freight lift to reach the building's window. Footage from museum cameras showed that the two who broke into the ornate Apollo Gallery used grinders to cut into jewellery display cases.
Employees at the Louvre also went on strike in December, with the heist highlighting long-standing concerns that crowding and thin staffing were undermining security and working conditions at a museum that welcomes millions of visitors each year.

Still thinking about Heated Rivalry? Here’s where to listen and read the sequel

Still thinking about Heated Rivalry? Here’s where to listen and read the sequel
There are currently six books in Rachel Reid’s Game Changer series
- Bookmark
Heated Rivalry is undoubtedly the most talked-about TV show of the year so far. Based on Rachel Reid’s book series, Game Changers, the TV adaptation follows the decade-long, slow-burning relationship between two NHL hockey players.
Its blend of sports drama and gay romance is an unlikely contender for 2026’s biggest show – but it’s a formula that’s drawn in millions of viewers around the world and made its two lead actors, Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams, overnight stars.
Spanning six episodes, the series follows Shane (played by Williams) and Ilya (Storrie) as they clash on the ice as rivals in opposing teams. Off the rink, the tension shifts: beneath the pressure of fame and the expectations of family, their emotional and physical bond deepens each hockey season.
The show is irresistibly charming, refreshing familiar romance tropes – enemies-to-lovers, secret affairs, opposites-attract – with surprising tenderness. But much of Heated Rivalry’s success lies in throwing away certain archetypes – there’s no toxic masculinity or misogyny, and the LGBT+ community has praised its representation of queer love.
Women have become particularly obsessed with the show, drawn to its vulnerability, yearning and emotional intimacy – all geared to the female gaze. In part thanks to Emerald Fennell’s “bodice-ripping” Wuthering Heights adaptation, “yearning” is the internet’s current buzzword – and it perfectly captures Heated Rivalry’s intensity.
No doubt you binged all six episodes of Heated Rivalry in record time – and if you can’t stop thinking about Ilya and Shane, the good news is that showrunner Jacob Tierney has already confirmed season two. The bad news is that we might not get it until 2027. “I don’t want to put out a rushed, shitty second season just because the show is very popular,” he told Variety.
While the first series was based on book two of Reid’s Game Changer series, the second series will likely follow the events of book six, The Long Game. There are four other titles in the series (Game Changer, Tough Guy, Common Goal and Role Model), which all focus on the romantic lives of different characters from the hockey league Here’s how to read the Game Changers series in order – plus, everything you need to know about the seventh book, Unrivalled (out in September).
How to read or listen to the ‘Game Changer’ books in order
'Game Changer' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina press
The first book in the series of the same name, Game Changer follows Scott Hunter – who you’ll be familiar with from episode three of Heated Rivalry (and that very public confession of love in episode five). The captain of the New York Admirals hockey team, Hunter, is openly gay, but has always been guarded about his private life. After a chance meeting with Kip Grady, a cheerful and charming smoothie shop worker, all that begins to change.
Heated Rivalry by Rachel Reid, publishing Carina Press
The book that inspired the global obsession, Heated Rivalry is the second title in Reid’s series. It follows Canadian golden boy hockey player Shane Hollander, and rival star Ilya Rozanov, as they battle on ice while hiding a long-running relationship. Navigating the complications of fame, secrecy and the demands of their sports careers, the enemies-to-lovers storyline has surprising emotional depth.
'Tough Guy' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
Tough Guy introduces us to yet more characters, with the attention turning to Ryan Price. A steely hockey player who secretly grapples with anxiety and vulnerability, he meets Fabian Smith, a musician who teaches Ryan to open up and trust others.
'Common Goal' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
Book four in the Game Changer series, Common Goal shines the spotlight on Eric Bennett. An experienced hockey goalie, he becomes entangled in a relationship with a bartender with a lot of emotional baggage, Kyle Swift.
'Role Model' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
The fifth book in the series follows Troy Barnett, a closeted and former bully in the league who wants to redeem himself. Helping him on his path to redemption is Harris Drover, his team’s charismatic and openly gay PR, who helps Barnett on his journey to self-acceptance.
'The Long Game' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina press
A direct sequel to Heated Rivalry, The Long Game is the source material behind season two of the TV show. If you can’t wait until then, the book picks up where series one left off. Shane and Ilya are a decade into their secret relationship and grappling with the idea of going public – but what will this mean for their celebrity careers, family and status in the hockey world?
'Unrivalled' by Rachel Reid, published by Carina Press
In mid-January of this year, Reid teased a seventh book in the Game Changers series, delighting fans by announcing that it will continue Shane and Ilya’s story. Spoilers ahead: now married and out, the couple face new challenges and acceptance within the sport isn’t a given. Released on 29 September 2026, you can pre-order it now.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The world has entered a new era marked by open conflicts and wars, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz declared at the Munich Security Conference, according to a TASS correspondent.
"We have entered a new phase of open wars and conflicts that keep us on edge and are transforming our world more profoundly than we have anticipated for many years," he stated.
Merz emphasized the disintegration of the rules-based international order. "We must be even clearer: this order, despite its imperfections even at its peak, no longer exists," he asserted.

Waymo is paying DoorDash drivers to close robotaxi doors left open by customers
Waymo has also partnered with a towing company to haul away vehicles that have lost power while on the roads
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Waymo has started paying DoorDash drivers to close the doors of its driverless robotaxis, as passengers leave them ajar and can hold up traffic.
The automated cars cannot drive if any of their doors remain open, forcing the company to draft in human assistance to prevent roads from getting clogged up with immobile cabs.
A DoorDash driver took to Reddit to claim Waymo had offered them up to $11 simply for closing the door of a nearby vehicle.
The post, which was upvoted 522 times, showed that the driver had been offered a “guaranteed” $6.25 for the job with an additional $5 up for grabs if they sent proof that the job had been completed.
“You actually DoorDashed,” one user quipped in the comments section.
Waymo and DoorDash confirmed the bizarre situation is part of a pilot scheme in a joint statement given to CNBC, in which they said that they were always looking for new ways for drivers to earn more money.
However, they acknowledged that Waymo vehicles could soon have new technology installed which would automatically close their car doors.
DoorDash is not the only company that Waymo has drafted in to get stranded taxis moving again.
In parts of California, the robotaxi brand has partnered with Honk, a service that functions similarly to Uber but is aimed at towing companies. Through the partnership, workers can earn up to $20 for closing Waymo taxi doors.
Cesar Marenco, owner of Milagro Towing in Inglewood, told The Washington Post that he is now a regular Waymo door-closer.
He told the newspaper that he completes around three jobs a week for Waymo via the Honk app, either towing vehicles that failed to make it to a charging station or closing doors.
But power outages still present a problem for Waymo, with a December 2025 outage in San Francisco leaving several vehicles stranded across the city.
The robotaxis approach non-functional traffic signals as though they were a four-way stop, just as a regular driver would do, but the lack of human intuition means that they struggle to navigate them in larger, citywide power outages.
Following the San Francisco outage, a Waymo spokesperson told The Washington Post that the “sheer scale of the outage led to instances where vehicles remained stationary longer than usual to confirm the state of the affected intersections.”
The firm also confirmed in a blog post that there was a spike in requests for human workers, as difficult intersections may necessitate that a vehicle checks in with officials to “ensure it makes the safest choice.”
But Waymo reportedly has plans to expand its operations, with The Post reporting the company will launch rides in Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando throughout 2026.

American 'Quad God' Ilia Malinin carries 5-point lead into the free skate at Milan Cortina Olympics
Ilia Malinin enters the Olympic men’s free skate as the clear favorite, and he holds a strong lead after the short program
- Bookmark
Ilia Malinin, widely considered the best figure skater of this generation, could take a big step toward going down as one of the greatest ever Friday night down when the American goes for the gold medal in the men's free skate at the Milan Cortina Olympics.
The 21-year-old known as the “Quad God” has a five-point lead over Japan's Yuma Kagiyama and France's Adam Siao Him Fa after the short program. That would be a big margin for anyone, but it could be insurmountable given who is in first place.
Malinin is undefeated over two-plus years, a stretch of 14 consecutive victories in full competitions. That includes the past four U.S. championships, the last two world titles, and a host of world records — most crucially, the best mark ever for a free skate, a massive score of 238.24 points that pushed him to a 30-point victory at the Grand Prix Final in December.
Yagiyama, the last man to beat Malinin, was second that day. Siao Him Fa finished in fifth.
“Being the favorite is one thing,” Malinin said after his short program, “but actually getting it done and doing it under pressure and having the skate of your life to earn that medal is another thing. I don't want to get too ahead of myself and say that it's guaranteed that I'm getting that gold medal. Because, of course, I still have to put in the work.”
In truth, he doesn't have to do much more than show up.
That's because the longer nature of the free skate plays even more to his advantage, since it contains seven jumping passes instead of the three in the short program. He has a record-tying seven quadruple jumps scheduled for his program; by comparison, Kagiyama and Siao Him Fa have four in each other free skates.
“It's not so much the point total, it's the difference between the placements,” said Scott Hamilton, the 1984 Olympic champion. “Say it's football. You win by seven points, that's a touchdown; that's good. If you win by 10 points, that's a two-possession victory. You kind of dominated, right? He is winning competitions by 50 points or more. That's like, seven touchdowns.”
The real drama might not be whether Malinin wins but whether he lands the first quad axel in the Olympics.
The sons of Olympic skaters Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov, the ever-confident Malinin is the only person ever to land the jump in competition. The reason it is so difficult is that the axel begins facing forward, whereas the other five main jumps in figure skating start facing backward, and that adds another half revolution to the quad axel.
“I’m hoping that I’ll feel good enough to do it,” Malinin acknowledged. “But of course I always prioritize health and safety. So I really want to put myself in the right mindset where I’ll feel really confident to go into it."
Malinin already has one gold medal from the team event, where he finished a surprising second to Kagiyama in the short program but beat fellow Japanese star Shun Sato in the free skate. That head-to-head win allowed the Americans to defend their team title.
Afterward, Malinin admitted that the pressure of the Olympics had gotten to him in his debut. But those nerves settled during his free skate, and by the time of his individual short program Tuesday night, his fearlessness and spunk was back again.
“Now I feel like I've taken over that fight that I had in the team event,” Malinin said, “so now I can really just focus solely on that free program, and let everything happen naturally.”

Gary Numan’s wife Gemma has been left partially paralyzed after undergoing spinal surgery, just months after the singer revealed his brother had died suddenly following a heart attack.
Gemma, 57, told fans in a post on Instagram that her left arm is now paralyzed following a multi-level discectomy, which is a procedure to remove damaged or herniated discs.
“No one can ever understand how s**t it is and not glamorous,” she added.
Gary and Gemma married in 1997 and have three daughters: Persia, Raven and Echo.
The couple live in Los Angeles but Gemma had her surgery in the UK, and said she has been unable to travel back to the States since September last year.
“Gutted!” she wrote. “I miss my animals so much, it makes me feel sick! Gary has looked after me here in the UK the whole time.”
The mum-of-three also thanked her loved ones for their help, writing: “It couldn’t have happened without you!”
Gemma added that the operation was her third since August last year, telling her Instagram followers that she still has another to come.
It comes after 67-year-old Gary announced the sudden death of his younger brother, John, in November. Fans had been concerned for Numan after he broke down in tears midway through a Birmingham performance of his song “Please Push No More”, telling the audience that he had received “the worst news ever”.
In an emotional post on social media, Gary later told fans his brother died just moments after he said goodbye to him following a show in Leeds.
“He had spent the evening with me at my Telekon show, catching up, swapping stories, telling me about his newly found love of reading,” he wrote.
“I hugged him at the door of our tour bus, I think it was about 12:20am, asked him how far he had to walk to get to his car (I always worried about him walking the streets at night), it was not far apparently, we said goodbye and I watched him walk away.
“Sadly he never made it to his car, betrayed by his own heart. It will haunt me forever that we may have driven off not knowing that he was lying in a rainy street just yards away. Luckily a kind person saw him and called an ambulance, but it was too late.”

Malawi vaccinates a new generation of children against polio, which still hasn't been eradicated
The southern African nation of Malawi has launched a new polio vaccination campaign this week in another reminder that the world still hasn’t managed to eradicate the disease despite a concerted effort for more than 35 years
- Bookmark
In a classroom in southern Malawi, children sit in rows on the floor as a health worker moves among them administering an oral vaccine that protects against polio.
The new vaccination campaign that began on Wednesday is another reminder that the world still hasn’t managed to eradicate the ancient disease, which primarily affects children and can cause paralysis. despite a concerted effort for more than 35 years by the World Health Organization and its partners.
Health officials believe they came close several times, including five years ago, when just five cases of the natural polio virus were reported globally.
But a WHO report said that there were 38 cases of the natural polio virus between January and October 2025 — all in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last two countries where it remains endemic — and another 151 cases of a vaccine-derived polio virus strain in 13 countries.
Those vaccine-derived cases have overtaken natural polio virus cases in recent years, and complicated the eradication effort as one of a number of missteps in the global fight. They come about when the weakened live virus in oral polio vaccines mutates into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks.
That’s the problem in Malawi, which reported last month that it had discovered the vaccine-derived Type 2 polio virus strain in sewage water in the southern city of Blantyre, prompting health authorities to launch a new immunization campaign using a modified vaccine.
By WHO regulations, Malawi was required to declare an outbreak on confirming the polio virus traces.
Malawi’s deputy health minister, Charles Chilambula, was among the officials promoting the vaccination drive. It involves 1.7 million doses being administered to children at schools and taken door-to-door through some of the city’s neighborhoods by health workers.
In an attempt to reassure people, Chilambula said that the doses will protect against the vaccine-derived form that’s been discovered in Blantyre in environmental samples. Malawi’s Health Ministry said that it's using the novel oral polio vaccine that’s designed to stop circulating vaccine-derived Type 2 outbreaks.
“It’s very important that we do the vaccine now, because it also deals with this virus which we have detected,” Chilambula said.
Polio is a highly contagious incurable disease that affects the nervous system, and both the wild virus and the vaccine-derived strain can cause irreversible paralysis. It's spread through contaminated food or water. Around one in 200 cases results in paralysis, WHO says, typically affecting the legs.
In the early 20th century, polio struck fear in communities across the world and paralyzed hundreds of thousands of children annually before the advent of vaccines in the 1950s.
Despite statistics now showing more children contracting polio viruses originating in vaccines than in the wild, global health authorities claim a bigger victory against polio. Wild polio virus cases have decreased by more than 99% since 1988, according to WHO, and from 125 endemic countries to two, largely because of vaccines.
But the end goal — the eradication of polio like smallpox — has been elusive.
Malawi became a country of concern for polio again in 2022 when a child contracted the wild polio virus, the first case in the southern African nation for 30 years. Last month’s announcement of traces of a vaccine-derived strain is another setback.
Dr. Joe Collins Opio, UNICEF's Malawi chief of health, said that the vaccination campaign would first focus on children in eight districts, but would ultimately grow into a national effort across the country of around 22 million people and called on everyone to “be part of the response.”
Malawi, like many poor countries, relies heavily on mobile health workers to reach people in vaccination campaigns.
Health workers, mainly women in matching blue dresses, visited schools and homes in the Blantyre area on foot, carrying vaccines in small cooler boxes. Officials say motorbikes will be used to take doses further afield.
People were also invited to open-air educational events, where officials promoted vaccines in speeches interspersed with popular music as children held up signs urging they be protected from polio.
“Polio remains a threat,” said Dr. Akosua Sika Ayisi, a public health specialist with WHO helping with the vaccination drive. She outlined Malawi’s task of ensuring every eligible child "in every community” is fully vaccinated to contribute to the global eradication of polio.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. Germany and France are looking at creating a European nuclear umbrella, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.
"I have launched the talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on European nuclear deterrence," he said at the Munich Security Conference.
In an address to the nation in March 2025, Macron announced plans to negotiate with the allies the possibility of placing European countries under the protection of France’s nuclear deterrence forces. Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and Denmark have already expressed their readiness to discuss the issue. According to The Financial Times, the United States’ European allies are looking at creating their own nuclear shield in view of Washington’s course toward resuming relations with Russia.

Bulgaria’s former premier says partnership with Türkiye 'extremely important' for establishing peace
Rosen Zhelyazkov calls 'two-speed' EU initiative 'very particular issue' that would not bother European integrity
MUNICH
Bulgaria's former Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov said cooperation with Türkiye carries strategic importance for the region.
"Nowadays, the world is eager for peace. For us, the partnership with Türkiye is extremely important ... of establishing peace,” he told Anadolu.
He noted that both countries are engaged in diplomatic initiatives tied to the Middle East.
“So I think that with Türkiye, we are a very good example of how the partnership between neighboring countries can facilitate and promote the peace process in the world,” he added.
'Two-speed' EU not a threat to European integrity
Addressing discussions around a "two-speed" Europe, he said the initiative has largely been misunderstood and relates mainly to capital market integration rather than political divisions within the bloc.
European leaders proposed a "two-speed union" as the quickest way to overcome the political deadlock blocking key economic reforms aimed at reviving the European economy.
"This initiative, I think that, is not very well understood," he said, explaining that countries ready to participate in simplifying and enlarging capital markets could move ahead, while others could join later.
He stressed that participation depends on readiness, not differences between member states, adding that the approach "is a very particular issue that would not bother the European integrity and the European Union at home."
Turning to the Middle East, Zhelyazkov said Bulgaria maintains relations with both Israel and Palestine and believes balanced engagement can help ease tensions.
"Both states are very important to ... mitigate all hostile narratives that exist because we need to establish peace and to promote the peace," he said.

PARIS, February 13. /TASS/. The Louvre is facing crises on a daily basis, leader of the French political party Les Patriotes, said.
"There's now a catastrophe every day at the Louvre! Thefts, smuggling, leaks, etc., it never stops! Meanwhile, the museum management is building a luxurious private dining room," the politician wrote on X.
Philippot also called it a "shame" for France that Laurence des Cars is still the museum director.
On February 12, Le Parisien reported that a fraudulent ticket-selling network had been dismantled at the Louvre. This incident adds to the list of problems the main Paris museum has faced recently. On October 19, 2025, the Louvre was robbed of royal jewels. In November, the museum had to close one of its galleries due to a water leak, and since mid-December, museum staff have been striking to demand improved working conditions.
According to BFMTV, French Culture Minister Rachida Dati, before leaving her post to run for mayor of Paris, could dismiss Louvre director Laurence des Cars amid the museum’s troubles.

SpaceX sends crew to International Space Station on 8-month science mission
Falcon 9 carries 2 NASA astronauts, one French astronaut and one Russian cosmonaut
ISTANBUL
A SpaceX rocket launched on Friday headed to the International Space Station for an eight-month science mission, NASA reported in a statement.
According to the statement, the Falcon 9, launched from Space Launch Complex 40 in Florida, US, carries NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot, and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.
“The research this crew will conduct aboard the space station advances critical technologies for deep space exploration while delivering real benefits here on Earth,” said NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman.
During the mission, Crew-12 will conduct a variety of science experiments aimed at advancing research and technology for missions to the Moon and Mars, said the statement.
Crew members will study pneumonia-causing bacteria to improve cardiovascular treatments, on-demand intravenous fluid generation for future space missions, and research on how physical characteristics may affect blood flow during spaceflight, according to NASA.
Other experiments include automated plant health monitoring and investigations of plant and nitrogen-fixing microbe interactions to enhance food production in space, according to the statement.
A SpaceX Dragon carrying Crew-11 scientists from NASA, Roscosmos, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency returned to Earth on Jan. 15 from the station.
NASA said that the crew's premature return followed monitoring of a medical concern involving one member, without giving additional details.

Logistics giant DP World replaces chairman named in Jeffrey Epstein documents
Dubai has replaced the longtime head of DP World after emails linked him to Jeffrey Epstein
- Bookmark
Dubai has announced a new chairman for DP World, one of the world’s largest logistics companies, replacing the outgoing head who was named in the Jeffrey Epstein documents.
The announcement by the government’s Dubai Media Office did not specifically name Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. However, it said that Essa Kazim was named DP World’s chairman and Yuvraj Narayan was named group CEO. Those were positions held by bin Sulayem.
DP World is a logistics giant that runs the Jebel Ali port in Dubai and operates terminals in other ports around the world. It has long been a pillar of the economy of the Middle Eastern city.
The announcement comes a day after financial groups in Canada and the United Kingdom said they’ve paused future ventures with DP World after newly released emails showed a yearslong friendship between bin Sulayem and Epstein.
The emails — some referencing porn, sexual massages and escorts — surfaced in the cache of Epstein-related documents recently released by the U.S. Department of Justice.
Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019 after he was charged with sex trafficking. The emails do not appear to implicate bin Sulayem in Epstein’s alleged crimes. DP World did not respond to request for comment.
Bin Sulayem previously had a larger role as chairman of the Dubai World conglomerate, which at the time included the property developer Nakheel. That company was behind the creation of human-made islands in the shape of palm trees and a map of the world that helped cement Dubai’s status as an up-and-coming global city.
The state-run WAM news agency also reported that Dubai’s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, named a new head of the city-state’s Ports Customs and Free Zone Corporation. That also was a position held by bin Sulayem.
The topics in the emails between Epstein and bin Sulayem range widely, including President Donald Trump, sex and theology. Some emails — like others in the Epstein files — contain typographical errors.
In one email from 2013, Epstein wrote to bin Sulayem that “you are one of my most trusted friends in very sense of the word, you have never let me down." In response, bin Sulayem said: “Thank you my friend I am off the sample a fresh 100% female Russian at my yacht.”
That same year, bin Sulayem sent Epstein an email showing a menu for a massage business which included sexual offerings. Two years later, bin Sulayem texted Epstein a link to a porn site, and, in 2017, Epstein sent bin Sulayem a link to an escort website.
Epstein e-mailed with bin Sulayem about Steve Bannon, the Trump acolyte, in 2018, saying “you will like him.” In another exchange, bin Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance.

Men Arrested in Shooting of GRU General Charged With Terrorism

Three men accused of being involved in a plot to assassinate senior military intelligence officer Vladimir Alexeyev earlier this month have been charged with terrorism, a spokeswoman for Russia’s top investigative body said Friday.
“Given the overall nature of the crime and the circumstances, investigators are bringing charges of terrorism against Lyubomir Korba, Viktor Vasin and Pavel Vasin,” Investigative Committee spokeswoman Svetalana Petrenko told reporters.
Earlier, the men were charged with attempted murder and arms trafficking.
Alexeyev, a lieutenant general who serves as first deputy head of Russia’s GRU military intelligence service, was hospitalized after being shot several times at an apartment in Moscow last Friday. He remains in critical condition.
Russia’s FSB security service claims Korba, who was arrested in the United Arab Emirates and extradited to Russia, shot Alexeyev with a Makarov pistol equipped with a silencer. Viktor Vasin, meanwhile, was said to have rented out an apartment to Korba in the building where the general was shot.
Both men confessed to having acted on orders from Ukraine’s SBU security service, the FSB said.
Vasin’s son Pavel was accused of providing his father and Korba with “vehicles that were used for physical surveillance and for retrieving weapons from a hidden cache.”
On Wednesday, a Moscow court ordered the three men to be placed in pre-trial detention for at least two months. They face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty of terrorism.
Russian police also issued an arrest warrant for a woman named Zinaida Serebritskaya, who is a fourth person of interest in the attempted assassination of Alexeyev. She is believed to have fled to Ukraine, law enforcement said.
Spokeswoman Petrenko said Friday that Serebritskaya would be charged with terrorism in absentia.
Ukraine has dismissed allegations that it was involved in last week’s shooting and suggested the incident was the result of “Russian infighting.”
The attempted assassination of Alexeyev is just the latest in a string of attacks inside Russia targeting senior military officials. Since December 2024, three generals have been killed in or near Moscow, with the most recent killing having taken place late last year.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.

Are teenagers too young to scroll? Europe weighs social media bans for minors

Worries that too much time on social media may be hurting children's mental health, and creating addictions as harmful as alcohol or cigarettes, are sparking growing calls across Europe to block minors under the age of 15 or 16 from access to platforms.
After Australia became the first country to block under-16s from platforms in December, a host of EU countries are poised to possibly follow suit.
France, Spain, Portugal and Greece are now weighing similar measures, driven by growing concerns over algorithms and the grip of Big Tech on young minds.
Supporters of tougher rules argue that the risks are no longer theoretical. Studies increasingly link heavy social media use among teenagers to anxiety, depression, addictive behaviour and, in extreme cases, suicide.
Read more‘Addiction is profitable’: Meta, Google stand trial over social media effects on children
Governments insist they are stepping in where platforms have failed to protect children from systems designed to maximise screen time over well-being.
Marc Angel, a Luxembourgish MEP from the Socialists & Democrats group, and a member of the European Parliament's Intergroup on Children's Rights, is among the European lawmakers who backs a ban.
In our Talking Europe debate, Angel argues that the logic is simple: what is illegal offline should be illegal online.
He warns that today's dangers are no longer just in the street, but on the bedroom screens of smartphones and other devices. "When I was a kid, my parents told me not to let strangers into the house," he says. "Now the strangers are in the bedrooms of kids. And sometimes they aren't even real people."
But opponents of a blanket ban, such as Ana Vasconcelos, a Portuguese MEP with Renew Europe, consider it a blunt and ineffective tool. In a pointed retort to Angel, Vasconcelos argues that Europe risks over-correcting, prioritising symbolic action over workable solutions.
Vasconcelos warns that age-verification systems raise serious privacy issues, expose sensitive data to hacking, and are "very easy to circumvent." In her view, bans may create a false sense of safety while failing to address the real problem.
Instead, she argues for targeted measures: privacy-by-design on devices, phone-free spaces in schools, stronger media literacy, together with greater parental responsibility. For Vasconcelos, the challenge is not whether social media poses risks, but how to prepare young people to navigate a digital reality they cannot avoid.

The Turkish president spoke by phone on Friday with the Iraqi prime minister to discuss bilateral ties, as well as regional and global developments, according to Türkiye's Communications Directorate.
During the call with Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Ankara would continue taking steps to strengthen relations with Iraq in multiple fields, particularly trade.
The Turkish president also emphasised that increasing cooperation in the fight against terrorism would benefit both countries.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s April 2024 visit to Iraq marked a turning point in bilateral ties.
During the visit, 27 agreements and memoranda were signed in areas including security, trade, transboundary waters, agriculture, culture, and transport, strengthening the legal foundations of the bilateral partnership.
Significant progress has been achieved in institutionalising cooperation through the joint permanent committees established under the Strategic Framework Agreement for Joint Cooperation, one of the key documents signed during Erdogan’s visit.
In the period that followed, high-level political and technical contacts intensified further.
With Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani’s official visit to Türkiye in May 2025, the sixth meeting of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council was held, and 11 strategic documents were signed.

San Francisco teachers, district reach deal after first strike in decades
San Francisco teachers who have been on strike over wages and family health benefits have reached a tentative agreement with the school district
- Bookmark
San Francisco teachers who have been on strike over wages and family health benefits have reached a tentative agreement with the school district.
The San Francisco Unified School District says schools will reopen to staff Friday and to students Wednesday after two holidays.
The strike by about 6,000 public schoolteachers started Monday, marking the city’s first such walkout in nearly 50 years.
The San Francisco Unified School District had closed all 120 of its schools and said it would offer independent study to some of its 50,000 students.
Teachers joined picket lines after last-ditch negotiations failed to reach a new contract. They were demanding higher wages, more health benefits, and more resources for students with special needs.
The union and the district had been negotiating for nearly a year, with teachers demanding fully funded family health care, salary raises and the filling of vacant positions impacting special education and services.
The union asked for a 9% raise over two years, which would mean an additional $92 million per year for the district. They say that money could come from reserve funds that could be directed back to classrooms and school sites.
SFUSD, which faces a $100 million deficit and is under state oversight because of a long-standing financial crisis, rejected the idea. Officials countered with a 6% wage increase paid over three years. Su said the offer also includes bonuses for all employees if there is a surplus by the 2027-28 school year.
A report by a neutral fact-finding panel released last week recommended a compromise of a 6% increase over two years, largely siding with the district’s arguments that it is financially constrained.
The union said San Francisco teachers receive some of the lowest contributions to their health care costs in the Bay Area, pushing many to leave. Su said the district offered two options: the district paying 75% of family health coverage to the insurance provider Kaiser or offering an annual allowance of $24,000 for teachers to choose their health care plan.

No, Trump hasn't threatened a 250% tariff on Norway over Olympic gold medals

A viral claim that Trump is slapping heavy tariffs on Norwegian salmon because of the amount of Winter Olympic gold medals the country is winning is fabricated.
A post circulating on X claims that US President Donald Trump threatened to impose a 250% tariff on Norwegian salmon after accusing Norway of cheating at the Winter Olympics.
The post, which has amassed more than 1 million views on X, is based on an alleged screenshot taken from Trump's Truth Social account.
It accuses the Norwegian ski team of using a "classified" ski wax to gain a competitive advantage during the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics.
The post claims that these unfair advantages are funded via NATO money, given to Norway by the US. "Make skiing fair again," the post reads.
However, the post is not authentic.
There is no record of Trump publishing this statement on his Truth Social account or any of his other social media accounts. There is also no credible media outlet reporting that Trump is targeting Norwegian salmon with tariff threats.
Credible elements
Whilst the post itself is fake, it draws on real elements of elite skiing to appear credible.
Factors such as ski base structure and waxing can influence performance, especially in races decided by seconds. National teams invest heavily in research, testing and specialist technicians to gain an advantage.
A recent ban on fluorinated ski waxes due to environmental and health concerns has also resulted in teams rushing to develop alternatives. These are often kept confidential to preserve a competitive edge.
Athletes found to be using banned substances, such as fluorinated waxes, can be disqualified regardless of nationality.
There is no evidence that any Norwegian athlete has been disqualified yet for using banned waxes this Olympic season.
Two South Korean cross-country skiers have, however, been disqualified from the women's classic sprint at the 2026 Games, after their equipment tested positive for fluor.
NATO funding claim is fake
There is also no evidence that Norway diverts NATO defence funding into its skiing programme.
In June, Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre committed the country to spending at least 5% of its GDP on defence. This money is allocated to military personnel, weapons and equipment, along with defence and security-related civilian investment, such as crisis response and infrastructure that supports military operations.
Norway's Olympic programme is funded separately through civilian sports policy, not defence or NATO budgets.
A share of funding comes from gaming proceeds generated by state-owned lottery operator Norsk Tipping, with 64% of eligible proceeds allocated to sporting purposes, including a portion dedicated to the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports.

Two men jailed for life over plot to attack Greater Manchester’s Jewish community

Two men have been jailed for life after attempting to stage one of the UK’s deadliest terrorist attacks before it was thwarted by an undercover operative.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, who had sworn allegiance to Islamic State (IS), planned a marauding firearms attack targeting Greater Manchester’s Jewish community.
On Friday, the pair were sentenced at Preston crown court after being found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism between December 2023 and May 2024.
The prime mover in the plot, Tunisian-born Saadaoui, of Abram, Wigan, was ordered to serve a minimum of 37 years.
Hussein, of no fixed address, was ordered to serve at least 26 years.
Saadaoui’s younger brother, Bilel Saadaoui, 37, of Hindley, Wigan, was sentenced to six years in prison for failing to disclose information about the plan.
All three had denied the offences in a trial lasting almost three months last year, in which jurors were told they were Islamist extremists with a “visceral dislike” of Jewish people.
Walid Saadaoui, a former Italian restaurant owner and hotel entertainer, arranged for the purchase and delivery of semi-automatic rifles, conducted reconnaissance and identified targets, but the man supplying them with the weapons was an undercover operative.
The operative, known to them as Farouk, had infiltrated jihadist social media networks and convinced Saadaoui that he was a fellow extremist.
Saadaoui was arrested in a counter-terror strike involving more than 200 officers as he attempted to take possession of two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol and almost 200 rounds of ammunition in the car park of the Last Drop hotel in Bolton on 8 May 2024. The weapons had been deactivated.
The court heard that Saadaoui hero-worshipped the IS terrorist Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who orchestrated the 2015 Paris terror attacks in which 130 people were killed and hundreds more injured in gun attacks.
Saadaoui and Hussein planned to disguise themselves as Jews and attack an antisemitism march in Manchester city centre before heading to suburbs north of Manchester city centre that are home to one of Europe’s largest Jewish communities.
Saadaoui, who used Facebook to disseminate IS propaganda and had been considering a lone knife attack for years, decided to escalate his plans after the outbreak of war in Gaza in October 2023. He recruited Hussein, a Bolton-based Kuwaiti national who is believed to have served in Saddam Hussein’s army, to assist his plans.
Believing Farouk would secure them guns, the pair travelled to Dover, Kent, in March 2024 to conduct surveillance on how a weapon could be smuggled through the port without detection.
On his return, Saadaoui travelled to Prestwich and Higher Broughton, north of Manchester, where he carried out reconnaissance on Jewish nurseries, schools, synagogues and shops. A safe house was also secured in Bolton for the storage of the weapons.
Sentencing, Mr Justice Wall told the defendants that if the plot had succeeded, it would “likely have been one of the deadliest terror attacks ever carried out on British soil”.
He said: “I am sure this would have led to the deaths of many people and serious injuries to many, many more.
“Your plan envisaged you and two others discharging AK-47s into a large crowd of marchers, who were unarmed and defenceless.
“One hundred and twenty bullets could have been discharged before any reloads were required. You planned to have spare magazines available.
“Your attack would have led to the deaths of people of all ages, including children.”
After the verdicts last year, the assistant chief constable of Greater Manchester police Robert Potts said the plot, “given the weaponry and ammunition involved, could potentially have been the deadliest terrorist attack in UK history”.
He added: “There was very real risk and danger for Farouk who undoubtedly saved lives. I cannot overemphasise his courage, bravery and professionalism in the role that he played.”
After the sentencing, the chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Sir Stephen Watson, said Jewish communities in the UK “put up with a way of life that nobody else has to put up with”.
He said Jews “have more justification to be fearful than anybody else”, which he said needed to be addressed. “We have seen the terrorist atrocity in Manchester at a synagogue on Yom Kippur,” Watson said. “We have seen the events on Bondi Beach in Sydney.
“We are seeing the manifestation of hatred moving beyond our shores globally and this is a threat to all of us. It is a threat to our Jewish communities and if our Jewish communities are under threat we are all under threat.”
Keir Starmer welcomed the life jail terms for the two men. Writing on X in response to the sentencing, the prime minister said: “I want to thank law enforcement for bringing these vile cowards to justice and reassure our Jewish community that we will never relent in our fight against antisemitism and terror.”

Sybiha informs Grossi in Munich about new Russian strikes, nuclear threat to Europe
Sybiha reported this on his X account, according to Ukrinform.
"I met with Rafael Grossi to inform [him] about Russia's reckless strikes on Ukraine's energy system that create risks for our nuclear objects and threaten nuclear and radiation safety of the entire Europe," the minister said.
He added that he informed Grossi about Ukraine's peace efforts, the country's position regarding the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, and the need to counter threats caused by Russia.
Sybiha also recalled that Ukraine has proposed amendments to the IAEA Statute to develop effective mechanisms for limiting the rights and privileges of a member state recognized by the UN as an aggressor.
The foreign minister thanked the IAEA for its decision to expand the mandate of monitoring missions at Ukraine's nuclear facilities, for providing medical equipment and other assistance, and suggested expanding humanitarian cooperation.
As was earlier reported, dozens of drones have been detected in the observation zones of the Chornobyl and Rivne nuclear power plants, posing a direct threat to nuclear safety and security.

Putin believes the Cold War was World War III, a system war decided by exhaustion, infiltration, and fear. In 2026, he is trying to replay that playbook against NATO, using cyber sabotage, information warfare, energy coercion, and nuclear intimidation to slow Western decisions.
This video breaks down the hard data behind that toolkit: the US record on Russian influence operations, the $10B+ NotPetya damage estimate, the 2022 gas shock and power price spike mechanics, and the measurable surge in NATO and EU defense spending after Russia escalated.

You will also see how these tools stack, because each crisis amplifies the next: distrust makes disruption feel bigger, and disruption makes compromise look tempting.

Ukraine is the front line, but Western cohesion is the center of gravity. If allies stay unified and speed decisions, the strategy fails. If allies fracture and delay, Putin buys time, and time is the resource he can still manufacture.

South Korean businesses remaining in Russia thriving — Russian envoy to Seoul

SEOUL, February 13. /TASS/. South Korean companies that have not left the Russian market, continue to earn "very good profits" in the country, Russian Ambassador to Seoul Georgy Zinovyev said.
"It's true that many large Korean manufacturers have left the market, but many not only remain but are actually making very good profits," he said at a meeting with reporters. This refers to representatives of the light industry, food and cosmetics manufacturers, including large corporations, the diplomat added. He also noted that South Korean companies were forced to cease operations in Russia due to export restrictions imposed by the government of the Republic of Korea.
"Automobile and electronics manufacturers were forced to leave because the South Korean government imposed anti-Russia sanctions on exports. The list of these restrictions currently consists of 1,402 items. They were unable to conduct their normal operations in Russia [due to these restrictions]," the ambassador explained, adding that the full return of such corporations to Russia is unlikely without the lifting of these sanctions.
"When they will be lifted is not a question for the Russian side," he said when asked to assess the prospects for South Korean companies to return to Russia after the conflict in Ukraine is resolved.
In the past, the Republic of Korea was an important trading partner for Russia: trade turnover between the countries approached $30 bln, Zinovyev said. "Last year, trade turnover stabilized at over $10 bln," he noted, adding that Russia remains attractive to foreign businesses because it has a large domestic market. At the same time, sanctions are often imposed quickly, but their lifting can take decades, as was the case with the Jackson-Vanik amendment in the United States, the diplomat stated.
The lifting of sanctions by Seoul could give South Korean companies the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of new constituent entities of the Russian Federation affected during the special military operation. "This idea has a right to exist as the Republic of Korea is known for its expertise in construction," he concluded.

Sex, health, child abuse scandals threaten Orban re-election

Sex, health, child abuse scandals threaten Orban re-election
February 13, 2026Hungary is no stranger to extremely polarized election campaigns.
For decades now, Victor Orban has — whether in government or in the opposition — followed the same playbook: Starting months ahead of the polls, he has run campaigns that suggest the very survival of the Hungarian nation is at stake.
In these campaigns, he styles himself as the only one who can save Hungary and its people from evil and the threat of destruction at the hands of the country's enemies.
Hungary is due to elect a new parliament on April 12, and this time, the campaign is more negative than ever.
Nonsense and fabrications
Orban, his government and his party, Fidesz, have no qualms about papering the country with thousands upon thousands of anti-Ukrainian posters, using taxpayers' money to organize a "national petition" against the EU and Ukraine, and flooding social media with AI-generated fake videos about the opposition.
These videos all have one thing in common: They spread nonsense and fabrications. The prime minister and his team are essentially claiming that if Orban loses the election, the country will face war, mobilization on the Ukrainian front, and enslavement and mass impoverishment as a result of tax increases from Brussels.
In view of this particularly extreme campaign, Gabor Torok — an otherwise sober political scientist — has already spoken of the "decline and fall" of political culture.
Could Orban lose the election?
The reason for this downward spiral is quite simply the real possibility that Orban could lose power for the first time since 2010.
People have in general grown weary of what they see as the corrupt, arrogant and autocratic Orban system.
For months now, Peter Magyar and his opposition Tisza party have been clearly and consistently ahead in opinion polls.
At the same time, the prime minister and his government are struggling with the fallout from a number of self-inflicted public scandals that could all safely be filed under "Lies and double standards."
Child abuse scandal
The first of these scandals relates to serious violence and the sexual abuse of minors at a juvenile facility in Budapest. New aspects of the story have gradually been coming to light over the past few months.
The facility, which was more or less a brutal prison for young offenders, has since been closed. Leaked videos have shown shocking scenes of staff violence at the facility.
Government representatives apparently knew about conditions in the facility for quite some time, but did nothing, even though child protection — coupled with homophobia — is a major theme for Orban's government. Indeed, the government likes to claim that it is protecting Hungarian children against "Brussels' LGBTQ+ propaganda" and the supposed abuse that this will lead to.
Orban and some members of his government and party also seemed to suggest a few weeks ago that the victims themselves were responsible by pointing out that they were criminals.
In doing so, they seemed to imply that civic and human rights could be revoked at will. This was greeted with even greater opposition from some parts of Hungarian society.
Ignoring health hazards at a battery plant
Earlier this week, Hungary was rocked by revelations about environmental and health hazards at a Samsung battery plant in God, a town north of Budapest.
According to research conducted by the Hungarian news site Telex.hu, staff at the factory have for years been exposed to poisonous heavy metal particles, and this dust was emitted into the air, the soil and the groundwater. Documents show that levels were in some cases over 500 times higher than permissible limits.
The Hungarian government was apparently aware of this. It is claimed that even the Hungarian domestic intelligence agency AH warned the government of the catastrophic situation. Nevertheless, it is reported that Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto stopped the closure of the plant.
There are also reports that when the anti-corruption website Atlatszo.hu first wrote about the matter in early 2024, the government considered how best to silence the site.
The story is so explosive because Orban's government has for years been pushing the massive development of battery production in Hungary and sees it as a pillar of the country's forward-looking economic and technology policy.
To this end, Chinese and South Korean investors were brought in. Despite numerous local protests, court cases and concerns voiced by experts, the government repeatedly moved ahead with its plans.
Scandal about a possible sex video
And then there is the story of a supposed sex video involving opposition leader Peter Magyar, which has the Hungarian public on tenterhooks.
A few days ago, a black-and-white photo of an unmade bed in a bedroom appeared on a mysterious website named after — but not belonging to — Tisza's deputy leader Mark Radnai. The image was taken from the perspective of what would appear to be a security camera.
After days of speculation, Magyar himself posted a Facebook video about the photo on February 12. In it, he said that he had had "consensual sex" with a former girlfriend in that room on August 3, 2024. He also said that there had been drugs on a table in the apartment, but that he had not taken any.
Magyar initially accused the woman in question of having filmed him in this situation on behalf of Orban's government and Fidesz and said the whole thing was a "Russian-style campaign" to deflect attention from the "death factory" in God.
Soon after, his ex-girlfriend told Hungarian media that she had known nothing of the matter and suggested to Magyar that if such a video was published, they could bring charges together.
Fidesz no longer dominant
To date, neither Orban nor any other member of the government or Fidesz has made any concrete statements as to whether the publication of a sex video involving Magyar was planned.
By addressing the matter head on, however, Magyar has put the powers that be on the back foot, indirectly showing them to be willing — out of fear of losing power — to stoop to primitive methods such as the publication of a sex video in order to divert attention from other scandals.
In an interview with "Campaign Noise Filter," a program by DW's Hungarian Service, political scientist Daniel Mikecz said that such scandals are ramping up the pressure on the Orban government.
"Before one scandal has blown over, a new one arrives," he said, adding that "Fidesz used to say that it had to dominate and win every day. Now we are seeing that they have to react to something every day. There is no more talk of domination."

What will upcoming inflation figures mean for interest rates in the UK?
Most experts predict inflation fell back sharply to 3% in January from 3.4% in December.
- Bookmark
Inflation is expected to have fallen back to its lowest level for nearly a year in Wednesday’s official figures for January, in a boost to interest rate cut hopes.
Most economists are forecasting Office for National Statistics (ONS) data to show Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation fell back sharply to 3% in January from 3.4% in December, according to Pantheon Macroeconomics.
This would be the lowest level since March 2025.
It is set to come on the back of lower airfares, food and energy price inflation in January.
The figures are likely to reinforce expectations of another interest rate cut, possibly as soon as next month.
Disappointing growth figures for the final quarter of last year have added to forecasts for a rate cut in March, to 3.5% from 3.75% currently.
The ONS said gross domestic product (GDP) eked of meagre growth of 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2025, leaving the out-turn for the year as a whole at a worse-than-expected 1.3% expansion.
But Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill said at a Santander event on Friday that he thought rates were already “a little bit too low”, suggesting he would not be among those voting for a reduction next month.
Mr Pill voted as part of the 5-4 majority on the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee to keep interest rates on hold at 3.75% earlier this month.
The Bank is forecasting that inflation will fall to its 2% target by the middle of the year, as measures announced in the Chancellor’s autumn budget will help to slow inflation, particularly a package of support to bring down household energy bills from April.
For the latest data, Pantheon is expecting a steep drop “as energy, airfares, education and food price inflation all slow”.
Pantheon experts said airfares are set to have dropped by nearly a quarter last month, having soared in December as increased demand for travel over the festive period fuelled price hikes.
Though it believes inflation will be 3% – a touch higher than the Bank of England’s 2.9% prediction.
Investec Economics economist Ellie Henderson said food price growth is also likely to have dropped to 4.2%, below November’s level, but warned there was a risk that food inflation was still a “key concern”.
She added that inflation may also be pushed lower by VAT on private school fees falling out of the annual comparison, as well as “some heavier discounting than usual by retailers”.
She said: “An additional small source of downward pressure on the annual rate looks to have come from utility prices.
“There was a near-5% rise in electricity prices on the month as per the energy price cap, but this was countered by a fall in gas prices.
“In total, the energy price cap increased by just 0.2% in January, smaller than the 1.2% increase in January 2025.”
The inflation figures come in a busy week for official UK economic statistics, with data for unemployment and wages on Tuesday and government borrowing and retail figures on Friday.

UNSC not working as intended: EU's Kallas

00:56:06 KST

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas has said the UN Security Council "is not working the way it was meant to be," arguing that the body fails to reflect the realities of today's world and lacks effective accountability mechanisms.
Speaking at a panel during the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Kallas said the current global order must be reformed to ensure that no country is above international law.
She said that major international crises have historically led to the development of international cooperation, but argued that what is currently missing is accountability.
"Everybody signs up to the United Nations Charter; the principles are there. But what happens if somebody breaches those principles? The accountability is clearly not working," Kallas said.
"The (UN) Security Council is not working the way it was meant to be. The United Nations is not reflecting the world as it currently is," she added.
"If we reform, then we should actually take into account the world as it currently is, where all the states are equal, and also that nobody is above the law," Kallas said, emphasising that even the "most powerful countries" must face consequences if they violate agreed rules.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also warned that the rules-based international order no longer exists as it once did and announced proposals to address challenges in an increasingly fractured world.
In a keynote speech at the Munich Security Conference, Merz said the world has entered a dangerous period of great power rivalries, with a growing number of wars and conflicts threatening global peace and security.
Different rules
In response to a question about repeated ceasefire violations by Israel in Gaza and who would hold it accountable, Kallas reiterated her call for the equal application of international law.
While she acknowledged that powerful states have often operated by different rules, she argued that cooperation, not dominance, ultimately ensures strength.
"But even in the jungle, you know, animals cooperate, and so you are better off when you work with others," she said.
Drawing a comparison between major powers, Kallas noted that when Russia wages war, it does so largely alone due to a lack of allies.
"When America goes to wars, you know, then a lot of us go with you, and we lose our people on the way. So, that means that you also need us to be this superpower," she added.

António Costa dials back two-speed Europe debate, says it's a 'non-issue'

"Enhanced cooperation is not an issue," António Costa dials back two-speed Europe debate, saying unity among member states will prevail.
António Costa, the president of the European Council, watered down expectations of a two-speed Europe as a magic bullet to break the impasse on economic reforms, a day after the proposal came to the fore in an informal summit of EU leaders.
"It's a non-issue," Costa said on Friday in a press briefing attended by Euronews.
Several countries, including France, Spain and Denmark, expressed support for using enhanced cooperation to create smaller groups of member states willing to adopt initiatives that could not otherwise be approved due to a lack of consensus.
Enhanced cooperation rose to prominence in December after EU leaders decided to issue a €90 billion loan to Ukraine without the participation of Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. The legal tool has also been applied in the past in limited cases, as the bloc's functioning is based on consensus-driven decisions.
A shift would indicate leaders now favour speed over unanimity.
"Enhanced cooperation is not an issue. It doesn't matter. And nobody discussed this in the room," Costa said. "We already have different formats in the Union. Some member states are part of Schengen, others are part of the eurozone."
His comments contrast with the approach outlined by Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, during the summit's closing press conference.
Von der Leyen highlighted two legislative files for which the legal tool could be considered: the first phase of the Savings and Investment Union, which aims to mobilise dormant private savings into strategic projects, and the 28th regime, which aims to establish a uniform framework to set up companies across the bloc.
Enhanced cooperation for the Savings and Investment Union might be triggered as early as June if "no sufficient progress" is achieved by capitals, she said.
"Often we move forward with the speed of the slowest, and the enhanced cooperation avoids that," von der Leyen told reporters on Thursday evening.
French President Emmanuel Macron went a step further, saying the European economy needs a new agenda agreed at 27 or through smaller coalitions by the summer.
"What we decided today is that between now and June, we will have to finalise the agenda," Macron said. "If in June we don’t have concrete prospects and concrete progress, we will continue with enhanced cooperation."
Council chief bets EU unity is still possible
Still, Costa sought to temper expectations that the EU would radically change the way it operates in the name of speed, suggesting that the necessary unity will eventually materialise over a two-speed Europe where some advance and others do not.
Costa said countries have "doubts" about the "scope" of the 28th regime, which is still to be formally presented, but that there is a "broad" agreement on its need to be adopted to allow entrepreneurs to overcome 27 different corporate regimes.
On the Savings and Investment Union, he noted, there is only one country that still has reservations about the proposal to centralise financial oversight in the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) in Paris.
The country, which Costa did not name, is widely believed to be Luxembourg, which has long argued that the supranational integration of capital markets would produce excessive regulation, raise costs for businesses and fail to unlock fresh funding.
"I haven't seen any good proposals for this so far," Luxembourgish Prime Minister Luc Frieden said at Thursday's summit.
Ireland, Malta and Cyprus, small countries with important financial sectors, had also voiced reservations in the past, but they are now considered to be on board.
"My feeling is that it will be possible to move forward without enhanced cooperation. If it is needed, then okay, no problem," Costa said.
"Some leaders use this to put pressure on other leaders and basically convince one of the founding members of the European Union that he should not be out of the Savings and Investment Union."
Reflecting on the informal summit, which yielded a tentative commitment to complete the single market by the end of 2027, Costa underscored the "sense of urgency" shared by member states beyond "ideological" debates.
"Everybody understands that we are under pressure from outside because the international rules-based border is under threat, that some economic agents and countries are promoting unfair competition and that we need to act to promote prosperity but also to increase our own security," he said.

White House files new lawsuit against Harvard University
- The Justice Department has launched a new lawsuit against Harvard University, alleging its failure to cooperate with a federal investigation and provide documents regarding its admissions procedures.
- The legal action, filed in a Boston federal court, seeks documents crucial for evaluating Harvard's adherence to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that deemed race-conscious college admissions programmes unconstitutional.
- The Justice Department clarified that the lawsuit was initiated solely to compel Harvard to produce documents and does not accuse the university of discriminatory conduct or seek monetary damages or federal funding revocation.
- This lawsuit is part of a wider campaign by Trump's administration to use federal funding as leverage to enforce changes at US universities, which it claims are plagued by antisemitic and 'radical left' ideologies.
- Previously, Trump's administration cancelled hundreds of grants to Harvard researchers, citing the university's alleged failure to address harassment of Jewish students, which prompted Harvard to launch its own lawsuit last year.

EU must build partnerships with Türkiye, Brazil, India: Germany's Merz

The European Union (EU) must forge partnerships with countries like Türkiye, India and Brazil to address global challenges, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Merz said closer integration among EU members and ties with the United States, while important, are no longer sufficient to address today's economic and security challenges.
"We need to establish a strong network of global partnerships," Merz said. "Canada and Japan, Türkiye, India, and Brazil will play a key role in this, as will South Africa, the Gulf States, and others."
The conservative leader emphasised that the EU should strengthen cooperation with these nations based on mutual respect and a long-term perspective, focusing on shared concerns.
"This would avoid dependencies and risks and, at the same time, open up opportunities and possibilities for both sides," Merz said.
We share a fundamental interest in a political order in which we can trust agreements and in which we are able to tackle global problems together."
Ukraine
Merz also said he was "ready to talk" with Russian leaders but maintained that Russia is not yet prepared for "serious" peace talks with Ukraine.
"If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," Merz said.
"But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously."
"This war will only end when Russia is at least economically, [and] potentially militarily, exhausted. We're approaching this time," Merz said.
"But we are not yet there. Russia has to give up this war against Ukraine, and we have to do everything that is needed to bring them to the point where they see no further advantages for them to continue this terrible war," he added.
"We are not yet there."

Canada school shooter may have been looking to ‘finish off’ family by hunting younger siblings at school: witness
Before opening fire at the school, the suspect allegedly shot and killed her mother and step-brother
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The teenager who carried out a mass shooting in British Columbia, Canada, may have intended to “finish off” her siblings, a witness said.
On Tuesday, the suspect, 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar, allegedly shot her mother and step-brother before entering a secondary school in Tumbler Ridge, a small mining town at the base of the Rocky Mountains.
Inside the school, Van Rootselaar — who was transgender and used she/her pronouns, police said — allegedly opened fire, killing five students and a teacher before taking her own life.
Duncan McKay, a 17-year-old, was inside the school when he took cover after hearing shots ring out, he told The Telegraph. McKay didn’t personally know the suspect, but noted that Van Rootselaar’s younger brother and sister were fellow students — and that the brother was in school when gunfire erupted.
“I am positive he went to finish off his family,” he said, referring to the suspect.
Another Tumbler Ridge resident reported hearing the same claims, though they could not corroborate them, the newspaper reported.
Canadian police, however, have yet to reveal what spurred the attack.
“We don’t have an idea yet as to motive,” Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said at a press conference on Wednesday. “It is something that we are certainly passionately pursuing, but it would be too early to speculate on motive at this time.”
There is no indication that Van Rootselaar had been bullied, he said, noting that she dropped out of school in Tumbler Ridge four years ago.
Police described the suspect as “a very quiet child” who didn’t have “much enthusiasm for anything,” according to the CBC.
Prior to the attack, Van Rootselaar had been visited by police several times in recent years due to mental health issues and she used to have a firearm license, officials said.
The victims at the school were not Van Rootselaar’s relatives. On Thursday, police identified those killed at the school as Abel Mwansa, 12, Kylie Smith, 12, Ezekiel Schofield, 13, Zoey Benoit, 12, Ticaria Lampert, 12 and teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39. Two other children were left injured with gunshot wounds.
Families of the victims have issued emotional statements, recounting memories of their loved ones.
“Seeing your child murdered at this age is heartbreaking,” the father of one of the victims wrote in a Facebook post yesterday. “I was broken when I saw you packed in that BLACK BAG lifeless and zipped up like those we see in movies…”
“Seeing you leave the house with that beautiful smile while going to Tumbler Ridge High School was so refreshing,” he added. “I saw a bright future, a leader an engineer also a scientist in you.”
The mother of one of the hospitalized victims said in a post on Thursday that her daughter — who was shot in the head — showed signs of improvement.
“Keep up the positive vibes…We need to know this isn’t it,” she wrote in a Facebook post, adding “Fight hard baby.”
Officials in British Columbia declared yesterday a day of mourning across the province, and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is set to visit the remote town of Tumbler Ridge Friday.
“Parents, grandparents, sisters, brothers in Tumbler Ridge will wake up without someone they love,” Carney told reporters in an emotional moment. “The nation mourns with you. Canada stands by you.”

Leaders are gathering at the Munich Security Conference as transatlantic relations remain under close scrutiny. This year, the United States is represented by Marco Rubio, whose early remarks suggest a more conciliatory and cooperative tone toward European allies. That contrasts with the impact of last year’s speech by JD Vance, which strongly criticised EU policies and unsettled European leaders. In their statements, European leaders are showing a willingness to rebuild transatlantic relations, as analysed by our journalist Kethevane Gorjestani.

Iran releases on bail three reformists arrested after protests
Iranian authorities have released on bail three senior reformist figures who were arrested in recent days following anti-government protests in January, local media reported.
Azar Mansouri, head of the Reformist Front, "was released from prison a few minutes ago after posting bail", her lawyer Hojjat Kermani told the ISNA news agency less than a week after her arrest.
Kermani previously expressed hope in an interview with ISNA published on Thursday evening that the release of Azar Mansouri, head of the Reform Front since 2023 could come "in the next few days when her arrest warrant is revoked".
Mansouri, 60, an adviser to reformist former president Mohammad Khatami, was arrested on Sunday alongside two other reformists.
"Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh were released a few minutes ago after posting bail," Kermani also told ISNA news agency in the interview published on Thursday.
Asgharzadeh is a former member of parliament and Emam is the spokesman of the Reformist Front, the main coalition of the reformist camp.
They were accused of "undermining national unity" and "coordinating with enemy propaganda," the Fars news agency reported at the time of their arrests.
Reformists traditionally call for more social freedoms and the establishment of a civil society and backed current president Masoud Pezeshkian during his 2024 campaign.
The arrests come weeks after deadly protests erupted across the country, in which thousands of people died and many more were more arrested.
In 2009, Emam was one of the campaign managers for Mir Hossein Mousavi, a leading figure in the Iranian opposition and former prime minister, who has been under house arrest since 2011.

UK painkiller shortage could last for months, pharmacies warn
- UK pharmacies are facing a significant shortage of certain strengths of the painkiller co-codamol, specifically 30mg and 500mg tablets.
- The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has warned that these supply disruptions are expected to continue until at least the end of June.
- The shortage is causing distress for patients living with severe pain, with pharmacists working to manage limited stock and find safe alternatives.
- Co-codamol, a combination of paracetamol and codeine, is a commonly prescribed painkiller, with around 1.25 million items dispensed monthly in 2025.
- The NPA attributes the issues to growing medicine supply problems and insufficient NHS funding for the full cost of medicines, urging government intervention.

Türkiye welcomes 'peaceful' parliamentary elections, reform referendum in Bangladesh
Türkiye reaffirms commitment to further developing relations with South Asian country in every field
ISTANBUL
Türkiye on Friday welcomed the parliamentary elections and referendum on reforms, including constitutional amendments, in Bangladesh, saying they were conducted “in a peaceful manner.”
“We hope that the results of the elections and the referendum, which observers from Türkiye also monitored, will contribute to democracy, stability and prosperity in Bangladesh,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Türkiye also reaffirmed its commitment to further developing relations with the South Asian country in every field in the period ahead.
Bangladesh held general elections on Thursday, the first since the 2024 popular uprising that ousted the government of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party has won a two-thirds majority in the 300-seat parliament and is set to form the new government. The party's chairman, Tarique Rehman, is expected to become the new prime minister.

A Ukrainian court has sentenced a 19-year-old woman, the daughter of a priest in eastern Ukraine, to 15 years in prison after convicting her of spying for Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB), according to Ukrainian prosecutors.
CNN reported on Wednesday, Feb. 11, that Hrystyna Garkavenko livestreamed a road used by Ukrainian troops from inside her father’s church in Pokrovsk about Ukrainian military positions in Pokrovsk, Donetsk region, to a Russian intelligence agent. She is currently serving her sentence in a penal colony.

Prosecutors said Garkavenko livestreamed a road used by Ukrainian troops and transmitted geolocation data about military personnel and equipment to the FSB throughout 2024. She pleaded guilty in June and expressed remorse.
According to Pavlo Uhrovetsky, head of the Donetsk Regional Prosecutor’s Office, the young woman developed more than a friendly relationship with the Russian agent who recruited her. In a phone interview from prison, Garkavenko told CNN she initially agreed to cooperate because she wanted to continue communicating with the agent. She declined to clarify whether their relationship was romantic.
The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) has opened more than 3,800 treason investigations since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, CNN reported, citing Ukrainian officials. More than 1,200 individuals have been convicted.

On average, those found guilty face 12 to 13 years in prison, though some receive life sentences.
Officials say Russian intelligence agencies frequently recruit Ukrainians through Telegram channels, often targeting unemployed individuals or those struggling with addiction. Initial tasks are described as minor before escalating to photographing military facilities or installing surveillance equipment.
Defense Ministry adviser Serhiy Beskrestnov also warned that Russian operatives have attempted to recruit Ukrainians to register Starlink satellite terminals for use by Russian forces, offering payments of about $300.
In her interview with CNN, Garkavenko said she hopes to be exchanged and relocate to Russia, where she has relatives. Prosecutors said some convicted collaborators believe they may be swapped for Ukrainian prisoners held by Russia.
Her father remains in Ukraine. According to CNN, he was shocked upon learning of her actions but has continued to support her.
Garkavenko said she regrets her actions. “I hurt my loved ones and, to some extent, ruined my own life,” she told CNN.

Why Pope Leo keeps issuing stark warnings about using AI
- Pope Leo XIV has expressed growing concern about Artificial Intelligence, warning it could alter human civilisation, invade intimacy, and diminish our ability to understand meaning.
- Catholic thinkers are particularly worried that AI's ability to remove “friction” and effort could lead to human isolation and a loss of essential human experiences and relationships.
- The Church is actively engaging with AI, learning from past experiences with social media, and focusing on the technology's impact on consciousness and potential for idolatry.
- While some believe Catholicism's embodied rituals will safeguard it, others fear AI's convenience could tempt people to replace traditional spiritual practices and community engagement.
- Despite acknowledging significant risks and potential negative consequences, there remains a hope among some Catholic figures that Christianity's inherent resilience and human wisdom will help navigate the challenges posed by AI.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Hungary increased its purchases of Russian pipeline gas by 8% in value terms in 2025, becoming the leader in terms of this indicator among EU countries, according to Eurostat data and TASS calculations.
The European Union imported 407 mln euros worth of Russian pipeline gas in December 2025. As of today, the TurkStream gas pipeline remains the only active route for Russian gas supplies to Europe.
Hungary (199 mln euros), Greece (76 mln euros), and Bulgaria (72 mln euros) remain the top purchasers. Slovakia paid 43 mln euros for gas, while Italy paid 16.5 mln euros.
In total, the European Union paid 5.8 bln euros for Russian pipeline gas in 2025 compared to 7.6 bln euros in the previous year. The main buyers were Hungary (2.8 bln euros), which increased purchases by 8.2%, Greece (1.3 bln euros), Bulgaria (884 mln euros), and Slovakia (600 mln euros).
TASS reported earlier that Russia exported a record 18 bln cubic meters of gas to Europe via the TurkStream pipeline in 2025.

Norwegian biathlete who confessed to cheating on girlfriend wins second bronze medal at Winter Olympics
Strula Holm Laegreid of Norway won a bronze medal at the Milan Cortina Olympics on Friday in the men's sprint biathlon race — three days after making an unexpected confession during a post-race interview.
Laegreid also won bronze in the 20-kilometer individual race on Tuesday, and revealed in a live broadcast that he had been unfaithful to his girlfriend and hoped to win her back. He said he had confessed the infidelity a week before his win and that she broke up with him.
"I told her a week ago. And it's been the worst week of my life," NBC reported Laegreid as saying, citing Norwegian Broadcasting Corp. "I had a gold medal in life, and there's probably a lot of people out there who look at me differently now, but I only have eyes for her. Sports has taken a bit of a back seat these past couple of days. Yeah, I wish I could share this with her."
Laegreid said he regretted his behavior "with all (his) heart" and accepted "the consequences of what (he'd) done," but hoped if he "put it all on the table," his ex-girlfriend would take him back. Local media reported that his ex-girlfriend, who remains unidentified, was not happy with the display.
"I did not choose to be in this position, and it hurts to have to be in it," local media reported her as saying, according to CBS Sports. "We have had contact, and he is aware of my positions on this."
His tearful confession was criticized by some who said it took the focus away from teammate Johan-Olav Botn, who won the gold medal in that event.
On Wednesday, Laegreid said in a statement issued by the Norwegian team that he deeply regretted "sharing this personal story on what was a day of celebration for Norwegian biathlon."
Quentin Fillon Maillet of France won Friday's sprint race — his second gold of the Milan Cortina Games after the mixed relay — and Vetle Sjaastad Christiansen of Norway took silver.

Naomi Watts ignites divisive debate with Jackie Kennedy portrayal in Love Story
New Ryan Murphy series centers on the tragic romance between JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Naomi Watts’s portrayal of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the debut season of Ryan Murphy’s new anthology series, Love Story, has sparked heated debate among viewers, with some arguing her performance leaves much to be desired while others are touting it as Emmy-worthy.
Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette, which premiered its first three episodes Thursday on Hulu and Disney+, centers on the whirlwind romance and high-profile relationship between the attorney and his publicist wife before their tragic deaths in 1999. It features Paul Anthony Kelly as JFK Jr., Sarah Pidgeon as Carolyn Bessette, Grace Gummer as Caroline Kennedy, and Watts as former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.
Watts, slated to appear in all eight episodes, left critics and viewers in stark disagreement over her vocal impressions of the former first lady.
The Guardian’s Lucy Mangan declared Watts’s performance and vocal impressions were “truly terrible” in a two-star review.
Others shared opinions similar to Mangan’s. “The series’ biggest disappointment was Naomi Watts. She did a horrible Jackie Kennedy. Very bad. I had to look away,” one person wrote on X, with a second adding that it was “unsettling.”
“I’m here for Naomi Watts doing an awful Jackie Kennedy impression on Love Story,” a third said, as a fourth insisted: “I need a minute to adjust to Naomi Watts as Jacqueline Kennedy.”
However, others said that her casting was not what they expected but still argued, “I think it could work.”
Lacy Baugher Milas of the AV Club found it to be “another outstanding performance” from the Mulholland Drive star.
“I think Naomi Watts is a very good Jackie Kennedy,” someone else opined on X. “I really enjoy her interpretation.”
“Naomi Watts is EATING these Jackie Kennedy monologues,” a second echoed, while a third added: “Naomi Watts sounds just like his mother. The comparison stops there but she has the voice down sure.”
A fourth went as far as to predict that she “could secure her 1st win for playing the iconic Jackie Kennedy (Love Story). This could be her 1st (!) major award across ALL mediums.”
This marks the fourth collaboration between Watts, 57, and Murphy. The British actor has previously starred in his 2022 Netflix thriller The Watcher, his limited 2024 series Feud: Capote vs. The Swans and his latest, heavily derided legal drama All’s Fair.
The nine-episode limited series has faced controversy and backlash from many people, who feel Murphy’s dramatized adaptation of JFK Jr. and Bessette’s highly publicized relationship and their untimely deaths in a horrific plane crash is disrespectful.
JFK Jr.’s nephew, Jack Schlossberg, initially slammed the series in a statement, saying: “Lately, my news feed has been filled with pictures of my uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr., a great man. For those wondering whether his family was ever consulted, or has anything to do with the new show being made about him, the answer is no, and there’s really not much we can do.”
Schlossberg then added his concern that Murphy was “profiting off of it in a grotesque way.”
Murphy responded to Schlossberg’s comment at the time by saying, “I thought it was an odd choice to be mad about your relative that you really don’t remember.”
The first three episodes of Love Story: John F. Kennedy Jr & Carolyn Bessette are now streaming on Hulu and Disney+. New episodes will be released weekly on Thursdays through March 26.

Israel’s West Bank annexation, the RSF’s new camp in Ethiopia, and a Myanmar media storm: The Cheat Sheet
Unknown

Our editors’ weekly take on humanitarian news, trends, and developments from around the globe.
On our radar
Israel moves closer to de facto West Bank annexation
Israel’s security cabinet approved a new set of measures on 8 February, further consolidating its control over the occupied West Bank. Israel’s nearly six-decade occupation of the Palestinian Territories, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, is illegal, according to the International Court of Justice. But Israeli ministers made no secret about their intentions following the approval. Energy Minister Eli Cohen said the move would establish “de facto sovereignty” and “actually establish a fact on the ground that there will not be a Palestinian state”. Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who lives in an illegal Israeli settlement in the West Bank, said the move would make it easier for Jewish settlers to force Palestinians off their land and to “continue to bury the idea of a Palestinian state”. The adoption of the measures has drawn international condemnation. Already this year, almost 700 Palestinians in different parts of the West Bank have been forced off their land by attacks by Israeli settlers. Israeli authorities have also been issuing demolition orders and evicting people from their homes in occupied East Jerusalem.
Has the UAE paid for an RSF training camp in Ethiopia?
The United Arab Emirates has reportedly financed the construction of a military camp in Ethiopia’s Benishangul-Gumuz region to train thousands of fighters for the Rapid Support Forces operating across the border in Sudan. An investigation by Reuters, citing 15 sources and supporting documents, says 4,300 recruits – mainly Ethiopians but also citizens of Sudan and South Sudan – are undergoing military training there, while upgrades to a nearby airport may be linked to supplying RSF operations. Benishangul-Gumuz borders Sudan’s Blue Nile state, where the RSF has opened a new front against the Sudanese army in the civil war that began in 2023 and has produced the world’s largest humanitarian crisis. Abu Dhabi’s support network for the RSF has drawn in countries such as Chad and Libya, as well as Somalia’s semi-autonomous Puntland region, though recent tensions with fellow Gulf heavyweight Saudi Arabia appear to be complicating these supply routes. Ethiopia is a key UAE partner in the Horn of Africa and received extensive Emirati backing during its war against Tigrayan forces between 2020 and 2022.
Almost half a billion people vote in Asia
More than 474 million people have gone to the polls across the Asian continent over the past two weeks. Bangladesh saw its first election since the ouster last year by a Gen Z uprising of long-time autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina. The centre-right Bangladesh Nationalist Party was projected to win a landslide majority: 212 of the 300 constituency seats. Narendra Modi and Shehbaz Sharif of India and Pakistan respectively sent their congratulations to BNP leader Tarique Rahman – the child of a former prime minister (like Hasina) who has returned after 17 years of self-imposed exile. In neighbouring Myanmar, the military-led government’s elections saw critics accusing the junta of conducting an orchestrated farce, with the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party securing clear majorities in both houses. There were also reports of alleged election violence by both the military government and armed opposition groups. In Japan, the party of the country’s first female prime minister won a super majority, with 351 of 456 seats. Thailand, meanwhile, saw the conservative Bhumjaithai Party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul winning but falling short of a clear majority. An expected “orange wave” of support for young candidates did not come to pass.
Misogyny and the Musevenis
The Pan-African Progressive Leaders Solidarity Network, a rights group led by Kenyan opposition politician Martha Karua, has penned an open letter to Uganda’s first family condemning atrocities against the country’s women following January's elections. Among many incidents of abuse and sexual intimidation the letter details is an assault on Barbara Kyagulanyi, the wife of President Yoweri Museveni’s main challenger in the election, Robert Kyagulanyi (AKA Bobi Wine). The letter criticises the president’s son, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who also heads the country’s military for misogynistic online conduct that emboldens subordinates to treat women with similar contempt, and appeals to First Lady Janet Museveni, who also serves as the Minister of Education and Sports, to break her silence. The letter was published a day after Museveni decorated his son with the Kabalega Star – Uganda's second-highest military honour – praising the army for maintaining security during elections despite allegations of involvement in intimidation, ballot-stuffing, and abductions of opposition supporters. The family has consolidated its stranglehold on power and Muhoozi is being groomed to replace his father as president, with some referring to him as the “standby generator”.
African countries push back against Russian military recruitment
Facing a manpower shortage in its war with Ukraine, Russia is increasingly turning to recruitment networks in the Global South – especially Africa – to help fill its ranks. Fast-track visas, the promise of good salaries as well as citizenship are the lures, in contrast to the official immigration hostility in the rest of Europe. But the problem is surviving the front line. In a report released this week, the investigative collective INPACT obtained a single list of 1,417 Africans hired by Russia (Egypt, Cameroon, and Ghana provided the most recruits) and found a death rate of over 20%. Those killed lasted an average of just six months. There are also reports of racism and brutality. While many young men volunteer, others are duped, promised work or scholarships, but are then forcibly enlisted. Kenya and South Africa are two countries that have complained. Nairobi wants a ban on the conscription of Kenyans, while South Africa said Moscow had agreed to the return of 17 men tricked into serving in Ukraine’s Donbas region.

Investigation reveals Frontier Myanmar’s military intelligence ties
An investigation by Myanmar Now into two other news outlets’ alleged military ties has ignited controversy in the country’s exile media scene. The investigation found that The Myanmar Times (now inactive) and Frontier Myanmar (still active) have their roots in an alleged propaganda apparatus designed in the 2000s by a military intelligence official to shape the image of the country’s previous junta abroad. Frontier promptly issued a response, rejecting the accusations as baseless and defending the outlet’s record of investigative reporting and editorial independence. One Myanmar-watcher pointed out that the investigation did not question the credibility of much of Frontier’s journalism, including its coverage of the Rohingya genocide, but explained how “media capture” exploits credible journalism to benefit corporate or state interests. The same person also noted that Frontier’s rebuttal did not engage with much of the evidence Myanmar Now produced, including apparent links between Frontier’s former owners and a military equipment supplier, and a slew of Frontier advertorials promoting businesses linked to one of its owners. Others have criticised Frontier’s editor-in-chief, who posted an AI-generated image that appears to portray the outlet’s critics of being jealous drug-abusers. A former Myanmar Times and Myanmar Now contributor told The New Humanitarian the investigation was a welcome reprieve from the “traumatising and monotonous” war reporting many local and exile journalists are forced to do every day, especially with budgets tightening amid foreign aid cuts: “This is precisely the kind of journalism Myanmar outlets would love to be doing and should be doing, if they had [more] support.”

Hungary's PM hopeful accuses opponents of planning blackmail ahead of election

Orban rival accuses opponents of blackmail plot ahead of Hungary election
Less than two months before Hungary's election, opposition leader Peter Magyar has accused his rivals of planning to blackmail him with a secretly recorded sex tape, and says he is filing a complaint with authorities.
Magyar, who leads long-time Prime Minister Viktor Orban in the polls, said he suspected there were plans to release a tape of him from August 2024, when he says he engaged in consensual sex with a now ex-girlfriend at a party.
He was responding to a photo recently posted online of a bedroom in an apartment dating back to then.
Leading figures in Orban's Fidesz party said they knew nothing about the claims. The BBC has approached Orban's spokesman for comment.
Magyar accused Fidesz of trying to blackmail him and made three allegations of unlawful conduct in a statement on Friday.
Although no video has been published, he said one from that date would have been "recorded with secret service equipment and possibly faked".
Magyar made no mention in his statement of the ex-girlfriend he had been with at the time of the alleged incident, although he said on Thursday he had accused her of extortion 15 months ago - an allegation she denied.
She told Hungarian media that they were both victims regarding the alleged illicit video and she was ready to take legal action with him.
Magyar accused Fidesz leaders of timing their campaign to coincide with the start of his nationwide campaign next week, and of trying to ruin the last week he was spending with his three sons ahead of the April election.
Fidesz communications director Tamas Menczer accused Magyar of lying, while Orban's chief of staff Gergely Gulyas told reporters he could not comment on something he knew nothing about.
Orban, Hungary's nationalist leader, has been in office for 16 years, but with parliamentary elections on 12 April, Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is at least eight points ahead in the latest opinion poll by Hungary's Idea Institute.
Fidesz has so far focused its campaign on attacking the European Union, accusing Brussels of trying to bring down his government. He is seen as Vladimir Putin's closest ally in Europe and has called on the EU to stop sending money to Ukraine.
On Friday, US President Donald Trump praised Orban as a "truly strong and powerful leader", ahead of a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump said he had been "proud to ENDORSE Viktor" for re-election in 2022 and was "honoured to do so again".
The election campaign is not even due to start until 21 February, but Magyar's allegations of dirty tricks are an indication of how murky the next few weeks may become.
Magyar has built support across Hungary over the past two years, promising to reset relations with Hungary's European partners.
A one-time Fidesz loyalist, he was once married to former justice minister Judit Varga, whose political career ended during a scandal in 2024. They divorced the year prior.

Why the UK is set to endure even more rain and flooding every year
- A new study warns that UK winters are becoming significantly wetter, dramatically increasing flood risks due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations.
- Researchers found that the UK's winter rainfall is increasing by approximately 7 per cent for every degree of global or regional warming, a rate faster than most climate models predict.
- This trend is primarily driven by a warmer atmosphere's ability to hold more moisture, leading to larger and more intense rainstorms.
- Leading global climate models significantly underestimate this change, projecting an average 4 per cent rise in rainfall per degree of warming compared to the observed 7 per cent.
- The UK is currently experiencing winter rainfall levels that climate models had not expected until the 2040s, making the country increasingly vulnerable to flooding.

Russia confirms $12 trillion pitch to Trump tied to Ukraine deal — White House stays silent on proposals

Russia confirms $12 trillion pitch to Trump tied to Ukraine deal — White House stays silent on proposals
Russia appeared to confirm on Feb. 13 the existence of a sweeping U.S.-Russia economic proposal known in Kyiv as the "Dmitriev package," days after President Volodymyr Zelensky first disclosed it publicly.
The Ukrainian president said on Feb. 6 that intelligence had briefed him on what he described as a roughly $12 trillion framework for large-scale economic cooperation between Moscow and Washington.
"Intelligence showed me the so-called 'Dmitriev package' that he presented in the U.S. — it amounts to around $12 trillion," Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv.
The reference is to Kirill Dmitriev, an envoy who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund and has remained engaged with top U.S. officials, including Special Envoy Steve Witkoff.
The White House twice declined to confirm the existence of such proposals in comments to the Kyiv Independent — first after Zelensky's disclosure and again following a subsequent Bloomberg reporting.
The Russian acknowledgment marks the first official signal that such proposals are on the table as the U.S. pushes for a deal to end Russia's war against Ukraine.
What's inside?
That Bloomberg reporting offered a detailed look at what Russia may be seeking.
The outlet reported on Feb. 12 that Russia seeks to secure a wide-ranging economic partnership with the U.S. as part of an arrangement tied to Ukraine.
Citing an internal Russian memo prepared earlier this year, the outlet said Moscow wants relief from restrictions that have cut it off from the dollar payment system.
Russia reportedly views the restoration of dollar-based settlements as part of a potential peace deal. The memo outlines seven areas of possible U.S.-Russia cooperation.
Beyond regaining access to dollar transactions, Moscow reportedly seeks long-term contracts for American aircraft to modernize Russia's commercial fleet, as well as joint ventures in hard-to-recover oil extraction and liquefied natural gas production.
The Kremlin has long sought the lifting of U.S. sanctions on its aviation sector.
The proposals also include cooperation in nuclear energy, and expanded mining projects for lithium, copper, nickel, and platinum.
To sweeten the offer, the Kremlin signals it is ready to factor in previous American investments in Russia and contribute to compensation for losses incurred after Western companies exited the market following the start of Moscow's all-out war.
U.S. firms would receive preferential treatment if they return to Russia's market.
The plan also envisions joint efforts to promote fossil fuels globally as an alternative to the so-called "green" climate-focused policies.
Moscow's careful confirmation
When asked about the package on Feb. 13, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov didn't deny its existence. He framed it as a natural extension of shared economic interests.
"This Bloomberg article explains something that is quite obvious," Peskov said. "Of course, we are offering cooperation. Of course, companies from both countries are potentially interested in this cooperation — so there you have joint ventures."
Russia has not refused to use dollars — it was the United States that imposed restrictions on the use of the currency, he added.
His response marked Moscow's first public acknowledgment that economic cooperation proposals are under discussion with Washington — a significant shift given the White House's refusal to confirm such talks.
The dollar gambit
Among the proposals, Russia's push to return to dollar-based settlements stands out as the most politically sensitive — and hypocritical.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly argued that the dollar's global dominance is declining and accused the U.S. of "parasitizing" the world economy.
Putin has also predicted that U.S. sanctions policy against Moscow would ultimately undermine the dollar's role in global finance.
A renewed embrace of dollar transactions would mark a reversal from the Kremlin's recent policy of "de-dollarization," as Moscow's officials have called it.
Since 2022, Russia has expanded settlements in national currencies with partners such as India and China and promoted alternatives within the BRICS group.
Although Putin said in October 2024 that there were no immediate plans to create a single BRICS currency, he noted the bloc's pursuit of financial sovereignty.
That effort has earlier drawn a warning from the Trump administration.
In January 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose 100% tariffs on BRICS members if they attempt to adopt a new or existing currency to replace the U.S. dollar in international trade.
Ukraine as bargaining chip
Taken together, the reported "Dmitriev package" suggests that Moscow is linking any movement on Ukraine not only to territorial and political demands, but also to a sweeping reset of economic relations with the United States.
Russia sees the war in Ukraine as leverage for extracting massive economic concessions from Washington, while trying to push its maximalist demands for Kyiv.

US has ‘squandered’ its claim to world leadership under Trump, German chancellor Merz suggests
Friedrich Merz was speaking on the first day of the Munich Security Conference, being held in the shadow of Donald Trump’s global influence

- CommentsGo to comments
Germany’s chancellor Friedrich Merz has declared the international order is being destroyed, in a swipe at US president Donald Trump and his disruptive foreign policy.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Merz warned that the United States’ “claim to leadership is disputed, perhaps squandered”.
“A rift has opened up between Europe and the United States. Vice President JD Vance said this very openly here in Munich a year ago,” Merz said, referring to Vance’s deeply contentious speech in which he lambasted traditional allies in Europe.
“He was right. The culture war of the Maga movement is not ours. Freedom of speech ends here with us when that speech goes against human dignity and the constitution. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
Referring to the upending of a rules-based order since Trump returned to office just over a year ago, the German leader gave a bleak assessment of the current climate.
“You’ve chosen a grim motto for this conference, ‘under destruction’, and it probably means that the international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed,” he told the summit.
“But I’m afraid we have to put it in even harsher terms: This order, as flawed as it has been even in its heyday, no longer exists.”
This year alone, Trump has deposed the leader of Venezuela with a military strike, threatened Greenland with annexation and sent aircraft carriers to the Middle East amid ongoing tensions with Iran.
However, Merz did offer an olive branch to the United States, represented at the three-day summit by secretary of state Marco Rubio.
“In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” Merz continued, referring to the rise of China, and Russia’s geopolitical aims.
“Dear friends, being a part of Nato is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” he said.
Merz went on to reiterate the importance of bolstering Nato’s defences and expressed Germany’s commitment to investing billions in the partnership in the coming years.
Europe has been left reeling from Trump’s more aggressive foreign policy in his second term, forcing a reassessment of global alliances. The theme is expected to come up repeatedly during the Munich conference, though Trump himself is not attending.
“No one in Europe, or in the United States, wins from any kind of conflict between old allies,” said Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen on Friday, reiterating Merz’s commitment to retain a good relationship with the U.S.
“So we must do what we can to keep the Americans close to us, but this is a new world disorder that we live in.”

People and power: How Cubans and their government see US pressure
As Cuba’s government prepares for American aggression, residents say economic hardship worries them more than the threat of war
- Cuban Foreign Ministry official says Havana concurs with pope’s call for peace, ‘but there is one party that doesn’t agree’
- Havana resident Andy Martinez Gonzalez says blackouts now last ‘12 to 20 hours a day’
- Expert Anna Ayuso says Cuba has diplomatic support from large powers, but is ‘not a priority’ for Russia or China
MEDELLIN, Colombia
Tensions between Cuba and the US have escalated sharply this year, as Washington steps up sanctions and threatens regime change while tightening pressure on the island’s already fragile economy.
The measures have deepened fuel shortages and prolonged blackouts across the country, disrupting transport, tourism and daily life, even as many Cubans say the latest geopolitical standoff feels like a familiar chapter in a decades-long conflict with Washington.
While Washington has for years pursued regime change in Cuba, many analysts believe the risk is now higher. The capture and forcible removal of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro earlier this year signaled that the Trump administration is willing to use force against regional adversaries, raising concerns that Cuba – Caracas’ closest political and economic ally – could be the next target.
US President Donald Trump has warned Cuba to “make a deal” with its northern neighbor before it is “too late.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio also told a Senate hearing that the White House “would love to see the regime there change.”
Liz Oliva Fernandez, a Cuban journalist with the Havana-based media outlet Belly of the Beast, told Anadolu that many Cubans feel “anxious, frustrated and irritated” by the threats.
Washington has no right to “decide which state or government should collapse,” she said.
Severe fuel blockade deepens economic crisis
On Jan. 29, Trump signed an executive order imposing tariffs on any country that supplies Cuba with oil. The measures most affected Mexico, the country’s main supplier after Venezuela, which had initially pledged to continue shipments but later halted exports amid US pressure.
The impact on Cuba’s energy supply has been severe. By late January, the island had received just 84,900 barrels of oil all year from a single Mexican shipment early in the month, according to energy consultancy Kpler.
That amounts to just over 3,000 barrels per day, down sharply from an average of about 37,000 barrels per day from all suppliers in 2025.
Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel has described the measures as an “energy blockade,” warning they are disrupting transportation, hospitals, schools, tourism and food production.
Aviation authorities have also warned airlines that there is insufficient jet fuel available on the island, while the already fragile power grid is facing even deeper strain. Rolling blackouts were common before the latest sanctions, but outages have now intensified.
Satellite imagery analysis cited by Bloomberg shows that nighttime light levels in major eastern cities such as Santiago de Cuba and Holguin have dropped by as much as 50% compared with historical averages.
The fuel crisis is also hitting the tourism sector. Canada, Cuba’s largest source of visitors, has seen its leading airline suspend flights until at least May due to the lack of jet fuel, repatriating around 3,000 tourists. Russian officials have also said they are preparing to halt flights and evacuate travelers in the coming days.
Andy Martinez Gonzalez, a chef and resident of the Cuban capital, told Anadolu that the economic situation “is becoming ever more critical” as blackouts caused by electricity shortages now last between “12 and 20 hours a day.”
He added that, although Cubans are divided on the question of whether the US will attack Cuba, the reality of continued economic hardship remains a more pressing issue to the average Cuban than the distant, albeit threatening, rhetoric of a foreign power.
Preparing for war
The Cuban government, however, is taking the military threats seriously. Authorities recently declared a “state of preparation for war” in response to what they described as the risk of a possible US operation against the island.
Officials warned that the country was ready “to defend the homeland to the last drop of blood,” while the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces (FAR) began wartime preparations.
In response to the rising tensions, Pope Leo XIV called for peace between the two nations, “inviting all responsible parties to promote a sincere and effective dialogue, in order to avoid violence.”
A Cuban Foreign Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press, told Anadolu that they agreed with the pope’s appeal.
“But there is one party that doesn’t agree,” the official said, referring to the US.
Since the Cuban Revolution of 1959, relations between Cuba and the US have been characterized by the specter of American-backed invasion, regime change, assassinations or economic suffocation. As a result, for many on the island, the threat of war is nothing new.
Jordy Falcon, a Cuban property developer in Havana, said he was generally unperturbed by the military preparations on the island.
Falcon told Anadolu that Cubans were born into “a militarized country 90 miles away from the common enemy” and have “been preparing for war their whole lives.”
However, he added that the latest threats have created a sense among some Cubans that the country’s prolonged economic crisis cannot continue indefinitely.
It is “unsustainable” and “unbearable,” he said, adding that it “will have to end soon, in one way or another.”
Cuba’s efforts to shore up support
Falcon’s speculations about the imminence of change on the island are backed by reports such as one by The Wall Street Journal that said the US intends to enact some form of regime change in Cuba by the end of 2026.
Havana, meanwhile, is seeking to diversify its economic partners after losing most of its subsidized oil supplies from Venezuela.
Mexico had pledged to continue supplying crude, but shipments were later halted. Instead, two Mexican Navy vessels delivered humanitarian aid this week, while President Claudia Sheinbaum said diplomatic efforts were underway to resume oil exports.
Havana has also turned to more distant partners. Both Russia and China – founding members of the BRICS bloc that Cuba has joined – have signaled political support.
Russia’s Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev visited the island on Jan. 20 to strengthen bilateral ties. This week, Russian media reported that Moscow is preparing to send fuel shipments, noting that the last delivery was in February 2025.
Meanwhile, China approved an emergency aid package of $80 million and has donated 60,000 tons of rice. The Asian giant has also pledged to “provide Cuba with as much support and assistance as possible.”
However, Anna Ayuso, a senior research fellow at the Barcelona Centre for International Affairs (CIDOB), downplayed the significance of the current Russo-Chinese-Cuban alliance because of the reality that the country is quickly running out of oil.
She told Anadolu that, although Cuba can count on “both Russian and Chinese diplomatic and political support,” she believes that “neither country is willing to directly confront the US oil blockade” by sending oil in sufficient quantities to compensate for the latest American sanctions.
“There will be cooperation in the field of intelligence,” she said, adding that China is strengthening surveillance capabilities on the island and Russia is helping Cuba prepare defensively in case of conflict.
But she noted that such cooperation is largely symbolic, stemming from a desire to see Cuba continue to resist American pressure and remain a nuisance for the North American superpower.
Cuba, she believes, is not a “priority for either nation.”
On the ground, Fernandez holds a similarly muted view of potential Russian and Chinese aid.
The journalist said that food donations or other similar diplomatic outreach “will not solve the problem.”
“What Cuba needs more than aid from Russia and China … is for the US to leave us alone – to not do anything, not to help, but not to get in our way. To forget we exist.”
But continued pressure from Washington appears likely. The highest-ranking US diplomat in Cuba, Mike Hammer, reportedly told other diplomats that the long-standing embargo could tighten even further.
“The Cubans have complained for years about the blockade,” he said, according to reports. “But now there is going to be a real blockade.”

Teacher banned from classroom after turning up to school open evening drunk
Julia Leith was also seen under the influence of alcohol on a second occasion at another school

A teacher has been banned from the classroom after attending a school open evening under the influence of alcohol, as well as turning up to class while “slurring” and “staggering”.
Julia Leith, 60, was described as “erratic, irrational, emotional and confused” by witnesses at Judgemeadow Community College in Leicester during the event in September 2017.
At 6.30pm, a fellow staff member reported concerns that Ms Leith was “disorientated and slurring her speech”, with another staff member realising she did not know “why or who” they were and showed visible signs of drinking.
Given that she was finding it “very difficult to talk”, it was determined that she would not be able to engage with the open evening, which was full of pupils and parents.
When trying to arrange transport, Ms Leith could only provide her own mobile number as a contact number, and was “unable to tell” where her bag was, before she was taken home through the back of the college to avoid the open evening.
In her witness statement, Ms Leith gave contradicting accounts, stating that she had been “anxious” over an observation class that day, and had “a couple of sips” of gin and tonic at home ahead of the open evening.
However, her oral evidence she stated she was “tee total” at the time and would “never drink alcohol in a school”.
A panel for the Teaching Regulation Agency concluded “that Ms Leith’s conduct was inappropriate and unprofessional, as she was present on the college premises having consumed alcohol. The professional judgement of Ms Leith’s colleagues present at the time concluded that she should not be present at the college and needed to be kept away from pupils and parents, necessitating her removal from the premises.”
On a second occasion in December 2018, while working as a supply teacher at Robert Smyth Academy in Market Harborough, Ms Leith was also found to be under the influence of alcohol.
A staff member was informed at 1.30pm that Ms Leith appeared drunk, and was seen swaying from side to side while walking along the corridor.
She appeared “emotional” and “slurring” and smelt of alcohol, with Ms Leith hugging one of the witnesses after opening an office door, the TRA report said.
When mentioned that she was unstable on her feet, she claimed it was due to wearing heels, despite the fact she was wearing flat shoes.
In her witness statement, Ms Leith claimed the smell of alcohol came from mouthwash she kept at work, but admitted drinking wine to “problematic levels” during the evenings.
The TRA found: “Whilst there was no evidence that Ms Leith’s conduct caused harm to pupils, the panel was mindful of the potential harm that could have been caused, had Ms Leith’s colleagues not intervened and sent her home. The panel considered that a teacher under the influence of alcohol whilst on school property was a significant safeguarding concern.
“As such, the panel found the high risk of repetition paired with the potential risk of harm, to be aggravating factors in Ms Leith’s case.”
She has now been prohibited from teaching indefinitely and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, youth accommodation or children’s home. An application to remove the order cannot be made for two years.

Russia Deploys TOS-3 ‘Dragon’ Modeled on Solntsepyok Rocket Launcher to Ukraine

Russian forces have begun deploying the new TOS-3 “Dragon” thermobaric multiple rocket launcher system (MRLS) on the frontlines in Ukraine – an upgraded model of the TOS-1A Solntsepyok dubbed a “legend” by Russian propaganda.
On Thursday, Defense Express reported that footage recently released by the Russian Ministry of Defense which purports to show a TOS-1A Solntsepyok actually shows the TOS-3 “Dragon,” which has a longer range and enhanced protection compared to the Solntsepyok.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
The system was first introduced in 2024, featuring a welded-on grill and an integrated “Volnorez” electronic warfare suite.
The TOS-3 differs from the older Solntsepyok in several ways: for example, it has 15 launch guides instead of 24, but fires longer-range rockets. While the TOS-1A had a range of up to 6 km (3.7 miles) and required direct line of sight, the TOS-3 can strike targets from 15-24 km (9-15 miles), enabling it to fire from covered positions.
Built on a T-72 chassis, it also includes Kontakt-5 dynamic armor, anti-drone nets, and electronic countermeasures. Additional screens and protective elements shield the rockets when stowed. These upgrades make the TOS-3 more resistant to counter-battery fire and strike drones.
Polish journalist Filip Melczarek recently said that its exact specifications will become known only if Ukraine captures one – but that “currently, the only line of defense is using [first person view] FPV drones to neutralize Dragons before deployment.”

Often mistranslated as a “heavy flamethrower,” the Solntsepyok is actually a multiple rocket launcher that fires thermobaric munitions. Like the Solntsepyok, the TOS-3 fires thermobaric rockets that produce massive blast waves by dispersing flammable aerosol before detonation, causing severe pressure changes that can devastate personnel and structures. Any incendiary effect is secondary.
Russia uses the Solntsepyok system to strike Ukrainian positions and civilian areas. A single salvo of 24 rockets can blanket roughly 200 by 200 meters, leveling fortifications and damaging entire neighborhoods.
Each rocket weighs over 200 kilograms, and the system is estimated to cost between $6.5 million and $15 million.
Russian officials have long claimed the weapon has no global equivalent, but it comes with serious risks: when damaged, its volatile ammunition can explode, endangering nearby troops. In one 2024 incident, a Solntsepyok munition detonated in Russia’s Belgorod region, killing three Russian soldiers.
Despite its destructive power, the Solntsepyok is large and lightly armored, making it vulnerable to drones and anti-tank weapons. Ukrainian forces have repeatedly destroyed the launchers throughout the war, sometimes striking them even as they fire. In late September 2025, Ukraine’s 429th Separate Achilles Drone Regiment reported destroying two Russian TOS-1A Solntsepyok launchers using FPV drones in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region.
Ukraine has also captured several of the systems in the past.

Devon and Cornwall Police said the assault took place at around 3am on 12 September 2025, and was reported last month.
The victim was dragged to the ground by a man who first engaged in conversation with her, then attempted to pull her top down on New George Street.
He then put his hand over her mouth, but the victim managed to scream, alerting a passerby, which caused the man to flee.
The suspect is described as a white male, in his early 20s, with tattoos on his forearms and wearing a black puffa style jacket.
The witness, a woman in her 20s called Sophia, gave the victim her jacket and walked her home, police said. She told the victim that she had just finished work.
A statement from the police said: “A woman was walking along New George Street in the city when she was approached by an unknown male.
“The suspect then engaged in conversation with the victim before attempting to pull her top down.
“He then followed the victim before dragging her to the ground and putting his hand over her mouth.
“The victim’s scream then alerted a female passerby which caused the suspect to flee.”
The assault was reported on 26 January, and officers are keen to speak with Sophia.
If you can help identify Sophia, or are the witness herself, please contact the police on 101 or via their website quoting 50260021188

UK court says Palestine Action ban ‘unlawful’: What does the verdict mean?

UK court says Palestine Action ban ‘unlawful’: What does the verdict mean?
Activists welcome the court ruling as the UK government, which designated the group as a ‘terrorist’ organisation, says it will appeal the verdict.
In a landmark ruling celebrated by human rights groups, the High Court in London has called the United Kingdom government’s ban on the pro-Palestinian campaign group, Palestine Action, “unlawful”.
In July last year, the UK government had banned the group, which had protested against Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and the UK’s support for Israel. The Labour government led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer designated it as a “terrorist” organisation and a national security threat, putting it on par with armed groups like al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS).

- list 3 of 3UK ban on Palestine Action was unlawful, says court
Here’s a timeline of when and why Palestine Action was banned and what members of the group have had to endure so far:
What does Friday’s ruling mean?
On Friday morning, judges at the Royal Courts of Justice struck down the British government’s proscription against Palestine Action, ruling that they were “satisfied that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate”.
Sean Summerfield, a UK-based barrister specialising in international criminal law and human rights at Doughty Street Chambers, told Al Jazeera that Friday’s ruling mainly vindicates those who stood in solidarity with Palestine Action and will not have an effect on those directly engaged with the group.
Since the ban, the UK police have arrested 2,787 people for holding signs like “I oppose genocide”, “I support Palestine Action” in silent vigils across the UK, according to a statement by the campaign group, Defend Our Juries.
After Friday’s court ruling, holding such placards will no longer be considered unlawful.
Defend Our Juries said that after Friday’s ruling, seven people charged with Section 12 (Terrorism Act 2000) offences for addressing Zoom calls as part of the Lift the Ban campaign against Palestine Action will also have their arrests deemed unlawful.
Summerfield said the UK’s Director of Public Prosecutions will now have a decision to make about what to do with those already arrested.
“Do they respect the decision of the High Court and discontinue those prosecutions, or do they continue to prosecute pending appeal? The Metropolitan police have already indicated they will now stop arresting people for holding placards, but that does not preclude further arrests if the appeal succeeds,” he said.
“But given the early indications that the government will appeal, the thousands of people arrested for holding placards are likely to remain in limbo,” he added.
Summerfield said that with respect to those activists directly engaged with Palestine Action who have broken into arms factories or disrupted supply chains on behalf of the group, prosecution will continue.
“This is because they have been charged with things like criminal damage. They will still be prosecuted,” he said.
Why was Palestine Action banned?
Last July, members of the UK parliament voted in favour of banning Palestine Action, which was established in July 2020. The direct action group describes itself as a movement “committed to ending global participation in Israel’s genocidal and apartheid regime”.
The government proscribed the group under the UK’s Terrorism Act 2000. Other groups banned under the law include armed groups such as ISIS (ISIL), al-Qaeda and Tehreek-e Taliban Pakistan.
The ban came after activists from Palestine Action entered the Royal Air Force station in Brize Norton, the UK’s largest airbase, in June 2025 and vandalised military aircraft with red paint. At the time, the group said they carried out this action since “these [Royal Air Force] aircraft can be used to refuel and have been used to refuel Israeli fighter jets.”
Prime Minister Starmer condemned the incident. “The act of vandalism committed at RAF Brize Norton is disgraceful,” he said in a post.
Previously, in August 2024, Palestine Action activists had driven a van into Israeli defence and technology company Elbit’s headquarters in Bristol, causing extensive damage.
At about the same time, they had also spray-painted the Ministry of Defence, in central London, red and defaced a statue of Arthur Balfour with tomato ketchup inside the House of Commons. Balfour was a former Conservative prime minister who, serving as foreign secretary in 1917, authored the Balfour Declaration, which supported the establishment of a Jewish “national home” in Palestine.
What has happened since the ban?
Following the ban, Palestine Action said on X that “the real crime” was not the “red paint being sprayed on these warplanes, but the war crimes that have been enabled with those planes because of the UK government’s complicity in Israel’s genocide”.
The group added that the government’s move could risk criminalising legitimate protest.
Since the ban, being a member of the group or supporting Palestine solidarity protests organised by the group in the UK was considered an offence punishable by up to 14 years in prison.
Last week, six people linked to Palestine Action were acquitted of aggravated burglary in connection with an alleged break-in at Elbit Systems in August 2024. The jury was unable to reach a verdict on charges of criminal damage.
In total, 24 activists linked to the Palestinian direct action group arrested at different times are still awaiting trial, and many have been held beyond the maximum six-month detention limits.
Several Palestine Action activists launched hunger strikes late last year, seeking better conditions in prison, rights to a fair trial, and for the UK government to reverse its decision to ban the group.
In January, a few of the activists ended their strike after a number of their demands were met, while others ended it due to health reasons.
What are the reactions to Friday’s ruling?
The court’s ruling has, however, been celebrated by people in the country, human rights groups, and members of the British government.
“This is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history,” Huda Ammori, the Palestine Action cofounder, said.
John Moxham, a retired professor of medicine who was standing outside the court at the time of the ruling, told Al Jazeera he’s “absolutely delighted”.
“I feel absolutely delighted because my wife was arrested for sitting down and supporting Palestine Action. I’ve been on all the marches and it’s just a wonderful day,” he said.
“The whole banning in the first place was just a total travesty, and it was obviously ridiculous. It’s so wonderful that it’s now been turned over. There ought to be a lot of resignations of government ministers and people. The prime minister and David Lammy [secretary of justice] have got a lot of blood on their hands.”
Anas Mustapha, head of public Advocacy at CAGE International, said: “Today’s decision is the correct legal outcome, though it was secured only through principled sacrifice and collective will.
“This ruling against the Home Secretary’s decision should now result in the withdrawal of charges against all Palestine Action activists in prison and the thousands who acted on their conscience, as part of the largest civil disobedience campaign this country has seen in recent years,” he added.
British Green Party MP Adrian Ramsay welcomed the ruling.
“The Govt must immediately stop interfering with legitimate peaceful protest – and instead fully address its complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza,” he said in a post on X.
What happens next?
The British government has said it intends to appeal the court’s ruling.
“I am disappointed by the court’s decision and disagree with the notion that banning this terrorist organisation is disproportionate,” Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said in a statement.
“I intend to fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
Summerfield told Al Jazeera that the High Court’s ban remains in place until the government decides whether to appeal.
“The British government has until next Friday to launch an appeal,” he said.
“Assuming the government does appeal, the ban will remain in place at least until that appeal process has been exhausted, which could be lengthy,” he added.
But rights groups have called on the government not to appeal the court’s decision.
“The High Court’s decision sends a clear message: the Government cannot simply reach for sweeping counter terrorism powers to suppress protest,” Amnesty International’s UK division said on X.
“We welcome this judgment as an essential check on overreach and a powerful reminder that fundamental rights still carry weight in UK law,” the international rights group said.
“We urge the Government to respect the ruling and NOT to appeal this decision. We will continue to expose attempts to erode our rights.”

German chancellor issues powerful Nato warning to US
German chancellor Friedrich Merz has proclaimed that the rules-based international order is “over” in stark opening remarks at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, 13 February.
In a comprehensive speech, the German chancellor implied that in a period of intense rivalry, even the US lacks the strength to stand alone without the backing of NATO allies.
Merz also offered Europe’s unconditional support to Denmark in the ongoing dispute with the Trump administration over Greenland, and reaffirmed his commitment to turning the German armed forces into the strongest army in Europe, ready to defend its eastern flank against Russia.

Keep drilling for oil in the North Sea, says Tony Blair
- Tony Blair's think tank has urged the Labour government to reverse its ban on new North Sea oil and gas licences.
- The Tony Blair Institute (TBI) also called for a reduction in the windfall tax rate on oil and gas firms, stating current policies have increased risk and driven capital away.
- The TBI report argues that the government's clean power plan is 'leading the UK in the wrong direction' and is 'climate theatre' rather than 'climate leadership'.
- Labour's current policy commits to phasing out North Sea oil and gas production by restricting new licences and increasing the Energy Profits Levy.
- The TBI's recommendations echo comments made by Donald Trump, who has criticised the UK for not utilising its North Sea reserves.

Ruling against Palestine Action ban is embarrassing defeat for the government

The list of those who criticised the ban on Palestine Action and its consequences was disparate to say the least, taking in a Trump administration official, a former director of public prosecutions, a former director of the security services, Home Office officials, politicians of different stripes, and UN experts, not to mention a host of NGOs.
Now a trio of senior judges can be added to the list, after they deemed the ban to be “disproportionate” and impinging on freedom of speech and protest when the direct action group’s activities could be targeted under the existing criminal law.
From the point in June last year when the then home secretary, Yvette Cooper, first announced her intention to proscribe Palestine Action, the ban has been hugely controversial.
While “serious property damage” is a criterion for a ban under the Terrorism Act 2000, the legislation had previously only been used on groups intent on violence to the person, such as Islamic State and Boko Haram.
As such, its use against Palestine Action, a group that targeted the UK sites of the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems and others it said were complicit in genocide against the Palestinians, jarred with many.
As well as its reliance on the “serious property damage provision” in the Terrorism Act, the ban also drew attention to the fact that the UK is one of the few countries where recklessly expressing support for a proscribed organisation is an offence.
Never before had a direct action group been banned, fuelling perceptions, despite government denials, that suppressing pro-Palestinian voices was more important to ministers than stopping the slaughter of tens of thousands of people trapped in Gaza.
The advocacy organisations We Believe in Israel and the Campaign Against Antisemitism had pressed the government to proscribe Palestine Action, and the Guardian had previously revealed meetings, under the Conservative government, with Elbit representatives and Israeli embassy officials, that were apparently concerned with cracking down on the group.
Cynicism only increased in the run-up to the parliamentary vote on the ban as the Home Office briefed the Times that it was investigating whether Palestine Action was funded by Iran – a claim the Home Office later distanced itself from and which the independent reviewer on terrorism legislation, Jonathan Hall KC, who supported the ban, told Channel 4’s Dispatches was “nudge-nudge, wink-wink” insinuation without foundation.
There were also concerns that two neo-Nazi groups, the Maniacs Murder Cult and the Russian Imperial Movement, were included on the same banning order, which meant MPs were forced to vote on banning all or none of them.
If the government expected the controversy to settle down after the ban came into effect, it was to be disappointed. Not only was there a legal challenge – an injunction to stay the ban having been rejected – but also a campaign of civil disobedience. Scenes of pensioners, including clergy and war veterans, being carried away by police only added to criticism, with the Metropolitan Police Federation saying the extra demands on officers as a result of the repeated demonstrations, during which hundreds of people were arrested, were “unsustainable”.
Police interventions were simultaneously chilling and absurd. Laura Murton was threatened with arrest by armed officers for supporting Palestine Action after holding a sign saying “free Gaza” and a Palestinian flag. Marianne Sorrell, a retired teacher, was held by police for almost 27 hours, during which officers forced their way into her house and searched it, after she was arrested for holding a placard saying: “I oppose genocide. I support Palestine Action.”
Jon Farley was arrested for carrying a placard reproducing a graphic from Private Eye magazine, which said: “Unacceptable Palestine Action: spraying military planes. Acceptable Palestine Action: shooting Palestinians queueing for food.”
Downing Street described Palestine Action as “a violent organisation that has committed violence, significant injury, extensive criminal damage” and Cooper made similar statements but they seemed to be contradicted by documents released in the judicial review.
The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (Jtac), a government body based within MI5, produced a secret report on 7 March last year that was disclosed in the high court. While recommending banning Palestine Action, Jtac said the group “primarily uses direct action tactics”, which typically resulted in minor damage to property. “Common tactics include graffiti, petty vandalism, occupation and lock-ons,” it said.
Whitehall officials also supported a ban, but conceded that proscribing the group would be “relatively novel” as “there was no known precedent of an organisation being proscribed on the basis that it was concerned in terrorism mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to property”.
Ultimately, the judges found that “a very small number of Palestine Action’s activities amounted to acts of terrorism within the definition of section 1 of the 2000 act”.
But in trying to categorise it as such, not only has the government suffered a humiliating defeat, it has transformed Palestine Action from a little-known protest group to one that is on the front page of newspapers.

Pakistani lawmakers demand treatment of jailed ex-Premier Imran Khan over 'vision loss'
Supreme Court directs government to form medical team to examine incarcerated PTI chief
ISTANBUL
Pakistani lawmakers on Friday demanded medical treatment for the imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan over his “vision loss.”
The opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz-i-Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP) lawmakers protested outside the parliament in the capital Islamabad, demanding Imran Khan’s admission to a hospital for treatment.
Lawmakers raised slogans seeking the release and treatment of Khan, according to videos shared by TTAP on US social media company X.
It came after a lawyer on Thursday submitted a report to the Supreme Court, detailing the situation of the founder of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party.
The report by lawyer Salman Safdar said Khan’s right eye had lost vision. He met Khan in Adiala jail on Tuesday, following the top court's direction.
The court was told by Safdar that Khan had only 15% vision remaining, prompting a strong response from the PTI and his followers.
The Supreme Court ordered the formation of a medical team to examine Imran Khan’s eye, after the submission of the report.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Friday said that the government has “repeatedly” assured the opposition that “no negligence will be tolerated regarding Imran’s health.”
“It is a medical issue,” he stressed, adding that Khan would be taken “wherever he prefers” for medical treatment.
TTAP leader and former lawmaker, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, said the government had “cordoned off all roads leading to the Parliament.”
“All this to stop opposition MPs from protesting and demanding medical access to Imran Khan. This doesn’t reflect strength rather weakness!” he said on X.
However, Minister Chaudhry said the “blockade was not from the government’s side."
Khan, who was ousted from government by parliament in April 2022, has been in jail since late 2023 over several cases, which his party says are politically motivated.

EU foreign policy chief says UN Security Council 'not working the way it was meant to be'
Kaja Kallas calls for reforms to multilateral system to better reflect today's geopolitical realities while upholding state equality
BRUSSELS
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Friday said the UN Security Council "is not working the way it was meant to be," arguing that the body fails to reflect the realities of today's world and lacks effective accountability mechanisms.
Speaking at a panel during the Munich Security Conference, Kallas said the current global order must be reformed to ensure that no country is above international law.
She said that major international crises have historically led to the development of international cooperation, but argued that what is currently missing is accountability.
"Everybody signs up to the United Nations Charter, the principles are there. But what happens if somebody breaches those principles? The accountability is clearly not working," Kallas said.
"The (UN) Security Council is not working the way it was meant to be. The United Nations is not reflecting the world as it currently is," she added.
"If we reform, then we should actually take into account the world as it currently is, where all the states are equal, and also that nobody is above the law," Kallas said, emphasizing that even the "most powerful countries" must face consequences if they violate agreed rules.
In response to a question about repeated ceasefire violations by Israel in Gaza and who would hold it accountable, Kallas reiterated her call for the equal application of international law.
Addressing questions about the US-led Gaza "Board of Peace" linked to a UN Security Council resolution, Kallas noted that the original resolution envisaged a time-limited mechanism and included Palestinian participation, while current proposals do not fully reflect those elements.
While she acknowledged that powerful states have often operated by different rules, she argued that cooperation, not dominance, ultimately ensures strength.
"But even in the jungle, you know, animals cooperate, and so you are better off when you work with others," she said.
Drawing a comparison between major powers, Kallas noted that when Russia wages war, it does so largely alone due to a lack of allies.
"When America goes to wars, you know, then a lot of us go with you, and we lose our people on the way. So, that means that you also need us to be this superpower," she added.

Reeves appoints higher pay advocate to fight skills shortages as chief economic adviser

Rachel Reeves has appointed a labour market expert who has repeatedly called for better pay and conditions in key sectors, such as social care, to reduce the UK’s reliance on migrant workers as her new chief economic adviser.
Prof Brian Bell, who chairs the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), which advises the government, has been announced as the new chief economic adviser in the Treasury – a senior civil service role.
He will take up the post just as the UK economy is adjusting to a plunge in net migration, which fell by more than two-thirds, to 204,000, in the year to June 2025.
Some economists have predicted a further decline, towards zero net migration – but Bell rejects that forecast, expecting it to bounce back towards 300,000 a year by the end of the decade.
A professor of economics at King’s College London, Bell has used his role on the MAC to make the point that the “skills shortages” bemoaned by UK employers may often reflect the failure to offer good enough terms and conditions to domestic workers.
In its 2024 annual report, after Labour came to power, the MAC welcomed the new government’s focus on skills policy as it sought to reduce net migration.
But it also warned: “Many sectors exhibit high levels of immigration not just due to skills shortages but as a result of poor pay and working conditions which cause low engagement from the domestic workforce.”
It added: “The domestic workforce with relevant skills may be unwilling to supply their labour for the wage and working conditions on offer from employers.”
Bell has also argued stridently for better pay in social care. In an interview with the Guardian in 2023, when the Conservatives were still in power, he accused ministers of having “no interest” in the conditions faced by workers in the sector.
“They may not say it explicitly, but I think they basically believe that care workers should be paid less than people who stack shelves for Aldi – because that’s what their policy is,” he said, accusing the government of relying on immigration as a “crutch”.
Bell added: “We’re not doing anything on the wages front, and until we do that, then we are accepting that exploitation as part of the way that we’re going to pay for social care: and that just seems appalling.”
Labour is establishing a new negotiating body for social care, which aims to agree a fair pay agreement that will become the statutory minimum across the sector. But it is not due to come into force until 2028, and sector experts have said the £500m set aside to pay for it will not be sufficient. The wider issue of how to fund social care is being reviewed by the cross-bench peer Louise Casey, who is not expected to report until the run-up to the next general election.
Speaking on a panel at the Bristol festival of economics last year, Bell argued that rapid increases in the number of people coming into the country often reflect wider policy challenges.
“It’s almost always that where there’s big immigration numbers, the problem is somewhere else in government not addressing an underlying problem,” he said.
Bell’s appointment comes amid a wider refresh of the chancellor’s advisers. Neil Amin-Smith, once the violinist for the pop band Clean Bandit and now an economist, was recently made chair of her council of economic advisers, which is made up of political appointees rather than civil servants.
Reeves said: “Through stability, investment and reform, this government has the right plan for our economy and the appointment of Prof Brian Bell will strengthen our economic leadership as we deliver for working people.”

Sweden announces third $100M aid package to Ukraine under PURL initiative
According to Ukrinform, the announcement was made on the Swedish government's official website.
"Sweden stands firm in its solidarity with Ukraine. Through our contribution to PURL, which will give Ukraine access to prioritized U.S. defense materiel, we are once again demonstrating that we are prepared to take concrete steps to strengthen Ukraine's defense capabilities. Air defense and ammunition are crucial to allow Ukraine to defend itself against Russia's continued attacks. Together with our Allies and partners, we are sending a clear signal that demonstrates our shared commitment to peace and security in Europe," Minister for Defense Pal Jonson said.
This is the third time Sweden has contributed to PURL. On previous occasions, Sweden has provided $275 million for a support package together with Denmark and Norway and provided $60 million for a support package together with other Nordic and Baltic countries.
Taking into account this new contribution, Sweden has provided a total of $435 million in financial support to PURL.
On February 6, the Swedish government announced a new aid package to Ukraine worth SEK 1 billion, intended to address the country's most urgent needs in energy equipment.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Geneva was chosen to host the next round of Russia-US-Ukraine talks because the parties found it convenient, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.
"The place was chosen based on the schedule of all three parties. Everybody found it reasonable and convenient," he said, when asked about the reason behind the decision to relocate the talks to Europe.
The Emirati capital of Abu Dhabi held the second round of trilateral talks on February 4-5. The first round of consultations was held in Abu Dhabi on January 23-24. Russia’s delegation was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces.
Peskov said earlier on Friday that the next round of Russia-US-Ukraine talks would be held in Geneva. Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky will lead Russia’s delegation.

MUNICH, Germany — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that U.S. leadership can no longer be taken for granted and Europe must prepare to stand more firmly on its own, in a stark warning to world leaders in Munich.
“The leadership claim of the U.S. is being challenged, perhaps already lost,” Merz said during the opening of the Munich Security Conference, laying out the starkest assessment yet from Berlin of a world increasingly defined by great-power rivalry. “In the era of great powers, our freedom is no longer simply guaranteed. It is under threat.”
He argued the global system itself may already have collapsed. “The international order based on rights and rules … no longer exists in the way it once did,” he said.

Trump-appointed judge issues scathing order saying ICE violated immigrants’ rights in Minnesota detention
Latest blow to mass deportation efforts in the state follows wave of rebukes from federal courts against ICE
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A federal judge appointed by Donald Trump lambasted the administration for surging federal officers into Minnesota without accounting for basic due process protections for thousands of people they arrested.
Immigration authorities violated their rights by stashing them into a severely overcrowded federal facility without access to attorneys, according to District Judge Nancy Brasel.
“It appears that in planning for Operation Metro Surge, the government failed to plan for the constitutional rights of its civil detainees,” she wrote Thursday.
“The government suggests — with minimal explanation and even less evidence — that doing so would result in ‘chaos,’” she added. “The Constitution does not permit the government to arrest thousands of individuals and then disregard their constitutional rights because it would be too challenging to honor those rights.”
Immigration and Customs Enforcement was ordered to immediately restore meaningful access to legal support for people detained in Minnesota, marking a major victory for human rights groups and detainees who sued over conditions that the judge said “all but extinguish a detainee’s access to counsel.”
In response to Judge Brasel’s order, a spokesperson for Homeland Security said that “no lawbreakers in the history of human civilization have been treated better than illegal aliens in the United States”
Thursday’s order arrived hours after the Trump administration’s announcement that federal officers would begin withdrawing from Minnesota in the coming days.
White House border czar Tom Homan — who was deployed to the state after officers fatally shot two citizen protesters and the apparent removal of Border Patrol “commander-at-large” Greg Bovino — said Thursday that “a small footprint of personnel” will remain in the state to supervise the transfer of “full command and control” of immigration enforcement back to the ICE field office in Minneapolis.
A class-action lawsuit from The Advocates for Human Rights alleges widespread violations at the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, where detainees are "shackled" and “secretly” moved to ICE detention centers as far as away as Texas without a chance to call a lawyer or family member.
Detainees are “moved frequently, quickly, without notice, and often with no way for attorneys to know where or how long they will be at a given facility,” according to the judge.
ICE refused to let attorneys meet with their clients, who were routinely “pressured” to sign self-deportation forms, according to plaintiffs.
“All of these barriers make it difficult — if not impossible — for attorneys to effectively represent their clients,”Judge Brasel wrote.
The judge ordered the government to provide written notice to detainees’ access to legal services and provide them with free, private and unmonitored access to telephones.
Attorneys also must be allowed to visit clients seven days a week, and ICE must inform them if their clients are being moved out of the facility, with a chance for the detainees to call their legal counsel or family.
“When the government deprives people of liberty, it cannot avoid its constitutional responsibilities because it finds them inconvenient,” according to Michele Garnett McKenzie, executive director of The Advocates for Human Rights. “It’s appalling that we required a court ruling to defend this fundamental right.”
The ruling is the latest blow to the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts in Minnesota, after a wave of rebukes from federal judges who accused ICE of routinely violating court orders, including ignoring orders to release detainees and illegally moving them around the country.
Judges have also issued similar court rulings over the conditions inside makeshift ICE facilities in Chicago and New York, where detainees similarly lacked access to legal counsel and were stuffed into overcrowded cells.

Ukraine’s former prime minister suspects US may quit talks on Ukraine in May

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Ukraine’s former Prime Minister Nikolay Azarov (2010-2014) did not rule out the possibility of the United States withdrawing from negotiations regarding the Ukrainian conflict in May.
"There are various speculations that, sometime in May, President Donald Trump might officially announce that he’s tired of all the talk and negotiations, and simply 'let them fight it out,'" Azarov stated on the Soloviev Live TV channel. "Could this happen? Well, probably. Why not? He’ll be able to sell weapons and make money."
Azarov suggested that in such a scenario, European countries would likely support Ukraine. He pointed out that the European Union’s budget for 2026 is approximately 190 billion euros, with about 90 billion euros allocated to support the Kiev regime.
Earlier, the British newspaper The Financial Times, citing sources, reported that Ukraine, under pressure from the US administration, had begun planning presidential elections and a referendum on peace agreements with Russia by May 15. The publication indicated that an official announcement might be made as early as February 24. However, a source close to Zelensky denied these election rumors to RBC-Ukraine. Additionally, Deputy Head of Ukraine’s Central Election Commission (CEC) Sergey Dubovik clarified that the CEC had not received any documents related to organizing elections.
Zelensky’s presidential term officially ended on May 20, 2024, but Kiev has not conducted regular elections, citing the impossibility of doing so until martial law is lifted. Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized that Zelensky’s term "has expired, along with his legitimacy, which cannot be restored through any tricks." He also recalled that Russia held elections during its own special operation period without any demands for guarantees.

The Pope and Catholic priests keep giving terrifying warnings about AI. What exactly are they scared of?
Artificial intelligence could bring people back to the church – or replace it entirely, writes Maja Anushka

- CommentsGo to comments
If there’s one defining aspect to Catholicism, it’s a fondness for the corporeal. They’ve involved themselves, for thousands of years, with the natural world and the role of the human body within it. Every sacrament has matter and form: something in the hand, something said with the voice. Water, to cleanse the body of sin. Ashes, pressed into the forehead. Bread and wine, blood and flesh, placed in the mouth. It’s a preoccupation that makes sense for a faith born from an incident of extreme physical torture, but Catholics know, for all their focus on Jesus’ singular body, that one body alone is of little use. Churches are not built by disparate networks of hermits. Your sins cannot be absolved without the attentive ear of a priest to hear them in the first place. People are important.
As a result, the labour of the Catholic church is largely done offline, by real people in real buildings. Its practitioners should be among the most insulated from fear about new, unwieldy technology. But after being elected as the new Pope in May of last year, Leo XIV used his first cardinal address to sound an alarm not only rooted firmly in the digital present, but which also rings out long into the future.
The Leo before him, Leo XIII, became head of the Catholic church in 1878, when the Gilded Age was well underway. Now, 147 years later, the new Pope looked upon a world grappling with a new industrial revolution. “Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV. The Church offers her social teaching… in response to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour,” he said.
“It was so unexpected to hear him speaking about AI. It delighted a number of Catholics I know,” Father Stephen Wang, the Rector of the Venerable English College in Rome, reflects. “They thought, thank God, we've got a pope who gets it.” Work on AI within the Catholic community was already well underway before Leo XIV’s papacy. In 2023, Longbeard founded Magisterium AI: a Catholic chatbot which can read relevant Bible passages to you.
Leo XIV’s first mention of AI was fairly neutral. But by 24 January, when he published his message for the 60th World Day of Social Communications, his tone had starkly intensified. The technology threatens to alter the fundamental pillars of human civilisation, Leo XIV warned. It could “invade and occupy” our sphere of intimacy. We stand to lose our ability to understand meaning, “turning into passive consumers of unthought thoughts and anonymous products without ownership or love.”
It’s undeniably striking to hear the leader of one of the oldest religions in the world speaking so directly about the dangers of unguarded AI usage. We already know that AI is changing our minds and hearts, but could it change our faith? And why does it seem that, out of all the organised religions, Catholics are particularly bothered about it?
Fr Stephen thinks it has to do with the attitude towards struggle. “For the Christian, need and vulnerability and brokenness is not something to be avoided. There’s an understanding built into the theology that these are not just roadblocks to try and get around, but they're part of what our humanity is, and in this imperfect world, they're part of the way that we learn to love and to be loved.”
Perhaps Catholics are particularly preoccupied with AI because it’s precisely this type of friction which chatbots are built to remove. There’s the obvious danger that AI doesn’t work well. That it could be taken over by a bad actor, or used to spread more written and visual mis-truth and mis-information. We’ve already seen the fatal impact of AI failing to understand the nuances of human communication. But there’s a secondary, altogether more concerning possibility: that AI works really, really well.
The promise of every large language model is the same, whether it be ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini. A lack of effort to get what you want, and a lack of friction in receiving it. “But if AI is substituting for my friend, my librarian, my teacher, my counsellor, my companion, my prayer partner,” Fr Stephen continues, “I become isolated. I've lost the things which nurture what it is to be human, a friend, a brother, or a sister.” Things are not meant to be this easy.
It’s these anthropological questions that bug Fr Stephen, much more than whether AI is going to start a thermonuclear war or not. “Because that, at least, you have a chance to solve. But you can't solve the questions about our consciousness easily. As a Christian, they’re on my mind all the time.”
Fr Stephen admits to having a bit of déjà vu with the whole thing. It feels very much like the world has stood here before. Naoise Grenham, a senior policy and research analyst for the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, agrees: “There's a sense that we were a bit behind when it came to social media. So now, we're working with AI to be a bit more kind of, if not ahead of the curve, then at least not as far behind.”
The difference here, he explains, is that in the early 2000s, when society was just starting to worry itself about social media, people in his community were primarily concerned about the content of the tool. Now, they’re worried about the effects of the tool on consciousness itself – and therefore, the consciousness we have about God.
Despite his simultaneous excitement and fear over AI, Fr Joseph finds comfort in the physicality of Catholicism. “Christianity in general, and especially Catholicism, are completely embodied religions, and have to stay that way. So that's why, as a Catholic thinker, I'm not worried that we'll go kind of stratospheric and become unrooted because we can't. Things might get very messy, and a lot of people might get broken and hurt on the way, but we’ll come back to the mass, to communion, to community.”
But could it be exactly this reliance on in-person rituals that puts Catholicism particularly at risk of losing worshippers to AI? These things require a combination of time and effort, which are two concepts we’re stripping more from our lives every day (see: the lack of friction thing), and you could argue that AI stands to be a fairly seamless substitute. The similarities are quite remarkable: both are something omnipresent, available to be called upon at any moment. They hold (or claim to hold) the answers to life’s greatest questions. They can be trusted to hear about your darkest secrets, and won’t tell a soul; will even comfort and absolve you of them. There to provide unwavering guidance and support in your loneliest moments, any time you need. The main difference between God and AI is that one of these things requires getting up and going to church, investing time into a community, building relationships, having discipline, maintaining dedication through doubt, and the frustration and persistence of undertaking a spiritual journey. The other lives inside your phone, for free.
Bishop Paul Hendricks, the Lead Bishop for AI at the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales, finds the concept of someone fully replacing God with AI troubling. “I think it is, in a sense, only a matter of time. A relationship with a chatbot is less rewarding, obviously, but also less demanding. I guess that's the temptation. It's difficult to envisage, but I can't help thinking that someone's bound to, sooner or later.”
It’s one example of how AI could become ‘spiritually unhealthy’, Naoise says. “If the relationship is overly dependent, that would be, in a Christian Catholic sense, a form of idolatry. Tech or AI could become an idol, and be revered or worshipped, even if kind of unwittingly. It needs to be used as a tool. That distinction is really important.”
Bishop Paul half-jokes: “I used to have a rather pessimistic rule of thumb. If it's possible to do a stupid thing, sooner or later, someone's going to do it.”
Father Josef Wieneke, pastor at St Matthias Catholic Church in Berlin, remains hopeful that nothing will ever replace the power of church-going, or his physical and spiritual role within his religious community. “There are lots of professions under threat, but mine isn’t. The Catholic sacraments cannot be performed by a computer. They only work face-to-face,” he says.
“Which may even lead to people becoming more sceptical of the internet, so that the search for what is genuine, real and authentic becomes stronger. We've been telling the young people at our church for years: ‘If you've posted some nonsense on the internet, that's terrible. But if you confess a sin, God will forgive you and never remind you of it again.’ It would be gone forever.”
Fr Joseph isn’t quite so optimistic. “I don’t think that’s where most ordinary people are,” he says, somewhat sadly. “The slope is so steep that I don’t think most of us are capable of getting off it. That’s why I'm not campaigning that we stop it – but the other reason is that I think it's impossible. We're in an AI race, and no one can stop it.
“I do think things will get very bad for a lot of people in the next 10 years, for the reasons that we’ve spoken about. We will go down a slippery slope. We’ll adopt AI uncritically. It will have lots of intended and unintended consequences. Some of those are going to be very dark.”
When I point out that I can’t follow how this bleak vision of the future chimes with his earlier statements that humanity will overcome the challenges of AI, he disagrees. “I don’t think there’s a contradiction here. There are enormous benefits and great risks. But I really believe in my Christian faith, and that Christianity is built to survive. I'm hopeful that humanity and human wisdom and the tech people will be able to adjust it before one of the tech companies takes over, or we reach [artificial superintelligence], and we’re blown up. I think we will find our way forward with AI before…” Fr Joseph stops speaking and cocks his head to the side, thinking. “No, I’m contradicting myself now,” he realises. After pausing for a moment, he continues, nodding, once again assured: “No, I am hopeful. I'm hopeful that we will find our way before existential annihilation.”

Judge sentences teen to life without parole for fatally shooting 5 in North Carolina

Mass shooter who killed five people at age 15 is jailed for life
A handwritten note found at his family's house was revealed during the sentencing hearing
- Bookmark
A judge has sentenced an 18-year-old to life in prison without parole for killing five people in a mass shooting.
Austin David Thompson was 15 when he went on a rampage on Oct. 13, 2022. The attack started at his Raleigh home, where he shot and repeatedly stabbed his 16-year-old brother, James.
Equipped with firearms and wearing camouflage, Thompson then fatally shot four others — including an off-duty city police officer — in his neighborhood and along a greenway.
He was arrested in a shed after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head.
Thompson pleaded guilty last month to five counts of first-degree murder and five other counts less than two weeks before his scheduled trial.
Thompson, who did not speak in court, was led away in handcuffs after the sentencing. Family members of the shooting victims cried as the sentence was handed down. Thompson’s attorneys announced plans to appeal the sentence.
Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway judge had the option to sentence him to life in prison with the chance for parole after at least 25 years, but Thompson did not face the death penalty given his age at the time of the crimes.
“It’s hard to conceive of a greater display of malice,” Ridgeway said, adding that months of planning and fantasizing by Thompson to carry out the rampage also confirmed that Thompson is the rare juvenile offender “whose crimes reflect irreparable corruption.”
During the sentencing hearing that began last week, prosecutors revealed the previously confidential contents of a handwritten note with Thompson’s name and the shooting date found at his family's house in the Hedingham subdivision.
The note said the “reason I did this is because I hate humans they are destroying the planet/earth,” adding that he killed James Thompson ”because he would get in my way.”
Thompson “cannot tell you why he wrote that note the way that he did,” defense lawyer Deonte’ Thomas said, noting that he had no history of ecological-based anger. “And he cannot tell you why he ran down the streets of Hedingham terrorizing people that day.”
But “he is not unredeemable, he is not incorrigible,” Thomas added in asking Ridgeway to give him the opportunity one day to tell parole commissioners he could “still be a productive person in society.”
Thomas argued that the rampage happened during a behavioral episode caused by medicine he regularly took for acne which dissociated the youth from reality. A psychiatrist who interviewed Thompson and a geneticist testified to bolster the explanation.
Ridgeway decided the evidence did not support the conclusion that Thompson’s acts happened while he entered an altered mental state induced by the medication and a genetic abnormality.
Prosecutors dismissed the medication argument as weak and highlighted Thompson’s internet search history on his phone and computer leading up to the attack. They said it included school shootings and were related to guns, assaults and bomb-making materials.
Nicole Connors, 52; Raleigh police Officer Gabriel Torres, 29; Mary Marshall, 34; and Susan Karnatz, 49, also were killed in the rampage. Two other people were wounded, including another police officer involved in the search for Thompson.
“In the blink of an eye, everything changed for those people and for the people that they left behind,” Wake County assistant prosecutor Patrick Latour said Thursday while urging a sentence with no potential parole. “And the thing that made it change was not some acne medication. It was the defendant’s knowing, researched, well thought out, planned, decisive actions.”
The judge heard from people like Jasmin Torres, the widow of Gabriel Torres and the mother of their 5-year-old daughter. She asked Ridgeway to sentence Thompson to life without parole, calling him a “monster.”
“Not one of us surviving victims, our families, our friends, our community should ever have to worry about a future where his barbaric self is set free,” Torres said last week.
Thompson’s parents testified they couldn’t explain why their son committed the violence, calling him a normal, happy kid who did well in school and showed no signs of destruction.
Thompson’s father pleaded guilty to improperly storing his handgun that authorities said was found when his son was arrested. He received a suspended sentence and probation.
“We both lost our children, one at the hand of the other. We never saw this coming and still cannot make sense of it,” mother Elise Thompson said last week while telling the families of shooting victims she will “forever be sorry for the pain that this has caused you.”

EU weighs two-track approach to break economic reform deadlock

EU weighs two-track approach to break economic reform deadlock
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BRUSSELS, Feb 13 - EU governments have long preached unity as the best response to U.S. and Chinese economic pressure, but are discovering they need urgently to boost Europe's competitiveness and that waiting for all 27 member states to agree may take too long.
That was the clear message from an informal EU summit in Belgium on Thursday, where French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gave the bloc until June to progress on a stalled union of financial markets.
The Capital Markets Union would allow the bloc to invest at scale at a level to match the United States, but vested interests in various countries and professional groups have held back any integration for more than a decade.
Now, unless there is sufficient progress by June, a smaller group of at least nine European Union members could press ahead in "enhanced cooperation" with the required steps and reforms, von der Leyen and Macron said.
"Often we move forward with the speed of the slowest and the enhanced cooperation avoids that," von der Leyen told reporters on Thursday. "The pressure and the sense of urgency is enormous, and that can move mountains."
The first movers could be the six leading economies who took part in talks last month hosted by Germany on a "Europe of two speeds" to break decision-making inertia and galvanise the EU economy. The other five countries were France, Italy, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands.
If EU leaders needed a reminder of threats to their economic model, data showed on Friday that the bloc's trade surplus shrank further in December as tariffs weighed on exports to the U.S. and rising Chinese imports crowded out domestic production.
MULTI-SPEED EU ALREADY EXISTS
Some of those not invited to the German-led group of six have expressed alarm.
"It is a good idea to threaten member states to agree on some files, but a very bad idea for the future of Europe," said one EU diplomat.
"Quite simply, it just flies in the face of the unity we like to parade in other areas," said another.
But a third diplomat said it was clear that plan A was to make progress with all 27 EU members and it was good to have a plan B.
"It's a hostile world out there. Prosperity is under threat if these bottlenecks continue," the third diplomat said, noting that Europe already operated at different speeds elsewhere.
Certain flagship EU projects, including the euro currency and the Schengen passport-free travel zone, allow groups of EU countries to move ahead, while others can join later.
The Schengen area, for example, does not include Cyprus or Ireland, but does include four non-EU countries. The European Public Prosecutor's Office has 24 EU participants and the Unitary Patent system 18.
As recently as December, EU leaders agreed to provide a 90 billion euro loan to Ukraine, but the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia opted out.
Karel Lannoo, CEO of the Centre for European Policy Studies, said the EU should still try to advance as 27, not "become more concentric circles".
"You need to advance as Europe, and that's what we need to see also in the context of the threats from the United States and Russia," he said.
The European Policy Centre think-tank said a coalition of the willing was no silver bullet, noting that talks on creating the Capital Markets Union had been long held up by disagreements among big EU members, including France, Germany and Italy.
European Council President Antonio Costa, who chaired Thursday's meeting, said the topic of a coalition of the willing was not part of the official discussions, but diplomats said it was raised on the sidelines.
"Europe has never really suffered from a lack of plans or grand vision; the real obstacle has almost always been weak implementation and national interests taking precedence over European ones," ING Bank economists Carsten Brzeski and Bert Colijn said in a note to clients.
"Whether this time will be any different remains to be seen." REUTERS

Epstein files rock Columbia as two officials are fired

ALBAWABA - Columbia University fired two administrators after it came to light that the girlfriend of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein got into one of their classes through what the school said were "unusual procedures."
As part of a larger release by the U.S. Department of Justice, new documents linked to Epstein showed internal communications that made people question the honesty of the admissions process. This led to the action.
The university said in a statement that the emails showed exchanges that did not meet its standards for fairness and honesty in admissions decisions.
Reversal of Admission Brings Up Questions
Reports say that Karyna Shuliak, a Belarusian woman who was said to be Epstein's last known girlfriend, had her entry to Columbia's dental school turned down in early 2012.
But records show that Epstein talked about her enrollment with top university leaders a few weeks later. By May 2012, Shuliak knew for sure that she would be able to start the fall term as a transfer student.
According to the released records, Ira Lamster, who was Dean of the Dental School at the time, emailed Epstein about Shuliak's admission and told him that her "special status" meant that her visa would not be a problem.
In the end, Shuliak passed from the program in 2015. She had studied dentistry for four years in Belarus before starting at Columbia. In 2010, she moved to the United States.
Talks About Donations
The papers also show that when Shuliak was accepted, university officials were talking with Epstein about a possible gift of several million dollars.
Later, Lamster told the media that while the university was trying to get Epstein to give a lot of money, Shuliak's application would be looked at on its own merits. He also said that the gift offer was turned down after more thought.
Epstein also gave $100,000 to Columbia's School of Public Health before Shuliak started her studies. The money went to a research project connected to Lamster, according to the records.
Response from Institutions
Columbia University said it had taken action against two people with ties to the medical school, but it didn't say who they were.
The case has made people look more closely at Epstein's connections with academic institutions and how much his money may have changed how those institutions made decisions.

How fast is “fast” at a UK online casino?
A fast withdrawal casino is one that processes payouts within minutes or hours rather than days. In the UK, instant withdrawals are often completed in under 15 minutes using methods like PayPal, Trustly or Apple Pay, while same-day withdrawals typically arrive within 24 hours.
Actual speeds vary between even the best online casino sites, depending on payment method and verification status.
Fast Withdrawal Casinos UK
We’ve broken down our list of fast withdrawal casino sites into three categories: instant, fast and same-day withdrawal casinos.
All our recommended fast withdrawal casinos are licensed and regulated by the UK Gambling Commission.
Best Instant Withdrawal Casinos
A growing number of online casinos claim to offer instant payouts, with punters receiving their funds in under an hour, depending on their preferred banking option.
Here’s our list of recommended instant withdrawal casino sites and the payment methods you’ll need to use to receive funds in 15 minutes or less.
Bet365 Casino
Bet365 Payment Methods
Apple Pay users will find banking with bet365 a breeze with the online casino pledging to process withdrawals in a matter of minutes using the service.
Punters can also unlock the bet365 welcome offer with an Apple Pay deposit, while the withdrawal limit of £20,000 using Apple Pay should satisfy most high rollers.
Bet365 have other speedy withdrawal methods, such as a Paysafecard. They are one of only a handful of Paysafecard casinos to allow bettors to make withdrawals.
The Stoke-based bookmaker will allow punters to withdraw up to £2,000 using a Paysafecard. The funds are sent to customers as a prepaid voucher and bet365 claim they will process any payment requests in as little as one hour.
Betfair Casino
Betfair Payment Methods
Typically, withdrawals made via debit cards have tended to be slower than those made via other casino payment methods. However, after coming under pressure from e-wallets, the banks have fought back by offering instant withdrawals, which some fast withdrawal casino operators have picked up.
Betfair offer the service and pledges to process the majority of withdrawals instantly. All Visa debit cards and selected Mastercard debit cards are covered by instant withdrawals and Betfair pledges to have the money in your account in no more than four hours.
With standard card payments taking between two and five working days to hit a user’s account, it’s hardly a tough decision for punters over which type of card payment they would prefer to use.
Other payment options, such as e-wallets and Paysafecard, are available on Betfair, but the best option are the instant card withdrawals, particularly as card payments are eligible to qualify for the welcome bonus of deposit and bet £10, get 150 free spins.
Sky Vegas
Sky Vegas Payment Options
Sky Vegas provide plenty of information on the withdrawal process, laying out the best methods if you want an instant withdrawal. There are many options, so bettors looking for Paypal and other e-wallets may want to go elsewhere.
They offer to complete Pay By Bank payments instantly with most major high street banks serviced.
If you can’t do Pay By Bank, all Mastercard debit customers can also get withdrawals paid within an hour of being approved.
All other withdrawal options are measured in days. We found the Pay By Bank option painless, once you’ve made a deposit from your account, and our withdrawal arrived in a matter of minutes during testing.
MrQ
MrQ Payment Methods
High rollers will be familiar with bank transfers, as they are often the preferred payment method used when large sums of money need to be withdrawn. Additionally, they incur no transaction fees and offer greater security than other methods. That said, bank transfers can take several days, hardly ideal for anyone wanting a fast withdrawal casino.
However, MrQ guarantee any bank transfers will be completed instantly, or they’ll pay you £10 as part of their lightning-fast withdrawal guarantee.
Using the instant bank transfer services means payments can be processed and completed within seconds. While it may sound too good to be true, it is widely supported by most of the big-name UK banks.
Rapid bank transfers are just one of four payment options available on MrQ - fewer than the majority of instant payout casinos - but that doesn’t feel like such a big issue when everything MrQ does just works.
Ladbrokes
Ladbrokes Payment Methods
Ladbrokes are a big-name brand in the world of online casinos, and with good reason. They have one of the highest-rated casino apps available and excellent live options, making them a popular pick for gamers.
Now, using their app or mobile betting site has been made even more user-friendly with the implementation of Google Pay.
Withdrawals can be made using Google Play from as little as £5. Any withdrawals made using Google Pay will be in your account instantly, according to Ladbrokes.
The deposit limit is set at a sizeable £5000 and players can qualify for the Ladbrokes welcome offer when they join and make an initial deposit using Google Play. Just sign up, deposit and wager £10 to unlock 100 free spins.
Best fast withdrawal casinos UK
Below are our recommended fast withdrawal casinos. They all process withdrawals within one hour, depending on your preferred payment method, which is still excellent for punters wanting quick access to their funds.
Pub Casino
Pub Casino Payment Methods
Pub Casino is a great option for Neteller users seeking a quick casino payout. One of the best new casino sites, Pub Casino claim that any withdrawal using the payment platform will be processed instantly.
Neteller, for those not in the know, is another e-wallet like PayPal or Skrill that’s linked to your bank account, meaning you don’t have to share your financial details with an online casino.
Pub Casino does require you to verify your identity before you can deposit, and be aware that you can not qualify for the Pub Casino welcome offer if you make your initial deposit using either Neteller or Skrill.
As well as being an under one hour withdrawal casino, Pub Casino have a reputation as one of the UK’s top slot sites, thanks in part to a huge selection of slots with regular updates of their library to include all the new slots to hit the market.
PokerStars Casino
PokerStars Casino payment options
The list of e-wallets accepted by online casinos changes regularly and the number of MuchBetter casino sites available has increased quickly as the digital payment service has grown in popularity.
MuchBetter is a prepaid service, making it easier to track your online spending and for users of PokerStars, it’s an option for instant withdrawals.
PokerStars doesn’t accept PayPal so bettors will need an alternative e-wallet. MuchBetter is a strong option with PokerStars pledging to process withdrawals made using MuchBetter instantly, or in one hour if the withdrawal amount exceeds the total sum deposited.
Pay By Bank, Neteller, Skrill and Luxon Pay also qualify for instant withdrawals at a fast withdrawal casino that is very transparent when it comes to its payment options.
There are also no restrictions on the payment method needed to unlock the huge PokerStars sign up offer.
Virgin Bet
Virgin Bet payment options
Virgin Bet are another fast withdrawal casino that doesn’t have a wide selection of payment methods with only four options, but two of them promise instant payouts.
Virgin Bet pledges to complete any payments made using Apple Pay and PayPal instantly, although this depends on how quickly the withdrawal request is processed by the operator.
In our experience, payment requests were dealt with in a timely fashion and a lot of the payments arrived in our account within the hour.
Away from their banking system, Virgin Bet with regular free spin offers, free-to-play games, a solid welcome bonus and a well-reviewed mobile app.
BetMGM
BetMGM payment options
For such a massive gambling brand, BetMGM have a relatively small list of banking options. And for those wanting fast withdrawals, they may be best off avoiding debit card and bank transfer transactions, which can take up to three business days to complete.
Those processing times can get longer if a withdrawal extends into a weekend or bank holiday. However, despite BetMGM’s caution over withdrawal times, our testing revealed that Apple Pay and PayPal payments tend to come through in less than an hour.
It helps if you’ve previously used Apple Pay or PayPal to make a deposit, as that will speed up any withdrawal.
BetMGM has quickly established itself as one of the UK’s most popular online casinos, thanks to a strong sign-up offer, a great range of slot titles and regular promotions.
PlayOJO
PlayOJO payment options
We were impressed with the level of detail PlayOJO go into when explaining how to make deposits and withdrawals using one of their five available methods, the online casino highlighting the processing with images and step-by-step guides.
The major omissions were the maximum withdrawal limits and an estimation of withdrawal times, which were a little harder to uncover.
In our testing, we found that PayPal, Apple Pay and instant bank transfer withdrawals were all delivered in under an hour, with an average time of 45 minutes. Once processed by PlayOJO, payments were quick to hit our accounts.
PlayOJO have collected plenty of awards over the years from within the industry to suggest they are a top online casino and we like the idea of earning cash back as an OJOPlus member. However, not all bettors have had a positive experience with PlayOJO, judging by several posts on Reddit about the fast withdrawal casino.
Same-day withdrawal casinos
Our final category features operators that are reliable and prompt with most payments, but can’t quite be described as a fast withdrawal casino yet.
Ivy Casino
Ivy Casino Payment Methods
Ivy Casino are the latest online casino from Betable, which operates nine other gambling sites. As a result, there’s a bit of a familiar look to Ivy Casino, but don’t let that put you off from making it your go-to PayPal casino.
Ivy Casino aim to process all withdrawal requests in four hours and says that the majority of payments are made to customers instantly, no matter which payment option you choose. Ivy Casino allows withdrawals of up to £10,000 to be made using PayPal and claims deposits using the e-wallet should be processed without delay.
It’s worth noting that PayPal is widely accepted across many fast payout casinos, but what makes Ivy Casino different is that PayPal isn’t excluded from their list of payment options when it comes to qualifying for their sign up offer.
Ivy Casino have a pretty standard welcome offer, awarding new customers a casino bonus of 20 no-wagering free spins on Big Bass Splash.
Once signed up, players will find a decent range of offers, including opportunities to unlock no-wagering free spins and claim cash prizes.
QuinnCasino
QuinnCasino Payment Methods
Revolut is a payment method only accepted at a handful of online casinos. It offers instant deposits and withdrawals, but just remember to uncheck the gambling block option on your Revolut account before trying to complete a transaction.
QuinnCasino is a high payout casino that accepts Revolut and guarantees that all withdrawals will be processed in approximately 24 hours, with most payments reaching accounts on the same day.
That 24-hour threshold can only be met if players have completed the verification process - so make sure to do this when you sign up.
QuinnBet has plenty of offers available, with a different one every single day, alongside weekly promotions, including 10 per cent cashback on any losses.
The sign-up offer has recently been updated and will appeal to fans of online slots, with new customers now able to secure 50 free spins on Big Bass Splash when they wager £10.
All British Casino
All British Casino Payment Methods
All British Casino accepts a large range of payment methods, including the e-wallet Skrill.
Skrill is similar to PayPal, allowing you to send and receive funds using an email address linked to a debit card or bank account. The combination of Skrill and All British Casino is a recipe made for those looking for an instant withdrawal casino.
Do keep in mind, though, that any withdrawals from All British Casino made via Skrill on a weekend will not be processed till the following Monday.
Another drawback of using Skrill is that the All British sign-up offer excludes qualifying deposits made via Skrill, meaning punters will have to choose another payment method.
888 Casino
888 Casino payment methods
888 Casino are clear and concise with their explanations on time frames for making withdrawals, depending on your banking method.
Using 888 Casino’s withdrawal table, bettors can see that withdrawals made using Trustly tend to be calculated and paid the same day.
That’s quicker than many rival Trustly casinos, the number of which continue to grow in the UK as the service becomes more and more popular.
Trustly can be used to activate the 888 Casino sign up offer, which gives new customers 100 free spins on selected Pragmatic Play slot titles after they deposit and wager a minimum of £10.

How We Evaluate Fast Withdrawal Casinos
Recommending a fast withdrawal casino is something we approach with care. Every site we list has been independently tested to confirm that its payout speeds match the claims.
Our review process combines licensing checks, hands-on testing, transparency analysis and player experience.
Licensing & Regulation All casinos must be fully licensed by the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), guaranteeing secure payments, protected funds and access to independent dispute resolution.
Payment Transparency True fast payouts require clarity. We only recommend casinos that publish full details on withdrawal times, limits, payment methods and fees.
Real-World Testing We deposit, play and withdraw using multiple methods — including debit card, PayPal and Trustly — to confirm real payout times and consistency.
24/7 Processing Top casinos handle withdrawals automatically, with payments processed round the clock, even on weekends and bank holidays.
Streamlined KYC Verification is essential but shouldn’t delay payouts. The best sites complete KYC quickly during sign-up, preventing unnecessary hold-ups when you withdraw.
How to cash out at an instant withdrawal casino
Most online casinos follow similar withdrawal processes. Below is a step-by-step guide to conducting a withdrawal from an online casino, using BetMGM as an example.
1. Log in to your account and head to the banking or cashier option on your my account page.
2. Select withdraw from the list of options on the banking page.
3. Choose one of the payment options for your withdrawal. For a fast withdrawal, it tends to best to use a method you’ve previously made a deposit from.
4. Enter the amount you wish to take out and click withdraw. You may be presented with a confirmation page. Check all the details are correct before going ahead.
5. Wait for verification. Some fast withdrawal casinos will have a pending withdrawal section where you can check the status of your withdrawal.
Why casino withdrawals can be delayed
Despite the best efforts of fast withdrawal casinos, payment delays can still occur. These tend to be caused by routine checks or human error, rather than technical problems, and can easily be avoided.
Here are some of the reasons payments from a fast withdrawal casino are sometimes delayed:
- Account verification (KYC): UK-licensed casinos must verify a player’s identity before processing withdrawals. If requested documents haven’t been provided and subsequently approved, payments will be held. To avoid any delays, complete the KYC steps during sign-up.
- Payment method alterations: Many casinos require withdrawals to be made using the same method as the deposit, which can slow down the process if an alternative is selected. Try to stick to one method of banking at a casino.
- Active bonus wagering: Any outstanding wagering requirements must be completed before funds can be released. Check the account balance to see if you have any bonus funds if a payment is held.
- Timing of the request: Withdrawals requested late at night, on weekends or on bank holidays may be processed more slowly. Some fast withdrawal casinos do process payments 24/7, but not all of them.
- Large withdrawal amounts: Higher-value payouts are often subject to additional internal checks.
What is KYC verification and how to complete it
KYC stands for Know Your Customer and is used by several industries to verify the identity of a user and manage any risk to the organisation.
Online casinos are required by law to carry out these checks and risk huge fines or losing their license if they don’t implement these measures, which are designed to protect the consumer, guard against money laundering and fraud.
A KYC check is often carried out during registration with an online casino or the first time a punter makes a withdrawal, and if not done correctly, it can nullify the ability of a casino to make an instant payment.
Here’s what you’ll need to make sure your fast withdrawal casino of choice remains able to make quick payments.
- Proof of identity: Casinos may ask for photo ID, such as a passport or UK driving licence, to confirm your identity before allowing withdrawals. They may also ask for you to take a selgie next to your identification document.
- Proof of address: You may need to provide a recent document, like a utility bill or bank statement, to verify your current UK address.
- Age verification: To confirm you’re over 18, casinos may request ID if automatic age checks fail.
- Payment method verification: Online casinos can ask you to verify that the payment method used belongs to you, usually with card images.
- Source of funds/wealth checks: This is likely to apply only if you are betting large amounts, but casinos may ask for evidence of the source of your gambling funds, such as payslips or bank statements.
- Affordability checks: As part of new regulations designed to keep players safe, some UK casino sites carry out risk-based checks to ensure gambling remains affordable, which may involve income checks or open banking (with consent).
Please Gamble Responsibly
Playing at a fast withdrawal casino means you should be able to collect your winnings almost immediately, but it’s just as important to keep gambling safe and balanced.
Whether you prefer betting sites, poker sites, betting apps, or any other types of popular gambling apps, setting personal limits and sticking to them can help you stay in control.
The most reputable instant withdrawal casino sites in the UK offer built-in safety tools, such as deposit caps, cooling-off periods, and full self-exclusion options.
These features make it easier to manage your bankroll, take breaks when needed, and ensure gambling remains fun. Remember not to get too carried away by free bet offers or casino bonuses.
If you start to feel gambling is affecting you negatively, reach out to support services like GamCare or BeGambleAware for confidential help.

The Palestine Action ruling vindicates the courageous – and shames the complicit | Owen Jones

This is a day of humiliation for those who facilitated Israel’s genocide in Gaza – and a moment of vindication for those who stood against “the crime of crimes”. It is worth underlining what the high court in London has today ruled to be unlawful: our government’s decision to place the direct-action group Palestine Action on the same legal footing as al-Qaida and Islamic State. Legally speaking, simply showing support for it risked a jail sentence of up to 14 years. The consequences? More than 2,700 people arrested for holding placards opposing genocide and supporting Palestine Action, many of them elderly, including a retired octogenarian priest.
No one who engages in criminal damage for a political cause imagines they will avoid arrest. As the court ruling makes clear, normal criminal law remains available for such acts. But when a government applies the badge of “terrorism” to movements that, however disorderly, are clearly not terrorist movements, an alarming precedent is set. As the court recognised, the proscription interferes with rights to freedom of expression, to peaceful assembly and free associations with others. You do not need a fevered imagination to see how a future Reform UK government could build on such a precedent. (As things stand, the ban on the group remains in effect so the government has time to appeal.)
The judges’ ruling did argue that Palestine Action’s adoption of direct action goes beyond civil disobedience. That’s because it seeks to damage property – primarily, to destroy equipment belonging to the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems. Well, fine, but then the suffragettes weren’t a civil disobedience movement either. Today, they are secular saints, lauded by some of the same MPs who voted to proscribe Palestine Action, even though their tactics were far more extreme. Let’s not forget, the suffragettes planted bombs, burned down private homes and even killed people.
History’s judgment on that movement is clear: the greater crime was the disenfranchisement of women. Their actions are seen through that prism.
In this case, a UN independent commission, genocide scholars and NGOs ranging from Amnesty International to Médecins Sans Frontières have concluded that Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people. The international criminal court (ICC) – of which the UK is a founding member – long ago issued arrest warrants for Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his former defence minister for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Britain supplies crucial components for Israel’s fighter jets, shares intelligence and permits its citizens to fight in Israel’s army.
In the abstract, how would a reasonable person respond if asked: “If you have strong grounds to conclude that your own government is facilitating genocide – the crime of crimes – should you do whatever it takes to stop it, even if that means breaking the law?” That is undoubtedly a question English juries have wrestled with, because they have repeatedly acquitted Palestine Action activists hauled before the court. No wonder the government wants to curb trial by jury.
Our home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, has declared that she will “fight” the judgment in the court of appeal. It is worth noting that according to his published correspondence with Peter Mandelson, Mahmood’s cabinet colleague Wes Streeting declared last year: “Israel is committing war crimes before our eyes.” Moreover, more than a decade ago, Mahmood was marching against an Israeli onslaught against Gaza which – however horrific – was not anywhere near the scale of the current genocide.
It stretches incredulity to believe that Mahmood does not share Streeting’s conclusion that Israel has committed war crimes, because denying that is like subscribing to flat-Earthism. The British government refuses to state the obvious because that would impose legal obligations on it. For a start, it would not be lawful to supply the crucial components of fighter jets to a state committing war crimes. That’s why the then foreign secretary backtracked last year when he described Israel’s blockade of Gaza as what it is: a violation of international law.
In sum, smashing up the equipment of an Israeli arms manufacturer isn’t lawful – but neither is arming a state committing war crimes, and indeed genocide. Which should we treat as the most serious?
There is one major question to be answered. After Palestine Action vandalised Donald Trump’s Turnberry golf resort in Scotland in March 2025 – before the group was proscribed – the president described them as “terrorists” and expressed hope they would be “treated harshly”. We also know that Trump discussed Palestine Action twice with our prime minister. The contents of that conversation must be revealed to establish whether proscription was discussed.
That only 26 MPs voted against this unlawful legislation tells you everything you need to know about our soulless, cowardly political establishment. But those who have facilitated genocide should begin to panic. The suffragettes, alas, did not have court rulings in their favour at the time, and their cause was – however absurdly – controversial. Women did not receive the vote in full until 1928, and the suffragettes’ canonisation came decades later.
But polling shows that the British public believes Israel’s attack on Gaza was not justified, supports an arms embargo and sanctions against Israel, and supports the arrest of Netanyahu. Polling in the US shows that half of Americans believe Israel has committed genocide, with just over a third disagreeing. That the ICC issued arrest warrants despite colossal western pressure is another sign of where this all leads.
It is obvious that Israel’s genocide will be remembered as one of the great crimes of our age. Those complicit will be damned by history, and may one day find themselves hauled before the courts. Those who were arrested for holding placards will be vindicated as courageous fighters against the worst crime that can possibly exist. Whether Mahmood wins or loses her appeal, that reckoning is coming.

Billboard outside Old Trafford takes aim at Jim Ratcliffe after anti-immigration claim
A billboard praising immigrants has been displayed outside Old Trafford after Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe claimed that the UK had been “colonised” by migrants.
He incorrectly claimed that the UK population had risen by 12 million since 2020 - it has risen by an estimated 2.7 million. He has since apologised for his comments.
On Friday (13 February), British protest group Everybody Hates Elon released a video showing the installation of a poster outside the stadium which read: “Immigrants have done more for this city than billionaire tax dodgers ever will.”
Sir Jim has been living in tax-free Monaco since 2020.

German Chancellor Merz urges US to repair ties with Europe

00:29:15 KST

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged, on Friday, February 13, that a rift had opened up between Europe and the United States but issued an appeal to Washington: "Let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together."
Merz was giving the opening address to the Munich Security Conference, against a backdrop of rapidly worsening ties between Europe and the US. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio was among the top American figures in the audience.
"Let me begin with the uncomfortable truth: A rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States," Merz told the gathering, attended by dozens of leaders, defence chiefs and foreign ministers from around the world. From US President Donald Trump's threats to seize Greenland, to his tariff blitz and his administration's warning that Europe faces "civilisational erasure," transatlantic ties have been dropped to the lowest level in years.
"Vice President JD Vance said this a year ago here in Munich. He was right in his description," he said, referring to a 2025 speech in which Vance also accused Europe of stifling free speech and other democratic rights.
'Change,' 'upheaval' and even 'sacrifice'
The tone of much of his address was dark, as he warned of worsening geopolitical tensions and called on Europe to bolster its defences. "In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone," said the conservative leader, traditionally a staunch supporter of the transatlantic alliance.
Merz warned that, in such an era, freedoms long taken for granted were increasingly "endangered." "This will require us to be prepared for change, for upheaval – and, yes, even for sacrifice."
Merz then struck a more hopeful note, as he called on the US and Europe to forge a "new transatlantic partnership." "Dear friends, being a part of NATO is not only Europe's competitive advantage. It's also the United States's competitive advantage. So let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together," Merz said. "We, the Europeans – we are doing our part."
In a sign of Europe's worries that long-standing US security commitments are in danger under the Trump administration, Merz also said he had held "confidential talks" with French President Emmanuel Macron about nuclear deterrence.
He has previously said he was open to France extending its nuclear deterrent in Europe. Germany, which cannot acquire its own atomic weapons due to treaty obligations, has traditionally relied on the US nuclear umbrella via its participation in NATO.

Trump administration sues Harvard seeking documents on its admission process
The Justice Department clarified that the lawsuit ‘does not accuse Harvard of any discriminatory conduct’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Donald Trump's administration has launched a fresh lawsuit against Harvard University, alleging its failure to cooperate with a federal investigation and demanding documents pertaining to its admissions procedures.
The legal action, filed in a Boston federal court by U.S. Justice Department lawyers, states that the requested documents are crucial for evaluating Harvard's adherence to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that deemed race-conscious college admissions programs unconstitutional.
The Justice Department clarified that the lawsuit was initiated "solely to compel Harvard to produce documents relating to any consideration of race in admission" and "does not accuse Harvard of any discriminatory conduct, nor does it seek monetary damages or the revocation of federal funding." Representatives for Harvard did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Earlier this month, President Trump indicated his administration was pursuing $1 billion from Harvard to resolve inquiries into its policies, following reports that he had rescinded an earlier demand for payment from the Ivy League institution.
Harvard has been a key target in the administration's wider campaign to use federal funding as leverage to enforce changes at US universities, which Trump claims are plagued by antisemitic and "radical left" ideologies.
This campaign has seen the administration cancel hundreds of grants to Harvard researchers, citing the university's alleged failure to adequately address harassment of Jewish students on campus, a move that led Harvard to launch its own lawsuit.
Harvard University sued the Trump administration last year, accusing the White House of violating its free speech rights by freezing federal funding to punish it for its refusal to take action against students for their beliefs.
"The government has not — and cannot — identify any rational connection between antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological and other research it has frozen that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and maintain America's position as a global leader in innovation,” the university said at the time.

Pride Festival in Zurich to charge admission
The Pride Festival in Zurich is to be downsized this year and will now charge admission. This is intended to secure funding after sponsors pulled out.
+Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
“After thorough analysis, we have decided to hold the Zurich Pride Festival 2026 on a smaller, more predictable scale at Turbinenplatz,” the organisers announced on Friday.
A ticket must now be purchased to attend the festival. This should ensure planning security and stabilise liquidity. The measures are intended to make the organisation behind the event financially stable and independent in the long term. Various large companies have recently reduced or cancelled their sponsorship of Pride in Zurich and other cities.
+ Why Zurich cemetery devotes section to LGBTQ community
The measures have not yet been finalised. The association’s members will vote on this at an extraordinary general meeting next week. Within a short space of time, the announcement published on Instagram was met with a number of disappointed and critical responses as well as understanding comments.
The Zurich Pride demonstration is not affected by the measures. The event will take place on June 19-20.

Love on the big stage: Couples star in Broadway's 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King'

Love on the big stage: Couples star in Broadway's 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King'
Rodney Ingram plays the title role of “Aladdin” on Broadway, and he shares the stage with his new wife, Sonia
- Bookmark
This Valentine's Day, Rodney Ingram will be doing what he loves with the one he loves. All on Broadway.
The newlywed plays the title role in Disney's “Aladdin” alongside his wife, Sonia, who covers multiple roles. It's a workplace romance at the pinnacle of musical theater.
“This is so rare,” he says. “This is such a gift and a dream. I couldn’t have thought to have even prayed for it.”
The couple first met in Mexico City on the first day of rehearsal of “Aladdin” in 2021. She joined the Broadway show in 2024, and they were married last December.
Then the call came this winter for Ingram to step into the role of Aladdin permanently. He didn't have to think about it. Plus, his favorite person was there.
“This is her show,” he jokes. “I’m just living in it.”
Love is in the air
The Ingrams aren’t the only couple working together on Broadway. They’re not even the only Disney couple. A few blocks away, Mduduzi Madela and Nteliseng Nkhela are both in “The Lion King.”
“It’s beyond any of my wildest dreams,” says Madela, who was raised in South Africa and has been picked to step into the role of Simba permanently later this month. “My wife is the one who’s the proudest and she’s the very first person to announce it to anyone.”
He joined the Broadway company in 2013, following several years in other productions around the world. She joined the Broadway ensemble in 2010 and understudies Rafiki. They got married in 2021 and have two daughters.
Madela met his future wife at a workshop for “The Lion King” in South Africa in 2003. Their friendship lasted a decade until things took a turn into more serious territory.
Both have been onstage as Simba and Rafiki as their daughters watched in the Minskoff Theatre seats, an astonishingly rare moment. “It’s not a usual phenomenon to see both your parents on the Broadway stage at the same time,” he says, laughing.
How Rodney met Sonia
Back at “Aladdin,” Rodney Ingram's rise to the title role caps a remarkable ascension for a young actor who was raised in the tiny Mexican fishing village of Sayulita and fell in love with DVDs of musicals.
It started with a love of music. Ingram recalls always wanting to sing with the mariachi bands and falling in love with “My Fair Lady” and “Fiddler on the Roof.”
“I just remember imitating them on screen and just watching over and over, becoming kind of obsessed with musicals. That same passion still exists today,” he says.
When it came time to audition for musical theater schools in New York, a rude awakening awaited. “I had no formal training, only the love of the game,” he says.
He found himself competing against trained actors who knew their way around a pirouette. He had never taken a dance class. Ingram faced rejection but vowed to get better.
“I think that motivated me even more. I didn’t get accepted into any musical theater school that first year and I don’t blame them. I wouldn’t have accepted me either,” he says.
After months of training, he tried again and landed a spot at New York's Collaborative Arts Project 21, a professional theater company with a conservatory. This time, he nailed a pirouette.
He credits his parents for always supporting his vision. “They’ve seen ‘Aladdin’ more than most people ought,” he says, laughing.
Mexico and a life partner
After school came regional theater — “Little Mermaid” at the White Plains Performing Arts Center in New York, “Little Women” at Theatre Aspen in Colorado and “Kiss Me Kate” at Gretna Theatre in Pennsylvania.
Ingram made his Broadway debut as an understudy for Aladdin in 2015, a year after he had scored a discounted, same-day ticket for the last row of the balcony to see the show for the first time.
“I thought, ‘Wow, this is incredible, really remarkable.’ But still such a nebulous dream that I could possibly end up there one day,” he recalls.
He spent two years as an understudy, going on maybe 20 or so times. He then played Raoul in “The Phantom of the Opera” for a year and returned to “Aladdin” just as the pandemic shut shows down.
When the world restarted, Ingram was tapped to lead a production in Mexico City, performing the role in Spanish from 2021-23. “Aladdin” would change his life again.
“I got to meet my wife on the very first day of rehearsal. We started off as friends,” he says. “I had no idea, obviously, that we’d get married four or so years later.”
The couple endured a long-distance relationship when she joined the “Aladdin” North American tour. “She said, ‘It’s going to be OK, honey. It’s not like I’m going to Alaska.’ And I look at her schedule and I’m like, ‘I think you are going to Alaska.’”
Now they take the subway to work together, on the same schedule, in the same city and in the same show.
“We’re exactly where we’re supposed to be right now,” he says.

Peter Murrell accused of embezzling £459,000 from SNP, court papers show

The former chief executive of the Scottish National party (SNP) Peter Murrell has been accused of embezzling £459,000 from the party over a period of more than 12 years, according to court documents that emerged ahead of a hearing.
Murrell, the ex-husband of the former first minister and party leader Nicola Sturgeon, is due to appear at the high court in Glasgow next Friday for a preliminary hearing in the case.
Details of the charges, which accuse Murrell of embezzling £459,046.49 of party funds between 12 August 2010 and 13 January 2023, and illicitly purchasing items including luxury goods, jewellery, cosmetics, two cars and a motorhome, were first published in the Scottish Sun.
According to documents seen by the newspaper, Murrell bought a Niesmann and Bischoff Smove 7.4e motorhome at a cost of £124,550 for his own personal use from a dealer in Stafford using SNP funds.
He is also accused of creating “false” sales documents “in order to portray the purchase as a legitimate party expense” in the court papers.
He is further accused of using £57,500 of SNP money towards the purchase of an £81,000 Jaguar I-Pace car in 2019.
Further allegations include that Murrell made “false invoices” for a £12,042 payment to Apple Retail and £2,478 to the German retailer Manufactum, both for “purported business related” purchases. He is also accused of using SNP funds to pay a parking ticket, according to the documents seen by the Sun.
Murrell, who served as the party’s chief executive for 22 years, made no plea during an initial appearance at Edinburgh sheriff court last year after which he was granted bail.
He was arrested in 2023 as part of Operation Branchform, the Police Scotland investigation into SNP finances, and charged with embezzlement in April 2024. Sturgeon was also arrested and questioned by Police Scotland detectives in June 2023 as part of Operation Branchform, but later exonerated.
In her memoir Frankly, published last August, Sturgeon described her “utter disbelief” when police raided her home in Glasgow and arrested Murrell. “With police tents all around it, it looked more like a murder scene than the place of safety it had always been for me. I was devastated, mortified, confused and terrified.”

Music Review: A post-'Brat' Charli xcx broods on the 'Wuthering Heights' soundtrack

Charli xcx review, Wuthering Heights – A spectacular, phantasmagorical fever dream
On her wild, gothic soundtrack album, the pop star proves herself much more in tune with the terrible complexity of Emily Brontë’s original vision than film director Emerald Fennell
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
“Put my flesh upon the cross until I scream,” intones a dry-throated Charli xcx on Wuthering Heights. Her atmospheric soundtrack to Emerald Fennell’s new film leans hard, at times, into the script’s BDSM vibe. But while the big, lavish gloss of Fennell’s visual narrative slip-slides (often comically) around on the surface of the story, the grimy friction of Charli’s music claws its way back through the centuries to disinter Cathy and Heathcliff’s dark, damaged hearts. This is a record that conjures history in its use of violin, cello and double bass, but drags the strings’ horsehair romance violently into modernity over cold, muddy beds of industrial electronica.
In interviews, the artist born Charlotte Aitchison says she was touring her all-conquering, messy party album Brat in 2024 when she got a text from Fennell asking if she’d be interested in creating a soundtrack (she’d already composed original music for Emma Seligman’s 2023 dark comedy Bottoms). Exhausted from performing Brat’s erratic hyperpop, she found herself moving in the “opposite” direction with Wuthering Heights. Working with Finn Keane (who also co-produced Brat) Charli luxuriates in dreamier sonic territory, swapping the garish neons of her last album for gritty, pixelated shades of grey. There are nods to the layered grind of Nineties bands such as Nine Inch Nails and the aching, Sixties drawl-drone of The Velvet Underground.
Charli scored a coup by coaxing former Velvet, John Cale, to appear on the tremendous single “House”. Like Nellie Dean, the elderly housekeeper who unreliably narrates most of Emily Brontë’s novel, the 82-year-old Cale’s weathered vocal adds a sense of deeper time (Brontë was always reaching back – her mid-19th century novel was set in the late 18th century), along with a reminder that passion and creativity doesn’t necessarily fade with age. Over the ragged, repeated snag of a violin bow, Cale speaks with haunting formality: “Can I speak to you privately for a moment?/ I just want to explain/ Explain the circumstances I find myself in/ What and who I really am/ I’m a prisoner, to live for eternity…” Towards the close, Charli balances his measured tone with a long, corrosive howl.
That howl echoes through the album, even as Charli switches to a low, guttural mutter on songs such as “Wall of Sound”. Here, she invokes “unbelievable tension... unbelievable pressure” that builds over loops of thwarted yearning; it escalates to a clubbable pace on “Dying for You” with its breathless revelations, “All the pain and torture that I went through all makes sense to me now/ I was dying for you.” The wild beauty of the misty moors gleams through “Always Everywhere” with a melody that scales the hills, while “Seeing Things” deals in madness and visions over punchy, sawing violins. The spectacular “Chains of Love” writhes around in the anguish of obsessive love: “I’d rather lay down in thorns/ I’d rather drown in a stream/ I’d rather light myself on fire/ I’d rather wear all these scars/ I’d rather watch my skin bleed…”
The whole thing is a phantasmagorical fever dream that relishes its weird and experimental noises without sacrificing cool hooks or accessible language. Charli proves herself much more in tune with the terrible complexity of Brontë’s original vision than Fennell: there are no inverted commas around the emotion expressed on this record. A windswept, gothic triumph.

GENEVA, February 13. /TASS/. Switzerland, as the host country, will organize trilateral talks between Russia, the US, and Ukraine in Geneva on February 17-18, the Foreign Ministry confirmed to TASS.
"The Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA) remains in contact with all parties and has consistently offered its good offices, an offer that was recently reiterated during exchanges held last week in Kiev and Moscow. In this context, Switzerland, in its capacity as host state, will host trilateral talks in Geneva on Tuesday and Wednesday between Russia, Ukraine and the United States," Spokesman Jonas Montani told TASS.
Earlier, Russian presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov announced the date and venue of the new round of talks between Russia, the US, and Ukraine. According to him, the Russian delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky.
The first round of trilateral security consultations between Russia, the US and Ukraine took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating team was led by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces General Staff. The second round was held in the UAE capital on February 4-5. Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that Moscow was maintaining a "polite silence" on the contacts in Abu Dhabi, as results-oriented talks prefer silence.

Warning as major shortage of painkiller used by millions could last until summer
The National Pharmacy Association (NPA) has warned the shortage could last until at least June
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
UK pharmacies are currently facing a significant shortage of certain strengths of the painkiller co-codamol, a disruption that could extend until at least the end of June.
The National Pharmacy Association (NPA), which represents approximately 6,000 independent community pharmacies, has highlighted widespread difficulties in obtaining 30mg and 500mg tablets, leading to a knock-on effect on other dosages.
According to the NPA, some suppliers have indicated to pharmacists that these supply issues are unlikely to be resolved before late June. Olivier Picard, chair of the NPA, confirmed: "Pharmacies are telling us they have struggled to order in supplies of some strengths of co-codamol, with a number reporting that supply disruption will last at least until June."
"This is deeply distressing for patients living with severe pain, and pharmacists are working tirelessly to find safe alternatives or manage very limited stock."
Co-codamol is a commonly prescribed painkiller which comprises a mix of paracetamol and codeine.
It is used to treat a wide range of pain, such as toothache, period pain and muscle pain.
According to NHS figures, some 1.25 million items a month of co-codamol were prescribed to patients in 2025.
Mr Picard added: "Where pharmacies have supplies, they will be doing all they can to manage them to ensure patients get the medication they need.
"We face ever growing issues with medicine supplies which are compounded by the NHS not funding the full cost pharmacies have to pay to get the medicines patients need.
"The Government must urgently act to address a growing list of medicine shortages impacting patients and pharmacists alike, who end up at the sharp end of an increasingly difficult medicine supply system."

I’m Harry Bullmore, a fitness coach and The Independent’s senior fitness writer.
Having spent my days interviewing experts, reading the latest research, and coaching in person, I can’t help but feel that fitness has been overcomplicated – and it’s getting a tad overwhelming.
Social media nudges us towards expensive supplements when a good night’s sleep would do the job better; it encourages us to invest in pricey exercise equipment when a cut-price dumbbell might suffice; fortified foods promise benefits better gained from a hearty home-cooked meal.
My aim is to strip all that back and provide Independent readers with accessible, affordable, actionable, evidence-based health tips. The goal? To help you build a body that’s fit for life – without compromising on the “life” part.
That’s the thinking behind Well Enough, a newsletter delivered straight from my noggin to your inbox each Sunday.
Each edition is a digestible collection of insights from my daily chats with expert coaches, leading exercise researchers, and athletes – whether it’s the benefits of a post-meal meander for blood sugar regulation or desk stretches that fend off tight hips. Everything is carefully curated to be genuinely useful, without demanding too much from you.
Along the way, I’ll point you toward a handful of deeper reads worth your time, fitness ideas you can realistically squeeze into your week, small food, movement, and mindset habits that add up to real health gains, and the odd budget-friendly product that’s earned its place in my routine.
Health and fitness isn’t about perfection – it’s about finding an approach that works for you and sticking with it. My aim is for readers to start every week feeling a little more informed – and a little less overwhelmed.
Hopefully, l can help you do just that.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. The Board of Peace is currently focused on the Gaza Strip but it is flexible enough to also address other global challenges, US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Michael Waltz said.
"The Board of Peace is absolutely focused on Gaza. I think you will see that in the meeting next week, but in the formation and its founding documents, the team wanted to leave flexibility to be able to tackle other problems," he pointed out at the Munich Security Conference.
On January 22, 19 countries signed the Charter of the Board of Peace on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The body was created as part of efforts to resolve the situation in the Gaza Strip. The Board of Peace was established based on an agreement between Israel and the radical Palestinian movement Hamas to govern the Gaza Strip, but it is also supposed to prevent and settle conflicts in other regions.

Iran announces enquiry team to investigate deadly protests
The Iranian government announced on Friday the establishment of a commission of enquiry to look into protests against the high cost of living that turned into anti-government rallies that left thousands dead.
"A fact-finding committee has been formed with representatives from relevant institutions and is collecting documents and hearing statements," Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told the local news agency ISNA.
The spokeswoman did not specify whether the commission would only focus on the economic demands that triggered the protests, or whether it would also investigate deaths during the protests.
"The final report will be published for public information and further legal action after the process is completed," she stated.
On Thursday, the government website published comments by President Masoud Pezeskhian saying "We have assigned teams to investigate the causes (of the unrest)", without providing further details.
The protests, which began in late December before escalating on 8 January, left more than 3,000 dead, according to the official count.
Iranian authorities claim that the vast majority of victims were security forces or bystanders killed by "terrorists" working for Israel and the United States.
Human rights advocacy groups based outside Iran, however, accuse the security forces of targeting protesters.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reports that at least 7,005 people were killed during the peak of the protests.
"We are ashamed that such unfortunate events have occurred," Pezeshkian said, according to the report published on the government website.

What does BNP’s landslide mean for Bangladesh’s post-uprising order?

What does BNP’s landslide mean for Bangladesh’s post-uprising order?
The victorious BNP was sceptical of constitutional reforms outlined in July Charter – now it must implement them.
Dhaka, Bangladesh – Bangladesh’s February 12 election has delivered a landslide victory for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), which will now form the first elected government since the July 2024 mass uprising that toppled former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League party.
While the election, from which the former governing Awami League was banned, has been viewed as something of a litmus test for political change in Bangladesh, observers say the overwhelming election of the BNP, one of just two parties which have held power continuously since independence in 1971, shows Bangladeshis may prefer to stick with what they know.
On Friday, the Election Commission released unofficial results showing the BNP winning 209 seats out of 297 already announced; Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami with 68; the National Citizen Party (NCP) with six; smaller parties, a handful of seats; and independents with seven seats.
In all, 299 of the 300 elected seats in parliament were up for grabs in this election. Turnout was about 60 percent.
Registered voters also voted in a referendum to approve constitutional reforms, with just more than 60 percent voting “yes” for the July National Charter outlining those reforms.
Final official results are still pending, but Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, BNP’s secretary-general, hailed the sweeping election victory as evidence that the BNP is “a party of the people”. The party expects to form a government on Sunday.
On Friday night, Jamaat-e-Islami, the BNP’s main opponent in this election, had yet to concede defeat, saying it was not “satisfied” with the vote count and raising “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.
Analysts fear this may signal a return to the confrontational politics of the past in Bangladesh.
A vote for familiarity, experience
Asif Mohammad Shahan, professor of development studies at Dhaka University, said the result showed most people would rather opt to have a known political group in power at times of uncertainty.
“Voters choosing BNP means they ultimately chose a familiar political force. They appeared to prefer a party whose governing experience they already knew, despite reservations about some of its past practices,” he told Al Jazeera.
Ultimately, the result indicates that the people of Bangladesh have chosen to revert to institutional politics following the turbulence of 2024 rather than embrace any sort of ideological shift as represented by the student-led National Citizen Party, which joined forces with Jamaat to contest this election.
Political historian Mohiuddin Ahmad told Al Jazeera that this election was almost a “repetition of the 2001 election” when the BNP surged in popularity and won 193 parliament seats, ahead of the previously governing Awami League, which secured just 62.
The real litmus test, now, he said, will be to see how well the opposing parties cooperate in the new parliament. “Parliamentary democracy becomes successful through cooperation between the treasury bench and the opposition bench,” he told Al Jazeera.
But can Bangladesh steer away from the confrontational politics of the past?
Two competing mandates
Political reform is far from off the agenda, however, and this may ultimately be what drags the nation back to those bad old days, experts say.
On Thursday, Bangladesh also held a referendum on the July National Charter, a blueprint for constitutional reforms emerging from the 2024 uprising and aimed at restructuring the state’s governance architecture. It has been overseen by a caretaker government in place since the ousting of Hasina.
The charter proposes a new two-chamber parliament, new procedures for appointing constitutional bodies such as the Election Commission, and strengthening institutional checks to reduce winner-takes-all executive dominance.
It also outlines broader constitutional reforms, including expanded fundamental rights and limits on unilateral constitutional amendments.
With approximately 60 percent voting “yes” to it on Thursday, the referendum creates a parallel reform mandate alongside BNP’s parliamentary majority.
These two mandates may not fully align, Shahan said.
The BNP was sceptical about the July National Charter referendum for months during the transitional government, at times signalling a “no”, until party chief Tarique Rahman publicly endorsed a “yes” vote on January 30 – something the main opposition Jamaat alliance was eager to point out during campaigning.
Therefore, “the BNP’s manifesto, to a large extent, conflicts with the July Charter”, Shahan pointed out.
During campaigning, the BNP pledged to back the implementation of the charter if voters approved it in the referendum. But Ahmad noted that the BNP’s earlier dissent on parts of the charter means the party may not feel obligated to implement every single reform in it.
In particular, the BNP may be opposed to proposals for proportional representation and the new design of an upper house, which, it has argued, could dilute large parliamentary majorities under the current electoral system.
The scale of its election win indicates that the public expects the BNP will uphold its campaign pledges, particularly on corruption and institutional reform. Therefore, any decision not to pursue specific reforms will require public explanation, Ahmed said.
But the sheer size of the BNP’s majority could make it easier to proceed unchallenged by a weak opposition.
“Those who come with a majority naturally have much greater capacity to work on policy implementation and reform,” political analyst Dilara Choudhury said. But such dominance in parliament also means less accountability.
Shahan warned, “There is a serious concern that, based on political costs, we could return to confrontational politics again.”
The Awami League factor
The landslide result also reshapes Bangladesh’s party system at a time when the Awami League is absent. Following Hasina’s brutal crackdown on protesters in July 2024, which killed about 1,400 people, the Awami League was banned from standing in this election.
Some observers have criticised this move, saying it would have been more credible to allow voters to reject the party through democratic means by refusing to vote for it.
As Bangladesh politics were previously dominated by the BNP and Awami League, its absence has also created the possibility of an asymmetrical political field dominated, now, by a single major party, analysts say.
The results of this election appear to show that this may be true.
The BNP has limited incentive to facilitate the Awami League’s return to political life, Shahan noted. But he cautioned that a failure to deliver reforms or effective governance could reopen space for the Awami League’s revival if voters become disillusioned with both traditional and reformist actors.
For now, according to Shahan, post-election stability will depend on two factors: whether opposition parties accept the results and participate constructively in parliament, and whether the BNP uses its strong mandate to pursue inclusive reforms rather than majoritarian consolidation.
A diplomatic balancing act
The landslide result places the BNP at the centre of both domestic restructuring and regional realignment in the wake of the 2024 uprising, said Shahab Enam Khan, geopolitical analyst and professor of international relations at Jahangirnagar University in Dhaka.
This election will have “immediate implications” for the region, he added.
Particularly, Bangladesh’s relationship with India, where Hasina remains in exile, much to the anger of many in Bangladesh who would like to see her extradited to face the death penalty handed to her by the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh in November last year, for ordering her forces to fire on protesters in 2024.
“The Sheikh Hasina factor will always remain … extradition will remain an agenda, but in reality it may not happen given her relationship with political circles in Delhi,” Khan said.
“This will be a government which will receive unprecedented support from all the global powers, including the regional neighbours,” Khan told Al Jazeera. The United States is likely to continue its engagement initiated under the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, while China will remain a key partner given its market-oriented approach to Bangladesh, regardless of which party is in power.
As a result, relations with India – warm under Hasina’s rule – could become more transactional. “[Bangladesh’s] foreign policy will be very confident and that will make Bangladesh–India relationship much more transactional … BNP will look forward to much greater cooperation from Delhi based on reciprocity,” he said.
On Pakistan, he noted, “Islamabad will continue to have a good relationship with Dhaka because historically it had a good relationship with both BNP and Jamaat … we will see trade and investment ties improving and possibly some security cooperation.”
But balancing ties with India, China, the United States and Pakistan simultaneously may pose diplomatic challenges.
“Delhi would always be suspicious about Islamabad’s engagement and the US will always have concerns about Beijing’s engagement,” he said.
Ultimately, however, Khan said internal stability for Bangladesh will depend less on geopolitics than on governance.
“Instability can come from many corners – lack of reform delivery, weak economic performance and inflation,” he said. The evolving relationship between BNP and opposition forces, particularly Jamaat, is an unknown variable.
Above all, Bangladeshi politics must not return to the old style of repression over debate.
“If BNP resorts to the same policies that Awami League has … cracking down on the public when it comes to criticism of foreign policy … that will be massively disastrous,” he said, adding that foreign policy toward India and Pakistan “will be heavily monitored by the public”.
Whether the new government embraces a reformed constitutional order or reverts to majoritarian governance will depend on how it balances its parliamentary dominance, the July Charter reform mandate, and rising geopolitical expectations.
The election has settled the question of power; the durability of Bangladesh’s post-uprising political order will hinge on how that power is exercised.

Teen writes chilling note admitting to killing his mom and stuffing her in a trash can, cops say
Isaac Gideon Tracy, 17, called 911 and said he wanted to get himself arrested ‘because he killed his mom’
- Bookmark
A North Carolina teenager allegedly left behind a chilling handwritten confession note after fatally stabbing his mother and stuffing her body inside a trash container in their garage, according to newly released court records.
Isaac Gideon Tracy, 17, a sophomore at Jack Britt High School, is charged as an adult with first-degree murder in the death of his mother, Katharine Svaldi, 49, the Fayetteville Police Department announced.
The brutal killing was reported shortly after 7 p.m. Tuesday at the family’s home in the 1900 block of Daphne Circle in the Arran Lake neighborhood of Fayetteville, police said.
An affidavit obtained by The Fayetteville Observer revealed disturbing details of the crime. It stated that Tracy's grandparent called 911 after he confessed to killing his mother.
Around the same time, Tracy also called 911 himself and told a dispatcher that “he wanted to get himself arrested because he killed his mom,” according to the affidavit.
When officers arrived, they found Svaldi’s body partially inside a recycling container in the garage. Police also observed Tracy with blood on his clothes and injuries described as self-inflicted, the affidavit said.
Police searched his home and found a handwritten note on the kitchen table, allegedly written by Tracy, “detailing why he committed the crime,” according to the affidavit. Authorities did not disclose the contents of the letter.
Neighbors told ABC11 that they were stunned by the violence in the normally quiet community.
“Can you imagine… to kill your mom. That’s very sad,” Diana Konitzer said, adding that she was “very shocked” and that she had “never heard like this in my neighborhood.”
Kirsten, a close friend of Svaldi, told ABC11 that she was heartbroken over the mom’s death.
“When I finally found out that it was her, devastated, heartbroken, you know, nobody deserves to lose their life like that at anybody’s hands,” she said.
She recalled a favorite memory they shared together.
“The one memory I have of her. We got to go to a Beauty and Beast prom,” she said. “So we dressed up and danced and just had the best time.”
Kirsten said she “hurts for her family, and I hurt for her son,” adding that she hopes the public will not rush to judgment.
“I just want people to not judge,” she said. “We don’t know where anyone or any family is going through, and to speculate on what either one of them could have been, is not needed.”
Because of the severity of the charge and his age, Tracy is being prosecuted as an adult under North Carolina law, which requires 16- and 17-year-olds accused of certain serious felonies to begin in adult court, where records are public.
He remains in custody without bond.

Prosecutor’s Office Asks Russian Supreme Court to Designate Anti-War Committee as Terrorist Organization

Prosecutors in Moscow have asked Russia’s Supreme Court to designate the Russian Anti-War Committee as a terrorist organization, state media reported Friday.
Founded shortly after the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Anti-War Committee is made up of prominent opposition figures living in exile, including former Yukos CEO Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chess champion Garry Kasparov and economist Sergei Guriev.
Its stated mission is to coordinate efforts, support anti-war Russians and create a space for solidarity, action, and mutual assistance for people who oppose the war against Ukraine.
Russian authorities labeled the Anti-War Committee an “undesirable” organization in January 2024, putting its members at risk of imprisonment and criminalizing any engagement with the group, including sharing its content online.
The Supreme Court said it would consider the request to slap the organization with the more severe terrorist designation behind closed doors.
In October, the FSB security service announced terrorism charges against 23 members of the Anti-War Committee.
Authorities accuse its members of financing paramilitary units fighting on the side of Ukraine and of plotting to overthrow the Russian government.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.

Thailand puts elephants on birth control as populations are 'squeezed out' of their natural habitat

In a bid to prevent human confrontations, which can turn deadly, Thailand is administering birth control vaccines to wild elephants.
Thailand is using a birth control vaccine on elephants in the wild to try and curb a growing problem where human and animal populations encroach on each other.
It's an issue in areas where farms spread into forests, meaning elephants are squeezed out of their natural habitat.
The initiative is part of efforts to address confrontations that can turn deadly. As farmers cut down forests to make more farmland, elephants are forced to venture out of their shrinking habitats in search of food.
Last year, wild elephants killed 30 people and injured 29 in Thailand, according to official figures, which also noted more than 2,000 incidents of elephants damaging crops.
Sukhee Boonsang, director of the Wildlife Conservation Office, recently told news agency AP that controlling the wild elephant population has become necessary as numbers of elephants living near residential areas rises sharply, increasing the risk of confrontations.
Thailand's elephant issue: Is birth control the solution?
The office obtained 25 doses of a US-made vaccine and conducted a two-year trial on seven domesticated elephants - using up seven doses of the vaccine - which yielded promising results. Boonsang says that the vaccine doesn’t stop female elephants from ovulating but prevents eggs from being fertilised.
Then, in late January, the vaccine was administered to three wild elephants in eastern Trat province, he explains, adding that authorities are now determining which areas to target next as they prepare to use up the remaining 15 doses.
The vaccine can prevent pregnancy for seven years and the elephants will be able to reproduce again if they don’t receive a booster after that time expires. Experts will closely monitor the vaccinated elephants throughout the seven-year period.
'Undermining' conservation efforts
The vaccination drive has drawn criticism that it might undermine conservation efforts.
Thailand has a centuries-old tradition of using domesticated elephants in farming and transportation. Elephants are also a big part of Thailand’s national identity and have been officially proclaimed a symbol of the nation.
Boonsang says that the programme only targets wild elephants in areas with the highest rates of violent human-elephant conflict. Official statistics show a birth rate of wild elephants in these regions at approximately 8.2 per cent per year, more than double the national average of around 3.5 per cent.
It is believed that around 800 out of the nation’s approximately 4,400 wild elephants live in these conflict-prone areas.
“If we don’t take action, the impact on people living in these areas will continue to grow until it becomes unmanageable,” Boonsang says.
Reducing elephant-human conflict
In addition to the contraception vaccine, authorities are said to be implementing other measures to reduce conflict, such as creating additional water and food sources within the forests where elephants live, constructing protective fencing, and deploying rangers to guide elephants that stray into residential areas back into the wild.
A court-ordered operation earlier this month to remove wild elephants that have repeatedly clashed with locals in northeastern Khon Kaen province sparked a public outcry after one elephant died during the relocation process.
An initial autopsy revealed that the elephant died from choking after anaesthesia was administered ahead of the move, officials said.
The Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation carried out the relocation effort, and its director general, Athapol Charoenshunsa, expressed regret over the incident while insisting that protocol was followed properly. He said an investigation was underway to prevent such incidents from happening again.

Beijing pastry shop overrun by shoppers after Xi Jinping’s visit

A Beijing pastry shop visited by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, on a lunar new year tour this week has been swarmed by customers hoping to get their hands on Xi-approved sweet treats.
Traffic was brought to a standstill in Beijing’s capital as the president took a tour around the city on Monday and Tuesday.
As well as visiting technology parks and business leaders, Xi dropped by a Chinese new year market in central Beijing’s Dongcheng district. The nine-day celebrations, the biggest holiday in China’s calendar, officially start on Sunday.
While at the festive market, Xi picked up a 45 yuan (£4.79) bundle of delicacies from Daoxiangcun, a historic bakery known for its traditional snacks.
According to the shopkeeper interviewed by Chinese media, Xi plumped for three items: honey-glazed dough twists, cream-filled dough twists and jujube flower pastries, a flakey, flower-shaped cookie with a filling made from red dates. Dough twists are made from fried pastry and are a popular local snack in Beijing.
The shop has since been overrun by shoppers keen to get a slice of the Xi-approved pies.
One customer, Zhao, bought 16 bags of the snacks, which are now being pre-packaged into Xi-themed triples. She told a reporter: “These are the same new year’s goods recommended by the general secretary, and people really like them. I want to buy some to give to my friends.”
Xi is the general secretary of the Chinese Communist party (CCP), as well as being China’s president and the commander of the armed forces.
Daoxiangcun said its stores had to restock pastries to accommodate hungry and patriotic customers.
Xi also visited a store called Yili Bakery and bought a 14 yuan loaf of fruit bread. He reportedly said that he had enjoyed Yili’s butter rolls as a child in Beijing’s hutongs, the traditional alleyways that crisscross the capital’s historic centre.
Xi’s personal tastes have often inspired imitations. In 2022, there was a viral trend among young people on social media of wearing “office and bureau style clothes”, ie the plain attire of a CCP bureaucrat, a tongue-in-cheek homage to the CCP’s highest-ranking cadre, the general secretary.

Meta plans to add facial recognition software to its glasses despite security and privacy concerns
Leaked memo suggests the company is well aware of the potential pitfalls of introducing controversial technology. Meta says it’s still “thinking through the options”

Meta is looking to add facial recognition software to its smart glasses despite concerns about security and privacy, a report claims.
The “Name Tag” feature would provide glasses wearers with identifying details of the people they are looking at, according to the New York Times.
But an internal memo seen by the newspaper acknowledged the technology carries “safety and privacy risks.”
Furthermore, the company appears to see an upside in releasing a potentially controversial product during the ongoing political turmoil in the U.S., The Times adds.
“We will launch during a dynamic political environment where many civil society groups that we would expect to attack us would have their resources focused on other concerns,” the leaked memo says, per the newspaper.
In recent months, facial recognition technology has been used by Immigration Customs Enforcement (ICE) to track down not only suspected undocumented migrants but also American citizens protesting against ICE.
A Meta spokesperson told The Independent the company was still looking into the technology and considering its options.
“We’re building products that help millions of people connect and enrich their lives,” a statement said.
“While we frequently hear about the interest in this type of feature — and some products already exist in the market — we’re still thinking through options and will take a thoughtful approach if and before we roll anything out.”
The move comes five years after Facebook removed facial recognition from its site , in a bid to find the “right balance” of privacy and legality on the social network.
Since then, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg has aligned himself to President Donald Trump’s White House which has been friendly to big-tech and little regulation.
Meta came out with its first Ray-Ban smart glasses in 2021, but at the time they could only take photos and record videos. The CEO and Facebook founder unveiled new glasses powered by AI last September.
The glasses have proven to be a popular product selling approximately seven million pairs in the past year.
According to three people involved in making the glasses who spoke to The Times, the facial recognition component would differentiate Meta’s product from smart glasses being produced by competitor Open-AI.
But Nathan Freed Wessler of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned that facial recognition is “ripe for abuse”.
“Face recognition technology on the streets of America poses a uniquely dire threat to the practical anonymity we all rely on,” he said.

Five more children abducted by Russia return to Ukraine
According to Ukrinform, Ukraine's Parliamentary Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said this on Telegram.
"Five Ukrainian children have returned from the temporarily occupied territories and from Russia – and each return is a small, yet at the same time great, victory for Ukraine," he said.
According to Lubinets, this was made possible thanks to the active efforts of the Ombudsman's Office as part of the president's Bring Kids Back UA initiative. The non-governmental organization Save Ukraine also joined the process.
The ombudsman thanked them for their support.
Lubinets also expressed gratitude to U.S. First Lady Melania Trump for humanitarian support for Ukraine's initiatives aimed at returning children.
"Thanks to our persistent work, children aged 4 to 15 are back home," he said.
According to Lubinets, one of the returned children, a seven-year-old boy, had been in the Kherson Baby Home, from where Russian forces deported him during the occupation of the city. His mother fought to have her child returned and appealed to the Ombudsman's Office. Now the closest people in his life are together again.
A similar separation, Lubinets said, was experienced by a four-year-old brother and his six-year-old sister. They were also abducted by Russian forces from the Kherson Baby Home. The children spent four years in deportation and did not see their mother during that time.
"The woman last hugged her children when they were essentially still infants. Today, they are together again," he said.
Lubinets also shared another story involving a nine-year-old boy: the child and his mother ended up in Russia, where the woman died of a serious illness. At first, the boy's grandfather tried to take him back but was unsuccessful.
"Today, the boy will be reunited with another close relative – his uncle," Lubinets said.
"These stories show that a childhood that should have been filled with fairy tales and warmth became a test of endurance. But now it is not only about pain. It is about return. About the first embrace after long years of separation," Lubinets said.
Overall, since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, 1,985 children have already been returned, Lubinets said.
"And as long as at least one Ukrainian child remains far from home, we will continue fighting for them," he said.
The Ombudsman's Office is directly involved in a number of processes related to returning children – from communicating with relatives to personally meeting minors at the border.
Lubinets also posted a video on Telegram in which a boy who was returned from deportation today and had not seen his family for almost four years says: "The flag looks good on me!"

UNRWA chief says Gaza remains in 'daily struggle' amid mounting pressure on agency
Philippe Lazzarini warns of desperate humanitarian conditions, political efforts to weaken UNRWA, and 'silent war' intensifying in West Bank
MUNICH
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees warned on Friday that humanitarian conditions in Gaza remain dire and political and operational pressure on his organization is intensifying, while violence and settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank risk further undermining prospects for peace.
Speaking to Anadolu on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini said people in Gaza continue to live in survival mode despite ongoing aid efforts.
"It's true that the situation in Gaza is still desperate, that beside food, people lack almost everything and are still in a survival mode. It's a daily struggle for the people in Gaza," he said.
He stressed that beyond emergency relief, maintaining basic public services in the war-battered enclave is critical, particularly education.
"When it comes to an agency like UNRWA, it is absolutely key that we continue to provide public health services, that we continue to provide education, primary, secondary," he said. "I think education has to become a top priority for the international community, because the children have been out of school for more than two years."
Calling schooling essential for long-term stability, he described education as "a key for a better future" for the Palestinians.
Lazzarini said the agency itself is facing mounting constraints, including political and legal challenges.
UNRWA under 'intense pressure'
Philippe Lazzarini warns of desperate humanitarian conditions, political efforts to weaken UNRWA, and 'silent war' intensifying in West BankStressing that the agency is "under intense pressure," Lazzarini said: "We have seen outrageous violation of international law. We have seen the destruction which is symbolic, but while it has been very violent, of the headquarters in occupied East Jerusalem, which also is perceived as a desire to annihilate any memory of the Palestinian refugee identity in East Jerusalem.”
He added that there is "political pressure to get rid of the agency, because the main political motivation is to strip the Palestinian from the refugee status."
Despite this, he said UNRWA, which Israel banned from operating starting January 2025, is determined to continue operating.
"We have to push back and focusing all our efforts to make sure that we continue to have the space so that we can deliver for the people in Gaza," he said.
Looking ahead, he urged that needs of Palestinians remain central in any post-war planning.
"It is time that in any, I would say, discussion about the future of Gaza, or future peace plan that will put the interest of the Gaza, the interest of the Palestinian, at the center of any of our decisions."
'Silent war' in West Bank
Turning to the West Bank, Lazzarini warned that rising settlement activity and violence are being overlooked amid the focus on Gaza.
"The West Bank is a silent war which has been overshadowed by Gaza," he said.
He lamented the acceleration of illegal settlement activities, as well as the increase of settler violence.
"It has been unabated," he said, describing the situation as "total impunity."
"People are living in an atmosphere ... of fear, and it is time that our attention also we brought into the West Bank before it is too late, before the situation has completely undermined the future of a two-state solution.”

Israeli settlers injure at least 54 Palestinians in West Bank attacks
Latest attacks come amid a widely condemned Israeli push to cement control over the occupied Palestinian territory.
Dozens of Palestinians have been injured as Israeli settlers carried out a wave of attacks across the occupied West Bank, destroying olive trees and vandalising property.
At least 54 Palestinians were wounded on Friday morning as settlers attacked several towns and villages under the protection of the Israeli military.

Settlers assaulted Palestinian farmers on their lands near Talfit, a village south of Nablus in the northern West Bank, and Israeli troops fired tear gas and live ammunition at residents who tried to repel the settler attack.
Images from the village showed homes with broken windows and vehicles with smashed windshields as a result of the attack.
Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli settlers also destroyed about 300 Palestinian olive trees near the Ramallah-area town of Turmus Aya, the Wafa news agency reported, citing local sources.
Palestinians across the West Bank have faced an intensified surge in Israeli military and settler violence in the shadow of Israel’s genocidal war against Palestinians in Gaza.
At least 1,054 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank by Israeli troops and settlers between October 7, 2023, and February 5 of this year, according to the latest United Nations figures.
Israel has also forcibly displaced tens of thousands of Palestinians from their homes across the West Bank, refusing to allow them to return in what Human Rights Watch says amounts to war crimes and a crime against humanity.
The Israeli government drew international condemnation this week after it approved plans to extend its authority over more of the West Bank – a move that observers denounced as de facto annexation, in violation of international law.
“If these decisions are implemented, they will undoubtedly accelerate the dispossession of Palestinians and their forcible transfer, and lead to the creation of more illegal Israeli settlements,” UN human rights chief Volker Turk said on Wednesday.
“We are witnessing rapid steps to change permanently the demography of the occupied Palestinian territory, stripping its people of their lands and forcing them to leave,” Turk said in a statement.
“This is supported by rhetoric and actions by senior Israeli officials, and violates Israel’s obligation as an occupying power to preserve the existing legal order and social fabric. These decisions must be overturned.”

World Rowing rules to allow Russians to compete as neutrals in multiple disciplines

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The World Rowing Executive Committee ruled to allow Russian and Belarusian athletes to participate in international competitions in double-sculls and 8+plus under a neutral status, the press office of the Russian Rowing Federation (RRF) said in a statement on Friday.
"The extended list of disciplines and tournaments that Russian rowers will be able to compete at proves that we are moving in the right direction and even the most stubborn [sports] federations can return Russian athletes back to international tournaments without any restrictions whatsoever," the RRF statement reads.
"We also carry on with our dialogue and expect a result here as well regarding the implementation of the IOC recommendations to reinstate Russian amateur athletes without any restrictions at all," the statement added.
IOC sanctions against Russia, Belarus
On February 28, 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) issued recommendations to international sports federations to prohibit athletes from Russia and Belarus from participating in international tournaments, citing Moscow’s special military operation in Ukraine as the reason.
Following the IOC’s recommendations in late February 2022, the majority of global sports federations decided to bar athletes from Russia and Belarus from all international sports tournaments.
In late March, 2023, the IOC recommended allowing individual athletes from Russia and Belarus to participate in international sports tournaments, but only under specific conditions. Specifically, athletes from the two countries should not be "actively supporting" Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine and must compete under a neutral status. Russia and Belarus were also banned from participating in international team events.
On October 12, 2023, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) until further notice after the Russian organization included the Olympic councils of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics (DPR and LPR), the Zaporozhye and Kherson Regions as its members.

Merz warns Munich Security Conference freedom 'is no longer a given' in stark remarks

Speaking at the opening of three days of high-stakes diplomacy, the German Chancellor delivered a stark diagnosis of a global order "under destruction".
Friedrich Merz has told the Munich Security Conference that the world order as it has stood for decades "no longer exists" – and warned the United States that it will not be powerful enough to "go it alone" in the new age of great power politics.
The German Chancellor alluded to the title of the gathering, "a world under destruction", suggesting that the old rules-based order has already disappeared and countries like Germany will have to completely rethink its approach to security and self-defence.
"You've chosen a grim motto for this conference, 'under destruction', and it probably means that the international order based on rights and rules is currently being destroyed," he said on the opening day of the conference on Friday.
"But I'm afraid we have to put it in even harsher terms: This order, as flawed as it has been even in its heyday, no longer exists."
Declaring that the "unipolar moment" that existed after the fall of the Berlin Wall with the rise of United States as world's superpower has passed, Merz warned that the new global order of power politics puts even the strongest nations in greater danger.
"The return to power politics is not only rooted in the rivalry between great powers," he said, suggesting that it reflects the restlessness and agitation of pre-revolution times.
"It is an expression of a wish in many democratic states for strong leadership in a globalised world in which democratic states in particular are coming very close to the limits of their ability to act," he added.
This new context, he argued, marks the end of the "rules-based order" that democratic powers have used to prevent or mediate conflict since the end of the Second World War.
"Great power politics, it seems, offers strong and easy answers – at least to the big players, and at least at a first glance," he said.
"Under this illusion, big power politics turns away from a world in which increasing connectivity translates into the rule of law and peaceful relations between states. Big power politics has its own rules. It is fast, harsh, and often unpredictable."
'An inconvenient truth'
Merz also directly addressed what he called an "inconvenient truth": the transatlantic relationship between the US and Europe that has underpinned western security for decades is now in doubt.
In a particularly striking passage, he referenced an incendiary speech given by US Vice President J.D. Vance at the Munich Security Conference last year, in which Trump's second-in-command accused European democracies of dooming themselves to destruction with censorious laws and mass immigration from other cultures.
"A divide has opened up between Europe and the United States," Merz said. "Vice President J.D. Vance said this very openly here at the Munich Security Conference a year ago, and he was right."
However, Merz said he does not subscribe to Vance's diagnosis, speaking instead of European values – including those in direct disagreement with the Trump administration's decisions and beliefs, in particular its withdrawal from multilateral organisations and abandonment of efforts to combat the climate emergency.
"The culture wars of MAGA in the US are not ours," he insisted.
"Freedom of speech here ends where the words spoken are directed against human dignity and our basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stick to climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we're convinced that global challenges can only be solved together."
'Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously'
One of the main themes of Merz's speech was the importance of western allies' support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's full-scale invasion, which will soon mark its fourth anniversary.
He alluded to the fact that since Donald Trump returned to the White House, Europe has had to double down on its support for Kyiv and strengthen its approach to penalising the Kremlin.
"For a year, Germany and Europe have assumed the most important leading role," Merz said. "We have imposed unheard losses and costs on Moscow. And if Moscow finally agrees to make peace, it will also be for that reason, because this is an expression of European self-assertion."
Going further in a brief question and answer session conducted by conference chairman Ambassador Wolfgang Ischinger after his speech, Merz insisted that Russia could not yet be trusted to negotiate in good faith on ending its assault – and called out Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's visit to Moscow in 2024, albeit without naming him.
"There was somebody from the European Union, a prime minister, who travelled to Moscow on his own," Merz recalled. "He had no mandate; he went there, he achieved nothing. In the week after, we saw the heaviest attacks on civil infrastructure, and private homes, on hospitals, we had ever seen until this time."
"So if it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," Merz continued. "But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously. This war will only end when Russia is at least economically, potentially militarily, exhausted."
"Russia has to give up this terrible war against Ukraine, and we have to do everything that is needed to bring them to the point where they see no further advantages for them to continue this terrible war."
Pointing to Europe, Merz warned that freedom can no longer be taken for granted.
"Russia's GDP is currently about €2 trillion. That of the European Union is almost 10 times as high – but still, Europe is not 10 times as strong as Russia today.
"Our military, political, economic, and technological potential is huge, but we haven't tapped it to the necessary extent for a very long time. So the most important thing is to flick the switch in our minds now."
"We have to understand that in the era of big powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is at stake. We will need to show firmness and determination to assert this freedom," he added.

Survivor 50 cast single out the player they’re most skeptical of ahead of landmark season
The milestone season will feature former contestants from as far back as the show’s inaugural competition in 2000
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The cast of the milestone 50th season of Survivor has called out one player they were surprised to see made the cut.
In May 2025, the show’s host and executive producer, Jeff Probst, announced the full cast of the reality show’s upcoming season on CBS Mornings. The season, titled “In the Hands of the Fans,” will feature a lineup filled with fan favorites.
With the new season set to premiere February 25, the cast recently opened up to People about their fellow competitors. When asked who cast members were surprised to see return, one name consistently emerged: Kyle Fraser.
Fraser recently won season 48 of the reality show in a final jury vote of 5-2-1, which awarded him the $1 million prize.
“Kyle, why? You just won yesterday!” four-time Survivor player, Cirie Fields said. “The ink ain't even dry on your check yet. What are you trying to prove, Kyle? That makes you public enemy No. 1 for me.”
Two of Fraser’s fellow season 48 cast members also agreed that they were not thrilled to see him as part of the cast.
“I am upset that Jeff did not disclose [that Kyle was returning] when he asked me, ‘Do you want to come play 50?’” Kamilla Karthigesu, who finished fourth on season 48, said.
Joe Hunter agreed, telling People, “It's like I was on national television, and Kyle gave me a wedgie, and then Kamilla came up and pulled it over my head...I won't come after them, but how could I trust them?”
Survivor follows a group of contestants divided into “tribes” based on the season's theme, who are stranded on an island and tasked with surviving by building shelters and foraging for food. Alongside these survival efforts, they compete in a series of mental and physical challenges. Each week, contestants are eliminated through a tribal vote until only one remains. The last contestant standing is crowned the Sole Survivor and awarded the $1 million prize.
Another notable season 50 contestant is Mike White, the creator of The White Lotus. White previously competed on Survivor’s 37th season, which was titled “David vs. Goliath.” The season’s premise saw the David tribe, made up of some of life’s underdogs, face off against a group of overachieving “Goliaths.”
He finished the season in second place with three jury votes, while Nick Wilson secured the title of Sole Survivor with seven votes.
“Mike, after he finished playing, said, ‘I want to play again,’” Probst previously recalled. “When White Lotus hit, and I thought, ‘Well, he’ll never play again.’ But he kept texting and saying, ‘Look, I’m serious. If you ever do anything where you have returning players, I want to play again.’ So we’re happy to have Mike.”
Survivor's milestone season premieres February 25 on CBS.

Sky-high cucumber prices are rattling Russian shoppers. The spike might be temporary, but the inflation problem isn’t.

Sky-high cucumber prices are rattling Russian shoppers. The spike might be temporary, but the inflation problem isn’t.
At the start of the year, Russians got a shock at the grocery store: cucumber prices had skyrocketed. Still, officials and economists aren’t sounding the alarm; prices are expected to begin falling by spring. Inflation more broadly accelerated early in the year, though it’s already showing some signs of slowing. But bringing prices under control could mean sacrificing economic growth — and that, in turn, could deepen Russia’s budget deficit.
Sticker shock
In the first weeks of 2026, cucumber prices in Russia spiked so dramatically that they took on a life of their own. Social media flooded with complaints and photos of produce aisles showing price tags of 500 — and even 1,000 — rubles per kilogram ($2.93, or even $5.87 per pound). As Forbes Russia noted, by early February, cucumbers had effectively become as expensive as meat.
Even official data confirmed the spike. According to Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat), prices rose 43 percent between late December and February 2, then climbed another 5.2 percent in the following week. Industry analysts say the actual increase is even higher.
The trade association Rusprodsoyuz estimates that over the past three months, cucumber prices have jumped 111 percent, with the average retail price reaching around 300 rubles per kilogram (about $1.76 per pound) by February. Alexey Plugov, head of agricultural research company AB-Center, told Forbes Russia that between December 22 and February 2, the price per kilogram rose from about 224 rubles to 317 rubles (from $1.32 per pound to $1.86 per pound).
And yet, viewed year over year, the picture looks far less dramatic. Compared with February 2025, vegetable prices are up just 1.8 percent. As Rusprodsoyuz Deputy Chairman Dmitry Leonov pointed out to Forbes Russia, last year prices rose 120 percent over the same three-month stretch.
Cucumbers in Russia always get more expensive in winter — and there are clear reasons for this.
First, seasonality. By the early 2020s, Russia had effectively become self-sufficient in growing cucumbers; today, about 95 percent of the market is supplied domestically. Thanks to widespread greenhouse technology, farmers now grow cucumbers year-round across the country — not only in the warmer southern regions but also in the colder central part of European Russia. In 2025, they harvested nearly 900,000 tons.
But winter production is costly. From November through March, greenhouses rely on intensive artificial lighting to compensate for short daylight hours, stimulating photosynthesis and speeding growth. Cucumbers, in particular, need bright, powerful light for up to 18 hours a day. Electricity can account for as much as half the cost of winter vegetables, and rates for producers have risen 23 percent over the past two years.
Then there’s the cold itself. January 2026 ranked among the three coldest in central Russia in the past 30 years — the very region where much of the country’s greenhouse capacity is concentrated. Heating costs rose accordingly. Freezing weather also makes cucumbers harder to store: at wholesale warehouses and smaller distribution points, they spoil faster than usual — driving up logistics costs throughout the supply chain.
Taken together, these factors make February a predictably difficult month for the cucumber market. Output falls. Harvesting and distribution become more expensive. And unlike during the 2025 potato price crisis — when authorities turned to imports — there are currently no foreign suppliers filling gaps in supply. Meanwhile, the cost of imported seeds, fertilizers, and equipment continues to climb. According to Plugov, production in February is roughly 35 percent lower than in January.
However, there may be some relief on the horizon for Russian cucumber lovers: prices are likely to fall soon. As daylight hours lengthen, temperatures rise, and open-field harvests begin, supply should increase. Officials and analysts alike expect prices to ease in the spring. Output in March is projected to be about one and a half times February’s level, and in April two to two and a half times higher — potentially pushing prices down to 90–100 rubles per kilogram ($0.53 to $0.59 per pound) by mid-spring.
The bigger inflation problem
In an interview with the business news outlet RBC, Russian Central Bank Deputy Director Alexey Zabotkin noted that the surge in cucumber prices reflects the pronounced seasonality of a single product, not “sustained inflationary processes” in the wider economy.
Keeping inflation in check is one of the Russian government’s main economic priorities in 2026. The Central Bank has been cautious in lowering its key interest rate from elevated levels. High rates curb business lending and make bank deposits more attractive for households, cooling consumer demand.
Even so, inflation accelerated at the start of the year, driven not only by seasonal increases in fruit and vegetable prices but also by the rise in value-added tax from 20 percent to 22 percent, Economic Development Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said.
Weekly data from Rosstat show that annual inflation in Russia peaked at 6.46 percent on February 2 before easing slightly to 6.36 percent by February 9. In late December, it stood at 5.59 percent, meaning inflation has yet to return even to last year’s level. At the same time, the Central Bank’s latest forecast for 2026 puts inflation at 4–5 percent.
Still, some economists say recent data point to a slowdown in inflation. Sofia Donets, chief economist at Tinkoff Investments, noted that “weekly inflation is better not only than in previous weeks but also than during the same period of the past three years.” The January bump from higher taxes and regulated tariffs, she said, has largely played out. What remains is consumer demand — which, for now, is subdued.
Reshetnikov maintains that inflation will continue to slow and move toward the 4–5 percent target range, giving the Central Bank “room” to cut rates further. Indeed, on February 13, the Central Bank cut the key rate from 16 percent to 15.5 percent. The problem, he acknowledged, is that the “natural price” of curbing inflation is stalled economic growth. Russia’s GDP may not increase at all in 2026, he said, with growth resuming only in 2027.
That outlook is troubling for a federal budget already suffering from revenue shortfalls. In January, the deficit reached 1.7 trillion rubles ($22 billion). Oil and gas revenues — depressed by lower global prices — fell to multi-year lows, totaling just 393 billion rubles ($5 billion). The shortfall could be offset by stronger-than-expected revenue from other sources. But those revenues depend on the broader health of the economy.
Whether the Russian authorities can balance the fight against inflation with the need to shore up the budget is difficult to predict. It is becoming increasingly harder to dismiss warnings that by summer, Russia’s economy, strained by war and sanctions, could face a crisis.

What to Say When Someone Tells You to Smile More
Unknown

00:12:39 KST

Four words have echoed across every boardroom, dating app, and city street in the world: You should smile more.
Anastasia Ryan has heard it her whole life, but perhaps never more than in a role where the people she was speaking to couldn’t see her at all. “The majority of what I did was over the phone, and I still had my supervisor coming through and making gestures that I needed to smile while on a call,” she says. “And then eventually, I was told that my facial expressions weren't appropriate in the office.”
After being let go, Ryan channelled her rage into a novel called You Should Smile More, a workplace revenge fantasy about a telemarketer who’s fired for her neutral expression. Through its protagonist, Ryan was able to say all the things she wished she’d been able to say when those smile directives were lobbed at her.
The same remarks might have inspired a rewarding career turn, but that doesn’t negate the damage they caused. “It is absolutely infuriating because it’s being singled out for your appearance and for the way you're presenting yourself, in a way that's not equal across gender standards,” she says. “It's frustrating because we're so much more than that.”
Why it happens
People (usually men) have been advising other people (almost always women) to smile more for as long as anyone can remember. “Men feel that it's OK, if not entirely required, to tell women to smile, which is a really interesting assumption,” says Marianne LaFrance, an emerita professor of psychology and of women's, gender, and sexuality studies at Yale University, and author of Why Smile? The Science Behind Facial Expressions. “The gender status quo is that women should smile more.”
That stems largely from a sense of entitlement, she says. “Men laugh it off, as though it’s a male prerogative to tell a woman what to do with her body,” LaFrance says. People in certain industries, like health care workers and service workers, are especially likely to be told that “they need to constantly display their femininity. And one of the best ways to do that is to smile.”
Read More: 15 Things to Say When Someone Comments on Your Weight
Another reason people deploy this line is because they feel uncomfortable when someone else's face isn't easy to read. Neutral expressions can be unsettling to people who expect emotional reassurance. “It’s less about me, and it's all about your comfort, because you want to see me smile,” says Minda Harts, an assistant professor at NYU's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service and author of Talk to Me Nice: The Seven Trust Languages For A Better Workplace. “It’s not about me being joyful.”
Comments like these do more than create momentary discomfort. They send a subtle signal about whose feelings matter—and whose don’t. “Being told to smile sends a message that ‘you’re inconveniencing me,’ and over time, that erodes trust—not just with others, but with ourselves,” Harts says. “I used to internalize when people would say, ‘Oh, you need to smile more,’ and I'm like, ‘Is there something wrong with me? What’s going on with my face?’”
When saying nothing says enough
Figuring out how to respond when someone tells you to smile more can be complicated. The truth is, experts agree, that it’s not always practical to respond the way you’d like to.
It’s sometimes easiest to address the comment nonverbally. Some people opt to just flash a smile, because they want the interaction to end quickly. “They feel awful for having done it, but they feel that they have no choice,” LaFrance says. “Unfortunately, it reduces the woman in some small way. She’s been caught not being appropriately feminine.”
Another option is to remain stoic and hold your expression, letting your eyes do the work of signaling that the request isn’t welcome. Or you could do what LaFrance defaults to: offer a fake smile. “We all have a bunch of those, and it sort of looks like the smile is plastered on the face and it’s held too long—because the key to a genuine smile is that they're very brief,” she says.
Will the person on the receiving end be able to tell? “It depends how good the fake is,” LaFrance says. “There are fakes that look like the real thing, and then there are fakes that look like it's a satire. It's a put on. It conveys a, ‘You want one? I'll show you one’ sort of attitude.”
That's almost irrelevant, though, LaFrance adds. What matters is the way it lands internally. “I know that what I'm doing inside isn’t obeying the premise that he gets to call me out on something,” she says, “but that I get to decide in what form.”
Redirecting without rewarding the comment
Different scenarios call for different responses. Say a family member or someone else with good intentions phrases their remark like this: “You seem so serious lately—you should smile more.” It can work well to acknowledge their intent without changing your behavior, says Tatiana Teppoeva, founder and CEO of One Nonverbal Ecosystem, an organization that teaches business leaders how to decode nonverbal behavior, communication patterns, and personality dynamics. You might say, “Thank you for caring,” or “I appreciate you checking in.” You’re validating their intentions, she says, without accepting the idea that your expression needs correction.
When people tell their colleagues to smile more, it’s often an attempt to redirect attention, minimize authority, or interrupt momentum, Teppoeva says. For example, you might be making a point in a meeting when someone interjects: “You’d come across better if you smiled more,” shifting focus away from whatever you were saying. In that case, neutral redirection or ignoring the comment entirely usually works best. You can continue your point without responding or calmly redirect: “Let’s stay on topic.” “Engaging emotionally or defensively reinforces the power move,” Teppoeva says. Continuing calmly, on the other hand, “signals authority and shows that your presence doesn’t require external approval.”
Or consider this scenario: A colleague instructs you to smile more because it helps other people feel more at ease. Teppoeva suggests light acknowledgement without commitment: “That’s an interesting perspective,” or “I’ll think about it.”
Occasionally, when she was still working in an office, Ryan would respond to comments suggesting she smile more like this: “Would you say that to a man?” You could even follow up with something like this, she adds: “It’s not your job to provide me with any sort of feedback on my appearance.”

Though LaFrance prefers to respond nonverbally, she can think of a few effective comebacks. One of her favorites: “I will if you will.” Or, if you’re walking down the street and someone shouts at you—“Come on, honey, I want to see you smile”—you could say: “I wouldn’t if I were you, because it’s not pretty.”
Some people feel best keeping their response light and defusing the tension with humor. You could make a joke like this, Harts says: “Smiling costs extra.” Another favorite: “I save my feelings for after meetings.”
If you'd rather be direct, she likes this way of framing things: “I’m comfortable with how I’m showing up right now.” Or, you could flip the conversation back on the other person: “Why do you think so?” Or: “Can you say more about what you're noticing? Is there something specific you need from me right now?”
Ultimately, how you respond is a choice—not an obligation. The idea isn’t to be nicer; it’s to reclaim control. “I always tell people that you don't need a perfect response. You just need one that protects your dignity and makes you feel safe,” Harts says. “You don't have to perform happiness to be respected. You can be professional without providing joy on demand for somebody else.”

Showdown in the American west as Colorado River faces crucial deadline: ‘Mother nature isn’t going to bail us out’

The future of the American west hangs in balance this week, as seven states remained at a stalemate over who should bear the brunt of the enormous water cuts needed to pull the imperiled Colorado River back from the brink. Time is running short to reach a deal before a critical deadline, set for Saturday.
In the region where water has long been the source of survival and conflict, the challenges hindering consensus are as steep as the stakes are high.
Snaking across 1,450 miles (2,300km) from the Rocky Mountains into Mexico, the Colorado supplies roughly 40 million people in seven states, 5.5m acres (2.23m hectares) of farmland and dozens of tribes. The waters fuel an estimated $1.4tn in economic activity, and raised bustling cities, including Los Angeles, Phoenix and Las Vegas. The sprawling basin is also home to diverse ecosystems, with scores of birds, fish, plants and animals, and provides critical habitat for more than 150 threatened or endangered species.
The river has also been overdrawn for more than a century. As demand continues to grow, rising temperatures and lower precipitation caused by the climate crisis are taking an increasingly larger share of declining supplies, a trend only expected to worsen as the world warms.
Up to 4m acre-feet of cuts are needed to bring the basin back into balance – an amount equal to more than a quarter of its annual average flow. One acre-foot, a unit denoting the amount of water that can cover a football field one foot deep, is equal to roughly 326,000 gallons – enough to supply roughly three families for a year.
A record snow drought plaguing the region this year is expected to reduce water supplies further, adding another layer of urgency to the talks.
“There needs to be unbelievably harsh, unprecedented cuts” that will affect water users in major ways, said Dr Brad Udall, senior water and climate research scientist at Colorado State University’s Colorado Water Center. “Mother nature is not going to bail us out.”
Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, which form the upper-basin states – have resisted any cutbacks to their share, insisting lower-basin states – California, Arizona and Nevada – are responsible for creating the deficit. Because they are situated closer to the headwaters, their supply doesn’t come from the reservoirs that the lower basins draw from.
The lower basin has balked at the idea. They have already agreed to take substantial cuts and are demanding their neighbors to the north share the burden. While disagreements range across a series of issues, this is a major sticking point.
After blowing through a deadline last November, experts believe even given months more, negotiators will again come up short.
If they can’t agree on a path forward, the federal government has threatened to issue its own plan, one likely to deeply slash the lower-basin states’ shares. Four draft proposals released for public comment in January include severe reductions of lower states’ supply.
Any of the federal options on the table would almost certainly result in lawsuits and complex court battles, an outcome everyone would like to avoid.
Still, the basin needs a plan – and one that goes far beyond the complex matrix of laws and agreements expiring this year that have been unable to keep pace with the rapidly widening gap between supply and demand.
“Everyone agrees we have to use less water, the problem is states look at each other and say you should use less,” said Dr Jack Schmidt, the director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University.
The negotiations have been like the final scene in Thelma and Louise, he added. “Seven people have their hands on the steering wheel driving toward the edge of a cliff – and no one is working the brakes.”
‘A system that fails us when we need it most’
Along with supplying vast water needs across the west, arguments have centered on how much should be released to protect critical reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead. Storage in these reservoirs has fallen to historic lows and experts have warned that just a couple of dry years could put them at critical levels.
If they fell far enough, the system would cease to function altogether. So-called “deadpool” – when water isn’t high enough to pass through the dams and be distributed downriver – would be catastrophic.
Schmidt said the federal government would intervene long before deadpool. But if desperately dry conditions like those expected this year fail to improve, then even the Bureau of Reclamation’s proposals might not be able to stabilize the system, according to the environmental analysis released with the alternatives in January.
“That’s pretty damn scary,” Schmidt said. Water managers may have to make urgent decisions in the coming months, even if agreements aren’t in place and the problems could get more complicated still.
“We know temperatures are going up – and going up quite rapidly,” Udall said. Hotter environments mean faster evaporation. It shifts the timing of snowmelt and runoff, produces drier soils, and thirsty plants soak up more water. Flows in the Colorado are down 20% over the last century and precipitation has shrunk by about 7%.
“The chickens are coming home to roost,” he said. “Climate models have underestimated how much warming we are going to get, and humans are not stepping up.”
Shortages could lead to dramatic changes in how water is distributed in the future. More than 70% of water is used by agriculture – which includes thirsty crops like alfalfa and hay that are used to feed cattle and the bulk of the winter lettuce and leafy greens grown in the US. The irrigation systems were set up long before suburbs began to sprawl across the deserts, and frameworks that govern the river dictate that that’s why they get their shares first.
“But you can’t fallow cities,” Udall said. While municipalities need to do more to conserve, “it’s the farmers that will hurt – that’s just super clear,” he added. “We have created a system that was supposed to provide certainty that fails us when we need it most.”
‘We are facing a system crash’
There’s still hope that negotiators may pull out a smaller, short-term deal that would provide incremental steps that buy more time for the big issues. Rather than a multi-decade plan, there could be something that covers just the next few years.
After watching years of small steps taken when tensions ran high, Udall has lost confidence that the states will be able to fall back on the short-term solutions this time.
“Maybe in a normal winter you could impose less drastic solutions, but given the snow drought we have right now and the state of the reservoirs, the federal government is going to have to impose a solution,” Udall said. “I would bet you dollars to donuts that the lawsuits are going to fly.”
Rhett Larson, a professor of water law at Arizona State University, agreed that there’s a good chance this will end in the courts.
Larson also serves as council for the Arizona Municipal Water Users Association, representing 10 of the large central Arizona cities. They face enormous cuts under the federal proposals, plans he said have “fatal flaws”.
Without a deal, it’s likely Arizona will sue, and they will likely be joined by California and Nevada. But the lawsuits might not end there.
If dry conditions push river flows low enough that lower-basin states don’t receive their share secured in the original compact over a century ago, another lawsuit could be filed against the upper-basin states themselves. Legal disputes would center on whether the upper basin can be held responsible for losses in supply due to climate change. An interstate water law conflict like this would go straight to the US supreme court.
While the legal battles unfold, “somebody has still got to manage an ever dwindling river”, Larson said.
Dr John Berggren, regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, agrees. Litigation, he said, would ultimately be a failure for the river leaving little room to manage the challenges of a highly complicated system.
“It kind of freezes everything – and environmental values are one of the first things to go,” he said. “They’ll protect the reservoirs as best they can, but they’re probably not going to be able to consider environmental flows and things that actually benefit the river itself.”
Berggren added that the waterway needs flexibility, especially during dry years. Emergency actions – especially those governed by courts and not experts – can’t take account of things like timing and temperature, that are so vital to protecting the river’s ecosystems.
“It’s not just a pipeline,” he said, “it’s a living river.”
The ecosystems on the banks of the river have already paid a heavy price. Fourteen native fish species are endangered or threatened. The once-lush wetlands in Mexico’s river delta have been dry for decades and the once mighty river slows to just a trickle as it crosses over the US-Mexico border. “That’s an ecosystem that is lost,” Schmidt said, “and no one is talking about returning it to its former glory.”
Matt Rice, the southwest regional director for the conservation organization American Rivers, said that’s why he’s clinging to hope that something will come out of the negotiations, even if it’s not comprehensive.
Rice has seen year after year of crisis management play out on the river, and lessons continue to go unlearned.
“The positive thing is we know what to do,” he added. Conservation efforts across the Colorado River basin have been successful. Cities in the region have reduced water-use by 18% over the last two decades, even as some saw their populations grow. Farmers have adopted more efficient irrigation systems, infrastructure can be updated for better efficiency and conservationists are working to restore watersheds.
But these fixes have not gone far enough – not by a long shot. Rice said there needs to be a new approach, framed not as an emergency cut that goes from crisis to crisis, but as adaptation to an arid future.
For that, the deadline isn’t coming from the federal government, it’s being imposed by the waterway itself.
“We are facing a system crash,” he said. “The river is not going to wait for process or politics.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia has all the necessary research facilities for advancing lunar and deep space exploration, said President of the Kurchatov Institute National Research Center and Chairman of the Scientific Expert Council of the Russian Maritime Board Mikhail Kovalchuk.
"We have the entire base, <…> a complete research rig. It is currently undergoing modernization. [Research] for space basing is being conducted there, for the fleet, and so on. There is a special facility that tests materials at extra-low temperatures: at -270 degrees Celsius, at absolute zero on the Moon. <…> This base has now been upgraded to a new level and ensures our country’s steady progress in the exploration of the Moon and deep space," Kovalchuk said in his address at a Scientific Expert Council meeting dedicated to the 123rd birth anniversary of Academician Anatoly Alexandrov.
He also highlighted new prospects in the development of a synergy of space and nuclear technologies.
"Today, thanks to our joint efforts with the new head of Roscosmos, Dmitry Vladimirovich Bakanov, I believe we have a chance for the deep and active introduction of nuclear technologies in the space industry," the Kurchatov Institute head concluded.

Three men jailed in UK over Islamic State-inspired plot to kill hundreds of Jews

Three men were jailed for involvement and knowledge of a plot to kill hundreds in an Islamic State-inspired attack on the Jewish community in England, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) announced on Saturday.
The plot, if successful, would have been "one of the deadliest terrorist attacks to ever take place on UK soil," according to GMP Assistant Chief Constable Rob Potts.
Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein were both found guilty of preparing acts of terrorism after a trial at Preston Crown Court and were sentenced to minimum sentences of 37 and 26 years, respectively.
Saadaoui's younger brother, Bilel Saadaoui, was additionally found guilty of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism and was sentenced to six years in prison.
According to GMP, Saadaoui masterminded the plot and recruited Hussein to participate.
Saadaoui, Hussein crafted plot through online communications
In late 2023, Saadaoui came into contact online with an individual he believed to be a fellow extremist, and after multiple messages were exchanged between the two, "it soon became clear that Saadaoui was keen to conduct a significant terrorist attack targeting Jewish people," GMP stated.
Saadaoui believed the individual could help him import automatic firearms to use in the terrorist attack and began developing the plot, going so far as to "conduct reconnaissance around Upper Broughton in Salford" and visit the port through which they believed the weapons would be smuggled.
According to a BBC report, Saadaoui planned to obtain four AK-47 assault rifles, two handguns, and 900 rounds of ammunition for the firearms.
The individual sought out by Saadaoui for help with the plot turned out to be an undercover agent who played a "crucial role" in foiling Saadaoui and Hussein's would-be terrorist attack, according to GMP.
Through Saadaoui's discussion of the plan with the undercover agent, it became clear to GMP that his younger brother knew about the planned attack, but remained silent, an action Potts stated "makes him as guilty as the others."
According to the BBC, Saadaoui was arrested by counter-terrorism police on May 8, 2024, in an operation with over 200 officers involved. He was apprehended in the parking lot of a hotel while attempting to collect the firearms he planned to use in the attack.
The BBC additionally reported that Saadaoui came to the attention of authorities when he began using social media accounts to spread Islamist extremist views. He used over ten accounts, none of which were created in his own name.
This is a developing story.

Leak damages 19th Century painting in latest Louvre setback

Leak damages 19th Century painting in latest Louvre setback
A water leak at the Louvre has caused damage to a 19th Century ceiling painting, in the latest major setback for the Parisian museum.
Water damage was discovered in room 707, also known as the "Duchâtel" room, late on Thursday night, the museum said. The room houses multiple 15th and 16th Century artworks.
The museum said the leak - from a heating pipe - was stopped shortly after midnight and the only painting damaged was Charles Meynier's The Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun.
It comes a day after French police reportedly detained nine people - including two museum staff - over a suspected ticket fraud scheme.
Museum bosses have come under increasing scrutiny in recent months, after thieves stole priceless French crown jewels from the museum in broad daylight and hundreds of books were damaged in a leak.
The Louvre said Thursday night's leak occurred at the entrance to the paintings department in the Denon wing.
It said firefighters responded "immediately" and the leak was stopped 40 minutes after it began.
A painting restorer inspected Meynier's ceiling painting on Friday morning and found it had "two tears in the same area, caused by the water, and the paint layer on the ceiling and its arches has lifted".
The ceiling painting, signed by Meynier in 1822, depicts lauded French painters Nicolas Poussin, Eustache Le Sueur, and Charles Le Brun, who appear in the clouds among angelic figures.
Rooms 706, 707 and 708 in the Denon wing on the building's first floor were closed on Friday morning, but are expected to reopen later in the day.
The chief architect of historic monuments also came to assess the condition of the ceiling, the Louvre said, but found there were no structural problems.
A union representative told news agency Reuters that scaffolding had been erected in the affected area.
The cost of the damage to the painting and the building remains unclear.
This leak is the latest in a long series of problems faced by the museum, which is the most visited in the world, in the recent past.
In December, 300-400 pieces, mostly books, were damaged by a leak in the Louvre's Egyptian department. At the time, the museum's deputy administrator, Francis Steinbock, said the problem that caused the leak had been known about for years.
The month prior, structural weaknesses prompted the partial closure of one of the galleries hosting Greek vases and offices.
This came shortly after a high-profile heist on 19 October in which four burglars made off with historic jewellery worth €88m (£76m; $102m), exposing glaring gaps in the musuem's security.
The brazen theft involved a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift, which was used to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.
Several people have been arrested in relation to the heist, which the French police are still investigating.
The majority of the stolen pieces have still not been recovered and the museum has since moved some of its most precious jewels to the Bank of France.
A report published in October by France's public audit body criticised the museum's excessive spending on artwork, which it said was "to the detriment of the maintenance and renovation of buildings."

Regarding the torture of Ukrainians

Danylo Mokryk
Reporter with the War Crimes Investigations Unit of the Kyiv Independent
Torturing prisoners is not merely a war crime that Russians perpetrate, it's part of Russian culture. Susan Sontag's 20-year-old essays may help us understand it.
In the Kyiv Independent's latest investigative documentary "Torture Culture," we examine the sufferings that Russians systematically inflict on their Ukrainian prisoners — all the beatings, electrocutions, mutilations, sexual abuse, psychological violence — not only as a war crime but also a cultural phenomenon, something that Russians do decade after decade, whenever and wherever the opportunity presents itself.
From Western Ukraine in 1939-1941 to the Gulag system, from Chechnya to today's occupied territories, torture resurfaces again and again.
As it usually happens, some parts of our work on the documentary did not make it into the final cut. For example, during the interview with the Chechen human rights defender Akhmed Gisaev (who himself survived Russian detention and extensive torture in 2003) we discussed how the intent to instil fear in civilians with torture (and with spreading information about it among the population) in the occupied territory alludes to the Russian popular "matrimonial" proverb, "If she fears you it means she respects you."
An important point in the documentary is that the perpetrators of torture most often seemed to thoroughly enjoy the process.
Several survivors talked about it in their interviews. But there's also a seemingly small detail that we left out from the film — and which, upon reflection, is quite telling: according to all of our interviewees, Russian torturers liked to record the beatings, electrocutions, waterboardings, and other abuses and humiliations on their smartphones.
That brings to mind the last major essay by Susan Sontag, "Regarding the Torture of Others," published in 2004. In it, she comments on photos from the Iraqi Abu Ghraib prison, where American soldiers had been torturing local prisoners. "The meaning of these pictures is not just that these acts were performed, but that their perpetrators apparently had no sense that there was anything wrong in what the pictures show," she writes. "Even more appalling, since the pictures were meant to be circulated and seen by many people: it was all fun."
The same analysis may be applied to the Russian practice of consistently recording the process of torturing Ukrainians 20 years later.
And there's more in Susan Sontag's essay that may be helpful in trying to understand the different reasons and twisted logic behind Russian torture. For instance, she remarks that very often the detainees in Abu Ghraib were arrested for reasons no more specific than simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time, the only justification for holding them being "interrogation."
"Interrogation about what? About anything. Whatever the detainee might know. If interrogation is the point of detaining prisoners indefinitely, then physical coercion, humiliation and torture become inevitable," Sontag writes.
It seems that thousands of Ukrainian civilian prisoners who fell into Russian hands find themselves in exactly the same situation. In most cases, they’re not even charged with any crime. Instead, they are subjected to days, weeks, or even months of continuous interrogation — and, it often seems, to torture for its own sake.
Sontag is also very critical of George W. Bush's administration and its geopolitical direction — and she connects this direction to torture. "The torture of prisoners is not an aberration. It is a direct consequence of the with-us-or-against-us doctrines of world struggle," she writes. "This endless 'global war on terrorism'... inevitably leads to the demonizing and dehumanizing of anyone declared by the Bush administration to be a possible terrorist."
Once again, this logic can be applied to Russian torture practices against Ukrainians — and not only Ukrainians.
Demonizing and dehumanizing Ukrainians is part of Russian state propaganda. Labeling Ukrainian patriots as "nazis" and "fascists" serves just that purpose (we've covered that in one of our previous investigative documentaries, "Destroy in Whole or in Part").
Given the crucial part that the victory against Nazism plays in the modern Russian mentality, there's hardly a more efficient way to dehumanize a group of people than calling them that.
That's precisely why, historically, almost all Kremlin's invasions and military operations after World War II were conducted against "fascists" and "nazis" — at least, according to the Kremlin’s own propaganda.
To fight "fascists," the USSR sent tanks to Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 1968. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to crush Latvian and Estonian aspirations to independence in 1991 were also ostensibly aimed against "fascism."
Russian invasions of Moldova in 1991 and of Georgia in 1992-1993 were also accompanied by the same rhetoric, and so on. (I covered that topic in my 2022 investigation for Bihus.Info, which is also available in English).
Accusing its victim of being a "fascist" or a "nazi" can very well be considered a part of Russian political culture. And in the same way that, for Susan Sontag, the American "war on terror" led to torture in Abu Ghraib, the Russian "war on fascism" leads to torture in today's Ukraine.
Obviously, torturing the arch-enemy, the "fascist," the "nazi," is something Russians not only practice, but also very much enjoy.
Once again, it's cultural.

Kyrgyzstan president highlights ‘steady positive dynamics’ in ties with Kazakhstan
Sadyr Japarov says bilateral political dialogue ‘actively developing’ as Astana’s top diplomat visits Bishkek
ISTANBUL
Relations between Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan are demonstrating “steady positive dynamics,” Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov said on Friday as he received Kazakh Foreign Minister Yermek Kosherbayev in Bishkek.
The meeting focused on current issues of bilateral cooperation across a broad range of areas and underscored potential for expanding collaboration, according to the Kyrgyz presidential press service.
An exchange of views also took place on multilateral cooperation within international and regional organizations, with both sides confirming readiness to continue coordinating efforts on the international stage.
Japarov stressed relations between the two neighboring countries are “filled with concrete practical content” and that interstate political dialogue is “actively developing” at the highest and senior levels.
He pointed to ongoing joint trade, investment, transport, transit, and water and energy projects, including the construction of the Kambarata Hydroelectric Power Plant-1.
Kosherbayev thanked Japarov for the warm reception and conveyed greetings from President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev.
He said the "trust-based" dialogue between the two leaders provides a solid foundation for strengthening allied relations and promoting stability and prosperity in both countries.
The Kazakh minister said implementing agreements reached at the highest level in a timely and effective manner remains a priority for his ministry, alongside boosting practical cooperation in trade, economic, investment and humanitarian spheres.

With the schools breaking up for half term, Friday is a particularly busy day at Brussels Airport in Zaventem (Flemish Brabant). No fewer than 70,500 passengers are expected at the airport during Friday, making it the busiest day at the airport this spring half term. Unlike last year both Dutch-medium and French-medium schools break for half term up on the same day this year. Pupils in Dutch-medium education have a week’s holiday, while those taught through the medium of French have two weeks.
Almost 1.1 million passengers will travel via Zaventem during the spring half term break. Many will be leaving for skiing holidays or for warmer climes for a bit of sun, sea and sand. Today (Friday 13 February) 37,500 passengers will depart from Brussels Airport and 33,000 will arrive there.
Sunday 22 February is also set to be a busy day at Zaventem with 70,000 passengers expected. This coincides with the end of the school holidays in Dutch-medium schools.
Tradionally the favourite destinations for a holiday during the spring half term vacation are the Cannary Islands, Spain, Morocco, Tunisia, Cabo Verde, Gambia, the UEA and Thailand, all of which are (considerably) warmer and sunnier than Belgium at this time of year. Winter sport destinations are also popular.
Arrive in plenty of time
Brussels Airport advises passengers to arrive in plenty of time. This means at least 2 hours before take-off for a flight within the Schengen Zone and 3 hours before take-off for a flight outside the Schengen Zone.
Passengers are also advised to travel to the airport on public transport if the can or to reserve a parking space in advance.

Alexander Skarsgård and Harry Melling on the surprisingly sweet BDSM romance ‘Pillion’
Alexander Skarsgård plays a biker who begins a dom-sub relationship with a younger, more inexperienced man in “Pillion.”
- Bookmark
Alexander Skarsgård doesn’t usually watch his movies more than once with an audience. But “Pillion,” in which he plays the enigmatic member of gay biker club who begins a dom-sub relationship with a younger, more inexperienced man, Colin (Harry Melling), has been an exception. He’s seen it at least four times.
It’s partly because “Pillion” has been coming out for so long. The film premiered last year at the Cannes Film Festival before going on to play at several others and is just now arriving in North American theaters. But mostly it's because it's a film that is never not interesting to experience with a crowd: It's both remarkably explicit in its depiction of sex and surprisingly sweet and comedic as Ray (Skarsgård's character) and Colin navigate the dynamics of their unconventional relationship.
“It can play in so many different ways,” Skarsgård said in a recent interview. “It’s really fun to see and feel the energy in the room, how sometimes people really lean into the comedy and sometimes it feels more somber and heartfelt.”
Skarsgård was joined by Melling and filmmaker Harry Lighton for a lighthearted conversation about sex on screen, “Heated Rivlary” and why Melling, who since his days as Dudley Dursley in “Harry Potter” has become a bona fide character actor, would prefer to keep the word “breakthrough” out of this moment.
Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.
AP: There’s been some comparisons to “Babygirl,” which stirred debate over whether it’s sex positive or negative. Do you see “Pillion” in one of those lights?
LIGHTON: It’s hard for me to reduce it to sex positive or sex negative, because I think that there are ups and downs to Colin’s experience. Maybe I’d call it “sex net positive,” which is an incredibly unsexy way to describe the film. That’s not going to get bums on seats at all. But for me the film’s about someone trying to grow into his sexuality. And that’s always going to be a bumpy road. But where he ends up is with more knowledge and practice.
AP: Was there anything you refused to compromise on?
LIGHTON: I had to fight for the odd piece of technical equipment or an extra day in the schedule, all that boring stuff. But not the stuff which I thought was really integral to the script, for instance, not sanitizing the depiction of sex. I was very keen on the fact that if we were going to take on this subject matter that the sex would be on screen, that it wouldn’t be like portrayed through ellipsis or the camera panning away because I thought would make it seem like I was judging the type of sex we were showing. But I was very well supported in that aim by all of our execs.
SKARSGÅRD: The screenplay was way more explicit than the final movie. You made sure that anyone who read the screenplay knew what they were throwing themselves into.
MELLING: You really did know what you were saying yes to.
LIGHTON: Actually, in a way, you didn’t because you thought you were saying yes to a five-minute shot of an erection.
SKARSGÅRD: I’m like, what kind of Disney version of this movie is that?
AP: Ray is pretty mysterious, but you do get glimpses of vulnerability and insecurity. How did you make sense of him?
SKARSGÅRD: I love the little clues that Harry put into the screenplay and the fact that it’s never really spelled out. There’s never a big cataclysmic moment where he’s opening up about his past or about a secret life.
It was a lot of fun finding little things that would add a flavor to the character of this dominant biker, everything from what book is he reading, what glasses is he wearing, to what are the tattoos on his body? Maybe they’re more effeminate. Maybe he’s listening to like, “I Think We’re Alone Now,” you know, like pop music from the '80s.
And I’m really pleased that he remains enigmatic.
AP: Would you say this is a breakthrough role for Harry Melling?
LIGHTON: He’s done lots of roles which have merited attention and they’re all incredibly varied, which is what I found so fascinating about Harry as an actor. But I also did it in a slightly greedy way. I thought it was really exciting that I would be able give Harry the opportunity to, I mean, this is your first lead feature film role. Is that fair Harry?
MELLING: I’d say so.
LIGHTON: The success of the film lives or dies by Colin so I think the reaction to the film is a kind of testament to Harry’s work in it.
MELLING: I’ll also add, this is like a side point, nothing about that, but like the idea of, you know, the word breakthrough terrifies me. If you as an actor start considering this is, like, the moment or the breakthrough moment, you’re sort of done for.
SKARSGÅRD: And can we steer the conversation back to me now?
LIGHTON: I knew I knew that was coming. As soon as I said “lives or dies by Harry’s performance,” I saw your face drop.
SKARSGÅRD: You saw the vacant, distant gaze of an actor when the conversation isn’t about him.
LIGHTON: Anger. It was anger on the face.
SKARSGÅRD: I was texting my publicist, “Get me out of this.”
AP: Do you think “Pillion” could be a “Heated Rivalry” kind of hit?
SKARSGÅRD: No. But I’m excited that it’s coming out, finally. And the fact that people in the BDSM community seem to respond to it, but (Harry Lighton’s) mom also loves it. Hopefully it can appeal to a lot of people.
MELLING: My parents also absolutely loved it. Sadly, I didn’t see it with them, which I would have loved to. I know to a lot of people that would be shocking.
SKARSGÅRD: I watched it with my dad (Stellan Skarsgård), and he loved it. But maybe that’s less surprising than like Lighton’s mom with her friends going to watch it.
LIGHTON: Yeah, my mum hasn’t made any films of Lars von Trier, as far as I’m aware. But I mean, “Heated Rivalry” is a good example of someone taking a risk on something which seems like it might be niche, and then suddenly it explodes into the mainstream. Independent films are obviously different and our film is different from “Heated Rivalry” but I think the sort of takeaway is that taking risks can result in not only exciting creative material but commercially viable results as well.

Regarding inaccurate information disseminated by certain media outlets
In connection with the publication by several media outlets of materials alleging the involvement of Serhii Tarasov and the group of companies “I&U Group” in criminal proceedings handled by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU), we hereby state the following.
The information disseminated by certain media outlets is inaccurate and presented with significant distortion of the factual circumstances.
NABU is currently conducting criminal proceeding No. 42020120000000009 dated January 10, 2020, initiated under Part 2 of Article 364 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (abuse of power or official authority), concerning alleged misconduct by officials of the Mykilska Village Council of Svitlovodsk District, Kirovohrad Region. The case relates to the establishment by the village council of an enterprise and the subsequent disposal of corporate rights in LLC “Megatrend” in favor of third parties.
The pre-trial investigation was originally initiated by law enforcement authorities of the Kirovohrad region and was conducted from 2020 to 2022, after which the case was transferred to NABU based on jurisdiction.
According to the investigation materials, officials of the Mykilska Village Council of Svitlovodsk District, Kirovohrad Region admitted participants into LLC “Megatrend” by contributing property belonging to the village council—namely 10 chairs—into the company’s authorized capital, which constituted 65% of the charter capital. Subsequently, the enterprise was granted lease rights, under a preferential procedure and without an auction, to 49 land plots totaling 1,500 hectares. Thereafter, the village council adopted a decision to alienate its share in the authorized capital in favor of another participant in the company. According to an expert assessment conducted by the Kyiv Scientific Research Institute of Forensic Expertise (KNDISE), damages were allegedly caused to the Mykilska Village Council as a result of the sale of corporate rights in LLC “Mega-Trend” at an undervalued price, taking into account the market value of such corporate rights as of January 25, 2016, in the amount of UAH 10,009,296.00.
Key Clarifications Regarding the Publication:
- The criminal proceeding concerns alleged abuse of power and official authority by officials of the Mykilska Village Council of Svitlovodsk District, Kirovohrad Region, and has no relation to “I&U Group.”
- According to NABU, no individual has been formally notified of suspicion in this proceeding; the case remains a fact-based investigation.
- The land plots were leased and have not been withdrawn from state ownership; lease payments continue to be made to this day.
- The decision to alienate part of the corporate rights in LLC “Mega-Trend” to a third party was adopted by resolution of a session of the Mykilska Village Council.
- “I&U Group” acquired LLC “Mega-Trend” with its assets and encumbrances from third parties, not from the village council.
- According to official data available on the website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine and Interpol, S.D. Tarasov is not subject to international search and no preventive measure has been imposed on him.
- According to official information from NABU, S.D. Tarasov has not received any notice of suspicion in any NABU case and does not hold any procedural status in the Bureau’s proceedings.
We additionally note that one of the media outlets that first disseminated the information using inaccurate wording and assumptions subsequently removed the respective publication from its platform.
We call on media representatives to adhere to journalistic standards, respect the presumption of innocence, and verify information before publication.
The group of companies “I&U Group” conducts its activities in full compliance with the legislation of Ukraine, cooperates openly with state authorities, and is prepared to provide all necessary information in accordance with the law.
For the purpose of media cooperation, S.D. Tarasov is ready to give interviews to independent media outlets.

No water or electricity, and children begging in streets filled with rubbish – but this is why I won’t leave Cuba

Felix Valdés García was nine years old when the revolutionaries came to blow up his trees. It was the verge of the 1970s and his father, Felin, was losing the family farm to Cuba’s 10-year-old communist regime. A push called the Revolutionary Offensive was under way, mobilising the people to sow, clean and harvest 10m tonnes of sugar cane in an effort to make Cuba financially independent. The land needed to be cleared.
For decades the family had nurtured their 800 hectares of rich loam alongside the meandering Sagua River. Eight couples, all related, worked the fields, while Felix and his sister had fruitful adventures among the royal palms, avocado, mango and magnificent ceiba.
“The sappers arrived,” Felix writes in his family memoir. “A gang of agile men who opened holes in the roots and placed charges of dynamite. There was a terrible roar and the trees flew into the sky, defying gravity, then fell shuddering with broken branches.”
Felix is my father-in-law, and I recall this moment when I think about Cuba’s revolution, which is often as the country spirals into tragedy around me.
A vast human experiment is coming to an end. Fidel and Raúl Castro’s communist revolution is crumbling, to be replaced by … we know not what. The US government, after six decades of aggression, is seeking the endgame. The Trump administration, newly energised from decapitating Venezuela’s Bolivarian revolution, is looking for “assets” within the Cuban government, and briefing of warships enforcing a total oil blockade. “Make a deal before it’s too late,” President Donald Trump told Cuba’s leaders.
The Americans are facing a country where the lazy tourist’s recommendation – “See it before it changes” – no longer applies. In the pit of an economic slump, the island has gone from being run-down and picturesque to a horror show. The economy contracted by 11% between 2019 and 2024, with a further 5% fall through September 2025. Rubbish fills the streets, picked over by burgeoning bands of beggars. Rolling power cuts rack the island, spoiling the little food people have in their fridges, and making it hard to sleep. Anyone who protests is met with authoritarian force.
It’s not the first time Cubans have gone hungry. The “special period in a time of peace” following the collapse of the Soviet Union saw people begin to starve. But those who lived through those times say these are different. The government, out of money and ideas, has allowed a small super-class of Cubans to emerge, licensed to import products including food. But inflation means very few can afford their goods. “In the special period things were very bad, because there was no food, but we had hope,” said Carlos Bustamante, a film producer. “Now there is food, if you can afford it, but no hope.”
The wealthy drive Mercedes and Dodge Rams past the famous 1950s Ford Fairlanes and 1970s Russian Ladas. In the special period neighbour helped neighbour, but such communitarianism is collapsing. Every generation is affected by the crisis, but none more so than the one that built the revolution, who rallied to the call to put aside personal gain for the common good. It was they who volunteered to cut cane during that 10m-tonne harvest, on the understanding that they would be provided with food and healthcare until they died.
The revolution raised many out of poverty, its great achievement. But it is now beggaring them again.
For some it was enough. I stop an old man sweeping the path outside his house in Havana’s Vedado neighbourhood. Darío Díaz Machado says he was a lieutenant colonel in FAR, the revolutionary army. His 4,500 pesos a month pension may only be worth $10, but his son, a surgeon in Spain, sends money.
“I was a peasant, working the land,” he says. “After the triumph of the revolution I began to attend schools and improve myself. I’ve come this far. I feel happy.”
This is not a widely held view. An estimated 20% of the population – among them the best and brightest – have emigrated since the pandemic, often with children. The shock on the faces of their elderly and increasingly lonely relatives matches the state of their clothes.
Martha Ortega was a secretary in a Communist party office in central Havana. She now lives with her daughter, who is deaf and mute, on a pension inflation has reduced to $5 a month. “We lived with a dream, with a devotion. And then everything was gone,” she tells me.
What Cubans now live with is an electricity grid that regularly collapses. The first time it happened, in October 2024, I was making breakfast for my then two-year-old boy, Santiago. Five days of blackout also meant the water supply had failed. He was potty training, and turning to check on him, I discovered he’d pooed on the floor, putting his dirty hands to his face.
I looked at the useless taps, aware that our cupboard of imported medicines didn’t include anything for conjunctivitis. Picking him up, I thought: what are we doing here? Many have no choice, but we do.
Part of it is that my wife, a literary professor at the University of Havana, has never wanted to go. We’ve lived together for eight years in her small apartment overlooking the Florida Straits and she remains in awe of her home city. “All this,” she’ll say, looking at some magnificent building. “In the Caribbean.”
But all her friends have gone. A graduate of the once meritocratic powerhouse of a high school, La Lenin, she shared a dorm with friends who are now spread across North America. They wonder why she won’t go, too. Instead she heads off to classes during the extended power cuts in the hope that her students will turn up in the gloom (they usually do).
But part of it is me. Cubans now refer to themselves as a “third world country”. Marco Rubio, the US’s Cuban-American secretary of state, who is at the forefront of the administration’s effort to change the Havana regime, called it “fourth world”. This makes me furious because neither is true. Or at least it wasn’t. Cuba is something else, something unique and terrifying, which is what this article is about.
I came of age in Scotland when the Berlin Wall fell, and was told the good guys won and the bad guys lost. Felix heard it differently. In the 1980s he had left the house in Santa Clara in which the family had been resettled from the farm, to study philosophy. He boarded a ship in Havana Bay and set off across the Atlantic to study in the Soviet Union. The cruise liner refuelled in Algeciras, Cuba’s communist students shouting down to Spain’s until recently fascist stevedores. Then it was through the Bosphorus, and a landing in Odesa.
There Felix met Yohanka, also Cuban, also a philosopher. (You get used to this sort of thing if you live in Cuba: I like to fish and Felipe, my Cuban guide, is a trained psychologist.) Felix and Yohanka were beneficiaries of a revolution determined to educate. “Without education there is no revolution,” Fidel Castro said. Yet all attempts to pay for this education were failing. The sugar harvest that saw Felix’s beloved trees blown up fell short by between 1.5m and 2.5m tonnes, and was soon excised from national conversation.
Other attempts to centrally plan prosperity sputtered into life. There was an ambition to build a network of nuclear power stations, which collapsed after Chornobyl, a bioengineering sector to manufacture drugs, which was met with an international shrug, and a tourism industry that necklaced the best beaches on the island with ugly all-inclusive hotels. Without capitalism’s glinting edge, the government’s money-making attempts either limped on or collapsed. Each time I pass through Havana’s José Martí airport, I laugh at a billboard attempting to encourage medical tourism. It shows a smiling couple saying, “I choose Cuba to procreate.” I mean, I chose Cuba to procreate, but I wouldn’t have put it quite like that.
Doctors have been trained by the thousand, and sent to more than 160 countries on medical missions. These have been a subject of pride and scandal: the doctors earn up to $1,000 a month while the state charges the host country five times that.
Nothing has given the island – 777 miles long, with a historic population of 11 million – the velocity to escape the financial kindness of other nations. Instead, the economy has lurched from one crisis to another, as insidious sweetheart deals have been done with Russia, Venezuela, Iran and China. Meanwhile, the fundamental infrastructure rots. “This country has never been economically independent,” says Katrin Hansing, a professor of anthropology at the City University of New York. “Full stop, since colonial times.”
The government blames its woes – with justification – on the US and its decades-long economic embargo. Others – with equal justification – point to ageing political leaders ineptly running a moribund, centrally planned state. What is certain is that the vast majority of Cubans on the island no longer care who is to blame.
As 2024 turned into 2025, we took a family trip to Viñales. If you have visited Cuba, you will probably know it: a village in the island’s west in a valley full of mogotes, steep-sided rocky hills. There was a pig roast, presided over by a local lad sporting a solid-gold chain and a vast medallion. I liked his shtick. He’d made money trading cars. His children were like little Mowglis, charging around bareback on horses, before falling asleep together in a hammock.
But my parents-in-law eyed him in confusion. “He’s just not emancipated,” Felix said. I’d laughed, teasing him, but I kept thinking about it afterwards. It reminded me of a line in Secondhand Time, Svetlana Alexievich’s Nobel prize-winning book of interviews with people after the fall of the Soviet Union. “There were new rules,” one said. “If you have money, you count – no money, you’re nothing. Who cares if you’ve read all of Hegel?”
I tell the story to Hansing, the City University of New York professor, who is a classic example of the curious people you meet on the island. She arrived in Cuba in the 1980s as a teenager, daughter of South African anti-apartheid activists. She was educated on Cuba’s Isle of Youth alongside students from a slew of African countries, part of Fidel Castro’s then global outreach.
“I know so many people who grew up in the early years of the revolution who became professionals, doctors, engineers, university professors, journalists,” she says. “But their children or grandchildren, if they haven’t been able to leave, are now doing manual labour because it pays better.” She is grim about the future: “There’s a growing sense of not only anti-intellectualism, but anti-education among many young people.”
Cuba’s revolutionaries made the island an icon of the international left. In some ways it still is. In January, there was a gathering to mark the anniversary of the 1966 Tricontinental Conference which drew anti-colonialists from all over the world. And yet lately, the government’s apparent acceptance of the suffering of its people has been causing a degree of circumspection even among true believers. Heinz Bierbaum is a former president of the European Left who, as chair of the Rosa Luxemburg Foundation, is a regular visitor to the island. “Solidarity with Cuba is very important because it’s a socialist country in an unfavourable environment,” he says. “But we have to talk about the situation, to enter a dialogue with the government about the problems.” (To be fair, he told me this before the US assault on Venezuela, which is bound to harden opinions again.)
It didn’t have to be like this. In 2016, then US president Barack Obama flew into Havana to “bury the last remnants of the cold war”. He was greeted by a population who believed fundamentally in free healthcare and education. It wouldn’t have been a reach for Cuba to give its people a little opportunity, allowing them to earn money while asking them to pay decent taxes towards such benefits. But the government didn’t think so, at least not on any effective scale. Instead it cleaved to policies that maintained its control of the economy, often in baffling ways. A programme of hotel building has been under way, with 7,000 more rooms added since 2019, despite tourist numbers halving in the same period. And no one answers the question why.
Meanwhile, in 2021 came a unification of two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar, one local, which resulted in hyperinflation that collapsed the value of state sector pay and pensions. The minister responsible, Alejandro Gil, was charged, convicted and given a life sentence for corruption and, more startlingly, espionage. Again, no further explanations were given.
Michael Bustamante, chair of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami, and one of the most fair-minded observers of the island, says the government has “missed every opportunity” to make the economy better, and the effects are heartbreaking. Children who would once have had to answer to the police if seen on the streets in school hours now use the time to beg. Parents struggle. A friend received a call from her sons’ school after a rainstorm asking that she pick them up. A lack of gas meant they had been cooking lunch for the children over fire, but their wood got wet.
Doctors battle on, working in dirty hospitals, sharing any functioning machines, doing what they can. But once-vaunted infant mortality rates have doubled and even the government admits medicines are scarce.
And people keep leaving. There are no firm figures but estimates are as high as 2 million. My wife’s speciality is the literature of emigration, her PhD on writers making sense of their broken families and exile. Her subject has been Haiti, a deflection not lost on her.
Across the Florida Straits, Cuba’s exile community watches events on the island carefully, sensing the end even as they struggle with this latest, unprecedentedly large, influx of refugees. In an office on the 11th floor of a glittering building in Miami’s Brickell mall, Pedro Freyre is one of the city’s leading attorneys. The 76-year-old is exile aristocracy, his family having fled a beautiful house on Havana’s Fifth Avenue ahead of the revolution. His brother fought against the Castros in the Bay of Pigs and his brother-in-law died there.
Cuban Americans are proud of their relationship with their adopted country, he says. “We were well received, well treated. And, as the song says, we built this city.”
Despite his family history, Freyre was closely involved in the effort to bring investment to Cuba during the thaw in relations started by Obama. “Trump’s people were there,” he says. “You see the property that they were looking at as you fly in. It had a landing strip, and he was going to build a golf course.”
He has lost patience now, saying many Cuban Americans would support intervention – something I never hear in Cuba itself. He calls nonsense on my suggestion that the revolution gave Cubans a unique intellectualism. “That’s a very Cuban tradition that has been around since the inception – think of José de la Luz y Caballero and José Martí.”
This remark brings me up short and I mull it as I drive away. I think also of pre-revolutionary artist Wifredo Lam, writer Alejo Carpentier and singer Benny Moré. Then I look around, at Miami’s flatlands full of strip malls and faux-this-and-that houses. Cubans may have built this city, but they didn’t do it with any poetry.
Still, I am on my way to meet a man who will shed no tears if the revolution collapses, who has experienced the darkest side of its legacy. In a small apartment under the flight path into Miami airport, I find José Daniel Ferrer, who for much of this century has been de facto head of the Cuban opposition. On and off, he has spent 12 years in Cuba’s jails as a political prisoner (one of nearly 1,200, according to human rights group Prisoners Defenders). “I saw things I never thought a human being in the western hemisphere could see,” he says, including being held in darkness for months, force-fed, attacked by both guards and prisoners. He says he watched two men get beaten to death.
Despite this, he always refused to leave Cuba, determined to be a thorn in the side of the government from within, but in October last year he’d had enough and accepted exile. “There is nothing to lose with the fall of the regime,” he says bitterly. “Rather we will gain freedom, opportunity and prosperity.”
The worst years of his incarceration, he says, came after 2016. It’s a reminder that, even if everything had gone smoothly following Obama’s visit, it’s unlikely Cuba would have easily pivoted into a cosy social democracy. “Cuba hasn’t had a democracy, let alone a social democracy, since 1952, so there is a lot of work to be done,” says Bustamante, the University of Miami academic. “And the tenor of political discourse among Cubans doesn’t give me high hope for the defence of democratic values.”
Indeed, inside Cuba, misery has led to a cyclone of cynicism, projected in bitter humour. During the last May Day celebrations, a joke circulated that the vast annual march, when workers are bussed in from all corners, would no longer lead to the city’s Plaza de la Revolucion … but instead to the psychiatric hospital.
For those the revolution educated, the sad last act of the great experiment appears to be extraordinary individual tragedies. Says Hansing, “For many of the Cubans I know, these are the questions: what have I lived through? What was all that for? What was my life?”
Reading this article, my father-in-law Felix said sadly, “You [he meant western Europeans, Americans] use communism as a hammer, but to me it remains a beautiful idea – perhaps the most beautiful idea.”
I drive my family down the island for a cousin’s wedding. We take the northern road, past the tourist beaches of Varadero and along a crumbling highway next to Cuba’s palm-fringed coast. Despite the power cuts and lack of gasoline, it remains a journey I love above almost all others.
The people we pass appear exhausted, as if waiting for something they can no longer even articulate. My wife and I have made a habit of exploring Cuba’s sideroads and we do so again, arriving by chance at a hotel once known for its natural springs. The whole family get out. The lobby is clean and the shop is open, selling beach towels and hats. The staff are welcoming, their uniforms pressed. The swimming pool is empty and there are no guests. I ask when the last came through and the receptionist tells me four years ago.
Later, at the wedding in Sagua La Grande, where the power cuts are now more than 16 hours a day, the priest tells the congregation not to throw rice, but to instead give it to the happy couple.
Still caught by the story of the sappers blowing up the family’s trees, I suggest we visit the farm on the way back to Havana, and plant a few fresh saplings. From the highway, I see the gesture is unnecessary. The whole place has turned to thick forest. But Felix has brought a tree anyway, a lemon that had grown from a discarded fruit in the Santa Clara house in the years after his father, Felin, died in 2021.
We pick our way through the woods, through rattlebush and punarnava, Felix plunging ahead with such intent, I worry the rest of us will lose him. Finally we emerge into a clearing where the Caribbean sun is diffused by the canopy.
Nothing remains of the farm, not even the foundations of the house. We stand astonished. All traces of Felin’s work, of the eight couples who lived here, have disappeared. All the pain and sadness Felin suffered on losing his land was unnecessary, and is now forgotten by everyone except this family.
I start digging. My boy Santiago runs over to help, pulling up rich, fecund soil with his little hands. When it is deep enough, Felix plants the lemon tree.
We press down the roots and christen it with water. A burst of sunlight draws out the deep green of its leaves and a yellow butterfly, magnificent and huge, floats by. We all watch it go, its journey as random as madness.

As Chinese provinces slash revenue outlook, analysts warn of debt control
Local governments seen curbing infrastructure spending as Beijing’s fiscal discipline pushes regions to prioritise social services and tech over large projects
Fiscal strains are forcing Chinese provinces to slash their budget-revenue expectations for 2026 due to the knock-on effects of a five-year property market slump, and analysts cite the shift as a warning sign that intense debt pressures continue to drag down the nation’s economic growth outlook.
Major provinces are budgeting for 2 to 3 per cent growth this year in general public operating revenue, broadly in line with last year but below broader economic growth targets, Fitch Ratings said in a research note on Wednesday. It pointed to “subdued revenue momentum” and flagged debt-repayment risks.
“We believe local governments will prioritise debt control rather than pursue rapid expansion in infrastructure investment to prop up growth,” Fitch wrote, citing data from 23 Chinese provinces, regions and municipalities.
Low property values were expected to keep local investments in check.
“A sustained rebound in land purchases is unlikely in the near term, keeping [local government] capital revenue weak or flat in many provinces and constraining government-fund spending growth,” the credit rating agency said. “Operating spending discipline is also likely to persist, despite the Ministry of Finance’s indications that fiscal spending would be increased in 2026.
“We expect modest expenditure growth for [local government’s] general public budgets.”

US and Europe must ‘repair and revive transatlantic ties’: Germany’s Merz
German leader seeks to set tone of unity at Munich Security Council, as top US diplomat says ‘new era in geopolitics’.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called on the United States and Europe to “repair and revive transatlantic trust together” during an address at the Munich Security Conference.
Merz began his remarks on Friday at the annual meeting of top global security figures with an appeal for unity, arguing that Washington also benefits from its role in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

- list 3 of 3Trump is the ‘elephant in the room’ as the African Union holds new summit
The statement contrasted remarks by US Vice President JD Vance last year, who used his appearance at the event, just weeks after taking office, to chastise European leaders for their funding commitments to NATO and to criticise the state of democracy on the continent.
“Let me begin with the uncomfortable truth: A rift, a deep divide has opened between Europe and the United States,” Merz said.
“Vice President JD Vance said this a year ago here in Munich. He was right in his description,” Merz said, as he called for a “new transatlantic partnership”.
Referencing Trump’s Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, Merz also warned that Europe did not need to move in the same political direction as the US, saying the “culture war of the MAGA movement is not ours”.
Directly appealing to the Trump administration, he added: “In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone.
“Being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It is also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together. Europe is doing its part.”
‘A new era in geopolitics’
It remained unclear how receptive Washington would be to the message after a year of confrontational policies that have roiled traditional European allies.
That has included the increased pressure for more NATO funding, whiplash efforts to end Russia’s war in Ukraine and Trump’s threats to seize Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO-member Denmark.
The administration has also put renewed emphasis on what it has called Europe’s “civilizational self-confidence and Western identity”, calling on countries on the continent to stem migration, while accusing them of stifling right-wing voices.
Critics have said the messaging has racist undertones.
Leaving for Germany late Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the US is “very tightly linked together with Europe”, adding that “most people in this country can trace both, either their cultural or their personal heritage back to Europe. So, we just have to talk about that.
“We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to reexamine what that looks like,” said Rubio, who is set to speak on Friday.
The visit comes as Trump’s Republican Party prepares for the midterm elections in November, which will decide control of the US House of Representatives and Senate.
A slate of recent polls has suggested tanking support for Trump on several domestic issues, including his hardline immigration policy.
Polls have also shown voter disquiet over Trump’s actions abroad, including the US military abduction of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and Trump’s push to take control of Greenland.
A new poll released on Friday suggested seven in 10 US adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland.
The rate is higher than the overall disapproval of Trump’s foreign policy approach.
‘European nuclear deterrence’
Speaking on Friday, Germany’s Merz also confirmed he was holding talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on “European nuclear deterrence”.
Calls for a so-called European nuclear umbrella have gained new momentum amid the wider US strategic pivot away from Europe.
Under NATO’s existing arrangement, US nuclear weapons stationed in Europe can be deployed by aircraft from allied countries in the event of an emergency. US nuclear bombs are believed to be stored in northern Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and western Germany.
For its part, Germany has been required to renounce the manufacture, possession and control of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as part of a 1990 agreement on the country’s reunification.
Merz said any new policy would be in line with Berlin’s legal commitments.
Following the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union in 2020, France became the only nuclear-armed member of the bloc.

Teachers describe immigration enforcement's impact on classrooms in challenge of Trump policy
In a new court filing, teachers around the country describe how President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown is emptying classrooms and frightening families
- Bookmark
In one testimonial after another, teachers detailed all the ways President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has shaped their work and the lives of their students.
In a court filing Thursday, educators around the country described rumors of immigration raids that scared away students, immigrant parents who stopped sending their children to school altogether, and stories of parents and students — including one middle schooler — being picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at school bus stops.
The stories were shared as part of a a lawsuit challenging a Trump administration policy that opened up schools, houses of worship and medical facilities to immigration enforcement. Farmworker and teacher unions, churches and preschool educators filed the lawsuit last year in federal court in Eugene, Oregon, arguing that the policy was “arbitrary and capricious.”
As the impacts of immigration enforcement on schools and healthcare facilities grew, the plaintiffs filed a petition asking a judge to halt the Trump administration policy as the lawsuit proceeds.
“In recent months — and escalating in the past several weeks — immigration enforcement agents have made startling incursions into cities and towns around the country, including unprecedented and unrestrained surges in and around vital community institutions such as schools and healthcare facilities,” attorneys wrote.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
Administration officials have defended the policy in the past, saying that making schools, churches and other spaces off-limits to immigration enforcement could make them refuges for criminals.
Officials have said Immigrations and Customs Enforcement does not target schools for enforcement operations, but there have been several instances in recent months where immigration authorities have pursued or detained people on or near school property.
A new policy opened the door to arrests at schools
The government for more than three decades had barred immigration authorities from making arrests in schools and houses of worship. That policy was updated over the years to include other “protected areas,” such as hospitals and homeless shelters, to prevent enforcement actions that would restrict access to essential services and activities.
Shortly after Trump took office, his administration rescinded that policy, instead issuing a four-paragraph memo that advised officers to use “a healthy dose of common sense” when deciding whether to make arrests near “protected areas.”
As Trump has ramped up his efforts to deport millions of people, some of the arrests have been made near schools during pick-up and drop-off hours. The plaintiffs in the lawsuit include a trio of educators from an Oregon preschool, where ICE agents attempted to arrest a man in the parking lot after he dropped off his infant son.
In Chelsea, Massachusetts, teachers union president Kathryn Anderson said immigration enforcement has been more disruptive to learning than the COVID pandemic, which moved school online for months. The school system lost a significant number of students this year and absenteeism is higher than usual.
“Right now, kids of all backgrounds are being prevented from going to school because of the extremely real fear that either they or their family members will be separated,” said Anderson, who is not part of the lawsuit. “As an educator ... having to help kids move through and exist in that fear (has) been a near impossible task.”
During a Chicago operation in October, agents released tear gas that engulfed a school playground. They later arrested a teacher inside of her preschool during morning drop-off. DHS said agents had attempted to pull over the car she was riding in before she got to school and said she barricaded herself inside, forcing agents to enter. The woman, who has work authorization, was eventually released.
In Minneapolis, agents scuffled with bystanders after pursuing a man onto a high school campus as school was ending for the day.
Teachers describe fear trickling into classrooms
The court filing included testimony from 60 teachers and health care workers from 18 states who described how immigration enforcement near their schools and medical facilities has challenged their work. All submitted their testimony anonymously.
One middle school teacher said half of students stayed home amidst a rumor about immigration enforcement nearby. The following month, a student at the school was detained while at a bus stop.
Elsewhere, a speech pathologist described tearful meetings with immigrant parents fearful that signing documents to get their child special education services would draw the attention of immigration enforcement.
A high school teacher said many students, including immigrants still learning English, switched to virtual learning after a parent was arrested by ICE at a school bus stop. But the virtual option is only offered in English, and the teacher said they feared the students are falling behind.
A teacher at a another school said a student was detained by ICE at a school bus stop and never returned to class after being released. Now, when students ask whether they can be arrested at school, "I can no longer reassure them that campus is safe from ICE.”

UK High Court rules banning of anti-Israel group Palestine Action unlawful

UK High Court rules banning of anti-Israel group Palestine Action unlawful
Judges leave ban in place pending government’s expected appeal, but say ‘level, scale’ of group’s actions, including raids on military and industrial sites, don’t merit ‘terror’ label
Britain’s High Court ruled Friday that the government’s decision to outlaw the protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization was unlawful, but kept the ban in place pending another hearing, while the government prepares an appeal.
The UK government banned Palestine Action after activists in June 2025 broke into a Royal Air Force base and vandalized two planes, causing an estimated £7 million ($9.3 million) of damage, in protest of Britain’s military support for Israel amid the war in Gaza.
Judges Victoria Sharp, Jonathan Swift and Karen Steyn said that “the nature and scale of Palestine Action’s activities” did not meet the “level, scale and persistence” that would justify proscription.
The judges said they were “satisfied that the decision to proscribe Palestine Action was disproportionate.”
The government had declared the anti-Israel group a terrorist organization, alongside the likes of al-Qaeda and Hamas, making membership in or support for Palestine Action a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison.
Since then, more than 2,700 people have been arrested at protests for holding signs saying “I support Palestine Action.” More than 250 have been charged under the Terrorism Act.
Supporters of Palestine Action and civil liberties groups said the arrests ran roughshod over free speech and the right to peacefully protest.
Palestine Action co-founder Huda Ammori said the court’s decision “is a monumental victory both for our fundamental freedoms here in Britain and in the struggle for freedom for the Palestinian people, striking down a decision that will forever be remembered as one of the most extreme attacks on free speech in recent British history.”
Yasmine Ahmed, UK director of Human Rights Watch, called the court ruling “a shot in the arm for British democracy.” She said the British government had used anti-terror legislation to stifle legitimate criticism of Israel.
British Jews ‘deeply concerned,’ minister vows fight
UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said she was “disappointed by the court’s decision,” and pledged on X: “I will fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
In a statement after the verdict, Mahmood said: “The Court acknowledged that Palestine Action has carried out acts of terrorism, celebrated those who have taken part in those acts and promoted the use of violence.
“It has also concluded that Palestine Action is not an ordinary protest or civil disobedience group, and that its actions are not consistent with democratic values and the rule of law.”
The home secretary argued that the blacklisting “does not prevent peaceful protest in support of the Palestinian cause, another point on which the court agrees,” and insisted that some of the supporters of the group “don’t know the full nature of this organization.
“The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament,” she said, pledging on X: “I will fight this judgment in the Court of Appeal.”
In a joint statement, the UK’s Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews welcomed Mahmood’s response to the ruling, which they said “deeply concerned” them.
“The practical impact of Palestine Action’s activities on Jewish communal life has been significant and deeply unsettling,” the Jewish groups said. “Palestine Action has repeatedly targeted buildings hosting Jewish communal institutions, Jewish-owned businesses, or sites associated with Israel, in ways that cause fear and disruption far beyond the immediate protest sites.”
The Jewish groups said they would “seek urgent clarity” from the UK government, police and prosecutors “regarding the implications of this ruling and the steps they intend to take to ensure that communities are protected from intimidation and criminality. This includes ensuring appropriate legal tools are available.
“The safety of the British public including Jews must remain a priority,” the groups said.
Palestine Action has carried out acts of “direct action” at military and industrial sites in the UK since the group’s formation in 2020, including breaking into facilities owned by Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems UK.
Last week, a UK jury found six Palestine Action members not guilty of aggravated burglary at an Elbit UK site in Bristol in August 2024. One of them was also acquitted of causing grievous bodily harm despite being filmed striking a policewoman with a sledgehammer, resulting in a fractured spine. UK prosecutors said Saturday that they would seek a retrial in the case following sharp criticism from lawmakers, police leaders and Jewish organizations.
Officials say Palestine Action’s activities have caused millions of pounds in damage that affects national security.
In their ruling Friday, the judges said that while “a very small number of its actions have amounted to terrorist action … regardless of proscription, the criminal law is available to prosecute those concerned.”
The justices said they would not quash the ban until a further hearing on whether it should stay in place “pending the possibility of an appeal.” They gave lawyers for the two sides until Feb. 20 to prepare for that hearing.
London’s Metropolitan Police force said that in light of the judgment, officers would not arrest people expressing support for Palestine Action, but would continue to gather evidence of offenses “to provide opportunities for enforcement at a later date.”

Falling cocoa prices won't necessarily mean cheaper Valentine's Day chocolates
Cocoa prices have fallen nearly 70% since last Valentine’s Day, but that won’t make heart-shaped boxes of chocolate or even chocolate Easter bunnies more affordable this year
- Bookmark
Cocoa prices have fallen nearly 70% since last Valentine's Day, but that won’t make heart-shaped boxes of chocolate or even chocolate Easter bunnies more affordable this year.
Chocolate prices at U.S. retail stores rose 14% between Jan. 1 and the first week of February compared to the same period last year, according to market research company Datasembly. That’s on top of a 7.8% increase for the same period in 2025.
Europe has seen even steeper price increases. In Germany, chocolate prices rose 18.9% in 2025, according to government figures.
Here’s what caused the price of cocoa futures to rise and then fall — and why that may not be reflected in the prices customers are paying.
Cocoa, climate and cost
Cocoa prices more than doubled in 2024 due to insufficient rainfall and crop diseases in West Africa, which supplies more than 70% of the world’s cocoa. Cocoa, which is made from the dried beans of the cacao tree, is the main ingredient in both dark and white chocolate.
Weather conditions have improved since then in Ivory Coast and Ghana, and cocoa production is increasing in Ecuador and other countries, according to an analysis by J.P. Morgan. The resulting supply increase is one reason cocoa prices are coming down.
But they're also dropping because of lower global demand. Chocolate getting more expensive has turned off consumers, so manufacturers have cut the amount of chocolate they use or shifted to other products like gummy candies to keep prices in check, said Chris Costagli, a food thought leader at the market research company NIQ.
In the U.S., annual retail sales of chocolate rose 6.7% in 2025 compared to the prior year, largely because of price increases, according to NIQ data. But the number of individual products sold was down 1.3%, as consumers bought less chocolate overall.
Tariffs on treats
The Trump administration's tariffs were another reason U.S. chocolate prices increased last year.
The administration put a tariff averaging 15% on cocoa-producing countries last February, which raised the price of U.S. cocoa imports, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve.
In November, the administration removed tariffs on cocoa and other commodities that can't be grown in the U.S., including coffee, spices and tropical fruit.
But tariffs of 15% or more on products from the European Union, including chocolates, remain in place.
What goes up... may stay up
So far, declining cocoa prices haven't necessarily let chocolate lovers pay less.
Costagli compares the situation to gas prices. Even when the cost of oil goes down, prices at the pump don't immediately follow because companies need to use up the oil they bought at a higher price.
Chocolate makers like The Hershey Co. have long-term contracts that may require them to pay more than current cocoa prices. The market also is volatile; companies know that another bout of poor weather or a surge in demand could make cocoa prices surge again.
But Costagli said companies also watch shoppers' reaction to prices.
“If the customer is still willing to pay that higher price point, do we really take the price down?" he said.
Mondelez International, which owns chocolate brands like Oreo, Cadbury and Toblerone, raised its prices by 8% globally in 2025 to counter higher cocoa costs.
In Europe, the company hiked prices by even more and saw a significant decrease in the amount of its products sold. As a result, Mondelez lowered prices this year in some markets, including the United Kingdom and Germany.
“We have learned that certain price points are very important, and so we have adjusted already to put our products at the right price point,” Mondelez Chairman and CEO Dirk Van de Put said during a February conference call with investors.
Van de Put said Mondelez didn't plan immediate price cuts in North America, where both its price increases and its sales volume losses were more moderate.
Trading up ... or down
Two segments of the chocolate market grew in the U.S. last year: value brands and super-premium brands, Costagli said.
The expanded interest in higher-end chocolate may seem surprising if consumers balked at paying more for a Snickers bar or a pack of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. But the companies behind super-premium lines like Ferrero Rocher, Justin's and Lindt Excellence were less aggressive about instituting cocoa-related price increases since their products already were more expensive, Costagli said.
As mainstream chocolate makers like Hershey and Mars raised prices, some customers decided they'd just spend a little more, he said.
“It's given the aspirational shopper that little push they need to trade up. If they wanted a better product, if they wanted better experience, better product characteristics, organic, fair trade, whatever it might be,” Costagli said.
On the flip side, value brands — think Whitman's or some store-brand chocolates — also sold more products in the U.S. last year as price-conscious shoppers traded down from mainstream brands.
“The savings you get by trading down is actually greater than it used to be,” Costagli said. “So from an aspirational perspective, it’s easier to trade up, and from a financially insecure perspective, it saves you more to trade down.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The acquired toughness of the monetary policy creates required conditions for inflation returning to target of 4%, Governor of the Bank of Russia Elvira Nabiullina said at a press conference after the Board meeting.
"The built-up toughness of the monetary policy creates necessary conditions for inflation to return to the target level of 4%," she said.
The peak of inflation was in December 2024 and in January 2026, Nabiullina noted.
"The inflation pressure peak was indeed in January, from our point of view. When speaking about stable inflation, we believe the peak was in December 2024. Concerning the peak of inflation expectations, we will keep an eye on it attentively," she added.

Eurozone trade ends 2025 with a €12.6bn surprise surplus

Strong export growth helped the bloc maintain a hefty annual trade surplus, even as December’s balance narrowed to €12.6bn.
The eurozone closed out 2025 with a solid trade surplus, as exports kept rising even though some major industries brought in less money, according to new figures from Eurostat.
The bloc recorded a €12.6bn surplus in goods trade with the rest of the world in December 2025, underlining the resilience of European exporters at the end of the year.
According to Eurostat, “the first estimates of euro area balance showed a €12.6bn surplus in trade in goods with the rest of the world in December 2025, compared with +€13.9 bn in December 2024”.
Exports from the eurozone reached €234bn in December, up 3.4% year on year from €226.3bn, while imports rose 4.2% to €221.3bn. The result was a comfortable surplus, even though it narrowed slightly compared with a year earlier.
Full-year surplus holds above €160bn
Across the whole of 2025, the eurozone maintained a strong external position.
From January to December 2025, the bloc recorded a €164.6bn trade surplus, only modestly below the €168.9bn surplus seen in the same period of 2024.
Exports for the full year climbed to €2,937.9bn, a 2.4% increase compared with 2024, while imports rose 2.7% to €2,773.3bn. Trade within the eurozone also grew, with intra-euro area trade reaching €2,627.6bn, up 2.0% year on year.
Seasonally adjusted figures show a slight improvement at the end of the year. Eurostat data highlighted that “in December 2025 compared with November 2025, eurozone seasonally adjusted exports increased by 1.1%, while imports increased by 0.6%”.
As a result, “the seasonally adjusted balance was €11.6 bn, an increase compared with November (€10.2 bn)”.
Sector shifts reshape the balance
The story behind the numbers indicates that the composition of the surplus shifted. The overall balance narrowed compared with December 2024 largely because of weaker surpluses in some of the euro area’s traditional industrial strongholds.
Eurostat noted that “this change can be attributed to declines in surplus across certain sectors, notably in chemicals and related products, where the surplus fell from €20.2bn in December 2024 to €16.5bn in December 2025”.
It added that “surplus decreased in the sectors of machineries and vehicles, other manufactured goods and raw materials”.
The energy sector, however, provided a bright spot. Eurostat highlighted that “the energy sector showed improvement, with the deficit reducing from -€24.5bn in December 2024 to -€19.1bn in December 2025”.
EU-wide picture also positive
Across the wider European Union, the pattern was similar. The EU posted a €12.9bn surplus in December 2025, compared with €14.2bn a year earlier.
Extra-EU exports rose to €214.8bn in December, up 2.2% year on year, while imports increased 3.0% to €201.9bn. Over the full year, the EU recorded a €133.5bn surplus, down slightly from €140.6bn in 2024.
Despite the modest narrowing, the data point to a broadly stable trade performance, with export growth continuing into the final month of the year and the bloc maintaining a sizeable external surplus.

UN creates first global AI safety panel as tech insiders sound alarm over the technology

Antonio Guterres, the UN's secretary-general, said the panel is a 'foundational step toward global scientific understanding of AI.'
The UN appointed a 40-member global scientific panel this week that will study the risks of artificial intelligence (AI), despite strong opposition from the United States. The move comes as former employees at AI companies sounded the alarm about the technology.
The UN's General Assembly voted 117-2 to approve the panel, with the United States and Paraguay voting no, and abstentions from Tunisia and Ukraine. Russia, China and European allies voted in favour.
The experts on the Independent International Scientific Panel on Artificial Intelligence (AI) will publish an annual report that synthesises and analyses AI's risks, opportunities and impacts in what the UN calls the "first global scientific body of its kind."
The panel's adoption is a "foundational step toward global scientific understanding of AI," said Antonio Guterres, the UN's secretary-general.
“In a world where AI is racing ahead,” Guterres said, “this panel will provide what’s been missing — rigorous, independent scientific insight that enables all member states, regardless of their technological capacity, to engage on an equal footing.”
The UN vote comes as employees walk out of artificial intelligence companies due to concerns over their practices.
Mrinank Sharma, Anthropic's former safety researcher, warned in an open letter that "the world is in peril," with the development of AI and other crises.
While OpenAI's former top researcher, Zoe Hitzig, told the New York Times that she has "deep reservations" about the strategy that her former company is taking.
Some of the world's most prominent figures in AI, such as Dario Amodei, the CEO of Anthropic, OpenAI’s Sam Altman and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, have also warned about the risks of AI.
'A significant overreach of the UN's mandate'
The UN's 40 members were selected from more than 2,600 candidates after an independent review by several UN bodies and the International Telecommunications Union, according to Guterres. They will serve for three-year terms.
Europe has 12 seats at the table: Joelle Barral of France, Melahat Bilge Demirkoz from Turkey, Finland's Anna Korhonen, Mark Coeckelbergh from Belgium, Latvia's Aleksandra Korolova, Russia's Andrei Neznamov, Germany's Maximilian Nickel and Bernhard Scholkopf, Spain's Roman Orus, Austria's Johanna Pirker, Poland's Piotr Sankowski and Silvio Savarese from Italy.
Lauren Lovelace, the US' representative, called the panel “a significant overreach of the UN's mandate and competence” and said “AI governance is not a matter for the UN to dictate.”
Instead, Lovelace asked the UN to focus on its "core missions," such as international peace and security, human rights and humanitarian assistance, instead of "attempting to regulate or stifle the development of cross-cutting ... technologies that will determine economic and strategic competition in the twenty-first century."
US President Donald Trump has pushed for minimal AI regulation, where he aims to cut federal red tape and avoid a "patchwork" of state laws that could slow innovation. The US and China are considered neck-in-neck in the AI adoption race.
Despite the US' opposition, they still have two representatives on the panel: Vipin Kumar, a University of Minnesota professor and Martha Palmer, a retired University of Colorado professor and linguistics expert.

Trump’s push for Greenland reveals a political weak spot, new AP-NORC poll finds

Trump’s push for Greenland reveals a political weak spot, new AP-NORC poll finds
Trump’s push for Greenland reveals a political weak spot, new AP-NORC poll finds
WASHINGTON (AP) — Republicans may be willing to stick with President Donald Trump through almost anything, but his recent push to seize control of Greenland has turned off many in his own party, according to a new AP-NORC poll.
The survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that about 7 in 10 U.S. adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the issue of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. That’s higher than the share who dislike how he’s handling foreign policy generally, suggesting that Trump’s Greenland approach has created a weak spot for the administration. About 24% of American adults approve of Trump’s Greenland approach.
Even Republicans aren’t thrilled. About half disapprove of his attempt to turn the icebound landmass into American territory, something that Trump has insisted is critical for national security in the Arctic, while about half approve.
The poll was conducted Feb. 5-8, which is after Trump had made the decision to scrap tariffs designed to pressure European countries into supporting U.S. control of Greenland, but after his weekslong push for American intervention over the island.
About half of Republicans disapprove of Trump on Greenland
Trump’s base is normally unwavering behind him, so Greenland stands out as an exception.
The marks represent Trump’s lowest ratings among Republicans on a list of key issues in the poll, including the economy and immigration — where about 8 in 10 approve — and foreign policy generally. About 7 in 10 Republicans approve of his overall foreign policy approach.
Trump has argued that the U.S. needs Greenland to counter threats from Russia and China in the Arctic region, despite America already having a military presence there.
Other recent polls, including a Pew Research Center survey conducted in January, found that Republicans were largely divided on whether the U.S. should take over Greenland, while Americans overall were opposed.
Ayman Amir, a 46-year-old Trump supporter from Houston, Texas, said he agrees that Greenland holds strategic importance for the United States’ military. But that doesn’t mean he thinks Trump should claim it.
“We can’t take it by force. We don’t have a right to do that,” Amir said. “You can’t blame Russia for what they do in Ukraine and then do the same thing. You can’t do this.”
Trump’s overall foreign policy approval remains steady
The president dropped his threats to seize the territory by force late last month after saying a framework for a deal over access to Greenland was reached with help from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.
The clash represents just one of the moves Trump has made to strain relationships with key allies over the last year. Western leaders are focusing on trans-Atlantic tensions this week at the Munich Security Conference.
On Greenland, Trump has few vocal supporters at home or abroad.
Even as Trump made significant moves to obtain control of Greenland, his overall approval on the issue of foreign policy has remained steady. About 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of Trump’s approach to foreign policy, a measure that’s been unchanged in recent months.
Young Republicans especially disapprove of Greenland approach
Younger Republicans are especially likely to disapprove of how Trump is handling the situation.
About 6 in 10 Republicans under 45 say they disapprove of his leadership on Greenland, compared to about 4 in 10 older Republicans.
That 4 in 10 who approve of Trump’s Greenland actions is much lower than young Republicans’ approval on issues of foreign policy, the economy, or immigration.
Independent voter Aaron Gunnoe, 29, an engineer from Marion, Ohio, was baffled by Trump’s aggressive posture on the NATO ally.
“It’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” he said. “It’s owned by somebody else. That should be the end of it.”

The AP-NORC poll of 1,156 adults was conducted Feb. 5-8 using a sample drawn from NORC’s probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for adults overall is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. The margin of sampling error for Republicans overall is plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.

Ukraine expects new IMF program to be approved 'in coming weeks'
Government Commissioner for Public Debt Management Yuriy Butsa said this in an interview with Reuters, Ukrinform reports.
Butsa believes that formal IMF Board sign-off on the money should come very soon.
"I would expect it in a matter of weeks. I think February is still doable in terms of a timeline," he said.
According to the government commissioner, all the numbers have already been agreed upon.
"We already agreed on all the numbers for this and next year and will cover it (budget deficit) from existing commitments," he said.
Commenting on talks about a potential U.S.-brokered ceasefire ahead of the anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Butsa noted that even after a ceasefire, Ukraine would need to maintain a large and strong army and continue rearmament, meaning that financial pressure would not ease.
He added that Ukraine was unlikely to rush to issue more international market debt whenever the war does end. Instead it will keep using cheap concessional lending and borrow in local currency debt markets where it doesn't face currency.
On November 26, 2025, the IMF and the Ukrainian authorities reached a staff-level agreement on a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with potential access of up to $8.2 billion.
The IMF said the launch of the new program for Ukraine depends on the country meeting prior actions and securing financing assurances. These prior actions include, among other things, adopting the 2026 state budget, broadening the tax base to include revenues from online operations, closing customs loopholes for consumer goods imports, and abolishing VAT registration exemptions.
IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said during a visit to Kyiv on January 15 that the issue of introducing VAT for sole proprietors in Ukraine must be resolved.
On February 13, Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said that the Cabinet of Ministers would not submit a bill to parliament this month on registering sole proprietors as VAT payers.

How two extremists planned ‘mass murder’ of Jewish community in Manchester
- Walid Saadaoui and Amar Hussein have been handed life sentences for plotting a mass shooting targeting an antisemitism march and a Jewish community in Manchester.
- Saadaoui had planned to smuggle four AK-47 rifles, two pistols, and 900 rounds of ammunition into the UK for the attack.
- The plot, driven by extremist ideology and admiration for ISIS, was foiled after Saadaoui shared his plans with an undercover operative.
- Saadaoui was arrested in May 2024 while attempting to take possession of assault rifles and ammunition.
- Prosecutors stated that had the terrorists succeeded, it would have resulted in mass murder and been one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish communities in the UK.

A new round of US-brokered talks between Russia and Ukraine is set for Geneva next week
Envoys from Russia and Ukraine are to meet for a new round of U.S.-brokered talks in Geneva next week as both sides keep fighting and trading long-range strikes
- Bookmark
Another round of U.S.-brokered talks between envoys from Russia and Ukraine will take place next week in Geneva, days ahead of the fourth anniversary of the all-out Russian invasion of its neighbor, officials in Moscow and Kyiv said on Friday.
The meeting will be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s communications adviser, Dmytro Lytvyn, confirmed the new round of negotiations.
The talks take place against a backdrop of continued fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile) front line, relentless Russian bombardment of civilian areas of Ukraine and the country’s power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on war-related assets on Russian soil.
Previous U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Zelenskyy said last week that the United States has given Ukraine and Russia a June deadline to reach a deal. Previous deadlines given by U.S. President Donald Trump have passed largely without consequence.
Zelenskyy in Munich
Zelenskyy was in Munich, Germany, on Friday and visited the first joint Ukrainian-German company for the production of drones. Germany has been a major backer of Ukraine in the war.
He was also due to hold bilateral and multilateral meetings at the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top international security figures.
Russia’s bigger army has managed to capture about 20% of Ukraine since hostilities began in 2014 and its full-scale invasion of Feb. 24 2022. Its battlefield progress has been slow and costly in terms of troops and armor.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that “the Russians are not winning (the war) as some are thinking.”
“This so-called Russian bear is not there,” he told reporters. “It is basically still the speed of a garden snail, what we are seeing in Ukraine — this is how the Russians are moving inside Ukraine, very slow, staggering losses.”
Finding compromises is hard
The negotiators heading to Geneva have the tough task of finding compromises that are palatable to both Moscow and Kyiv.
Russian President Vladimir Putin’s adviser Vladimir Medinsky, who headed Moscow’s team of negotiators in the first direct peace talks with Ukraine in Istanbul in March 2022, is returning to lead Moscow’s delegation.
The previous two rounds of trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi reportedly focused on military issues, such as a possible buffer zone and ceasefire monitoring. The return of Medinsky, who has pushed Russian President Vladimir Putin’s maximalist conditions for peace, could mark a shift toward political issues in the next round of talks.
Ukraine’s delegation will again be led by Rustem Umerov, Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council chief.
It was not clear which American officials would be in Geneva. In the UAE capital, the Trump administration was represented by envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.
War of attrition
The grim war of attrition is continuing while the two sides negotiate.
Overnight from Thursday to Friday, a Russian strike killed three brothers between 8 and 19 years of age in eastern Ukraine, authorities said. Their mother and grandmother survived but sustained multiple injuries, the Donetsk regional prosecutor’s office said.
In Odesa, one person was killed and six more injured in a Russian strike at the city’s port and energy infrastructure, officials said.
The Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday its air defenses shot down 58 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions and annexed Crimea during the night.
Of those, 43 were brought down in the Volgograd region of southwestern Russia, where three people, including a 12-year-old boy, were injured by drone debris, according to the local governor. Ukraine has recently targeted the Volgograd oil refinery.

France’s ‘French Response’ uses memes and sarcasm to fight disinformation on X

Through posts combining provocation, humour and irony, the "French Response" account has taken potshots at trolls, but also top-level politicians. It is part of a wider strategy led by Paris to combat disinformation, ministry told Euronews.
France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ramped up its fight against disinformation with "French Response", an official X account which replies to trolls and fake news with humour, irony and provocation.
The account has amassed more than 180,000 followers since its creation in September, taking aim at disinformation peddled by pro-Russian users and US accounts. Meanwhile, White House-aligned accounts have increasingly targeted France on X in recent months.
According to ministry spokesman Pascal Confavreux, France has decided to shake up its strategy to actively combat disinformation.
"The intuition was that you can't win the information war if you don't fight the battle. So we had to raise our voice," Confavreux told Euronews.
"We have changed our stance, with a rapid reaction to foreign informational attacks against us, so that we can re-establish a form of dissuasion, in other words by exposing the ridiculous, the big tricks or the big lies", he said.
"We're using the codes of social networking with a virality that will enable us to increase our audience and reach precisely those who hear only manipulated information."
The account combines sarcasm and meme language in its responses to what it identifies as trolls and disinformation. The ministry reported that the account generates approximately 15 million impressions weekly.
The account's first post responded to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's claim that Hamas withdrew from hostage negotiations immediately after France announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state.
French Response posted a timeline showing Israeli officials had reported the collapse of talks before President Emmanuel Macron's announcement.
The account has also defended the EU's investigations into X, responding to claims that the probes constitute "censorship" of freedom of expression.
"Judicial scrutiny should be a welcome spotlight, not something to run from," the account stated in a February post that garnered more than 1 million views.
"European interests are often the target of misinformation. The Digital Services Act, a European regulation which aims to make digital platforms more accountable, is also frequently targeted by disinformation," Confavreux explained.
Asked about the risk of legitimising the techniques used by trolls by using them for diplomatic purposes, he said: "We will respond to trolls, but we are not trolls ourselves."
In another recent public spat, French Response took aim at a pro-Russian account named "Loetitia" sharing a viral video featuring doctored email exchanges that implicated Macron in the latest tranche of the Epstein files.
As part of the campaign, a false article sharing the same allegations was also posted on a website impersonating the fringe French outlet France-Soir.
In a tongue-in-cheek post, French Response moderators responded to the X video.
"It turns out that Loetitia holds global secrets. It turns out that AI puts them into images. It turns out that the France Soir article does not exist. It turns out that Russian networks are amplifying it directly," their reply said.
France's diplomatic communications shift has not been restricted to its French Response account.
In May 2025, the Élysée's official X account responded to a pro-Russian disinformation campaign which alleged that French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer were caught taking cocaine on their trip to Kyiv.
The Élysée shared a meme mocking allegations that the leaders had a bag of cocaine and a snuff spoon on their meeting table — stating that "misinformation" was being used to "pass off a simple tissue as drugs."
Experts warn about 'trolling tactics'
Ruslan Trad, an expert in global security at the Digital Forensic Research Lab, warned: "When official diplomatic channels adopt trolling tactics, they implicitly validate the information ecosystem's descent into provocation-based discourse".
He added that matching adversaries' tone risks "creating equivalence in audiences' minds between democratic institutions and disinformation actors."
It is unclear whether the account could reach the most vulnerable segments of the population, particularly given the rising distrust of institutions in France and across the continent.
A 2025 study by the Fondation Jean-Jaurès, Cevipof and the Institut Montaigne found that distrust of institutions and politicians alike has increased over the past year. Separately, 62% of French people believe they should "be wary of what the media say about the major issues of the day," according to a 2025 survey.
"What counts is not so much the number of followers that 'French Response' accumulates, but the number of engagements," Confavreux retorted. "These posts need to be seen, particularly by those who are the target of these manipulations."

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has said that Russia's Northern Fleet is very strong.
"The Russian Northern Fleet is highly active in the Arctic with nuclear-powered submarines and its fleet," the minister warned. "We are talking about a very, very strong military maritime power there." "These are very, very powerful naval forces we're talking about," Pistorius told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, raising the topic of Germany's participation in NATO's Arctic Sentry mission.
The Northern Fleet is an operational-strategic formation of the Russian Navy. Its missions include "implementation of measures to protect the integrity and inviolability of the territory of Russia" and maintaining naval strategic nuclear forces in constant readiness in the interests of nuclear deterrence. The fleet’s flagship is the heavy nuclear-powered missile cruiser The Pyotr Veliky. The Russian Northern Fleet consists of more than 40 submarines and over 40 surface ships and boats.

Temple Mount’s delicate balance tested as Jewish prayer, Ramadan crowds meet

The Temple Mount: The very words evoke strong feelings among diverse peoples. Let us explore other aspects of what makes this site arguably “the center of the world.”
For Jews, the Temple Mount is the site of the First and Second Temples – the center of ancient worship and the heart of Jewish memory. Yet the rhythms of modern life on the Mount are shaped in large part by the Muslim calendar, especially Ramadan, which brings tens of thousands of worshipers to al-Haram al-Sharif.
During this month-long daytime fast, the esplanade is crowded, especially in the final 10 nights, and security is heightened to protect and control tens of thousands of worshipers – and the Jews who brave the ascent, as well as those praying at the Western Wall below.
For Jewish visitors, Ramadan is not just an observation of Muslim practice – it is a period when access and visibility on the Mount are constrained, and when the smallest gestures of prayer can carry heightened significance. Whispering a “Shema” prayer, prostrating quietly, or holding and learning from a Torah page becomes a deliberate act of devotion against the backdrop of centuries of exclusion.
Historically, Jewish access to the Mount has been limited, and tensions have flared during Ramadan when overlapping holidays or large crowds have complicated movement. Today, police allow controlled Jewish prayer in certain areas – a small but powerful reclaiming of presence during times when the site holy to two cultures is otherwise filled.
“There has never been a time in Jerusalem’s history with such religious tolerance for all believers like this period of Israeli rule,” said Rabbi Shmuel Rabinowitz, rabbi of the Western Wall and Holy Sites. “The hundreds of thousands of Muslims who ascend the Temple Mount uninterrupted daily, and even more so throughout the blessed days of Ramadan, can testify to this.”
For Jewish visitors, Ramadan underscores the fragility – and the value – of access. It is a reminder that while the Mount remains under Waqf administration, the right to ascend and pray, even quietly, is a hard-won achievement. Each visit, each whispered prayer, is part of a continuum that stretches from Solomon to today: a living connection to Jewish history at the site where history itself was and continues to be made.
Perspectives: The Temple Mount today – change in practice
For decades after 1967, the Temple Mount was defined by a simple rule: Jews could visit but not pray. Muslim worshipers claimed the esplanade; Israeli police enforced quiet access below. The arrangement was called the “status quo,” and for a long time it mostly worked – until recently.
Small but meaningful changes are quietly shifting that balance. Jewish visitors now regularly ascend the Mount, sometimes bringing prayer books, sometimes whispering under their breath. Police often allow these gestures, as long as they are discreet and brief. As mentioned in the main article, one visitor described prostrating for up to five minutes without interruption – an apparently small event but large in the grand spiritual scheme and historic for those who have long been excluded.
The Mount’s paradox is clear: Laws may or may not change, but practice does. Court rulings affirm the right to visit certain areas, while rabbinic authorities weigh ritual restrictions; police calibrate security, and visitors navigate the gray zone. The Mount is controlled, yet negotiable; sacred, yet monitored.
High-profile visits have a way of escalating attention. Politicians have ascended and walked the site – like former prime minister Ariel Sharon in 2000 when he was the leader of the opposition and, more recently, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, who has ascended several times, most recently on October 8, 2025, the day after the second anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre.
Such visits, whether drawing scrutiny and criticism from some, or support and encouragement from others, remind everyone that such presence is both symbolic and significant, and IT can also be provocative. These visits are rare but potent reminders that the Mount is always more than a physical space; it is a living focal point of memory and sovereignty.

These visits are rare but potent reminders that the Mount is always more than a physical space; it is a living focal point of memory and sovereignty.
Debates continue behind the scenes, sometimes spilling out into the open. Some rabbis forbid ascent on halachic grounds; others advocate for broader Jewish presence. Activist groups press for expanded access, while police remain cautious, mindful of crowd dynamics and regional and cultural sensitivities.
On the Muslim side, fears of encroachment persist, shaping responses even to quiet, controlled visits, as mentioned in the main article. But why should Jews feel like they are encroaching on a place that is originally – and should now be at least equally – theirs?
The result is a holy, contentious site where tiny shifts carry enormous symbolic weight. Each allowed prayer, each permitted tour, is a visible crack in decades - or even centuries-old patterns.
For those who climb its steps, the experience is more than procedural – it is a living connection to centuries of prayer and Jewish history. On the Temple Mount, the “status quo” is never still; it moves and shifts – incrementally, carefully, and with immense meaning.

What happened to the Syrians detained and disappeared by Israel?

What happened to the dozens of Syrians detained and forcibly disappeared by Israeli forces?
In the weeks following Bashar al-Assad's fall on 8 December 2024, Israeli forces invaded areas of southwestern Syria beyond the Golan Heights, which they had occupied since 1967, seizing areas inside a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone and beyond.
Since then, families across the southern cities of Quneitra and Daraa and the town of Beit Jinn say Israeli forces have been detaining civilians during raids, incursions and patrols in border areas.
What began as scattered reports has now developed into a documented pattern, with lawyers and rights groups saying at least 43 Syrians remain held in Israeli detention, including at least one child.
Former detainees describe being blindfolded, interrogated and, in some cases, transferred into Israel itself. Others speak of months spent without charge, without access to lawyers, and without their families knowing where they were being held.
The arrests come amid Israel's continued illegal military presence inside southern Syria, which Israeli officials have framed as a "security zone" intended to prevent alleged threats near the Golan.
By March 2025 however, Defence Minister Israel Katz publicly stated that Israeli forces were prepared to remain in Syria for an "unlimited" period, reinforcing concerns that the detentions were unfolding within a deepening and open-ended military presence beyond the occupied Golan Heights.
How many Syrians are being held?
Ahmad al-Moussa, a lawyer who has been documenting the arrests, told The New Arab's affiliate Syria TV that the number of Syrian detainees had previously reached 50, although seven were released in recent weeks.
Four were freed shortly before a fact-finding visit by the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances to Quneitra last month, while three others were released ahead of the group's sessions in late January.
According to al-Moussa, 43 Syrians remain in detention, including four who were children at the time of their arrest, and one who is currently under 18.
Thirty-nine of those detentions took place after 8 December 2024, the day Israeli forces entered parts of southern Syria beyond the long-standing buffer zone.
Additional testimonies to The New Arab's sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, as well as local monitoring, suggest the number of abductions may be higher.
Activists and local sources told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed last month that dozens of incidents have been recorded in villages in the Yarmouk Basin and areas near the separation line, with civilians seized during military incursions, from their workplaces, or while moving between towns.
Al-Moussa says he has compiled individual case files and submitted them to the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearances, while also contacting the Human Rights Council, the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Syria and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
With the assistance of Israel-based rights groups, including HaMoked, lawyers were appointed to represent some detainees. Al-Moussa says that legal pressure contributed to the release of seven individuals so far, though dozens remain in custody.
He adds that sustained advocacy had led to a fact-finding visit to Quneitra in December, where officials met families of detainees, and the issue was discussed during a dedicated session at the UN Human Rights Council. Further clarification on detention locations and legal status is still being sought.
Detainees being transferred to notorious Sde Teiman facility
Testimony from a recently released detainee has intensified concerns that some of the detainees were transferred to facilities in Israel where horrific abuse of Palestinian detainees has taken place.
The man, cited by Syria TV, says he was held for more than two months and reported encountering around 50 Syrian detainees inside Sde Teiman prison near Beersheba in southern Israel, where Palestinian detainees have been subjected to rape, starvation, and torture by Israeli forces.
Other testimonies point to detainees being held in Ofer prison near Ramallah and in Nafha desert prison.
One case that drew attention is that of Shadi Zeina, a 17-year-old from the Damascus countryside town of Kanaker, who disappeared during an Israeli incursion on 29 July 2025.
His mother, Samar Dreiby, told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that she had spent two months searching for him before learning through released Palestinian detainees that he was being held in Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.
She had contacted the International Committee of the Red Cross and HaMoked before confirmation came that her son was in Israeli custody.
According to former detainees who met him, Shadi had not been formally charged and had not been visited by a lawyer.
The transfer of detainees from Syrian territory into Israel would raise serious legal issues. Under the Fourth Geneva Convention, protected persons in occupied territory must not be forcibly transferred to the territory of the occupying power.
Such transfers can constitute grave breaches of international humanitarian law and may carry individual criminal responsibility.
Legal experts say that detaining civilians without clear charges, denying information about their whereabouts, or refusing to acknowledge their detention could also amount to arbitrary detention or enforced disappearance under international human rights law, which continues to apply during military occupation.
What are former detainees saying about what happened to them?
One young man from Jbata al-Khashab described to Al-Araby Al-Jadeed being seized by a seven-member Israeli force along with three others.
Blindfolded and taken to what he believes was a military site inside Syria, he said he was questioned about his political views, his family, and whether he had any links to the Lebanese group Hezbollah or Iran.
A map was placed in front of him, and he was asked to identify homes and neighbourhoods before he was released seven hours later. The fate of the three others detained with him remains unknown.
Another Syrian man, who spent seven months in Israeli detention, described his experience as a "nightmare". He said he was first held at the Sde Teiman camp, where he spent around four months without formal charges or a court appearance.
He described harsh detention conditions and sustained physical and psychological abuse, including severe beatings, prolonged stress positions, painful restraints, solitary confinement, sleep deprivation and repeated interrogation sessions lasting up to six hours.
He was later transferred to Ofer prison, where questioning continued.
How many cases may qualify as disappeared?
Almoutassim Al-Kilani, founder of the rights group Min Haqqi, says his organisation has documented 41 cases of disappearance since 8 December 2024.
Families have no confirmed information about where many detainees are being held, with some believed to have been transferred to facilities inside Israel, based on testimony from released detainees.
Under international law, enforced disappearance occurs when a person is deprived of liberty by state agents and their fate or whereabouts are concealed or denied.
Al-Kilani says the combination of detention and a lack of information places individuals outside the protection of the law.
He notes that while UN mechanisms can request urgent clarification, they lack direct enforcement power.
He says the International Committee of the Red Cross can visit detainees and help families communicate with them confidentially, while the Committee on Enforced Disappearances can push authorities for answers, but neither has the power to force Israel to release the detainees immediately.
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Commission of Detainees and Ex-Detainees Affairs says it has attempted to organise visits for Syrian detainees and pursue legal interventions, but Israeli prison authorities have so far refused to grant permission.
The commission is preparing to petition Israel's Supreme Court in an effort to obtain access.
For many families in southern Syria, however, the legal process offers little immediate relief. Months after their relatives were seized, they remain without confirmed information, without visits, and without clarity about what charges, if any, have been brought against them.

Ukraine's battlefield lessons drive UK to spend over $545 million on hypersonic, long-range weapons in 2026
The U.K. plans to spend 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) on hypersonic and long-range weapons in 2026, drawing on lessons from Russia's war in Ukraine, the U.K. Defense Ministry announced on Feb. 13.
The announcement comes as the annual security conference opens in Munich, running on Feb. 13–15, with about 50 world leaders and government officials expected to attend, including President Volodymyr Zelensky.
"To meet this new era of rising threats, we need hard power, strong alliances, and sure diplomacy," U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey said.
"We can see from the war in Ukraine the decisive impact of long-range precision weapons, so the U.K. is stepping up, investing more than 400 million pounds ($545.4 million) in long-range and hypersonic weapons this year," Healey added.
The planned investments will also support joint weapons projects with France, Germany, and Italy, the statement said.
The Stratus program, a collaboration between the U.K., France, and Italy, is developing a next-generation stealth missile to replace the Storm Shadow. The new missile is designed to "defeat high-value targets, destroy enemy ships, and suppress enemy air defenses," the statement said.
Separately, a joint long-range weapons program between the U.K. and Germany is entering a study phase and will focus on future stealth and hypersonic capabilities.
"Alongside Germany, France and Italy, we will deliver the cutting-edge weapons that will keep the U.K. and NATO safe, boost deterrence, and build a new deal for European security," Healey said.
This year's investment in hypersonic weapons will also cover the development of key technologies, ground and flight testing, and support for academic training, including funding for postgraduate studies, according to the statement.
The U.K. Defense Ministry added that the new domestically produced Deep Precision Strike system, with a range of more than 2,000 kilometers (1,240 miles), is expected to enter service in the 2030s.
Earlier, the U.K. and other partners announced roughly $38 billion in aid to Ukraine following a Feb. 12 meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in the Ramstein format.
More than $2.5 billion will be allocated for Ukrainian drones, more than $500 million for the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, and $2 billion for air defense, according to Ukraine's Defense Minister Mykhailo Fedorov.
Ukraine has long urged its partners to boost support for air defense systems, as Russian strikes on its energy infrastructure have intensified over the past months.
The attacks have left Ukraine facing its most severe energy crisis since the start of the full-scale invasion.

Thousands of documents detail Jeffrey Epstein’s far-reaching ties across Europe

The monstrous tentacles of sex offender and multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein did not discriminate. He sought power and tried to draw it from every sphere of life: politicians, academics, economists, hedge fund managers, artists, sports team owners and royalty. Although Epstein’s record — he was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor for prostitution — was well known, many chose to look the other way.
But the 3 million documents from the case released by the U.S. Justice Department in recent weeks expose another aspect: the sweeping geographic scope of the affair. Name after name, country after country, continent after continent. Figures of power who felt above the law and morality, who believed nothing would happen to them despite various ties to Epstein, including a frequent guest mentioned in thousands of documents, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who maintained business and social ties with Epstein even years after his conviction.
This is only an initial review of the documents, a task expected to take weeks more. For now, each new revelation widens the circle of alleged wrongdoing — those who knew and remained silent, those now finally facing consequences and, above all, public shame and ostracism. This report focuses solely on the European circles that intersected with Epstein, and there is more than enough material there.
Trouble in the kingdom
Only a rear-guard political battle by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer temporarily prevented his ouster this week, though it appears to be a brief reprieve before further challenges ahead. Some stem from the Epstein documents, which reveal the depth of ties between the financier and Peter Mandelson, whom Starmer appointed Britain’s ambassador to the United States in late 2024.
Those ties allegedly included financial grants to Mandelson and his partner and stays at Epstein’s apartment, whom Mandelson called "my best friend." The documents also suggest that while serving as a member of Parliament and Cabinet minister, Mandelson lobbied for Epstein’s interests and leaked secret and classified government documents related to Britain’s economic policy.
Mandelson’s connections to Epstein were public knowledge as early as 2019, the year Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail. But the new documents allege actions that approach outright betrayal and have led London police to open an investigation into Mandelson.
Starmer has also come under scrutiny for making the sensitive Washington appointment despite later acknowledging he knew Mandelson had continued his ties with Epstein after 2008 — a pivotal year in which the financier was first convicted and designated a sex offender. Mandelson, a leading figure in New Labour and a close Starmer adviser, was viewed as someone capable of building strong ties with President Donald Trump, particularly on trade and tariffs. Starmer survived an attempt to remove him after all Cabinet ministers, including rivals, expressed confidence in him and he pledged full transparency and referred the ambassadorial appointment to a parliamentary committee.
Mandelson, dismissed after just seven months as ambassador, could still face prison. But little surprises Britons anymore after Prince Andrew lost his royal titles and patronages in 2022 following a settlement with a woman who said she had sex with him when she was a minor and revelations about his ties to Epstein’s sex trafficking network. The new documents allege Andrew also shared confidential British government business documents with Epstein.
The Oslo failure
Relative to its population size, few countries appear to have had as many senior figures in politics, business and society linked to Epstein as Norway. His reach extended into its diplomatic corps, the prime minister’s office, the Foreign Ministry, the Nobel committee and even the royal household.
Mona Juul, 66, a former Norwegian ambassador to Israel, the United States and the United Nations, was suspended last week and later resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq after her ties to Epstein were revealed. Newly released documents show that shortly before his death, Epstein drafted a will leaving $10 million to the two children she shares with her husband, Terje Rød-Larsen, who also held several diplomatic posts in the Middle East.
The couple had faced scrutiny before. In 2002, Juul was fined by Norwegian tax authorities for failing to report $100,000 she received in 1999 from the Peres Center for Peace for her involvement in the Oslo Accords. Her husband resigned in 2020 from the International Peace Institute after his ties to Epstein and funds he received from him were exposed. Norway’s Foreign Ministry said Rød-Larsen also demonstrated poor judgment in his dealings with Epstein. The country’s economic crimes unit has opened a corruption investigation into the couple and searched their apartment.
According to the documents, the couple in 2018 purchased an apartment in a trendy Oslo neighborhood at a price significantly below market value after pressure allegedly exerted by Epstein on the seller. "I am slowly tightening the noose around his neck," Epstein wrote in an email. The couple also visited Epstein’s private Caribbean island with their children. Testimony cited in the documents alleges that attractive young Eastern European women with limited qualifications were temporarily employed at the International Peace Institute.
Juul is not the only Norwegian public figure tied to the affair. Crown Princess Mette-Marit remained in contact with Epstein from 2011 and visited his estate in Florida. In one message she said she missed her “crazy friend,” and in another remarked that Paris was well suited for affairs while Scandinavia was a good place to find a wife. Last Friday, she apologized to everyone she had disappointed and described her association with him as entirely shameful.
Meanwhile, Norway’s economic crimes unit has opened an investigation into former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland, who served as chairman of the Nobel Peace Prize committee. Authorities are examining whether he received gifts, travel expenses or loans from Epstein in connection with his role, and whether he facilitated contact between the financier and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Norway’s Foreign Ministry approved a police request to lift Jagland’s immunity, granted during his tenure as secretary-general of the Council of Europe. The council confirmed Epstein attended at least two events at Jagland’s official residence in Strasbourg.
Norwegian journalist Geir Jørgensen said it is a source of national embarrassment that the world is questioning why so many figures from a country known for promoting human rights and development assistance were deeply entangled with a convicted pedophile. At the same time, he said, there is a measure of reassurance in the fact that, unlike in the United States where little appeared to change after the revelations, the affair has become a major story in Norway. That, he added, reflects a functioning press, a culture of accountability and, above all, a sense of public shame among those involved.
Deutsche Bank acknowledged this week that Epstein managed more than 40 accounts at its branches. Johanna Rubinstein, a Swedish U.N. official, resigned after it emerged she visited Epstein’s Caribbean island in 2012. Miroslav Lajčák, Slovakia’s national security adviser, stepped down after emails surfaced in which he and Epstein discussed diplomacy and "beautiful girls." Latvia, Lithuania and Poland announced official investigations into links between their nationals and Epstein, as well as possible connections to Russian intelligence.
In a statement, Poland’s Foreign Ministry said Epstein cultivated relationships not only with those already in positions of power but also with individuals rising toward senior roles. The ministry said authorities plan to investigate whether he sought to influence elections or shape policy, and whether any public officials may have been susceptible to blackmail by the Kremlin.
The French connection
Epstein also extended his reach into France, where he owned a large apartment near the Arc de Triomphe. He followed local politics obsessively, and the names of Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen appear hundreds of times in his documents. So does the name of former Culture Minister Jack Lang, who resigned as head of a major cultural institute, and his daughter Caroline, who stepped down from her role at an independent filmmakers’ association after documents revealed Epstein invested in her film projects, transferred $5 million to an account in her name in the Virgin Islands and mentioned her in his will. Lang said in an interview that mutual friend Woody Allen introduced them. Asked about Epstein’s crimes, he replied that he does not investigate the criminal past of people he meets.
Everyone knew. Many of those involved in the Epstein affair are highly educated individuals. No one could have missed his 2008 conviction, which resulted in a lenient 18-month sentence. The internet already existed, and even those using dial-up connections could read The Daily Beast’s 2010 investigation under the headline "The Pedophile Billionaire and His Sex Den."
Everyone knew and chose to ignore it, partying with vulnerable young women from Eastern Europe in an apartment in Paris, on the Caribbean island, in New York. Bill Gates and Noam Chomsky are among the names, alongside a long list of lawyers, Hollywood producers and hedge fund managers. Many did not need Epstein’s money, yet accepted gifts such as flights or Apple watches and exchanged suggestive emails describing women as commodities.
None of the European figures mentioned here reached the level of hypocrisy and moral blindness of Steve Bannon, a leading figure in the "Make America Great Again" movement who fashioned himself as an opponent of elites. In 2017, he offered Epstein public relations assistance and began preparing a documentary intended to rehabilitate his image. In documents released by Congress last year, Bannon told Epstein that they needed to oppose rapists who traffic in girls exploited by some of the world’s most powerful and wealthy men, adding that such acts are beyond redemption.

UK facing more rain and flood risks due to climate crisis, new study warns
Extra rainfall now falling on UK each winter due to global warming ‘would fill three million Olympic-sized swimming pools’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
UK winters are becoming “significantly wetter” and dramatically increasing flood risks as rising greenhouse‑gas concentrations warm the atmosphere, a new study has warned.
Researchers found the UK’s winter rainfall is increasing by around 7 per cent for every degree of global or regional warming – a rate the authors say is happening far faster than most climate models predict.
They explained the trend is not driven by changes in weather patterns, but by a warmer atmosphere’s ability to hold more moisture and produce larger, more intense rainstorms.
The team at Newcastle University analysed UK winter rainfall records from 1901 to 2023 to determine whether the increase was caused by shifts in atmospheric circulation or by the thermodynamic effect of warming. They said the rainfall increase of 7 per cent per degree of warming “is consistent with the expected rate of moisture increase in a warmer atmosphere”.
Anthropogenic climate change – primarily from the burning of fossil fuels – is the dominant factor, they said.
The team also discovered that many leading global climate models significantly underestimate the scale of the change. On average, models project a 4 per cent rise in rainfall per degree of warming – well below the 7 per cent increase seen in real‑world observations.
Dr James Carruthers, lead author and researcher at Newcastle University’s School of Engineering, said the findings show the UK is already experiencing rainfall levels that models had not expected for another two decades.
“Climate change has already made our winters significantly wetter,” he said. “Since the 1980s, the UK has warmed by around 0.25C per decade, meaning we are now seeing almost 9 per cent more winter rainfall than we did then.
“This is really concerning, as seasonal rainfall is increasing at a much faster rate than global climate models have predicted. We’re already experiencing changes in UK winter rainfall that global climate models predict for the 2040s – we’re 20 years ahead.”
He noted that October 2023 to March 2024 was the wettest winter half‑year on record, with the current season close behind.
Professor Hayley Fowler, a co‑author of the study published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, warned that the additional rainfall leaves the UK increasingly vulnerable to flooding.
“The extra water that falls every winter across the UK from fossil-fuel induced warming would fill three million Olympic-sized swimming pools,” she said.
“This predisposes the country to flooding as the ground is more generally saturated.
“This extra rainfall will continue to increase every year with additional global warming. We can only stop these increases in flooding by stopping the burning of fossil fuels.”
Prof Fowler added that with the UK facing more than 100 flood warnings this week, without major investment in adaptation, economic losses and casualties will continue to grow.
“There is a widening gap between growing climate risks and action on adaptation,” she said.
The findings build on earlier research showing that northern and central Europe are becoming significantly wetter in winter, while the Mediterranean is becoming drier – patterns that global climate models also underestimate in both speed and magnitude.
A Defra spokesperson told The Independent: "We recognise how important it is to prepare the country to adapt to climate change.
"That is why we are investing £10.5bn in our flood programme until 2036, protecting nearly 900,000 properties. This is alongside reprioritising over £100m to maintain existing flood assets."

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The negotiations on a Ukrainian settlement in Geneva will involve representatives of Russia, the United States and Ukraine, with no European participation, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told TASS.
"No, this will be a strictly trilateral format, so only Russia, the US and Ukraine. There will be no Europeans," he said when asked whether representatives of the European Union or international organizations might participate in any capacity.
The first round of trilateral security consultations involving Russia, Ukraine, and the United States was held on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating group was headed by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff. A second round was held there on February 4-5.

Men who plotted ‘mass murder’ of Jewish community in terror attack jailed for life
The men plotted to open fire on a march against antisemitism in what could have been ‘one of the deadliest attacks’ the UK has ever seen
- Bookmark
Two men who plotted a mass shooting that could have become “one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish communities” in the UK have been given life sentences.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, hatched a plan to smuggle four high-powered military-grade AK-47 rifles, two pistols and 900 rounds of ammunition into the UK and unleash what police chiefs said could have been Britain’s deadliest terrorist incident.
Alongside Amar Hussein, 52, he had intended to cause “untold harm” by opening fire on a march against antisemitism in Manchester city centre before moving to attack an area of the city occupied predominantly by the Jewish community.
The plot was foiled after Saadaoui, of Abram in Wigan, shared his deadly preparations online with a man he believed shared his ideology. Unbeknown to him, Saadaoui was actually in contact with an undercover operative – later identified in court proceedings as “Farouk” to protect his identity.
Saadaoui and Hussein, both of no fixed address, were jailed for life on Friday at Preston Crown Court, with minimum terms of 37 years and 26 years respectively.
Mr Justice Wall told the defendants that if their plot had succeeded, it would “likely have been one of the deadliest terror attacks ever carried out on British soil”.
He said: “I am sure this would have led to the deaths of many people and serious injuries to many, many more.
“Your plan envisaged you and two others discharging AK-47s into a large crowd of marchers, who were unarmed and defenceless; 120 bullets could have been discharged before any reloads were required. You planned to have spare magazines available.
“Your attack would have led to the deaths of people of all ages, including children.”
Prosecutors said Saadaoui had moved to the North West in 2022 and made several unsuccessful attempts to purchase guns online before he met Farouk. He was also found to have posted Isis propaganda on numerous Facebook accounts and encouraged others to take up weapons “in the name of the Islamic State”.
In his communications with the undercover officer, Saadaoui shared his admiration for Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the leader in the 2015 Paris attacks. He also told Farouk of his desire to attack Jewish people, and covertly joined a Jewish Facebook page to follow events.
He also recruited Hussein, a fellow Isis sympathiser, to conduct reconnaissance and monitor the arrival of the weapons.
The two would-be terrorists believed that Farouk could import automatic firearms from abroad, and welcomed him into their deadly fold. He infiltrated the group, learning that the pair embraced the ideology of Isis and intended to carry out attacks in response to alleged atrocities conducted by Israeli troops since October 2023.
Saadaoui told Farouk he could independently obtain a firearm via Sweden, and indicated that he was looking to bring guns from Eastern Europe. Separately he had bought an air weapon and had visited a shooting range.
Saadaoui and Hussein travelled to Dover, Kent, in March 2024 to conduct hostile reconnaissance on how a weapon could be smuggled through the port without detection. A safe house was also secured in Bolton for storage of the weapons, while both men returned to Dover two months later, where they believed they were watching the firearms coming into the country.
Farouk also learnt that Saadaoui had discussed his plans with his younger brother, 36-year-old Bilel Saadaoui.
Walid Saadaoui was arrested by counterterrorism police in May 2024 after attempting to take possession of two assault rifles, a semi-automatic pistol, and almost 200 rounds of ammunition.
Following a trial at Preston Crown Court, he and Hussein were convicted of making preparations to commit a large-scale terrorist attack, while Bilel Saadaoui, of Hindley in Wigan, was found guilty of failing to disclose information about the terror plan. He was sentenced to six years in jail with an extended licence period of 12 months.
Mr Justice Wall commended the bravery of undercover operator Farouk. He told the court: “His is a dangerous and difficult job. He undertook it with great skill and patience. He has potentially saved many lives by putting his own life on the line. I am not allowed to know his true identity, but I hope the remarks I make are passed on to him.”
Frank Ferguson, head of the Special Crime and Counter Terrorism division at the Crown Prosecution Service, said: “This was a deeply disturbing plot inspired by extremist ideology. Had these terrorists succeeded, it would have led to mass murder and been one of the deadliest attacks on Jewish communities in this country.
“The investigation and prosecution deployed a highly trained witness who made sure their plot did not succeed and secured valuable evidence directly from the mouths of the terrorists. This laid bare their intention to destroy lives, their long-held attitudes and beliefs as well as their Isis credentials. We worked closely with counterterrorism officers to ensure the strongest possible case was built from the outset and presented in court to the jury, resulting in these convictions.
“Terrorism is an attack on the very fabric of our society. We will always use the law to protect communities from harm and relentlessly hold offenders to account, making sure they face the toughest legal consequences for their actions.”

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Annual inflation in Russia is at present slightly lower than the interval forecast by the Bank of Russia, Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said at a press conference after the Board meeting.
"Annual inflation is at the level of 6.3% now. It is slightly lower than our forecast interval of 6.5-7%, the one we expected as of the start of this year," Nabiullina said. "Accordingly, inflation dynamics at large is evolving within the framework of this scenario, we merely came to the current point not smoothly but throw slowdown in November - December and subsequent acceleration in January," she added.
An increase in certain indicators of stable inflation can be seen in full month data for January, Nabiullina noted. "Why? Because the estimation of such stable inflation indicators does not anticipate exclusion of the effect from VAT rate increase. That is why their growth cannot be interpreted as an upward turn of stable inflation," she added.

SARAJEVO
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said Friday that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is “a great world leader” and described Türkiye as one of Belgrade’s most important partners following what he called highly productive talks in Ankara.
“Erdogan is a great world leader, Türkiye is one of our most important partners. We had exceptionally productive talks on all issues. Infinite thanks for the exceptional hospitality to President Erdogan, we look forward to welcoming you in Serbia,” Vucic wrote on the US social media platform X after concluding a one-day visit to Türkiye late Thursday.
During his stay in Ankara, Vucic held a bilateral meeting with Erdogan at the Presidential Palace and stressed that Serbia recognizes Türkiye’s political and economic importance, describing it as one of the country’s most significant partners.
Vucic thanked Erdogan for what he called exceptional hospitality and expressed hope that the Turkish president would visit Serbia within the next three to four months, when several important documents could be signed.
During the visit, Erdogan highlighted Türkiye’s efforts to promote regional ownership-based initiatives, citing the second meeting of the Balkan Peace Platform hosted in Istanbul on Jan. 23, 2026, and thanked Vucic for his personal support for the platform.
Erdogan described Vucic’s visit as highly valuable for advancing peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.
“God willing, we will also pay a visit to Belgrade and Novi Pazar in May or June with a large delegation,” he said.
Following their meeting, Erdogan hosted a dinner in honor of Vucic.
Members of the Serbian delegation included Foreign Minister Marko Djuric, Defense Minister Bratislav Gasic, Economy Minister Adrijana Mesarovic, Assistant Defense Minister Nenad Radomirovic, and the minister without portfolio in charge of reconciliation, regional cooperation and social stability, Usame Zukorlic.

Boots launches first high street service for weight loss jabs
The pharmacy chain has launched the service as a trial initially across 17 stores nationwide.
- Bookmark
Boots is offering customers an in-store service for weight loss drugs that will allow people to pop in and buy jabs in their lunch breaks.
The pharmacy chain has launched the service as a trial initially across 17 stores nationwide, including in London, Manchester and Edinburgh, offering treatments such as Mounjaro and Wegovy on the high street for the first time.
Customers will be offered an in-person consultation with a pharmacist in a private consultation room, where their health and medical history will be assessed to see if they are eligible for treatment.
Weight loss medication has until now been largely only available through online prescriptions.
GPs in England are also allowed to prescribe Mounjaro on the NHS, but only to severely obese people who also suffer from a range of other health problems.
Estimates suggest more than 1.5 million people in the UK are already taking weight loss drugs, which may have been prescribed through specialist weight loss services or via private prescription.
Jamie Kerruish, chief healthcare officer at Boots, said: “We know that people have different preferences for how they access healthcare services – some seeking online support and some wanting in person conversations with their local practitioner.
“The launch of our in-store weight loss treatment service alongside our digital offer delivered through Boots Online Doctor means we can now deliver convenient care to people both online or in person.”
He added: “Our weight loss treatment services are for anyone whose lives are affected by obesity.
“For people who are overweight or living with obesity, it can be hard to lose weight through diet and exercise alone.
“Weight loss treatment combined with 360 support to make lifestyle and behavioural changes, can be a powerful tool in helping people manage their weight and at Boots we are here for every step of our customers’ weight loss journeys.”
Boots has already been selling Mounjaro, made by Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk’s treatment Wegovy through its Boots Online Doctor service.
Customers can book in-store appointments for the service online or on a walk-in basis at stores taking part in the pilot.
Here is a list of Boots stores offering the weight loss drug service:
– Nottingham, Victoria Centre, Nottinghamshire– Cardiff, Queen Street, Wales– Durham, Market Place, County Durham– Belfast, Donegal Place, Northern Ireland– Edinburgh, Princes Street, Scotland– Newcastle, Sidgate, Tyne and Wear– St Albans, St Peters Street, Hertfordshire– London, Liverpool Steet Station– Leicester, Fosse Park, Leicestershire– Brighton, North Street, East Sussex– London, Piccadilly Circus– Dartford, Blue Water, Kent– Altrincham, Stamford Quarter, Trafford, Greater Manchester– Chester-Le-Street, County Durham– Middlesborough, Nunthorpe, North Yorkshire– Bath, Southgate Centre, Somerset– Lisburn, Sprucefield, Northern Ireland

Trump expected to attend Saudi FII conference in Miami
US President Donald Trump is expected to attend Saudi Arabia's Future Investment Initiative conference in Miami, marking his second consecutive appearance at the event since returning to the White House, people familiar with the matter said.
Trump is expected to attend a dinner on the first day hosted by Yasir Al-Rumayyan, governor of Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund PIF, two people said, asking not to be identified as they were not authorised to speak publicly. The event takes place from 26-29 March.
The FII Institute, the Saudi government and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Trump's engagement with the FII platform underscores the importance his administration places on Gulf economic partnerships.
Saudi Arabia and the US finalised a series of investment and defense agreements during the crown prince's meeting with Trump in November, with Riyadh boosting its commitment to invest in the United States to $1 trillion - expanding significantly from the $600 billion in deals outlined during Trump's visit to the kingdom in May.
Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 pivots to private sector
The potential high-profile attendance comes as Saudi Arabia recalibrates its ambitious Vision 2030 economic transformation program amid a shortage of funding for mega-projects that were part of the kingdom's wider diversification efforts.
Saudi officials have increasingly pivoted toward securing buy-in and collaboration from the private sector after initial plans relied heavily on government funding.
The FII Miami event would provide a platform for Saudi Arabia to court North and South American business leaders and investors at a time when the kingdom is repositioning its economic agenda.
The gathering also takes place against a backdrop of deepening rivalry between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, traditionally close Gulf allies, who have increasingly found themselves at odds over regional economic competition and strategic priorities.
The two nations have been vying for position as the Middle East's premier business and financial hub, with the UAE's rapid rise in sectors from finance to technology creating friction with Saudi Arabia's own ambitions under Vision 2030.
FII competes with Abu Dhabi's Milken Institute Global Conference, which takes place in Los Angeles in May. The main FII conference, usually held each fall in Riyadh and dubbed "Davos in the Desert," has become a flagship event for Saudi Arabia to showcase its economic vision and attract global investment.
The organisation has expanded beyond Riyadh to host events in other major cities.

What to know about the Homeland Security shutdown starting this weekend
Another shutdown for parts of the federal government is expected this weekend
- Bookmark
Another shutdown for parts of the federal government is expected this weekend as lawmakers debate new restrictions on President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement agenda.
Funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire Saturday. Democrats say they won't help approve more funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
The White House has been negotiating with the Democrats, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week, guaranteeing that funding for the department will lapse.
Unlike the record 43-day shutdown last fall, the closures will be narrowly confined, as only agencies under the DHS umbrella — like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection — will be affected. Still, depending on how long the shutdown lasts, some federal workers could begin to miss paychecks.
Services like airport screening could also suffer if the shutdown drags on for weeks.
At the Transportation Security Administration, about 95% of employees are deemed essential. They will continue to scan passengers and their bags at the nation’s commercial airports. But they will work without pay until the funding lapse is resolved, raising the possibility that workers will being calling out or taking unscheduled leave. Many TSA workers already faced financial stress last year.
“Some are just now recovering from the financial impact of the 43-day shutdown” said Ha Nguyen McNeill, a senior official performing the duties of TSA administrator. “Many are still reeling from it.”
Why is a Homeland Security shutdown happening?
Essentially, it's because Trump acquiesced to Democrats' request that Homeland Security funding be stripped from a broader spending package to allow more time for negotiation over demands for changes to immigration enforcement, like a code of conduct for federal agents and a requirement that officers show identification. Homeland Security was temporarily funded only through Feb. 13.
The rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means most federal programs are unaffected by the latest shutdown, including food assistance, and pay for most federal workers and for service members will continue uninterrupted.
What agencies are impacted?
The funding lapse affects the Department of Homeland Security and its constellation of agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The vast majority of employees at the Secret Service and U.S. Coast Guard will continue their work, though they could also miss a paycheck depending upon the shutdown's length.
At the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the shutdown will disrupt the agency's ability to reimburse states for disaster relief costs. Some workers will be furloughed, limiting the agency's ability to coordinate with state and local partners, and training for first responders at the National Disaster and Emergency Management University in Maryland will be disrupted.
Republicans have pointed out that the work of ICE and CBP will mostly continue unabated during a shutdown, despite Democratic demands for changes at those agencies.
That's because Trump's tax and spending cut bill passed by Republicans last year provided ICE with about $75 billion and CBP with about $65 billion, money those agencies can continue to tap for Trump's deportation operations.
What is the impact on workers?
It’s up to each federal agency to designate which of its employees are “essential” or “excepted,” both of which mean the same thing in this case. They keep working during a shutdown, typically without getting paid until government funding is back in place.
Some examples of “essential” employees are military personnel, security screeners at airports and law enforcement officers. There can be a wide range, from positions deemed critical for public safety to those authorized by law to continue even without new funding.
Most of the more than 270,000 people employed by Homeland Security are deemed essential, meaning that they stay on the job even during a shutdown. For the fall 2025 shutdown, more than 258,000 DHS employees were in that category, and about 22,000 — or 5% of the agency's total employee base — were furloughed.
Lawmakers have been particularly concerned about the potential impact on the TSA and airports.
Senate Republican Leader John Thune has warned that “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to last year's shutdown. As staffing shortages grow, airports may reduce the number of open security lanes or close checkpoints altogether to relieve pressure on an already strained workforce.
During last year’s lapse in funding, unpaid TSA workers increasingly called in sick or stayed home as missed paychecks made it harder for workers to cover basic expenses. The strain was visible on the ground: About a month into the shutdown, TSA closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport.
“The longer the shutdown goes on, the more severe the impact on our TSA workforce,” the agency said at the time.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The ongoing negotiations in Geneva regarding the resolution of the Ukraine conflict should be viewed with optimism, as each new round brings us closer to the development of comprehensive peace agreements, stated Leonid Slutsky, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs and leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. He made these remarks to TASS ahead of the upcoming trilateral meeting of delegations from Russia, the United States, and Ukraine scheduled for February 17-18 in Geneva.
"Continued negotiations on the Ukrainian settlement in Geneva are undoubtedly a positive development," Slutsky emphasized. "Each session advances us incrementally toward establishing a 'peace formula.' At least, that is our collective hope. The key is ensuring that this peace is sustainable and that it effectively addresses threats to Russia's national interests and security." He further noted that the upcoming negotiations are expected to concentrate on implementing existing agreements and transitioning the process into a practical phase at the working group level.
Earlier, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced the date and venue for the next round of talks involving Russia, the United States, and Ukraine. He confirmed that the Russian delegation would be led by Vladimir Medinsky, an aide to the Russian president.
The first trilateral security consultations among Russia, Ukraine, and the United States took place on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi, with Igor Kostyukov, Chief of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Russian General Staff, heading the Russian team. A second round was held there on February 4-5. Subsequently, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov remarked that Moscow was maintaining a "polite silence" regarding the Abu Dhabi contacts, emphasizing that results-oriented negotiations shun publicity.

Ever since Donald Trump's return to the White House and the appointment of Robert F. Kennedy Jr as Secretary of Health, the United States has become the scene of a growing clash between science and politics. One field in particular is paying the price of this ideological battle: health. FRANCE 24's Pierrick Leurent and Valerie Defert report from Texas.
Read moreUS scraps universal child vaccine guidance, drawing expert concern
Between January and August 2025, Texas saw a major resurgence of measles, a disease declared eradicated more than 20 years ago. Nationwide, more than 1,200 cases have been recorded in 2025, a level not seen since 1992.
This crisis reflects a longer-term trend taking hold locally and nationally in the US: the constant questioning of science and medicine, a phenomenon fuelled by social media. These theories are now reaching the highest levels of government, as seen with the recent decision by the Texas attorney general to sue Tylenol, the painkiller accused without evidence by the Trump administration of being responsible for the rise in autism cases in the country. The move contradicted the conclusions of every serious scientific study on the subject.

Strictly judge Shirley Ballas rumoured to be quitting BBC show after landing new job
- Shirley Ballas, Head Judge of Strictly Come Dancing, is reportedly in discussions for a new role on a US spin-off show, Dancing with the Stars: the Next Pro.
- The potential move has sparked speculation among fans regarding her future on the BBC programme, particularly as the US show's filming schedule clashes with Strictly's preparation.
- Ballas joined Strictly in 2017, succeeding Len Goodman, and has frequently spoken about the significant mental health impact of her role due to relentless online trolling.
- She revealed in 2023 that the constant abuse once brought her to the verge of quitting the show.
- Despite recent changes to the judging format, Ballas continued to face intense criticism following contestant Lewis Cope's elimination, even when other judges shared her assessment.

Trump Tracker: Why we're keeping count of every climate attack the POTUS unleashes in 2026
Unknown

23:41:42 KST

Euronews Green is holding the world's most powerful man to account, by documenting all the ways he's sabotaging climate progress this year.
In a world crippled with uncertainty, one thing is for sure: 2026 will go down in history as the year that Donald Trump single-handedly unravelled decades of climate progress.
Since his return to the White House, the POTUS and his administration have turned their back on science, ruthlessly retreating from global pledges and institutions to prioritise the profits of big polluters.
It's stripping the US – which remains the world's largest historical polluter – of any kind of accountability, while the world edges dangerously close to irreversible climate disaster.
But here's the thing, climate change and its devastating effects do not stop at country borders. What one nation does impacts us all.
It's why Euronews Green has consistently covered Trump's unwavering climate setbacks – from his "drill baby drill" attitude over Venezuela's oil reserves to repeatedly describing wind energy as a "con".
Keeping up with these fast-moving stories can be hard, which is why we've created the Trump Tracker – documenting every single action the POTUS is taking to bolster fossil fuel giants and sabotage progress.
Just two months into 2026, and we're already struggling to keep up.
February: More retreat and less science
'Beautiful clean coal power'
On 11 February, Trump signed an executive order directing the defence department to buy more electricity generated by coal – which is considered the dirtiest, most polluting way of producing energy.
"When burnt, coal releases more carbon dioxide than oil or gas, so it’s by far the worst fuel when it comes to climate change," says Greenpeace. "Coal also produces toxic elements like mercury and arsenic, and small particles of soot which contribute to air pollution."
The order does not mention climate change or the environmental impacts of burning coal. Instead, it is referred to as "beautiful clean coal power".
Repeal of the endangerment finding
On 12 February, the Trump Administration is slated to revoke a scientific finding that has long been the central basis for US action to regulate heat-trapping gasses and fight climate change.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will issue a final rule rescinding a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding. This Obama-era policy determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.
The endangerment finding is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet. It is used to justify regulations, such as auto emissions standards, intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change – deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the US and around the world.
“The Trump administration is abandoning its core responsibility to keep us safe from extreme weather and accelerating climate change,'' says Abigail Dillen, president of the nonprofit law firm Earthjustice.
“There is no way to reconcile EPA’s decision with the law, the science and the reality of disasters that are hitting us harder every year. Earthjustice and our partners will see the Trump administration in court.”
January: UN withdrawal, Venezuela's oil and legal fights
'What happened to global warming?'
In the last week of January, a dangerous winter storm has swept across much of the US, leaving at least seven dead, cutting power to thousands of homes, and causing thousands of flights to be cancelled.
Trump used the weather event to cast further doubt on 'global warming', writing on American conservative-focused social media platform Truth Social: "Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 states. Rarely seen anything like it before.
"Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain - WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING?"
More than a dozen scientists tell news agency AP that the president’s claims are wrong. They point out that even in a warmer world, winter and cold occur, and they never said otherwise. They note that even as it is cold in the eastern United States, more of the world is warmer than average. They also stressed the difference between daily and local weather and long-term, planet-wide climate change.
Meteorologists also said that global warming over the past couple of decades may make this cold seem unprecedented and record-smashing. But government records show it has been much colder in the past.
“This social media post crams a remarkable amount of inflammatory language and factually inaccurate assertions into a very short statement,” says climate scientist Daniel Swain of the California Institute for Water Resources. “First of all, global warming continues – and has in fact been progressing at an increased rate in recent years.”
'Stupid' wind turbine rant
Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos on 21 January, Trump made several dubious claims about Greenland, NATO and renewable energy.
In a speech that lasted over an hour, Trump claimed that China makes "almost all" of the world's wind turbines, which he continues to refer to as "windmills".
"Yet I haven’t been able to find any windfarms in China,” he said. "Did you ever think of that? It’s a good way of looking. China is very smart. They make [wind turbines].”
Trump went on to argue that China sells wind turbines to other countries for a “fortune”. “They sell them to the stupid people that buy them, but don’t use them themselves,” he added.
According to energy think tank Ember, China’s wind generation in 2024 equalled 40 per cent of global wind generation. In April 2025, wind and solar power generated more than a quarter of the country's electricity.
China is also home to the world's largest wind farm, which is visible from space. Located in the vast desert region of western Gansu, construction of the Gansu Wind Farm began in 2009, with the first phase being completed just a year later. It already features more than 7,000 turbines.
Blocking clean energy grants
On 11 January, a federal judge ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it cancelled $7.6 billion (around €6.52 billion) in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Kamala Harris in 2024.
The grants supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 different states. This includes battery plants, hydrogen technology projects, upgrades to the electric grid and efforts to capture carbon dioxide emissions.
The Energy Department says the projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation’s energy needs or were not economically viable. Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being cancelled".
However, US District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.
Anne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.
She told AP: "Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible."
Trump’s interest in Greenland
Trump’s growing obsession with Greenland has triggered concerns from environmentalists over its critical mineral resources, which are seen as “essential” for the green energy transition.
A 2023 survey found that 25 of the 34 minerals deemed “critical raw materials” by the European Commission were found in Greenland. The nation is estimated to hold between 36 and 42 million metric tons of rare earth oxides, making it the second-largest reserve after China.
Tapping into these resources could help the US reduce its dependency on China, which currently processes over 90 per cent of the world’s rare earth minerals, and empower the US as demand rises.
Since his first term, Trump has been trying to tackle this issue – passing bills to increase American mineral production and stepping up deep-sea mining within both US and international waters.
However, some experts believe Greenland’s mineral reserves could just be a smokescreen for Trump’s real motives.
New dietary guidelines
The US Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture have come under fire after releasing their 2026 dietary guidelines, which encourage American households to prioritise diets built on “whole, nutrient-dense food.”
The new food pyramid puts an image of a red steak and ground beef at the top under the “protein” section, despite beef being responsible for 20 times more greenhouse gas emissions per gram of protein than plant-based alternatives such as beans and lentils.
Neither of these foods appears on the food pyramid, but they are mentioned in the full dietary guidelines.
“While there are many ways to meet our protein needs, not all protein sources have the same impact on people or the planet,” says Raychel Santo, a food and climate researcher at the World Resources Institute (WRI).
“Beef and lamb, in particular, have some of the highest environmental costs of any protein-rich food – with significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and water pollution per ounce of protein than most alternatives.”
Controlling Venezuela’s oil
After US special forces snatched Venezuela’s President and his wife in a lightning raid, Trump has shown a clear interest in the country’s oil reserves.
Venezuela holds the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, sitting on an estimated 303 billion barrels (Bbbl) – outranking petrostates like Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Trump immediately confirmed the US would be “very strongly involved” in the country’s oil industry, with plans to send large US firms to fix Venezuela’s oil infrastructure and “start making money for the country”. In an interview on 8 January, he said the US could tap into Venezuela’s oil reserves for years.
“The only safe path forward is a just transition away from fossil fuels, one that protects health, safeguards ecosystems, and supports communities rather than sacrificing them for short-term profit," Christensen adds.
US pulls out of UN climate treaty
The POTUS was accused of “sinking to a new low” after pulling the US out of a key climate treatyin a sweeping withdrawal from global institutions.
In a Presidential Memorandum signed on 7 January, Trump argued it is “contrary to the interests of the US” to remain a member of, participate in, or provide support to more than 60 international organisations, treaties and conventions.
This includes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) – which aims to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions – and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world’s leading authority on climate science.
"At a time when rising seas, record heat, and deadly disasters demand urgent, coordinated action, the US government is choosing to retreat," says Rebecca Brown, President and CEO of the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL).
"The decision to defund and withdraw from the UNFCCC does not absolve the US of its legal obligations to prevent climate change and remedy climate harm, as the world’s highest court made clear last year."
On 27 January, Trump also officially exited the Paris Agreement – a move he initially put in motion on his first day in office on 20 January 2025. It leaves the US the only country to have withdrawn from the pact, which aims to limit global warming from reaching 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Iran, Libya and Yemen are the only countries that didn't join the agreement.

Dubai-based DP World replaces chief named in Epstein files
DP World appoints new chairman and group CEO following departure of Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem over ties to sex offender.
United Arab Emirates-based logistics giant DP World has appointed a new chairman and CEO, after coming under pressure over former company chief Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem’s ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein
The UAE government’s Dubai Media Office said Friday that Essa Kazim had been appointed chairman and Yuvraj Narayan as group CEO of DP World, one of the world’s largest logistics companies, which claims to handle about 10 percent of global trade.

The roles were previously held by bin Sulayem, one of Dubai’s most powerful and well-connected people, who has led DP World – which operates more than 60 ports and terminals worldwide – for more than four decades.
Sulayem’s lengthy tenure at the helm of the logistics giant came to an end in a firestorm of controversy over his links with the disgraced financier, after recently declassified documents showed the pair had exchanged messages for years before and after Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting a minor for prostitution.
Salacious exchanges
The friendly exchanges between the two include discussions about deals and also mention bin Sulayem visiting Epstein’s private island while sharing contacts in business and politics.
The two men also shared salacious comments about women, with bin Sulayem’s email address featuring a correspondence in which Epstein remarked, “I loved the torture video.”
Bin Sulayem’s name was blacked out in documents released by the Department of Justice, but on Tuesday, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna identified him in the House of Representatives, along with five others whose names had been redacted, saying the government had shielded their names “for no apparent reason”.
Since Khanna’s speech to Congress, the Justice Department partially unredacted some of the files he pointed to.
Partners suspend ties
While the files referenced by Khanna did not appear to implicate bin Sulayem or the other men in any specific crimes, the revelation of bin Sulayem’s years-long friendship with Epstein prompted the United Kingdom development investment agency, British International Investment, and Canada’s second-largest pension fund, La Caisse, to announce they had paused future ventures with DP World in response.
La Caisse, which in 2022 invested $2.5bn in Jebel Ali Port, the Jebel Ali Free Zone and the National Industries Park, three of DP World’s flagship assets in the UAE, said on Tuesday that it would not carry out further investments until it shed light on bin Sulayem’s links to Epstein and took “necessary actions”.
On Friday, British International Investment welcomed DP World’s appointment of a new chief executive and said it would resume investment alongside the company.
“We welcome today’s decision by DP World and look forward to continuing our partnership to advance the development of key African trading ports to unlock the continent’s global trading potential,” a spokesperson for the agency said.
Epstein was convicted of procuring a minor for prostitution in 2008, spending about a year in prison before his release.
His contacts with a network of wealthy and influential figures continued in the wake of his conviction until an investigation into the wealthy financier was reopened in 2019.
Epstein died in prison that year while facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.

KYIV - Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Feb 13 that he had invited his Chinese counterpart to visit Ukraine, adding that Beijing could help to end the four-year war with Russia.
“China can play an important role in bringing about a just peace for Ukraine,” Mr Sybiha told Ukrainian TV channel Novyny Live after a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
“We appreciate China’s support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, and we had a very substantive and pragmatic conversation.”
In an official Chinese summary of their meeting, Mr Wang said China was “willing to provide new humanitarian assistance to Ukraine” but made no mention of any invitation to visit Kyiv.
“It is encouraging that various dialogues surrounding the Ukraine crisis are progressing intensively,” Mr Wang said, according to a statement released by his ministry.
“We are willing to maintain communication with Ukraine and work with the international community to play a constructive role in achieving an early political solution to the crisis,” Mr Wang added.
China has close economic and security ties to Russia and has refused to join international sanctions on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. REUTERS

LONDON - A UK court on Feb jailed two men for life for planning an Islamic State-inspired gun attack on a Jewish gathering in northern England.
Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, intended to target an anti-Semitism march in Manchester before killing more Jews in the north of the city.
Their deadly plan was thwarted when they revealed it to an undercover operative posing as a like-minded extremist who could help import weapons.
A judge at Preston Crown Court sentenced Saadaoui, originally from Tunisia, to serve a minimum of 37 years in custody.
Hussein, a Kuwaiti, will serve at least 26 years.
Their trial in 2025 heard evidence that Saadaoui hero-worshipped Abdelhamid Abaaoud - an Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) recruiter and ringleader for the November 2015 Paris attacks
A jury convicted Saadaoui and Hussein
Judge Michael Wall told the defendants that if the plot had succeeded, it would “likely have been one of the deadliest terror attacks ever carried out on British soil”.
Main instigator Saadaoui had aimed to smuggle four AK-47 assault rifles, two handguns and 900 rounds of ammunition into the UK.
Saadaoui also travelled to north Manchester to carry out surveillance on Jewish nurseries, schools, synagogues and shops.
Authorities began to investigate him after he used 10 Facebook accounts in fake names to post Islamic extremist views.
Counter-terrorism police intervened in May 2024 in an operation involving over 200 officers.
Saadaoui was arrested at a hotel car park after he went to collect some firearms, which had been intercepted and deactivated. AFP

European Commissioner for Sport says he 'respects' IOC's decision to ban Ukrainian Olympian

“Ukraine is going through a very tough time”, Commissioner Glenn Micallef told Euronews' flagship morning programme Europe Today, discussing the Ukrainian athlete's disqualification, “But the decision by the IOC is one I respect.”
European Commissioner for Sport Glenn Micallef said he respected the International Olympic Committee's decision to disqualify a Ukrainian skeleton racer over his custom helmet featuring portraits of fallen Ukrainian athletes, while expressing sadness that "the situation could not be resolved."
Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified before his first run at the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, after the IOC banned him from using his custom-made helmet, which features portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia’s full-scale invasion since early 2022.
The helmet does not display any slogans or political symbols.
Speaking exclusively on Euronews' Europe Today morning show, Micallef said he appreciated the IOC's decision.
“The decision by the IOC is one I respect,” he said.
“I respect particularly the fact that Kirsty Coventry, the president of the International Olympic Committee, was speaking to Vladyslav (Heraskevych) face to face, explaining the situation, trying to resolve the dispute through dialogue."
"I also admire the fact that ... in the event of the extraordinary situation, (Coventry) made an appeal to the disciplinary committee also to revoke the accreditation and restore the accreditation,” Micallef added.
The IOC allowed Heraskevych to remain at the Olympic venues in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, albeit without competing.
The Olympic Committee also said it had offered Heraskevych alternatives, such as wearing a black armband and displaying his helmet before and after the race, but the athlete rejected them.
The helmet at the centre of the controversy depicted over 20 Ukrainian athletes killed in Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Among them are former competitors who left their sporting careers to join the Ukrainian Armed Forces, as well as civilian athletes killed in Russian attacks, including minors.
"I did not break any rules. I defended the interests of Ukraine — not just the country, but the memory of these athletes. They deserve it," Heraskevych said before leaving the Olympic village on Thursday.
European Commissioner for Sport told Euronews he was “sad to see that the situation could not be resolved before the competition in a way that would have allowed him to express himself and pay respect to the fallen heroes in Ukraine."
“Ukraine is going through a very tough time”, he said, reiterating “But the decision by the IOC is one I respect.”
'This is price of our dignity'
Micallef stated that it is for the IOC and the federations to set the rules and regulations for the competitions and “this is uncontested”.
“What we're talking about here is messaging and messaging rules, particularly to come out of the Olympic Charter”, he told Euronews.
“In this particular case, the rule is not directed at a particular country. These are rules to safeguard safety for athletes, but also fair competition, and I emphasise this point.“
Meanwhile, other Ukrainian athletes have spoken out about similar restrictions imposed by the IOC.
Two more Ukrainian Olympians had their helmets barred from competition on the grounds of "politicisation".
Ukrainian freestyle skier Kateryna Kotsar said the IOC disqualified her helmet for the inscription "Be Brave like Ukrainians".
Oleh Handei, a Ukrainian short track speed skater, said his helmet was banned for what the IOC claims is a "political slogan."
"I have an inscription on my helmet by (Ukrainian poet) Lina Kostenko: 'Where there is heroism, there is no final defeat,'" Handei explained.
"They banned it, saying that it was a political slogan, that it was about war, that it was not allowed. I translated it word for word for them — no, it's not a political slogan. These are just motivational words for me, for my team, and for my country."
Sports court dismissed Heraskevych’s appeal
The Court of Arbitration for Sport on Friday denied Heraskevych’s application against the International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation (IBSF) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
In a statement issued on Friday evening, the CAS insisted that while being “sympathetic” to Ukrainian athlete commemorations, “the sole arbitrator considers these guidelines provide a reasonable balance between athletes' interests to express their views, and athletes' interests to receive undivided attention for their sporting performance on the field of play.”
“The sole arbitrator appointed for this matter wished to state that she is fully sympathetic to Mr Heraskevych’s commemoration and to his attempt to raise awareness for the grief and devastation suffered by the Ukrainian people, and Ukrainian athletes because of the war,” the statement said.
The CAS admitted that while the guidelines state that “freedom of speech is a fundamental right of any athlete competing in the Olympic Games,” they also “limit the right to express views during competitions on the field of play.”
“These limitations (are) reasonable and proportionate, considering the other opportunities for athletes to raise awareness in mixed zones, in press conferences, on social networks, or in Mr Heraskevych’s case, wearing the helmet during four training runs.”
On his social media platforms, Heraskevych pointed to several similar instances at the 2026 Olympics in which athletes honoured the memory of the deceased without facing punishment.
At the opening ceremony, Israeli skeleton racer Jared Firestone honoured the memory of those lost at the 1972 Munich Games by wearing a kippah inscribed with the names of the athletes and coaches who were killed.
US figure skater Maxim Naumov paid tribute to his own family after his performance. He held his childhood photo depicting him and his parents, who died in a 2025 plane crash.
Canadian skier Jessica Linton also carried a personal message on her helmet, "I ski for Brayden," and displayed it to the cameras after her run, likely in memory of moguls skier Brayden Kuroda, who passed away in 2020.
Heraskevych said after his disqualification he was getting threats from Russians and blamed the IOC's decision for that.
"I believe that these Games now and this act of the IOC also serves as an instrument of propaganda for Russia," Heraskevych said. "I still receive a lot of threats from the Russian side."

Why You Should Handwrite Someone You Love a Card

Dashing off an email or text takes seconds. Handwriting a card takes a little courage—and five minutes with a pen. Putting in the extra time and effort matters more than you might think.
“We all have a need to matter—to be considered and to be seen,” says Alison McKleroy, an art therapist in San Francisco. “When you get a homemade card, it’s sending a message: ‘I spent time doing this thing with you in mind.’ It lands differently.”
Here’s what to know about the benefits of sending and receiving handwritten cards—and how to make one yourself.
What makes handwritten cards so special
The research is clear: People underestimate the emotional boost they get from writing and receiving positive letters or cards.
Writing a card can make you feel more relaxed and quietly pleased. “Even five minutes of making something can put you in a flow state, and afterward you feel calmer and more settled,” McKleroy says. “Making a card is very tactile—cutting, gluing, touching—and that kind of tactile input actually calms your nervous system.”
Plus, you might find it’s fun. There’s joy in choosing a color, tearing paper, or getting one small detail just right, McKleroy says. It gives your brain a break from overthinking and pulls you into the present moment. “This is a very low-stakes way to reconnect with fun and play—parts of ourselves that can feel a little exiled,” she adds. “I think we underestimate how much we benefit from these micro-moments of joy.”

Meanwhile, if you’re the recipient, you’ll likely feel extra loved knowing that someone took the time to express their feelings in such a thoughtful way. It’s also a physical reminder of the connection you share—you can save the card and look at it any time you need a boost. That’s especially true if your loved one struggles to articulate their feelings.
“It’s a way to express affection and warmth and care without having to actually say it,” McKleroy says. “Sometimes it just starts with a willingness to do something differently.”
How to get started
You don't need any special art skills to make a card. “It’s not about being Picasso. It’s really about the message: ‘You matter to me. I care about you. I was thinking about you when I made this,’” McKleroy says. “When my 7-year-old makes a rainbow for me, I’m not thinking, ‘This could use some work.’ I’m thinking, ‘That was generous. She was thinking about me.’”
People often tell Melissa Tract that they’re self-conscious about their handwriting: They think it’s too messy or hard to read. But there are ways to have fun with it. You could try calligraphy, write in cursive, or play around with the size of your words, maybe writing in all caps or only lowercase. “You can make it funky,” says Tract, a psychotherapist who integrates professional training in the arts into her clinical work.
You can also add small personal touches, like choosing the recipient’s favorite pen color, drawing tiny hearts or smiley faces, using glue pens to attach glitter, or wrapping the card in ribbon or lace, Tract suggests.
What to write
Don’t focus on finding the perfect words. There’s no such thing, Tract says. If you’re staring at a blank page, she suggests starting with one of these prompts: “One thing I love about you is…” or “A moment with you I keep thinking about is….”
“Think about the last time you saw this person,” she says. “What did you do? What were you laughing about? What did you love that they said to you?” The answers to those questions might spark inspiration and guide your words.
Keep in mind that a handwritten card can do something a store-bought one can’t: it’ll sound unmistakably like you. It leaves room for inside jokes, shared memories, and the small details that only make sense to two people. “What’s great about handwritten cards is they afford you the opportunity to tailor your message to reflect you, your partner, and your relationship,” says Laura Kurtz, a social psychologist and program manager of the Love Consortium, a group of researchers who study social connections. “The power is in the personalization.”

Kurtz suggests considering what qualities you most admire about that person, and working them into your message. “What do you love about them?” she asks. “Try not to focus on what they do or how they make you feel, but rather emphasize what it is about them—who they are as a person—that you find most remarkable.”
If that feels like a lot to put into words, that’s OK. The message itself can stay simple.
“Your card doesn’t have to be a grand overture of love,” Kurtz says. “A simple, thoughtful note that speaks to the positive qualities of your partner and relationship can be just as powerful.”

Faster EU accession is possible, but European Union must take all candidates into account – Ukraine's foreign minister
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has stated in Munich that Ukraine is consulting with partners about setting a fixed date for accession to the European Union, and that any such agreements must also take other candidate countries into account.
Source: Sybiha speaking to journalists in Munich, as reported by European Pravda
Details: The minister emphasised that Ukraine's public calls to enshrine a specific accession date in official documents are realistic.
"All these discussions are realistic. Ukraine is openly raising the positions and expectations we count on," he said.
According to Sybiha, negotiations on how to formalise such a date are based on the understanding that this is not only about Ukraine's accession, but also about a new security framework.
"For us, EU membership is an element of security guarantees. That is why we are currently holding active consultations with our European partners," he explained.
The minister added that his optimism is partly based on the fact that Ukraine and the EU managed to overcome the issue of Hungary's veto by launching a frontloading process. "This is a good example of how to find the right formulas for advancing Ukraine's membership in the EU," he said.
"But we must not forget that there are also the Western Balkans and Moldova [undergoing accession into the EU – ed.]. Therefore, this is a comprehensive issue, and we are working with our European partners," he noted. In particular, the minister explained that under any scenario – including a possible fast-track accession for Ukraine – Kyiv would not go through the process alone. "It is very important to understand that Ukraine is categorically against decoupling [separating the Ukraine-Moldova group in the accession process – ed.], because Moldova and Ukraine share a common path toward EU membership," Sybiha explained.

Rights group says verified death toll in last month’s Iran protests has passed 7,000

Rights group says verified death toll in last month’s Iran protests has passed 7,000
HRANA’s figure emerges as world’s largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald Ford, said headed to region; WSJ reports US smuggled thousands of Starlink terminals into Iran amid blackout
The verified death toll from the Iranian regime’s crackdown on nationwide protests last month has passed 7,000, with many more still feared dead, activists said Thursday.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency — which offered the latest figure of 7,005 people killed, including 214 government forces — has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in the country to verify deaths.
More than a month after the mass killing of demonstrators on January 8-9, a second round of talks between the US and Iran remains up in the air, while the American military continues to build up its forces in the region.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pressed his case directly with US President Donald Trump on Thursday to intensify demands on Tehran in the negotiations.
Trump told reporters at the White House that Iran should come to an agreement with Washington “very quickly,” and when asked for a timeline, said: “I guess over the next month, something like that.”
Netanyahu called the meeting “excellent” but said he “did not hide” his own “general skepticism” about any deal.
As the premier returned to Israel, it was reported that the US will send the world’s largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, to the region, to join the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, as well as other ships and warplanes the country has dispatched to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The move, which was first reported early Friday by The New York Times, came as US forces shot down a drone they said got too close to the Lincoln and came to the aid of a US-flagged ship that Iranian forces tried to stop in the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf.
6,000 Starlink terminals smuggled into Iran
Additionally, it was reported Thursday that Washington has smuggled around 6,000 Starlink satellite internet kits into Iran to aid protesters during a regime-imposed internet blackout.
A US official told The Wall Street Journal that senior Trump administration figures decided to use money for internet-freedom initiatives in Iran to purchase the terminals, which were mostly bought in January.
The official said it was unclear whether Trump personally ordered the delivery of the devices, but said the president was aware of it.
Owning a Starlink terminal is illegal in Iran and punishable by years in prison.
As anti-government protests swelled across Iran last month, Trump threatened to strike the Islamic Republic if it killed demonstrators. The US president also told the protesters, via social media, “HELP IS ON ITS WAY!”
So far, no operation by the US to directly help the protesters on the ground is known to have been carried out.
The White House declined to comment on the Journal’s report.
Tehran announces probe into mass protests
The Iranian government announced on Friday the establishment of a commission of inquiry related to the protests.
“A fact-finding committee has been formed with representatives from relevant institutions and is collecting documents and hearing statements,” Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani told the local news agency ISNA.
The spokeswoman did not specify whether the commission would only focus on the economic demands that triggered the protests or whether it would also investigate deaths during the protests.
“The final report will be published for public information and further legal action after the process is completed,” she stated.
On Thursday, a government website published comments by President Masoud Pezeskhian saying, “We have assigned teams to investigate the causes” of the unrest, without providing further details.
“We are ashamed that such unfortunate events have occurred,” Pezeshkian said.
Concern over Nobel Peace Prize laureate
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Friday it was “deeply appalled by credible reports detailing the brutal arrest, physical abuse and ongoing life‑threatening mistreatment” of 2023 Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi.
The committee that awards the prize said it had information that Mohammadi had been beaten during her arrest in December and continued to be mistreated. It called for her immediate and unconditional release.
“She continues to be denied adequate, sustained medical follow‑up while being subjected to heavy interrogation and intimidation,” the committee said. “She has fainted several times, suffers from dangerously high blood pressure, and has been prevented from accessing necessary follow‑up for suspected breast tumors.”
Iran just sentenced Mohammadi, 53, to over seven more years in prison. Supporters had warned for months before her arrest that she was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.

As presidents of the bar, “it is our duty to point out that the time for justice is not the time for the media, and that the mission of lawyers is to represent each of the parties in order to guarantee a fair trial. Justice must not be the media’s justice, nor that of private justice”, they wrote.
The chairs of the bar refered to the “climate of tension” in which the proceedings were taking place, marked by “particularly intense media coverage” in which some lawyers are participating, sometimes in violation of normal practice. They called for restraint.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called for re-setting relations between Europe and the United States to bridge the gap between them.
"Let me start with an uncomfortable truth: there is a rift in relations between Europe and the United States," he said at the Munich Security Conference. He pointed out that US Vice President JD Vance "very openly stated" this at last year's security conference.
"If we want our partnership to have a future, we need to give it a jumpstart, imbue it with new meaning," Merz said, adding that the United States also depends on its NATO partners. "In the age of superpowers, the United States also depends on this trust. Even they will ultimately reach the limits of their might if they act alone," he warned.

U.S. military completes transfer of 5,700 IS detainees from Syria to Iraq
The U.S. military has moved thousands of Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq, where Iraqi authorities expect to try them
- Bookmark
The U.S. military has completed the transfer of thousands of Islamic State group detainees from Syria to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial in the future, the U.S. Central Command said Friday.
CENTCOM said that the transfer that began on Jan. 21 saw U.S. forces transporting more than 5,700 adult male IS suspects from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody.
The prisoners were transferred to Iraq at the request of Baghdad — a move welcomed by the U.S.-led coalition that had for years fought against IS.
“We appreciate Iraq’s leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security,” said Adm. Brad Cooper, CENTCOM commander.
Over the past three weeks, the U.S. military escorted the detainees from 60 different nationalities from prisons in northeastern Syria run by the U.S.-backed and Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, to Baghdad.
The transfers have helped calm fears that the recent rounds of fighting in Syria between government forces and the SDF would allow the IS prisoners to flee from detention camps there and join militant sleeper cells that are still carrying out attacks in both Iraq and Syria.
Iraq is looking to put on trial some of the thousands of the IS detainees who were held for years in Syria without charges or access to the judicial system.
When IS declared a caliphate — a self-proclaimed territory under a traditional form of Islamic rule — in large parts of Syria and Iraq that the militant group seized in 2014, it attracted extremists from around the world.
From the caliphate, the extremists plotted attacks around the world that left hundreds dead from Europe to Arab countries and Asia.
“The successful execution of this orderly and secure transfer operation will help prevent an ISIS resurgence in Syria,” said U.S. Army Maj. Gen. Kevin Lambert, commander of the Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve, that led the mission planning, coordination, and execution. He used an acronym to refer to the Islamic State group.

Louvre closes rooms after ‘major water leak,’ artworks reportedly damaged
Water believed to have come from floor above, possibly due to faulty pipe, local media report
ISTANBUL
A “major water leak” at the Louvre Museum has forced the closure of several exhibition rooms, with some artworks “apparently damaged,” French broadcaster BFMTV reported Friday.
The leak, described by the museum’s technical teams as an “emergency situation,” occurred overnight between Thursday and Friday in Room 707, known as the Duchatel Room, on the first floor of the Denon wing.
The room houses works from the 15th and 16th centuries, including canvases by Bernardino Luini such as Christ Blessing, Savior of the World, as well as Calvary with Saint Dominic in Prayer by Fra Angelico. It also features The Triumph of French Painting: Apotheosis of Poussin, Le Sueur and Le Brun by 19th-century French painter Charles Meynier.
According to the report, the leak was discovered late Thursday night and was initially classified internally as a technical incident before being escalated to an emergency. The water is believed to have come from the floor above, possibly due to a faulty pipe, BFMTV said.
Scaffolding has been installed as a precautionary measure, and the museum’s website indicates that Rooms 706 to 708, including the Salon Carre, are currently closed to visitors. The ceiling in the affected area has sustained significant damage, requiring the space to be shut down indefinitely.
A source cited by BFMTV said some artworks were “apparently damaged,” though an expert assessment has been launched to determine the extent of the impact.
The incident comes less than three months after another major flooding episode at the Louvre on Nov. 26, when “dirty water” inundated the Egyptian Antiquities library, damaging books and archival documents.
The latest setback adds to mounting challenges at the world’s most visited museum, which has recently faced labor tensions and internal disputes.
Unions renewed a strike notice earlier this week and called for a general assembly amid ongoing criticism of the museum’s leadership.
French Culture Minister Rachida Dati is reportedly considering leadership changes at the institution, including the possible dismissal of Louvre President Laurence des Cars, according to political and union sources.
Museum officials have not yet issued a detailed public statement on the extent of the damage.

Second U.S. aircraft carrier expected to head to Middle East, officials say, amid Iran tensions
The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier and its escort ships are expected to head from the Caribbean to the Middle East, three U.S. officials told CBS News, adding a second aircraft carrier to the region as tensions between the U.S. and Iran continue to simmer.
The Ford — which is the Navy's most advanced aircraft carrier — is set to join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its carrier strike group, which arrived in the Middle East late last month. The region is overseen by the U.S. military's Central Command.
The Ford carrier strike group has been in the Caribbean region since November, part of a broader military buildup near Venezuela. American forces in that region have conducted dozens of strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats and, last month, captured former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife.
The New York Times was first to report on the Ford's expected movement.
The planned deployment comes as President Trump presses Iran to strike a nuclear deal, threatening military action against Iran if it doesn't agree to curb its nuclear program. The president also pressured Iran over its violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters last month.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly warned in recent weeks that a "massive armada" is on its way to Iran. In an interview with Axios on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he was "thinking" about sending another aircraft carrier strike group to the Middle East region..
"Either we will make a deal or we will have to do something very tough like last time," he told Axios, seemingly referring to a set of U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites in June.
Mr. Trump told NBC News last week that Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, "should be very worried." Khamenei, meanwhile, warned that any attacks by the U.S. would spark a "regional war" in the Middle East.
Representatives from Iran and the U.S. held indirect talks in Oman last week. Officials from both countries said the talks went well and that negotiations would continue.

Macron calls for stronger measures against antisemitism in France at Ilan Halimi ceremony

French President Emmanuel Macron called for intensified efforts to combat antisemitism in France, as recent government data showed hostility toward Jews has remained high.
Macron held a tree-planting ceremony at the Elysee Presidential Palace in Paris to commemorate 20 years since the death of Ilan Halimi, a 23-year-old Jewish man who died after being kidnapped and held captive for 24 days.
A gang leader was sentenced in 2009 to life in prison for his abduction, torture, and murder.
"Schools, the justice system, elected officials: everyone must be mobilised," Macron said during a speech before the ceremony.
He criticized what he called the "poison of online hatred" and urged the European Commission to hold big online platforms accountable.
"In the France of the Enlightenment, 'free speech' stops at antisemitism and racism," the French leader said.
Antisemitism rising across France, Europe
France, which has the largest Jewish community in Europe, documented 1,320 antisemitic acts in 2025, accounting for 53% of all anti-religious incidents, according to a report released on Thursday by the Interior Ministry.
Even as incidents fell 16% year-on-year, they remained at "historically high" levels for three consecutive years, the Ministry said.
The increase followed Hamas's October 7 massacre and attack on Israel.
Antisemitic acts continue to rise across Europe. Britain recorded 3,700 antisemitic incidents in 2025, a 4% increase and the second-worst year on record, according to data published on Wednesday by the Community Security Trust, which protects Jews in the UK.
In Germany, cases of antisemitism nearly doubled to 8,627 last year, according to the Federal Research and Information Point for Antisemitism, pointing to violence, vandalism, and threats tied to the Israel-Hamas War.

In the latest episode of The Jerusalem Dispatch, hosts Ruth Marks Eglash, editor-in-chief of The Jerusalem Report, and journalist and news anchor Calev Ben-David, discuss the ongoing geopolitical dynamics surrounding Israel, Iran, and the United States. Their conversation revolves around the recent diplomatic discussions between Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Trump, focusing on Iran's nuclear program and regional influence.
Eglash reflects on how Netanyahu’s visit to Washington revealed that Israel did not receive the desired approval from the US for military action against Iran. Instead, President Trump emphasized a diplomatic path to resolve tensions.
While Netanyahu’s initial visit suggested a potential military strike, the lack of a press briefing following the meeting pointed to a shift in strategy, with Trump advocating for negotiations rather than direct confrontation.
The hosts delve into the complexity of addressing Iran’s nuclear ambitions, its missile program, and support for regional proxies like Hezbollah. They highlight the challenge of enforcing any comprehensive deal with Iran, noting that while the nuclear issue is critical, addressing Iran's broader influence in the region remains a daunting task.
Shifting to relations between Israel and diaspora
The discussion shifts to the impact of October 7 on Israeli-diaspora relations. Ruth discusses the divide between Israelis and Jews in the diaspora, exacerbated by differing perspectives on political issues like Israel's judicial reforms and the conduct of the Gaza war.
Both hosts note the rise in antisemitism following October 7 and the sense of solidarity that followed, but they also acknowledge the generational and ideological gaps that persist, particularly among younger Jews.
They conclude by reflecting on the future of Jewish unity and media coverage of Israel, touching on the changing dynamics of foreign news reporting, particularly with the closure of The Washington Post's Jerusalem Bureau. Despite challenges, the hosts remain optimistic that Israel’s cultural influence and connections to the Diaspora can continue to grow.

Russia not ready for serious talks, will end war only after exhaustion — Merz
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated this at the opening of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
"My personal view is that this war will end when Russia is at least financially, and potentially militarily, exhausted. We are moving closer to that point. We have done a great deal to bring this about, but we are not there yet. Russia must end this terrible war against Ukraine," the chancellor said.
He stressed that it is necessary to work together to "do everything needed to bring Russia to the point where it sees no advantage in continuing this terrible war."
Merz noted that the war has already lasted longer than the Second World War, and while responsibility for ending it lies with Russia, only joint efforts by the United States, Europe, and Ukraine – military, economic, political, and diplomatic – can bring it to an end.
"Russia has the possibility to stop this war. But we also have that possibility – America, Europe, and Ukraine together – to bring Russia to that threshold where the war can be stopped. And we must do everything in our power to achieve this: by military, economic, political, and diplomatic means – by any means necessary," he said.
Commenting on the possibility of a European dialogue with Russia to end its war against Ukraine, Merz said this makes sense, but first the Russians "must demonstrate that they are genuinely ready to talk about ending their aggression, and then about peace."
The 62nd Munich Security Conference opened in Germany on February 13, bringing together around 1,000 participants from nearly 120 countries, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, more than 30 defense ministers, and leaders of over 40 international organizations.
The Ukrainian delegation is led by President Volodymyr Zelensky.

Jews pray on Jerusalem's Temple Mount as decades-old status quo begins to shift

Escorted by police, a group of about 25 people walked across the Temple Mount esplanade to the steps leading up to the Dome of the Rock, the site where the First and Second Temples once stood.
They climbed a few steps toward the mosque, singing “Yedid Nefesh” (“soulmate”), usually sung on Friday nights.
“Are you with us?” a policeman asked this reporter.
When I said no, he told me to stop filming as participants in the group continued to video themselves walking on the large courtyard of the mount.
The men did not want to be interviewed, but Ilana, one of the few women in the group – who asked that only her first name be used – agreed to speak.
Wearing a white kerchief covering her hair, Ilana said she had immigrated to Israel from the Ukraine.
“I used to go to pray at the Kotel,” she said, referring to the Western Wall, just below the Temple Mount. “But then I started coming here whenever I had the opportunity. It feels very special to pray here.”
A few Muslims sitting on a nearby stone wall watched the group silently.
Ali, who said he goes to pray every day at Al-Aqsa (so called because it was “the farthest” mosque from Mecca when the Quran was revealed), said Jewish groups visiting and even praying there doesn’t bother him.
“It does disturb some people, but it doesn’t bother me,” he said. “If they do it quietly, it’s okay. People should worship God in the way they want to.”
But other Palestinians disagreed. A group of three women from the Galilee, who said they come about once a week to pray at the mosque for their families and for those who were killed in Gaza, frowned as they watched the Jewish group.
“This place is for Islam, and Jews are supposed to pray at the Wall,” Samira said.
Indeed, that has been the case since 1967 when Israel took over Jerusalem’s Old City from Jordan during the Six Day War. For many Israelis, it was the fulfillment of a dream, with the chance to pray at the Kotel – the Western Wall. The iconic photo of three paratroopers standing at the Wall is inscribed into every Israeli’s DNA.
The Temple Mount, which Muslims call the Haram al-Sharif, is holy to both Jews and Muslims.
For Jews, it is the site of both the First and Second Temples (destroyed in 586 BCE and 70 CE, respectively), and the holiest site in Judaism. For Muslims, it is the site where Mohammed ascended to heaven on a miraculous trip called Isra’ and Mi’raj (“the night journey and ascension”) and is the third-holiest site after Mecca and Medina.
Some approve, others don’t
When Israel conquered east Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it, then-defense minister Moshe Dayan made a controversial decision to allow the Waqf (Islamic religious trust) to continue administering the site, while Israel would be responsible for its security.
In an effort to ease potential tensions in 1967, the government made a decision that while Jews could visit the site, they could not pray, dance, or engage in any other religious activity.
As part of the deal, while Muslim prayer is permitted in the area, and hundreds of thousands go there to pray during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan (see box), Jewish prayer was not permitted.
The area has long been a flashpoint for Israeli-Palestinian tensions, and riots have repeatedly broken out after Muslim worshipers threw rocks at Jews praying at the Western Wall below and police stormed the area.
Hamas’s name for the massacre of Oct. 7, 2023, is “Al-Aqsa Flood,” an effort to rally the Muslim world around this religiously significant location.
In the past few years, the number of Jews ascending to the Temple Mount has increased dramatically to more than 68,000 in the Hebrew year that ended in September 2025, an increase of 22% over the previous year, according to the Beyadenu activist group. The change is also partly due to recent rabbinic rulings that according to Jewish law, Jews are allowed to visit part of the Temple Mount esplanade – the large area that includes both the Dome of the Rock and the Aqsa Mosque.
Some rabbis have said that Jews should not visit the area, either because of ritual purity laws or because there are some parts like the Holy of Holies that only the high priest was allowed to enter, and only on Yom Kippur.
Now, in the past few weeks, in what amounts to a dramatic change to the status quo that has prevailed since 1967, police have begun to allow Jewish prayer on the Temple Mount under certain conditions.
Not a concentration camp
Five months ago, Rabbi Leo Dee, whose first wife and two of their daughters were killed in a terrorist attack on April 7, 2023, ascended the Temple Mount on the day of his second wedding.
He said it is a custom to go to the site on your wedding day. He arrived at the Mugrabi Gate, the entrance that is designated for non-Muslims to use, wearing his tefillin.
“Usually, as you go through security, the police ask you to remove your tefillin, but somehow this time they didn’t notice,” he told the Magazine.
“We davened [prayed] all of “Shaharit” from our phones,” he said, “then we danced for a few minutes celebrating my wedding. One of the policemen said, ‘I’d like to escort you to the chief of police because it’s forbidden to put on tefillin.’ I responded that the only place I thought it was forbidden was in concentration camps in Germany.”
Dee said that prayer at the site feels different.
“When you pray there, you pray as near as you can to where Jacob had his dream about the ladder, to where Abraham and his son Isaac were for the Akeida [the binding of Isaac], to where our ancestors would sacrifice animals, and to the place where the Shechina [the presence of God] dwells.”
In any case, in the past few weeks police have allowed Jews to enter the Temple Mount compound with prayer pages, printed by the Temple Mount Yeshiva, whose leaders are close to National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir. This change comes just weeks after he appointed his close associate, Maj.-Gen. Avshalom Peled, as commander of the Jerusalem District Police.
Real status quo change?
Israeli officials deny that there has been a major change to the status quo.
“The Israel Police operates throughout the year to enable freedom of worship and visitation to the Temple Mount for all religions and communities, while strictly maintaining public order and the rules in place at the site, in accordance with the directives of the political echelon,” the police spokesman said in a statement in response to a request for an interview by the Magazine.
“Following a request submitted by the administration of the Temple Mount Yeshiva, the police approved the entry of guidance sheets for visitors,” the statement said. “However, in order to maintain the existing order, it was determined that the use of these sheets would be limited to specific areas defined by the police.
“The Israel Police continues to act with discretion and responsibility in order to maintain a balance between the various needs at the Temple Mount,” it concluded.
But for those who have long advocated for Jewish prayer there, the new rules are a step in the right direction.
“Four years ago, someone would utter a prayer under his breath or say a quick ‘Kaddish,’” said Yisrael Medad, who has been up to the Temple Mount hundreds of times, beginning in 1970. “Now people can prostrate themselves and the police let them pray, sometimes for up to five minutes.”
He has even led tours of the Temple Mount.
“For many people, it is a very powerful experience,” he said. “And if they [Muslims] can pray there, we should be able to pray there.”
Rabbi Dee goes even further.
“We should declare sovereignty over the Temple Mount,” he said. “As long as it is in their hands, they believe they are the sovereign rulers.”

NEW YORK, February 13. /TASS/. Disagreements over the legitimacy of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was kidnapped by US servicemen, do not hinder joint work between Caracas and Washington, the country’s authorized president Delcy Rodriguez said.
"Not at all. I don't consider it a difficult task," she said in an interview with NBC News in response to a journalist's question about whether opposing positions complicate Caracas' work with the US administration.
According to Rodriguez, "diplomatic and political dialogue," as well as cooperation in the energy sector, serve as "a channel that will crush all fake news."
On January 3, Washington announced a military operation in Caracas, as a result of which US servicemen captured Maduro and his wife. On January 5, they appeared before a federal court in the Southern District of New York. They are charged with involvement in drug trafficking. Neither Maduro nor his wife pleaded guilty. Rodriguez, who served as executive vice president under Maduro, is currently acting as head of state in Venezuela. The US administration has stated that Washington will temporarily take over the administration of Venezuela.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Ukrainian Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov has revealed who will represent Kiev at the upcoming round of trilateral talks in Geneva on February 17 and 18.
"[Vladimir Zelensky] has approved the preliminary composition of the negotiating group. Besides me, our group will include [presidential office head] Kirill Budanov (designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia - TASS), [General Staff Chief] Andrey Gnatov, [the ruling Servant of the People party’s parliamentary faction head] David Arakhamia, [Ukrainian presidential office first deputy head] Sergey Kislitsa, and [Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate Deputy Chief] Vadim Skibitsky," Umerov wrote on his Telegram channel.
According to Umerov, the Ukrainian delegation has already begun preparations for the meeting.
Earlier, Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov announced the date and the venue of the next round of negotiations between Russia, the United States, and Ukraine. He also said the Russian delegation will be headed by Presidential Aide Vladimir Medinsky.
The first round of trilateral security consultations involving Russia, Ukraine, and the United States was held on January 23-24 in Abu Dhabi. The Russian negotiating group was headed by Igor Kostyukov, head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff. On February 4-5, in Abu Dhabi, the second round of trilateral negotiations between Russia, the United States, and Ukraine took place. Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov noted that the success of the talks hinges on secrecy, which is why Moscow "maintains a diplomatic silence" on the results of the Abu Dhabi contacts.

War in Ukraine will end only if Russia is economically and militarily exhausted – Merz
Russia’s war against Ukraine will end only when Russia is economically and militarily exhausted, and Moscow is not yet ready for serious negotiations, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has said.
"My personal assumption is that this war will end only when Russia is at least economically, and possibly also militarily, exhausted. We are approaching that moment, but we are still approaching it," he said at the opening of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
"Russia is not yet ready for serious negotiations," Merz said.
"Russia must abandon this terrible war against Ukraine. And we must do everything necessary to bring them to the point where they no longer see an advantage in continuing this terrible war," he said.
The German chancellor added that this point had not yet been reached. He described it as "terrible" that Russia’s war against Ukraine has already lasted longer than the Second World War, and said the United States, Europe, and Ukraine must do everything possible to stop Russia through military, economic, political, and diplomatic means.
"And if there is a point in talking, we are ready to talk — but they must acknowledge that they are genuinely ready to talk about a ceasefire, and then about a peace plan," Merz said.

Russia’s foreign national debt remains one of the lowest among major economies — experts

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia remains one of the countries with the lowest level of foreign national debt among the world's largest economies, according to experts interviewed by TASS.
Russia’s foreign national debt has exceeded $60 bln, according to statistics published by the Finance Ministry. By February 1, 2026, it had risen to $61.9 bln, according to the ministry’s documents.
"The government's foreign currency debt has increased slightly, but not by a critical amount. This was primarily due to the Finance Ministry issuing yuan bonds in 2025. In my opinion, it is necessary to observe the overall limit of 20% of GDP for government debt. This is important not only for the state's financial capacity, but also to prevent the state from withdrawing excess financial resources from the financial market and limiting companies' ability to raise funds for their development," said Alexander Abramov, head of the Laboratory for the Analysis of Institutions and Financial Markets at the Presidential Academy.
The expert noted that Russia's foreign national debt is one of the lowest among large countries. According to the expert, even a temporary increase above the 20% threshold would not be critical – it is important to properly assess and manage potential risks.
"There are two main risks with regard to government debt: high debt servicing costs and the risk of creating liquidity shocks to domestic financial resources," the expert said.
For example, there is currently a sharp rise in money market rates in the yuan market. This is largely due to the fact that the Finance Ministry raised a significant amount of yuan through the placement of government bonds. Therefore, theoretically, exceeding 20% of the debt could create both risks of rising debt servicing costs and liquidity risks in the domestic financial market, the expert noted.
According to Anton Tabakh, Chief Economist at Expert RA, it is the national debt-to-GDP ratio that is more important. According to him, the economy in dollar terms has grown significantly over 20 years. The national debt-to-GDP ratio itself is important in conjunction with the structure of liabilities and their repayment schedule.
"There are no uniform 'gold standards' for public debt. Russia has the lowest level of public debt (both in rubles and foreign currency) of any major economy," the expert stressed.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said earlier that Russia's national debt is one of the lowest among major developed countries. Last December, Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov stated that in the medium-term forecast, Russia's public debt was not expected to exceed 20% of GDP, which is an advantageous factor for the Russian economy. Currently, it stands at around 15% of GDP, he noted.

Invictus Games gold medallist could face jail over dishonest disability claim
The Ministry of Defence has accused Debbie O’Connell of ‘lies’ about the extent of her injury
- Bookmark
A former soldier turned champion para-athlete could go to prison after being “dishonest” about her disability in a £1.74m damages claim.
Debbie O’Connell was in the Royal Horse Artillery’s ceremonial unit, the King’s Troop, in 2015 when she fell off her horse and broke her collarbone.
Ms O’Connell claimed that the fall made her left arm almost useless.
After she left the army, she embarked on a successful para-athletics career. She won gold medals for cycling at the 2018 Invictus Games, and for sprinting at world-level competitions.
In September 2018, she launched a £2.4m compensation claim against the Ministry of Defence, later scaled down to £1.74m. However, despite a judge's finding that she was injured, she had her case thrown out due to “fundamental dishonesty”.
At the High Court in 2025, Judge Christopher Kennedy KC said Ms O’Connell’s evidence about ongoing pain “must be dishonest” due to video footage showing her doing various activities, including leading a horse and chopping vegetables, and slapped her with the £200,000-plus costs bill for the case.
But her case was back in court again on Friday after the MoD launched an application to have Ms O’Connell committed to prison for contempt of court, accusing her of telling “lies” about the extent of her disability.
Lawyers for Ms O’Connell argued the contempt bid should be blocked, telling the court she has already “suffered enough”.
But giving permission for the contempt case to go ahead, Mr Justice Coppel said it is in the “public interest” that committal applications be pursued when claims are “prosecuted on a false basis, as has been found in this case”.
“It seems to me that the public interest plainly permits, and requires, that this committal application be made,” he said, giving permission for a five-day contempt hearing to take place.
During the trial of the case, the court heard Ms O’Connell shattered her left collarbone in four places when she fell in 2015, leading to damage she claimed left her with chronic pain in her left arm and shoulder.
She had been training as a mounted gunner with the Royal Horse Artillery’s King’s Troop, but ended up being discharged from the forces two years later.
The King’s Troop is a ceremonial unit of the Royal Horse Artillery, tasked with driving teams of six horses pulling First World War-era cannons during high-profile public displays.
Troopers wear a distinctive blue and gold uniform dating back to the Napoleonic wars and are called on to fire the royal salutes marking grand-scale state occasions, such as the Queen’s birthday and platinum jubilee.
In her claim, Ms O’Connell claimed her fall was caused by riding boots which were two sizes too large and because the horse allotted to her had a tendency to buck.
But disputing the claim, the MoD accused her of exaggerating the impact of her injuries while “dishonestly” pursuing a para athletics career in the T46 category – for competitors with limb impairments comparable with an “athlete with a unilateral above-elbow amputation”.
MoD barrister Niazi Fetto KC said she had “relied upon her dishonest pursuit of a para-athletics career in the knowledge that her condition does not fall within the T46 category”.
Giving evidence, Ms O’Connell, of Lincoln, denied being dishonest, insisting that her damages claim was genuine and that allegations of “cheating” are “not credible” because she fits squarely into the T46 classification.
She told the court she had simply “described my condition” when asked and been given the classification.
As a soldier, she said she had been taught to “push through pain” and, in pursuing her athletics career, is simply doing her best to make the most of her life, despite her injury.
She competed in the Invictus Games in 2018, winning two gold and two silver medals, before also competing in para-athletics as a sprinter and also in CrossFit, which tests the fitness and endurance of athletes.
In his judgment on the claim last year, Judge Kennedy said that by 2022, when the surveillance footage was shot, Ms O'Connell was still reporting that she “needed assistance with cutting food and preparing hot drinks along with aspects of bathing and dressing/undressing. She reported that her pain remained the same as before and it restricted her daily activities.”
“[But] the claimant’s presentation on the video is of someone with normal or near normal function in their left upper limb and shoulder,” he said.
“That is what I find the claimant had at that time. I do not accept her accounts of continuing pain and hypersensitivity. I find her evidence in relation to her symptoms must be dishonest.”
Although the accident had for some time had “serious disabling consequences”, there was a “stark” difference between what she had told experts in the case and what she was seen doing by the time of the surveillance footage in 2022.
“This is a claim which I have found to be fundamentally dishonest. The claimant has persisted with her dishonesty over a long period. She has sought to engage others and her attempts to conceal the truth have been sophisticated.”
On Friday, the case went back to court, with MoD barrister Mr Fetto applying for permission to bring contempt of court proceedings against Ms O'Connell.
The KC said there was a “public interest” in the contempt case – which could result in up to two years’ imprisonment – being allowed to proceed.
However, for Ms O’Connell, barrister Ian Denham argued that the case should not go ahead, telling Mr Justice Coppel that Ms O’Connell had “suffered enough already.”
She had lost her case, been handed the MoD’s massive legal costs bill for it and, having been found “fundamentally dishonest” in a public judgment, would suffer further public repercussions, he said.
He also argued that some of the specific allegations of contempt were not backed by evidence, since they involved statements made before the surveillance evidence.
She had also only been found dishonest to the civil standard of proof, not the higher criminal standard which would apply in a contempt case, he said.
But after a short hearing in London on Friday afternoon, Mr Justice Coppel ruled against Ms O’Connell.
“There are strong findings of fundamental dishonesty made against the defendant in the judgment,” he said.
“I am going to give permission, insofar as it’s necessary, for the claimant to pursue each of the allegations.”
A hearing to decide if Ms O’Connell was in contempt of court and if she should be jailed will now take place at a later date.
The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years behind bars.

Is it too early to write your will?

Is it too early to write your will?
Will writing is not something to put off, a financial planner explains why.
- Bookmark
It can be easy to feel invincible and as though we’re destined to live forever. After all, why think about death when there’s so much living to do first? But, just like taxes, dying is guaranteed – it’s just a matter of when, not if.
Of course, the hope is that it won’t happen until you are a grand old age. Things do not always go to plan though, and being prepared in advance, especially when it comes to writing a will, can make your passing a tiny bit less difficult for those that love you.
Is there an optimum time to write one though? Is there an age limit? Or can you put one together too soon? “The short answer is, you have to be at least 18 to make your will. So you do have to be an adult,” says Tony Fuller, chartered financial planner at Path Financial. “But beyond that, it’s more common for people to do it too late than too early.”
When to think about writing your will
It’s certainly not mandatory that you visit a solicitor the day you turn 18, that would probably put a downer on the birthday festivities. Instead, Fuller says, “there are some natural times that people start to think about, or should start to think about, making a will…”
1. Firstly, when you come into money. “It’s more important if you have property or wealth,” he explains. “If you accrue some other money in life, maybe you run a business or generate some savings, having a will can become really important so that you define how you want your money to pass should something happen to you.”
2. Secondly, “If you buy a property with a partner for the first time, it can be very important to have a will for unmarried partners.” For married couples, if there are no children and no will, the surviving spouse tends to inherit everything. But for unmarried couples, “if you die without a will, then your estate will pass according to the laws of intestacy, a predefined order of inheritance,” says Fuller.
“For unmarried partners, that can often not be what they want, maybe their money will go to a parent, for example, rather than their partner. So it’s definitely important to think about what you want to do in that position, and consider making a will.”
3. Thirdly, becoming a parent. “For people that have children, a will can define who you want to look after them in the event that you die,” says Fuller. “You can appoint certain people to be the guardians for your children in your will.”
Look beyond the money
Fuller is adamant that will writing – contrary to what watching Succession may have led you to believe – is “not all about wealth. There’s a lot of other good reasons for making a will, don’t let not having wealth be a barrier to creating a will, it’s still well worth doing.”

For instance, “you can also choose things like if you want to be buried or cremated”. “Those kinds of decisions and having a will in itself, can take a lot of stress off loved ones in the event of death,” he continues.
Wills are not set in stone until you die
The first draft you make is not the one you have to stick to throughout your life. Who you are at 25 might not reflect who you are at 45 or 75. People get divorced, remarried, have more than one child, move houses, buy second homes, make money (and sometimes lose it all) – life does not remain static, and a will shouldn’t either.
“When young people think about making a will, sometimes they think: ‘Is this still going to be the same as what I wish in five or 10 years’ time?’ And if the answer is no or maybe not, then maybe they defer or delay making a will,” says Fuller. “That can be the wrong thing to do, because a will isn’t a once-and-done situation. You can update it. In fact, you should update it regularly throughout your life as circumstances change.”
It’s never too early to start having conversations about wills
Just because children are not legally able to write a will, doesn’t mean they won’t be interested in the concept. They may worry about who would look after certain teddies if something happened to them, for instance, and parents can promise to honour their wishes to give reassurance if appropriate.
“I remember when I was young and watched The Lion King and Mufasa died in that gorge,” says Fuller. “You start to learn about death and some of these concepts [early on], often it seems to be that Disney films kill someone off. Having conversations with our kids about some of these concepts is a good idea.”
How to write a will
“Typically, when we speak to clients, we would suggest they take professional advice unless they’re very certain about what they’re going to do and have a very simple set of circumstances,” says Fuller.
“If it’s a case of you can’t afford to take advice from a solicitor and have them draft it for you, then perhaps you’d be better off getting a will pack online or using an online service, of which there’s a few around, rather than not having a will if it came down to that choice. But best practice would be to take advice about what you’re putting in your will, particularly if your circumstances are complex.”
Don’t leave it too late
“It’s very rarely too early to make a will and it can be too late, and it’s often too late for most people,” warns Fuller. “By the time people get around to it, I would typically say they should have done it a few years earlier. So if you’re thinking about making one and that it might be the right time, then go ahead and do it, because it probably is.”

Israel's Ben-Gvir storms Ofer Prison, oversees abuse of Palestinian detainees

Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Friday forced his way into Ofer Prison, west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, in a visit marked by intimidation and abuse of Palestinian prisoners.
Ben-Gvir entered the prison accompanied by senior police officials, including Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai, days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s Channel 7 reported, saying that stun grenades were fired near Palestinian prisoners’ cells during the visit.
Ben-Gvir, known for publishing inflammatory videos targeting Palestinian detainees and repeatedly threatening them, has openly boasted about tightening prison conditions for Palestinians since taking office in late 2022.
During his tour, he said the changes imposed on prisons were “not enough” and vowed to push for legislation allowing the execution of Palestinian prisoners.
“This is not a luxury hotel. It is a real prison,” Ben-Gvir said, expressing satisfaction with what he described as a “fundamental change” in detention conditions.
Conditions for Palestinian prisoners have sharply deteriorated under Ben-Gvir’s tenure amid severe restrictions, widespread abuse and noticeable weight loss among detainees.
Palestinian and Israeli rights groups say former prisoners released in recent months have reported systematic torture, sexual violence, starvation and medical neglect, with some showing signs of severe psychological trauma.
In November 2025, Israel’s parliament advanced at first reading a bill introduced by Ben-Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party that would allow the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis.
The proposal still requires second and third readings to become law, and no vote date has been set.
More than 9,300 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including about 350 children, according to figures through early February.
Rights organisations have repeatedly warned that abuse of Palestinian prisoners has intensified since October 2023, alongside Israel’s Gaza genocide.

Europe moves to build its own 'Oreshnik' missile

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Germany and France are interested in developing a new land-based intermediate-range ballistic missile with a non-nuclear warhead and are in talks with the aerospace company ArianeGroup to build the weapon, Reuters reported.
"People are trying to understand what is at stake with ballistic systems," Vincent Pery, ArianeGroup's director of defense programs, told reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. According to him, ArianeGroup is holding "preliminary discussions with several countries" about how the weapon would fit into the geopolitical context, keeping in mind that ballistic missiles are already fielded by Russia and in the Middle East.
Reuters notes that ArianeGroup previously proposed a new land-based ballistic missile for Europe. The Aviacionline website points out that the company showcased the Missile Balistique Terrestre/Missile Balistique de Theatre (MBT) concept at the International Paris Air Show at Le Bourget last year.
The weapon presented by ArianeGroup is a high-precision ground-launched intermediate-or intermediate-to-long-range ballistic missile similar to Russia’s Oreshnik.
The missile’s features, as announced by ArianeGroup, include an approximate flight distance of 1,000 to 1,500 kilometers, which is expected to be increased to over 2,000 kilometers, the capability of carrying a non-nuclear warhead, potentially high maneuvering capabilities, and hypersonic speed, at least in the terminal phase of flight.
The plan is to produce two versions of the missile, with one-and two-stage solid-fuel engines, while the warhead will be designed to split into hypersonic planning units.
As of the summer of 2025, the MBT program was at an early stage. What was showcased at the Le Bourget event was just a rough layout of the missile, aimed at drawing the interest of potential customers in Europe.
However, according to Aviacionline, the French authorities had by then allocated initial funds for the development of such a missile in their military plans. Up to one bln euro may be spent on this project. Paris expects the missile to enter service in 2030-2032.
While talking to reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Pery noted that ArianeGroup was in talks both with the French Ministry of the Armed Forces and the German government on a missile, which, in his words, would be capable of hitting targets at a distance of over 1,000 kilometers in minutes. However, he did not highlight any link to the concept presented in Le Bouget last year. Paris and Berlin did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Aviacionline claims that France is currently the only European NATO ally that has domestically-made ballistic missiles. Notably, its M51 submarine-launched missiles carry nuclear warheads and are seen as strategic weapons.
They, too, were developed by ArianeGroup, a joint venture between the French corporation Safran and the European aerospace company Airbus.
The media outlet emphasizes that the new initiative is aimed at creating a non-nuclear intermediate-range ballistic missile. French President Emmanuel Macron stated earlier that Europe "falls within the range of such missiles." This is why, he stressed, similar weapons must be developed in order to ensure security on the continent.
Meanwhile, Zuzanna Gwadera, a researcher with the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), believes that Europe has a long way to go before it has anything on par with Russia’s Oreshnik missile.
She pointed out that the EU had already introduced several joint initiatives to develop intermediate-and long-range missiles, including cruise missiles. One of the initiatives, the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, was announced last year. However, most of them are still at the concept stage, Gwadera said.

Lebanon's singer Fadl Shaker gets 'cleared' through Al-Assir's testimony
The military court in Lebanon heard testimony from singer Fadl Shaker yesterday, 12 February 2026, in cases related to the so-called "Abra battle" that took place in 2013 in Sidon, southern Lebanon. Shaker was accused of participating alongside Sheikh Ahmed Al-Assir and his followers in attacks against the Lebanese army and killing several soldiers.
The session saw a notable development as al-Assir testified as a witness and faced multiple questions, primarily about which side fired the first shot at the Lebanese army checkpoint.
The court adjourned the hearing until next month, 24 March, to hear two more witnesses.
A legal source following the case told Al Araby al-Jadeed, the Arabic language sister publication of The New Arab, that "the session was positive and favours Fadl Shaker, who repeatedly denied any involvement in the battle, firing at anyone, or joining any armed group."
"Ahmed Al-Assir's testimony, held in a closed session, confirmed that Fadl did not participate in the Abra battle. He was hiding in a room during the fighting before leaving the area, was not part of al-Assir's Free Resistance Brigades, and did not fund any armed group," the source added.
The source noted that "Al-Assir's testimony is important but cannot be taken in isolation, as there are conflicting accounts that may affect the course of the case and the decision regarding Shaker."
"Al-Assir discussed his relationship with Fadl Shaker, the friendship they shared, the later differences of opinion, and that armed men accompanied Shaker because he faced death threats. However, he did not carry or use weapons or participate in any battle," the source said.
Al-Assir also apparently addressed the widely circulated video of Shaker holding a weapon surrounded by men, confirming "it was a satirical clip that was misrepresented."
"Al-Assir emphasised that he did not carry a weapon himself, did not participate in the Abra battle, and did not incite the killing of Lebanese army personnel," the source added, noting there is a move to have Shaker's lawyer request his release.
Shaker had surrendered to an intelligence patrol at the Ain al-Hilweh camp in Sidon in October 2025, restarting investigations into the accusations against him after previous convictions were issued in absentia.
Shaker's lawyer, Amata Mubarak, repeatedly stated that her client did not surrender due to any deal or under threats at the Ain al-Hilweh Palestinian refugee camp but because he found the timing appropriate under a new presidential term, hoping for a fair trial without political interference.
In June 2013, clashes broke out between al-Assir's supporters and the Lebanese army in Abra near Sidon after an attack on an army checkpoint, killing more than 18 soldiers. The army seized a complex used by al-Assir and his followers, including Shaker.
Al-Assir was arrested in 2015 while attempting to flee via Beirut's Rafik Hariri International Airport and sentenced to death in 2017, despite Lebanon not applying capital punishment.
Shaker faced multiple in absentia convictions in three cases, with sentences ranging from five to 15 years, involving charges of incitement to murder, forming an armed gang with Al-Assir, armed appearance, and resisting army personnel, though he was cleared of some allegations.
The Beirut Criminal Court held a session last Friday, 6 February 2026, for Shaker and al-Assir in a case filed by a "Saraya al-Muqawama" official in Sidon, Hilal Hammoud, accusing them of attempting to kill him in May 2013 in Abra. The hearing was adjourned until 24 April.
Hammoud testified that a group affiliated with al-Assir attacked and threatened him before firing at him on his balcony, but he escaped with army assistance to Sidon's old quarter.
He also claimed that Shaker incited against him and threatened to burn his house via loudspeaker at Bilal Bin Rabah mosque, which Shaker denied, describing the case as politically motivated given his opposition to Hezbollah and the Assad regime.

Buzz of the Olympics: How drone cams deliver high-pace visuals and add a new dynamic for TV viewers
Drone cameras are changing how boradcasters show Olympic winter sports by chasing athletes down the course for fast and close-up shots
- Bookmark
Standing on a tower overlooking the cliffs of the Cortina downhill course, there is someone who is just as involved in the biggest skiing races of the Winter Olympics as Mikaela Shiffrin and Breezy Johnson.
Martin Bochatay is the drone cam pilot for the money shots inside the iconic Tofana schuss, the narrow chute between two walls of Dolomite rock.
He is part of a team in control of the buzzing machines that are flying right behind Olympians as they go for gold at the Milan Cortina Games, offering stunning and high-pace visuals to TV viewers back home.
“In my mind, I’m not flying a drone. I’m flying with the skiers,” Bochatay told The Associated Press before the Olympics. “It’s an immersive thing. ... The skiers don’t see us. But I’m right there with them. You become the drone.”
Drone cams have become ubiquitous in showcasing the speeds and angles of skiers, lugers, snowboarders, ski jumpers and other Winter Olympians at these Games.
“The skill of those drone pilots is just phenomenal,” U.S. bobsledder and flag bearer Frank Del Duca said. “It gets a really unique perspective.”
Viewers have noted the humming noise coming from the machines, sparking the question: Is it putting off the Olympians in the biggest moment of their lives? Norwegian downhiller Kajsa Vickhoff Lie says that's not an issue.
“No, you just maybe hear them on the start, but you don’t hear them when you ski,” she said.
The drones are tiny and zoom beyond 100 mph
Drone cams made in inauspicious impact on Alpine skiing 11 years ago when a primitive, massive machine came crashing down from the sky and nearly smashed into Austrian great Marcel Hirscher during a slalom race.
These days, the drones are agile, tiny — they weigh around half a pound (250 grams) — and can easily accelerate to speeds beyond 100 mph (more than 170 kph).
In all the sports, there are rules preventing the drones from overtaking the athletes, and they must keep a safe distance behind the competitors.
Pitch, roll and yaw: how to fly a drone
The drones actually contain two cameras. There’s a high-quality camera for broadcast purposes that is actually controlled by the TV production unit in a truck below the course.
“They can adjust whether it’s too bright, the balance, without us doing anything,” Bochatay said.
Then there’s a lower-quality camera that the pilots use to see where they are going. Those are the images that the pilots see in the goggles they wear to fly the drones.
The pilots have a remote control that requires two hands to hold, and contains two main switches to input the flying commands of pitch (front-to-back), roll (side-to-side) and yaw (vertical axis); plus throttle (up/down or altitude control).
“There’s always these four,” Bochatay said. “It’s not like you move one then the other. It’s everything at the same time.”
There’s also a low-tech issue: the batteries for the drones need to be changed constantly — and kept in warming cases due to the cold temperatures — requiring a “pit stop crew” to quickly sub in new batteries between runs.
Flying footage can be ‘nauseating’ but beautiful
Two things were important to Olympic broadcasting officials: Showing off both the beauty of the venues and the point of view of the athlete.
And the International Olympic Committee is delighted with the results as they look to bring viewers closer to the action. Maybe too close.
“Looking at the screen in the downhill, I almost feel motion sickness,” said Pierre Ducrey, the IOC’s sports director. “That’s how much we are able to project ourselves thanks to this new way of broadcasting the sport.”
U.S. bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor agreed.
“I’m not concerned about the drone or anything like that,” she said, “but I will say I was watching the luge footage the other day and I was like, ‘This is slightly nauseating.’ I don’t know if I could watch this all the way down the run.”
Lie, the Norwegian skier, likes how the drones showcase a key aspect of skiing: It’s cool to see the speed a little bit more for the spectators.”

Consumers face higher electricity charges at peak periods: ACM
Dutch households may have to pay more to use electricity at peak times from 2028, the Dutch consumer and markets watchdog ACM said on Friday.
The regulator mooted the measure in its annual Focus on Energy report and will decide later this year how the costs of using the energy network are to be calculated. Industry – including large and small firms – will also switch to fees which depend on the time of day.
The ACM said the step is needed because the power grid is overloaded from late afternoon until around 9pm. It is not yet clear what the new tariff structure will look like in practice and the agency said it plans to publish more information as the year progresses.
On Wednesday it emerged that the grid is so congested that no new electricity connection contracts will be issued for homes in the central Netherlands after the summer while two new substations are completed.
Encouragement
The government has been trying to encourage people to use less electricity at busy times.
Households have been asked to charge electric cars outside peak hours and to replace energy-hungry appliances, such as old freezers, with more efficient models. But grid operators say those measures have not had enough impact.
By raising charges during peak periods, the ACM hopes to nudge consumers into shifting their usage. That could mean paying less if a washing machine runs outside peak hours or if an electric car is not charged immediately after arriving home from work.
The ACM is charged with regulating the electricity market.

Cash-strapped French hospitals appeal to public to help fund medicines, devices

Cash-strapped French hospitals appeal to public to help fund medicines, devices
A growing number of French hospitals struggling with their finances are appealing to the public to help fund urgent needs like medicines and medical devices, and in one case even beds. While some have opted to offer so-called "citizen loans", others have turned to donations and company sponsorships.
Cash-strapped and running out of options, a public hospital in southwestern France has turned to an unlikely source of rescue: potential patients.
This week, the Basque Coast Hospital Centre (CHCB) in Bayonne was the latest to appeal to the public to help fund urgent needs and purchase medicine, medical devices and vaccines through what it calls "citizen loans".
Under the scheme, people lend money to public hospitals that later reimburse them, with interest.
The model has emerged in France over the past few years, with several hospitals and nursing homes inviting people to invest in their healthcare facilities.
The CHCB hopes to raise €1.5 million, the largest sum ever targeted by a French medical facility in such an operation.
Supporters see the loans as an ingenious way to reconnect hospitals with the people they serve.
But critics say such loans are a symptom of a healthcare system under severe strain, with hospitals forced to pass the hat around the community.

The loan "offers citizens the opportunity to participate directly in financing its cash flow needs related to essential healthcare purchases: medicine, medical devices, vaccines, and sampling equipment", the Basque Coast hospital said.
The hospital, which has several sites, notably in the towns of Bayonne and Saint-Jean-de-Luz, said it had received institutional funding but the payments were delayed, and it needed to fund its regular purchases.
A person can invest as little as €1 and will be reimbursed "at the end of 12 months" in a single payment, with interest set at 3.1 percent, a rate that exceeds that of France's popular Livret A savings account.
The operation is being carried out via the start-up Villyz, a government-approved platform.
'Useful, transparent, local'
The Basque Coast hospital praises what it calls a "virtuous" financing model that "diversifies" its funding sources and lets people invest their savings in a product that is "useful, transparent and local".
But it comes against a backdrop of tight finances. In 2024, the CHCB recorded a deficit of €21 million on a budget of around €400 million.
Across France, hospitals' accounts are in the red: the system's overall deficit reached an estimated €2.7 billion to €2.9 billion in 2024, according to official data.
Villyz began offering the scheme to hospitals last year, claiming to be the only platform doing so.
It collects only "application fees that depend on the amount raised", typically amounting to several thousand euros, said its president, Arthur Moraglia.
Through the scheme, a hospital in the northeastern town of Haguenau raised €100,000 to purchase new windows, and a hospital in Evreux in the northwest raised the same amount to add beds.
Two nursing homes in southeastern France have funded improvements, and another in the central town of Bourges plans to do so soon.
The Limoges University Hospital, which wants to open a women's health centre dedicated to victims of domestic violence, with a total budget of €2.5 million, hopes to borrow one million from the public.
'Hold out their hand'
Some hospitals had already turned to more traditional fundraising, including Paris's Georges Pompidou Hospital, which sought donations to buy a scanner, and the Nantes University Hospital.
Critics including the Force Ouvriere union have denounced what they call the government's austerity policies undermining public hospitals nationwide.
"Whereas France once prided itself on having the best healthcare system in the world, today public hospitals are forced to hold out their hand to survive," the union said last year.
"Citizen loans, appeals for donations, corporate sponsorship, or any other 'raffle' scheme – this is now what part of the funding for our public hospitals boils down to."
Jean‑Paul Domin, an economist at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, said the trend, emerging over the past three or four years, was symptomatic of a system in crisis.
"Hospitals need cash," he said, and they are scrambling to find it.
Nicolas Sirven, an economist at the EHESP school of public health, said the loan scheme proved that people were willing to pay to fund the hospital system – even though the political class was reluctant to push for more social security contributions or taxes.
Compared with their overall budgets, the amounts hospitals seek are "marginal", Sirven said.
But "should it be up to hospitals to manage the savings of the French?"

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. The Bank of Russia is not currently taking part in talks on the possibility for the return to US dollars in Russian export payments, Central Bank chief Elvira Nabiullina said at the press conference after the Board meeting.
"As regards the potential development of relations with the United States, we as the Central Bank, are not participating in it so far in any case," she said.
The regulator is not expecting a new inflation wave in Russia, Nabiullina noted.
"No, we do not see such a risk, we do not await a new inflation wave. Yes, fiscal changes unexpectedly resulted in the price hike in January. However, this is a one-time splash, a one-time increase of the price level in the economy - exactly the level and not the start of an inflation acceleration trend. And we believe, I have already spoken about that - the effect of fiscal changes on inflation was largely materialized in January thus far," she added.

1 dead, dozens injured as violent winds batter Spain, red alert issued in Valencia region
Spain, Portugal face fresh alerts as storms continue into weekend
OVIEDO, Spain
At least one person has died and about 90 were injured in Catalonia alone after violent winds swept across large parts of Spain on Thursday and Friday, while meteorologists issued a red alert for hurricane-force gusts in parts of the Valencia region.
The fatality occurred in Barcelona, where a 46-year-old woman died after part of the roof of an industrial building collapsed during the storm, police said.
The extreme winds, driven by storm Nils, forced school closures, canceled non-urgent medical activity and disrupted transport across Catalonia on Thursday. More than 100 flights were canceled at Barcelona’s El Prat airport, while rail services were suspended or delayed and truck traffic was restricted near the French border.
Emergency services received nearly 6,000 calls in Catalonia – the highest number ever recorded during a wind episode – as gusts reached up to 166 kilometers (103 miles) per hour, according to regional authorities.
On Friday, another storm system called Oriana moved in, and large areas of eastern and northern Spain remained under orange or yellow alerts for wind, rain, snow and coastal storms through the weekend.
Spain’s national weather agency, Aemet, placed parts of Castellon province in Valencia under a red alert, warning of “hurricane-force” winds exceeding 140 kilometers (87 miles) per hour on Saturday.
The storm has also worsened flooding across southern Spain, particularly in Castile-La Mancha and Andalusia, where authorities said the cumulative impact of successive storms has been unprecedented.
“We have never experienced an emergency of this level,” said Andalusian interior and emergency official Antonio Sanz, who reported nearly 12,000 incidents handled across the region during the recent chain of storms.
He said authorities were forced to issue 10 emergency alerts to phones – an unprecedented number – while more than 3,100 people remain evacuated from their homes.
The agricultural sector has also been hit hard. Agriculture Minister Luis Planas described the damage as “very significant,” citing early estimates of at least 14,000 hectares (34,600 acres) affected in Andalusia, a figure expected to rise as assessments continue. Flooded citrus groves, olive orchards and damaged irrigation systems were reported across several provinces.
The string of storms has also battered Portugal. Earlier this week, part of the country’s main north-south highway near the city of Coimbra collapsed due to flooding.
Authorities in the historic city are preparing evacuation plans for up to 9,000 people if river levels continue to rise, local media reported. The nearby Mondego River has already overflowed in some areas.
Across Portugal, at least 16 people have died in recent weeks due to the succession of Atlantic storms.
However, meteorologists say Oriana could be the last major system for now, with stable weather expected next week.

Canada school deaths suspect created shooting simulator on gaming platform

The 18-year-old suspect in a high school shooting in British Columbia had previously created a mass shooting simulator on the gaming platform Roblox, it has been revealed.
The simulator, set in what appeared to be a virtual shopping mall, allowed users – represented as Roblox-style avatars – to pick up weapons and shoot other players, 404 Media reported on Thursday.
Users first identified the suspect’s Roblox account and game on Kiwi Farms, a site known for doxing and trolling. After the shooting on Wednesday, Canadian police identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar.
In a statement to the Guardian, Roblox said: “We have removed the user account connected to this horrifying incident as well as any content associated with the suspect. We are committed to fully supporting law enforcement in their investigation.”
The California-based company added that the “Mall experience” was accessible only through Roblox Studio, a separate app used by developers to create games. As a result, the simulator recorded just seven visits.
Roblox also said it uses a combination of AI and a team of safety specialists to review content that is uploaded to its platform before it is shown to another user.
Wednesday’s attack – one of Canada’s deadliest school shootings since the 1989 École Polytechnique massacre when a gunman killed 14 women – left nine people dead in Tumbler Ridge, a small coalmining community.
The victims included a teacher, five students, the suspect’s mother and her stepbrother. The suspect, who reportedly had a history of mental health issues, was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
This isn’t the first time Roblox has been criticised for its content. The platform allows its millions of users to create and share their own video games – many of them benign, featuring cartoon fish and camping trips.
However, it has also allegedly made Jeffrey Epstein-themed content available to children, and is facing a lawsuit in California for facilitating the sexual exploitation and assault of minors.
The links between violent video games and mass shootings have been long-debated and remain inconclusive, with large studies finding at most a small correlation between gaming and real-world aggression.
However, though games may not cause violence, recent incidents underscore the growing trend of “gamified violence”: extremists adopting elements of video game design in the context of real-world attacks.
This is becoming increasingly common. The attackers in the 2019 mosque shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, broadcast their massacre on Twitch, a platform that allows users to livestream themselves playing video games; as did the shooter in the racially motivated attack in Buffalo, New York, in 2022.

TESERO /Italy/. February 13. /TASS/. Russia’s Savely Korostelyov finished in 15th place on Friday in the 10-km men’s cross-country skiing event Interval Start Free at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Italy.
The Russian skier, who is competing at the 2026 Winter Games under a neutral status (AIN), completed the distance in 21 minutes 42.3 seconds.
Norway’s Johannes Klaebo clocked the distance in 20 minutes 36.2 seconds to win the gold. Mathis Desloges from France crossed the finish line 4.9 seconds behind Klaebo to win the silver while another Norwegian athlete, Einar Hedegart, took home the bronze finishing 14 seconds behind his gold-medal-winning compatriot.
Athletes from Russia and Belarus have been cleared to participate in the 2026 Winter Games under a neutral designation, which excludes the display of national flags and anthems.
The 2026 Winter Olympic Games are taking place in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, from February 6-22, 2026. Thirteen Russian athletes are competing under a neutral status in figure skating, speed skating, short track, freestyle skiing, cross-country skiing, alpine skiing, luge and ski mountaineering.
Norway currently tops the Overall Medals Standings at the 2026 Winter Games with 16 (eight gold, two silver and six bronze), followed by host Italy (six golds, three silver and nine bronze) and the United States in the 3rd place (4-7-3).

Ex dpty head of President's Office Shurma denies hiding in Germany
Former Deputy Head of the Ukrainian Presidential Office Rostyslav Shurma, who has been placed on a wanted list by the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) on suspicion of misappropriation of property and money laundering, has denied wrongdoing, said he is prepared to cooperate with the investigation, and stated that he is lawfully present in Germany.
"Today, media reported that my brother and I have allegedly been placed on a wanted list… I emphasize: neither I nor my brother are in hiding. I am openly and lawfully present in the Federal Republic of Germany at an address known to the investigation. My current contact details and those of my defense counsel have been communicated to the competent authorities on multiple occasions. I am prepared to cooperate with the investigation within the bounds of the law — with respect for my right to defense and due procedural process," Shurma wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He said his defense team had formally requested that his participation in procedural actions be facilitated via videoconference or through diplomatic channels.
"I do not plead guilty and will prove my innocence through the procedure established by law. The defense will continue to take all legally prescribed measures to ensure proper procedural communication and the protection of my rights in Ukraine and abroad," he added.
As previously reported, NABU placed Shurma on a wanted list on suspicion of misappropriation of property and money laundering. The relevant entry appeared in the wanted persons section of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry’s website, with Feb. 12, 2026 listed as the date of his disappearance. No preventive measure had been applied against him. A wanted notice for Oleh Shurma, born Jan. 13, 1986, carrying identical suspicion details and disappearance date, was also added to the database.
The case stems from a scheme uncovered by NABU and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) on Jan. 21, 2026, involving the alleged embezzlement of funds under the so-called "green" energy tariff in the temporarily occupied territories of Zaporizhia region, with losses estimated at UAH 141.3 million. Member of parliament Yaroslav Zheleznyak of the Holos faction linked Shurma to the suspicion notice, writing on Telegram: "The suspicion against Shurma follows my complaint to NABU."

Controversy erupts as France signals bid to remove UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese

ALBAWABA - Several European governments have voiced sharp criticism of Francesca Albanese, the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, for what she said at a recent public event. Frankreich has said that it will officially ask her to step down at the next UN Human Rights Council meeting.
The problem started when Albanese spoke at a forum put on by Al Jazeera and talked about new developments in the Palestinian situation. During her speech, she used words that some European officials said were rude and didn't fit with the neutrality that UN mandate holders are supposed to show.
Some people didn't like how she supposedly called Israel a "common enemy of humanity." They said that this kind of language goes beyond criticizing policies and could be used to target a state and its people.
France Leads the Call to Act
Lawyers were told by France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot that the country would bring up the problem at the February 23 meeting of the Human Rights Council. It wasn't appropriate for him to talk about politics, and Albanese's comments made him question her independence and fairness.
Barrot also said that her comments add to what he called a catalogue of controversial views and that they hurt the reputation of her UN job.
A message was sent to the Foreign Ministry by French MP Caroline Yadan and other lawmakers asking for a review of Albanese's role because they were worried about his impartiality and professional standards.
More reactions across Europe
Antonio Tajani, Italy's foreign minister, said that Albanese's comments do not reflect the stance of the Italian government and are not in line with the duties of a UN human rights official.
Beate Meinl-Reisinger, the foreign minister of Austria, said the language used was wrong and warned that it could hurt the impression of fairness.
Johann Wadephul, Germany's foreign minister, said he supported the UN's system of independent rapporteurs but that Albanese had made many incorrect comments. He also said that Albanese's recent comments about Israel made him very worried about her ability to keep her job.
Responses from Israel and Advocacy Groups
Yair Lapid, the head of the Israeli opposition, called Albanese a "extremist envoy" and said that if she wasn't removed, it would show that antisemitic speech was okay.
The Anti-Defamation League also called for action, saying that her views went beyond what was allowed as criticism of human rights and showed broad generalizations.
Albanese denies the claims
Albanese has denied the charges, saying that what she said was taken out of context. She said that her criticism wasn't aimed at a specific country or group of people, but at larger systems that were linked to supposed violations of international law. She put out the full recording of her intervention to back up her point of view.
In a message to António Guterres last year, the US asked for her to be fired, saying she was antisemitic and helpful to terrorists. Albanese has denied those claims and said that the punishments she was given were an attempt to hurt her image.

Pentagon to move carrier to Middle East from Caribbean
The Pentagon is sending an aircraft carrier from the Caribbean to the Middle East, two US officials told Reuters on Friday, a move that would put two carriers in the region as tensions soar between the United States and Iran.
The Gerald R. Ford carrier, the United States' newest and the world's largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
One of the officials, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The Gerald R. Ford will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering "illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere."
President Donald Trump had said this week he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if a deal is not reached with Iran.
On Thursday, he suggested an agreement with Iran could be struck over the next month.
"We have to make a deal, otherwise it's going to be very traumatic, very traumatic," Trump told reporters.
Long Deployment
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jets and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also includes sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

DR Congo agrees to Angola-proposed ceasefire with M23 armed group
Congolese president’s office says DR Congo wants peaceful solution to conflict
KIGALI, Rwanda
The Democratic Republic of the Congo on Friday accepted Angola's proposal for a ceasefire between the government and the AFC/M23 armed group, the president’s office announced.
Amid intensified fighting, Angola’s President Joao Lourenco earlier this week proposed a ceasefire between the warring parties in eastern Congo from Feb. 18.
The proposal followed a meeting held on Monday in Luanda between Lourenco, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi, Togolese President Faure Gnassingbe, mediator of the African Union, and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, one of the African Union facilitators of the peace process in the Congo.
The president has agreed to a ceasefire for a peaceful solution to the conflict, a statement by the Congo’s president’s office said.
There was no immediate reaction from the AFC/M23 armed group.
But the statement warned that any unilateral consolidation of military positions or any action aimed at altering the balance on the ground during the ceasefire period would seriously compromise the credibility of the process and weaken its prospects.
The UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said Tuesday MONUSCO would deploy forces in the Congo’s border city of Uvira in South Kivu Province to monitor the ceasefire after their security guarantees were met.
M23 has been at the center of the conflict in eastern Congo. The rebel group allegedly supported by neighboring Rwanda, according to the UN and Western nations, controls significant territory in eastern Congo, including the provincial capitals of Goma and Bukavu seized early in 2025.

Extremist Israeli minister storms Ofer Prison, oversees abuse of Palestinian inmates
Itamar Ben-Gvir visits West Bank prison ahead of Ramadan as reports say stun grenades were set off near detainees and harsher measures were touted
JERUSALEM
Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir on Friday forced his way into Ofer Prison, west of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, in a visit marked by intimidation and abuse of Palestinian detainees.
Ben-Gvir entered the prison accompanied by senior police officials, including Police Commissioner Yaakov Shabtai, days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israel’s Channel 7 reported, saying that stun grenades were fired near Palestinian prisoners’ cells during the visit.
Ben-Gvir, known for publishing inflammatory videos targeting Palestinian detainees and repeatedly threatening them, has openly boasted about tightening prison conditions for Palestinians since taking office in late 2022.
During his tour, he said the changes imposed on prisons were “not enough” and vowed to push for legislation allowing the execution of Palestinian prisoners.
“This is not a luxury hotel. It is a real prison,” Ben-Gvir said, expressing satisfaction with what he described as a “fundamental change” in detention conditions.
Conditions for Palestinian prisoners have sharply deteriorated under Ben-Gvir’s tenure amid severe restrictions, widespread abuse and noticeable weight loss among detainees.
Palestinian and Israeli rights groups say former prisoners released in recent months have reported systematic torture, sexual violence, starvation and medical neglect, with some showing signs of severe psychological trauma.
In November 2025, Israel’s parliament advanced at first reading a bill introduced by Ben-Gvir’s far-right Otzma Yehudit party that would allow the death penalty for Palestinians convicted of killing Israelis. The proposal still requires second and third readings to become law, and no vote date has been set.
More than 9,300 Palestinians are currently held in Israeli prisons, including about 350 children, according to figures through early February.
Rights organizations have repeatedly warned that abuse of Palestinian detainees has intensified since October 2023, alongside Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.

Vampire bomber drones to be entirely produced in Ukraine by year's end: interview with leading drone maker Sky

Vampire bomber drones to be entirely produced in Ukraine by year's end: interview with leading drone maker SkyFall
SkyFall is one of Ukraine's most under-the-radar defence companies, yet its drones speak volumes.
The company produces Ukraine's most effective bomber drone, the Vampire, which Ukrainian troops use as their primary tool to hit Russian positions, with a huge lead over other weapons. The Vampire is one of the drones that the Russians collectively dub "Baba Yaga", referencing the infamous witch from Slavic tales – a name that captures the fear it sows.
SkyFall also builds the Shrike, a top choice for Ukrainian first-person view (FPV) drone operators, and has recently introduced the P1-SUN interceptor UAVs.
The manufacturer is grappling with multiple hurdles. Supply chain risks from China mean drones must be fitted with Ukrainian components. Russian forces are shooting down an increasing number of bomber drones, so new ways to protect them are needed. FPV drones must keep pace with battlefield needs, and the development of interceptor drones must move faster than Russia's production of Shahed loitering munitions, used by Moscow to terrorise Ukrainian civilians each night.
Ukrainska Pravda has discussed all these issues with a SkyFall representative, who goes by the alias Nirmata, at their stand at the World Defence Show 2026, which is currently taking place in Saudi Arabia. The company is seeking technological partners for production and is promoting its products to potential customers worldwide to secure funding for further investment in technology development.
How many people are working on building your drones?
Today the workforce numbers roughly 4,000.
Tell us about the evolution of the Vampire drone. How different is it from the earliest version?
The difference is enormous. If we had had the Vampire in its current form at the start of the full-scale war, no territory would likely have been lost. Compared to the original, it's better in every way: communications, range, resilience to electronic attacks, ease of operation, speed and design for production. That last factor now lets us produce a larger number of drones with consistent quality: previously, we could create 50,000 units a year, but now we can confidently say 100,000.
How much of the Vampire is actually built from Ukrainian parts?
All of the communication systems, antennas and chassis are ours, and the ground station is almost entirely ours. We've also got our own motors, though they're not yet in mass production.
We're developing our own camera – a prototype is ready, and by spring we'll have a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) (an early working version – ed.). Cameras for the Vampire will go into mass production by the end of the year.
We've got a "Vampire non-China" version right now – no Chinese parts at all. By the end of the year, the drone will be fully Ukrainian.
How has the cost of the Vampire drone changed since 2022?
We've brought the cost down to US$8,500 per drone. When production began, it could go up to US$20,000, depending on the configuration.
Is there still room for manoeuvre on the price?
Yes, but further reductions will be tricky. Once we have our own camera, we can cut the price a little, since our domestically made components are cheaper than Chinese parts. Still, going lower is tough because we're improving performance and introducing new modules with modern technology, which costs money. Even so, the most advanced Vampire currently sells for under US$10,000.
A lot of your bomber drones are getting shot down by the Russians. Is there a way to address this with technology?
Most of our bomber losses are caused by FPV drones. Our R&D team is focused solely on protection for the Vampire. Options include electronic warfare systems, a blinding device, a net launcher, or a small turret. Some things we're keeping under wraps. Let it be a surprise. We haven't yet decided whether each bomber will defend itself or if a "hunter" drone will protect the group.
In which direction are the bombers going next? Or have you already got everything you can out of the platform?
There's still plenty of room for development. Navigation is one area: we no longer rely solely on GPS as we did before. We're exploring visual orientation, inertial navigation, or ground beacons. For the Starlink-equipped version, satellite constellations could be used for orientation. Our goal is to ensure that, even when faced with jamming, the Vampire can complete its mission and return safely. Some of the technologies we're developing could become true game changers.
How much does the Shrike FPV drone cost today?
Prices vary depending on size and configuration. The most basic daytime model costs around US$300, while the top-end nighttime Shrike, controlled via fibre optics, goes for about US$1,500. Even so, these remain some of the most affordable drones in the world.
Is the Shrike's automatic target tracking fully accurate today, or is its machine vision still in its early stages?
I think machine vision could achieve much more if it were used more often. At the moment, it's hardly being used at all – the military doesn't make much use of it. This technology is really underestimated and needs more development.
It's part of a global automated combat system. We won't see any real breakthroughs without it. In the future, every drone will have a smart image-processing module and an analytical computing core that can make decisions based on the goals you set. Right now, it might not be obvious, but very soon, we won't even be able to imagine a drone without all of this.
How is FPV drone technology evolving at the moment? Has the platform reached its limits?
Fibre optics, size, repeaters and drone carriers. You can experiment endlessly with connectivity, swarm technology, mesh networks and DroneID. FPV drones, like our Shrike, are not a finished product. They can be refined further without increasing weight. Motors, propellers, batteries, cameras and AI are all evolving. Each evolving module adds a certain percentage to a target's destruction. A truly perfect FPV drone hasn't been created yet; we're still quite far from that.
Are Shrikes made with Ukrainian parts? Which components are already produced in Ukraine, and do you plan to make the drones entirely domestic eventually?
We already have 100% domestically-produced Shrikes that are completely moisture-proof. They significantly outperform their global counterparts. The only thing holding back mass production of entirely domestically produced drones is the state and capacity of production facilities, which are currently being scaled up.
You've just launched the P1-SUN drone interceptors. How many are you making right now?
We've been making them for three months. We've taken out more than 1,000 targets. These include 700 Shaheds. Everything is backed up by video.
How much does your interceptor cost?
About US$1,000. Further reductions aren't really possible unless we manufacture our own thermal sensors, and even then, the difference would be just a few dollars, not hundreds.
What direction will the development of interceptor drones take going forward?
It's machine vision with automatic targeting. It's an automated control and automatic launch. Our drone already has remote control and target tracking. Starting mass production is essential, though. The objective is to launch two interceptors and guarantee target elimination.
A separate challenge is training the people who will operate all of this. Our SkyFall Academy is handling that. Over the past two years, we've trained 20,000 pilots, technicians and engineers on all our equipment. As regards the interceptors, nearly 1,000 pilots have already completed training.
Is the government placing enough orders with interceptor manufacturers?
Are state orders sufficient to cover the needs of the front? We don't know. Do the contracts match our production capacity? We could always do more. But in our view, the state is doing everything it can at the moment.
Is the market short of drone assembly workers? How do you get around that and bring people on board?
We don't struggle with recruiting assemblers. People come from all walks of life. Seamstresses come to assemble drones, guys from car service stations come to assemble them. The market is big enough to find staff. We're also working to automate parts of the assembly process. We don't feel a shortage of people. Our academy helps anyone train for a specific role and start work as soon as possible.
Why do you find it essential to take part in the exhibition? (World Defence Show 2026 in Riyadh)?
Ukraine has demonstrated that our engineers are among the world's finest. Still, there's a long way to go before these innovations become a large-scale industry domestically and internationally. Our aim is to prevent Ukrainian technological achievements from being overshadowed by the global giants in weapons production.
Naturally, we keep an eye on new developments and technologies. Naturally, we look for something new, especially at exhibitions like this. However, whereas we once learned from others, we're now leading the way in technological innovation globally.
Which of your products do you see having the most export potential?
Absolutely everything. If a product works in Ukraine, it has export potential worldwide. Of course, depending on the country, weather, climate and mission requirements, drone configurations may need to be adjusted to meet local challenges. But Ukrainian engineers are well-equipped to handle that.
There's interest from all over: Germany, France, the US, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Japan and numerous others. Some of the countries that approached us, I hadn't even heard of before. If exports were fully open, many of them would already be willing to sign contracts for small quantities.

MOSCOW, February 13. /TASS/. Russia was able to secure its tank contract with India 25 years ago because the country’s T-90 proved itself worthier in tests versus its Ukrainian competitor the T-84, Alexander Nozdrachev, who served as General Director of the Russian Agency for Conventional Arms from 1999 to 2004, told TASS.
"Our key advantage was that we offered not just to supply tanks, but also to transfer technology. We said in all negotiations: ‘We’re not just selling you tanks, we’re giving you technology.’ We offered to localize production to the Indian side. Moreover, during the trials in which the Ukrainian tank also participated, our tank demonstrated significantly better results," Nozdrachev explained.
He noted that the Ukrainian side, with its T-84 tank, was at one point the frontrunner for the Indian contract. "They had already made deliveries to Pakistan, and their tanks had proven themselves there. We had fierce competition on our hands," Nozdrachev added.
According to him, after the Russian tanks began to be tested in 1999, India realized they were the better choice. "The test program requirements were very demanding, especially for the engine, which was run at extreme conditions. Thanks to the efforts of test crews from the Uralvagonzavod Group and representatives of the Main Armored Vehicle Directorate of the Defense Ministry in 2000 we received positive test results and approval from the Indian military, who participated in these trials," the expert said.

Zelenskyy: 10,000 drones manufactured in Germany to be delivered to Ukraine in 2026
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has visited the first German-Ukrainian joint venture producing drones for the Ukrainian military during his stay in Munich, receiving the first jointly manufactured strike drone.
"We saw the production line and the first flight of the drone. This is modern Ukrainian technology. Battle-tested. Equipped with artificial intelligence. It will strike, conduct reconnaissance, and protect our soldiers. And already this year, 10,000 drones produced here will be handed over to Ukraine and will strengthen our forces," Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram on Friday.
The president also said that 10 joint drone production ventures are planned to be launched by the end of the year.
"I thank Chancellor Friedrich Merz, the German government, Defense Minister Boris Pistorius personally, and the German people. Ukraine is always ready to share the experience we have gained defending lives," he said.
Germany’s Defense Ministry said the German-Ukrainian joint venture "is delivering results." "Both sides benefit from the joint venture. By the end of the year, Ukraine will receive up to 10,000 drones under this project. Germany, in turn, is expanding its own production capacity and learning from battlefield experience," it said.
According to Ukrainian company Frontline Robotics, the drone received by Zelenskyy — the Linza 3.0 — was developed by the company and manufactured by the first Ukrainian-German defense enterprise, Quantum Frontline Industries (QFI), which the Ukrainian president visited alongside Pistorius.
"I would like to express my gratitude for this project, which was implemented at the speed of light. We are learning from the successes achieved on the battlefield and benefiting from the innovations being applied," Pistorius said.
QFI CEO Matthias Lehna, who demonstrated the production facility to Zelenskyy and Pistorius, noted that the venture began production just two months after its establishment was announced. "QFI is the first enterprise of this kind, but certainly not the last. We are proud to be the flagship company of Ukrainian-German industrial cooperation and to support the Armed Forces of Ukraine," he said.
Frontline Robotics Chief Business Development Officer Mykyta Rozhkov said the Linza 3.0 was built on frontline experience and "is already helping Ukrainian forces operate more effectively."
The Linza 3.0 is the latest version of the Linza bomber drone series, which has been adopted by more than 60 units of Ukraine’s Defense Forces. It is equipped with an AI-based visual-inertial navigation module, has a 12-inch airframe, and can carry a payload of up to 4 kg over a range of up to 15 km, with an endurance of up to 60 minutes.
The visit by Zelenskyy and Pistorius was organized with the support of the Ukrainian Armory Council, which represents Ukraine’s private defense manufacturers.

BERLIN, February 13. /TASS/. The North Atlantic Alliance is growing increasingly frustrated with what it is hearing from the US, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
He noted that NATO is under pressure. "There is growing alienation and irritation about some of the things we hear from Washington. We need to discuss this together," he told the ARD television channel.
The updated US National Security Strategy, released on December 5, in particular says that Europe "will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less" as it is on the verge of "civilizational erasure" due to low fertility, massive immigration, regulatory paralysis, and the loss of cultural identity. According to the document, some of the European countries don't have the economic and military potential to remain reliable allies for Washington.

Israeli forces fired at an Al Jazeera news crew on Friday as it covered an illegal settler attack in the town of Talfit, south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, the broadcaster said.
The Qatar-based channel reported that soldiers shot towards its team, causing partial damage to camera equipment.
Al Jazeera correspondent Tharwat Shaqra said in a live broadcast that troops used live ammunition against the crew before firing a tear gas canister that directly struck and damaged filming gear.
She said the journalists were positioned in a clearly visible, open area and were targeted without being asked to leave the location.
The Israeli forces did not immediately comment on the incident.
Israel closed Al Jazeera’s operations inside Israel on May 5, 2024, and shut its offices in the occupied West Bank on September 22, 2024, with the closure order repeatedly extended.
On December 23, 2025, Israeli Communications Minister Shlomo Karhi said the channel would be barred from operating “forever”.
Illegal settler attacks
Twenty-five Palestinians were wounded after illegal settlers, under the protection of Israeli forces, stormed the village of Talfit south of Nablus in the occupied West Bank, according to a local official.
Mahmoud Abu Aisha, head of the village council, told Anadolu that the settlers carried out a coordinated assault on residents and property, while Israeli troops fired tear gas towards villagers.
He said 15 people suffered suffocation from tear gas, one was wounded by live fire, and nine others were beaten during the attack.
The illegal settlers also smashed the windows of 10 vehicles and damaged four homes, disrupted an electricity transformer and fired live ammunition towards a mosque in the village, Abu Aisha added.
Earlier, the Palestinian Red Crescent reported an initial toll of three injuries, including a man shot in the thigh and two others assaulted.
The official Palestinian news agency Wafa said illegal settlers attacked residents and opened fire, while Israeli forces provided cover and used live ammunition, stun grenades and tear gas against civilians and their homes.
Illegal settlers also stormed the Ras al-Ain area in the nearby town of Qusra, where a new settlement outpost has recently been established, attacking residents under military protection, Wafa reported.
According to the Palestinian Commission for Resistance of the Wall and Settlements, illegal settlers carried out 468 attacks across the occupied West Bank in January, including physical assaults, arson, property damage and restrictions on farmers’ access to their land.
Israel has intensified operations in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, since October 8, 2023. Palestinians view the escalation, including killings, arrests, displacement and illegal settlement expansion, as a step towards the formal annexation of the territory.
At least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed and about 11,500 injured in the occupied West Bank during that period, and more than 21,000 people have been arrested.
In a landmark opinion in July 2024, the International Court of Justice declared Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory illegal and called for the evacuation of all settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

Zelensky names Ukrainian delegation for trilateral talks in Geneva
Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council Secretary Rustem Umerov announced this on Facebook, according to Ukrinform.
"On February 17-18, the next round of trilateral negotiations between Ukraine, the United States, and Russia is scheduled to take place in Geneva. The Ukrainian delegation has already begun preparations for this meeting," Umerov said.
According to him, President Volodymyr Zelensky has determined the preliminary composition of the negotiating group.
"Along with me, the delegation will include Kyrylo Budanov, Andriy Hnatov, Davyd Arakhamia, Sergiy Kyslytsya, and Vadym Skibitskyi," Umerov said.
He stressed that the team had been formed to reflect the military, political, and security dimensions of the process.
"We will work on substantive decisions within the framework defined by the Head of State. The goal remains unchanged – a sustainable and lasting peace. We are preparing for serious and responsible work," Umerov said.

Five more Ukrainian children abducted by Russia have been brought back home – photo
Five more Ukrainian children have been brought back to Ukraine under Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's Bring Kids Back UA initiative after Russia's illegal deportation or forcible transfer.
Source: Bring Kids Back UA
Details: Three of the children, aged 4, 6 and 7, were residents of an orphanage in Kherson Oblast.
In autumn 2022, during the temporary occupation of Kherson, Russian troops removed them from the institution despite staff's attempts to hide the children. They were later forcibly transferred to Russian-occupied Crimea and placed in the Simferopol orphanage Yalynka.
Maksym Maksymov, the head of the Bring Kids Back UA initiative, thanked international partners who helped secure the children's return and US First Lady Melania Trump for supporting these humanitarian efforts.
The initiative also stressed that under international law, Russia must bring back Ukrainian children who were illegally deported or forcibly transferred from Ukraine, and that there will not be "exchanges" of children.
For reference: Bring Kids Back UA is an initiative by the president of Ukraine which coordinates the work of state bodies, civil society organisations and international partners to find and bring back Ukrainian children. Since the start of the full-scale invasion, 1,990 children have been brought back to Ukraine.
Previously: On 12 February, the White House reported that US First Lady Melania Trump assisted in bringing back kidnapped Ukrainian children to their families for the third time.
Background:
- In August, Melania Trump raised the issue of Ukrainian children in Russia in a personal letter to Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin. US President Donald Trump had personally delivered the letter to Putin during their talks in Alaska.
- Afterwards, the US first lady said she has an "open channel of communication" with Putin regarding the return of abducted Ukrainian children.
- On 4 December, US First Lady Melania Trump said that seven abducted Ukrainian children were brought back to their families thanks to "bridge-building" by Ukraine and Russia.
- It was due to the forcible transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine that the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Putin in 2023.

MUNICH, February 13. /TASS/. Germany has spent 55 billion euro on military aid to Ukraine since 2022, Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said.
"We are Ukraine’s biggest sponsor. A total of 55 billion euro have been allocated to military aid only since 2022," he said ahead of a meeting of the Transatlantic Forum hosted by Germany’s Christian Social Union (CSU) party in Munich.
The Institute for the World Economy (IfW Kiel) said earlier that Europe had increased military support for Kiev in 2025 by 67% compared to averages from 2022-2024, while humanitarian and financial support from the European Union was up by 59%. The bulk of financial and humanitarian support is provided to Ukraine via EU institutes and mechanisms, whereas military assistance originates from a small number of countries, primarily in Western and Northern Europe, such as Germany and the United Kingdom.
In 2026, Germany has allocated a total of 11.5 billion euro to help Ukraine's war effort.

Madagascar: ‘Overwhelming’ destruction, surging needs after back-to-back cyclones – WFP
Some 10 days after Tropical Cyclone Fytia brought heavy rains and flooding to Madagascar, Cyclone Gezani has left the island’s main port in ruins, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) said on Friday.
Speaking to reporters from Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo, WFP Country Director Tania Goossens said some 400,000 people are facing acute humanitarian needs after the island was hit by back-to-back cyclones in the space of three weeks.
Ms. Goossens recently returned from a mission to the port city Toamasina (also known as Tamatave), the country’s second largest urban centre, where Gezani made landfall on Tuesday evening with wind gusts of up to 250 kilometres per hour.
“The scale of the destruction is really overwhelming,” Ms. Goossens insisted.
Nearly 40 deaths
She said that according to the authorities, 80 per cent of the city has suffered damage and that it is “running on roughly five per cent electricity at the moment.”
“There's no water and one of WFP’s warehouses and our office was also completely destroyed during the cyclone,” she added.
Assessments are ongoing but to date the authorities report 38 deaths and 374 people injured.
Families left with nothing
The UN food agency official said that many families have left their homes and that there was “severe” damage to buildings, businesses, schools and the city’s hospital.
“During my visit, I saw families trying to recover the little that was left of their home,” she recounted. “Many are spending the night in homes where the roofs have been torn off.”
Uprooted trees and debris across the city are blocking streets, Ms. Goossens said, and fuel is difficult to come by.
“Families are telling us that they have lost everything,” she stressed. “Many are sheltering in damaged homes or temporary sites and uncertain about how they can access their next meal.”
Rising needs
In addition to the urgent need for food Ms. Goossens highlighted humanitarians’ concerns about water, sanitation and hygiene conditions, as a lack of clean water and damaged infrastructure raise the risk of disease outbreaks.
She also mentioned “rising protection concerns for vulnerable groups” such as women, children, the elderly and persons with disabilities.
Mobilising support
In anticipation of the shock WFP and partners have been providing cash assistance to the most vulnerable households allowing them to purchase some food and better prepare before the storm struck.
The UN food agency is now mobilising its “last food stocks,” which will be distributed in coordination with national disaster relief teams, Ms. Goossens explained.
However, the needs on the ground exceed WFP’s capacity and the agency is calling for urgent donor support.
The latest disaster “comes on top of an already very critical food security situation,” Ms. Goossens said, as already before the back-to-back cyclones 1.57 million people across the country were food insecure, including 84,000 facing emergency levels of hunger, according to the latest data from the IPC, a UN-backed global food security monitoring system.
“We're also in the peak of the lean season here in Madagascar and funding shortfalls remain alarming… Our lean season response as well as cyclone response faces a $18 million gap over the next six months,” the WFP official warned.
“We will need… sustained support over the coming months to help people recover, to rebuild and strengthen their resilience against further shocks,” she added. “In fact, we are in at the start of the cyclone season. So, we are also concerned that this is only just the beginning.”

‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’: UN report warns of war crimes in Sudan’s El Fasher

‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’: UN report warns of war crimes in Sudan’s El Fasher
Paramilitary forces in Sudan unleashed “a wave of intense violence…shocking in its scale and brutality” during their final offensive to capture the besieged city of El Fasher last October, committing atrocities that amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, according to a report released on Friday by the UN human rights office, OHCHR.
“Persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk, calling for credible investigations and accountability for perpetrators.
Sudan's national army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia have been fighting each other for control of the country for almost three years. The new report details widespread atrocities committed during the RSF assault on the besieged city of El Fasher in North Darfur.
The RSF and allied Arab militia carried out mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment, detention, disappearances, pillage and the use of children in hostilities. Many attacks were directed against civilians and persons hors de combat based on ethnicity or perceived affiliation.
Documented atrocities
Based on hundreds of interviews with victims and witnesses in late 2025, OHCHR documented more than 6,000 killings in the first three days of the RSF offensive. The report however warns the overall death toll during the weeks-long offensive is “undoubtedly significantly higher”.
The report revealed that in one incident around 500 people were killed when RSF fighters opened fire using heavy weapons on a crowd of 1,000 sheltering at Al-Rashid dormitory in El Fasher University on 26 October. One of the witnesses reported seeing bodies thrown into the air “like a scene out of a horror movie”.
RSF fighters also carried out summary executions within El Fasher of civilians, targeting young boys and men under 50, accused of “collaboration” with the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and Joint Forces, often determined on the basis of their non-Arab ethnicity, such as the Zaghawa community.
Survivors and witnesses recounted patterns of rape and gang rape, abductions for ransom using sexual violence, and sexual assault during invasive body searches, with women and girls from the Zaghawa and other non-Arab communities at particular risk.
Possible crimes against humanity
According to the report, the violations at El Fasher mirror other RSF offensives during the war, such as at the Zamzam camp in April 2025. The “organized and sustained course of conduct” suggested a systematic attack against the civilian population in the Darfur region.
“The acts of violence knowingly committed as part of such an attack would amount to crimes against humanity”, OHCHR said.
Calls for justice
Mr. Türk urged parties to the conflict to end violations by forces under their command and called on States with influence to help prevent further atrocities, including by respecting the arms embargo and halting the supply of weapons.
He called on States to do everything possible to support local, regional, and international mediation efforts, to achieve a cessation of hostilities and a pathway towards inclusive civilian governance.
“In a protection crisis of this scale, human rights must remain central to efforts to achieve a durable resolution of the conflict,” he said.

US sending second aircraft carrier, world’s largest, to Mideast as Iran tensions high

US sending second aircraft carrier, world’s largest, to Mideast as Iran tensions high
Source says USS Ford to join USS Lincoln as Trump ups pressure on Tehran to reach nuclear deal; Iranians hold 40-day mourning events for victims of regime’s crackdown on protests
WASHINGTON (AP) — The United States will send the world’s largest aircraft carrier to the Middle East to back up another already there, a person familiar with the plans said Friday, putting more American firepower behind President Donald Trump’s efforts to coerce Iran into a deal over its nuclear program and potentially its missile program too.
The USS Gerald R. Ford’s planned deployment to the region comes after Trump only days earlier suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was at hand. Those negotiations didn’t materialize as one of Tehran’s top security officials visited Oman and Qatar this week and exchanged messages with the US intermediaries.
Already, Gulf Arab nations have warned that any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Middle East still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for the thousands killed in Tehran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, adding to the internal pressure faced by the sanctions-battered Islamic Republic.
The Ford’s deployment, first reported by The New York Times, will put two carriers and their accompanying warships in the region. The USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers are already in the Arabian Sea.
The person who spoke to The Associated Press on the deployment did so on condition of anonymity to discuss military movements.
It marks a quick turnaround for the Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean in October as the administration built up a huge military presence in the lead-up to the surprise raid last month that captured then-Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro.
It also appears to be at odds with Trump’s national security strategy, which emphasizes the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.
Trump on Thursday warned Iran that failure to reach a deal with his administration would be “very traumatic.” Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman last week.
“I guess over the next month, something like that,” Trump said in response to a question about his timeline for striking a deal with Iran on its nuclear program. “It should happen quickly. They should agree very quickly.”
Trump told Axios earlier this week that he was considering sending a second carrier strike group to the Middle East.
Trump held lengthy talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he insisted to Israel’s leader that negotiations with Iran needed to continue. Netanyahu is urging the administration to press Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and end its support for terror groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of any deal.
The USS Ford set out on deployment in late June 2025, which means the crew have been deployed for almost eight months. While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an unusually long deployment.
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
Iran at home faces still-simmering anger over its wide-ranging suppression of all dissent. That rage may intensify in the coming days as families of the dead begin marking the traditional 40-day mourning for the loved ones. Already, online videos have shown mourners gathering in different parts of the country, holding portraits of their dead.
One video purported to show mourners at a graveyard in Iran’s Razavi Khorasan province, home to Mashhad, on Thursday. There, with a large portable speaker, people sang the patriotic song “Ey Iran,” which dates to 1940s Iran under the rule of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. While initially banned after the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran’s theocratic government has played it to drum up support.
“Oh Iran, a land full of jewels, your soil is full of art,” they sang. “May evil wishes be far from you. May you live eternal. Oh enemy, if you are a piece of granite, I am iron.”

US Homeland Security taps social media chief behind posts decried as having racist overtones
Peyton Rollins swerved Labor Department’s X account from union updates to criticism of ‘globalism,’ used font reminiscent of ‘Mein Kampf,’ claimed credit for building’s huge Trump banner
JTA — The US Department of Homeland Security has hired a new digital communications director whose social media content for the Labor Department reportedly raised alarm bells inside the department and beyond for promoting white supremacist rhetoric.
Peyton Rollins began his new role at Homeland Security this month, as reported by The New York Times this week. Tricia McLaughlin, the Homeland Security spokeswoman, did not confirm the move to the newspaper, but Rollins’ LinkedIn profile shows that he began working at the department this month.
Rollins, 21, has been identified as the staffer responsible for posts at the Labor Department that have been decried as making veiled antisemitic and racist allusions. He also claimed credit for a large banner of US President Donald Trump’s face that was hung from the Labor Department’s headquarters, which its critics said echoed fascist stylings.
During Rollins’ time at the Labor Department, its social media pages have featured a range of slogans including “the globalist status quo is OVER,” “America of, by, and for Americans,” “PATRIOTISM, NOT GLOBALISM,” and “Patriotism will Prevail. America First. Always.”
One post on X in November, which featured the phrase “Americanism Will Prevail,” spurred hundreds of negative comments because it appeared to use the same typeface used on the original cover of Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf.”
Staffers at the department were alarmed, according to the New York Times. “We’re used to seeing posts about things like apprenticeships, benefits and unions,” a former employee, Helen Luryi, told the newspaper. “All of a sudden, we get white-nationalist rhetoric.”

In his new role, Rollins will oversee the Homeland Security social media accounts, including its X account, which itself has been accused of tweeting antisemitic dog whistles.
Rollins joins a growing list of hires under US President Donald Trump’s administration who have faced allegations of promoting extremist rhetoric.
In March, DHS hired speechwriter Eric Lendrum, who has previously promoted the “Great Replacement” theory and likened conservatives in the United States to Jews in Nazi Germany. In May, the Pentagon also appointed Kingsley Wilson, who has repeatedly echoed antisemitic rhetoric online, as its press secretary.
Last year, the appointments of Darren Beattie as the acting undersecretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs in February and Paul Ingrassia in May to a senior legal role drew criticism for the pair’s relationships with white supremacists.

Israel looks to wean itself off US aid, but breaking free could cost both sides

Israel looks to wean itself off US aid, but breaking free could cost both sides
As PM urges ‘maximal independence’ after years of getting billions from Washington, past officials say IDF can benefit from more freedom, but shift could also destabilize region
Israel’s battle against Hamas in Gaza over the past two years was waged with extensive military support from the country’s closest ally, the United States.
Since the Hamas-led invasion and massacre that sparked the war, Washington has supplied Israel with an estimated $16-22 billion in military assistance. That wartime support supplemented the $3.8 billion the US sends Israel in defense aid annually, together reinforcing the strength of the military alliance.
But while largely appreciated in Jerusalem, the heavy reliance on foreign assistance has also raised concerns in Israel about the downsides of the aid, including the level of control it gives the US over Israel’s military spending and priorities.
With the agreement underpinning the annual aid disbursement set to expire in the coming years, the White House occupied by a president who has sought to reduce handouts to foreign allies, and restrictions on arms sales during the war with Hamas a fresh and painful memory, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has signaled that Jerusalem will phase out its dependence on US military assistance.
The shift could help recalibrate the US-Israel relationship and address those downsides, but analysts warn it could also carry deep knock-on effects domestically and on the international stage, depleting Israeli coffers and boosting hostile elements.
Phasing out aid would represent “a much deeper decline of US influence in the Middle East,” warned former US ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro, adding that it risks weakening US-Israel military ties and calling for careful consideration of a potentially destabilizing move.
While the move carries considerable risk, Israel has survived without US aid before. It fought in 1967 without US weapons, and has found ways to cope with restrictions even since aid was ramped up. After the US restricted the use of American cluster bombs during the 2006 Lebanon War, Israel developed its own improved version.
For Jerusalem, the challenge of weaning off Washington’s assistance will be to preserve cooperation while reducing unwanted control.
If done carefully, Israel has much to gain by moving “from a recipient status to a partner status with the United States,” said former Israeli envoy to the US Michael Oren.
‘Maximal independence’
Speaking to The Economist in an interview published last month, Netanyahu declared that he wanted to “taper off” military aid to zero over the next 10 years. Days later, he said in a Hebrew-language press conference that he was seeking “maximal independence” from foreign military aid “so we don’t run out of weapons or ammunition.”
In the press conference, Netanyahu leveled an incendiary accusation against the former US president Joe Biden’s administration, saying that Israeli soldiers lost their lives in Gaza because of an “embargo” that he alleged caused the IDF to run out of ammunition. That policy only ended, he said, when US President Donald Trump took office.
The premier has repeatedly accused the Biden administration of limiting arms supplies to Israel, notably in June 2024. President Joe Biden has denied withholding arms apart from a batch of 2,000-pound “bunker buster” bombs, over concerns about their potential use in southern Gaza’s Rafah at that time.
To prevent such instances from recurring, Netanyahu said he was prioritizing establishing a robust domestic Israeli arms manufacturing sector, aiming to shift the Israel-US relationship “from aid to partnership.”
This would be done, he said, through Israeli development and joint production, and such a partnership could extend to other allies, including India and Germany.
Gil Pinchas, who stepped down last month as chief financial adviser to the Israel Defense Forces and Defense Ministry, told the Financial Times before leaving his position that Israel would seek to prioritize joint military and defense projects over cash handouts in talks with the Trump administration on a new memorandum of understanding, or MOU, which he expected to take place in the coming weeks.
The last MOU, a 10-year deal signed in 2016 that went into effect two years later, granted Israel $3.8 billion per year in military aid, much of it to purchase US-made arms.
Pinchas called the annual aid “one component of the MOU [that] could decrease gradually.”
Double-edged aid
Annual US military aid to Jerusalem dates back to 1979, when Washington committed to providing billions in assistance to both Israel and Egypt as part of the US-brokered peace treaty between the countries.
While the aid once made up a significant chunk of Israel’s military spending, the percentage it makes up of the defense budget has significantly declined in recent years as Israel’s economy has flourished and its own defense spending has expanded. US aid currently makes up some 15-20 percent of Israel’s defense budget.
Shapiro, who helped negotiate the 2016 MOU as envoy under then-president Barack Obama, and is now a distinguished fellow at the Atlantic Council, said the agreement was built on a rigorous assessment of Israel’s threat environment and projected needs, as “there was a strong consensus between our two sides that we wanted to ensure Israel had adequate means to defend itself.”
Under the agreement, Israel receives $3.3 billion annually in Foreign Military Financing — US grants earmarked for buying American weapons — and a separate $500 million per year for missile-defense development and procurement, specifically the Iron Dome. The deal formalized missile defense funding for the first time, reducing yearly bargaining with Congress.
While the framework greatly assisted Israel in areas like missile defense, interoperability, and procurement, it also imposed some limitations.
Earlier MOUs allowed Israel to spend more than a quarter of the funds at home, helping nurture Israel’s defense manufacturing, but Obama chose to gradually eliminate this flexibility from 26% to 0% by the final year, so that by 2028, the assistance will be spent exclusively on US systems.
Oren, Israel’s ambassador to the US from 2009 to 2013, described the current aid framework as a liability for Israel, pointing to multiple cases over recent decades where Israel’s dependence on the US constrained military action, including when Obama delayed delivery of certain weapons during fighting in Gaza in 2014.
Oren said he warned Netanyahu at the time that this could happen again in a larger and higher-stakes conflict — as occurred two years ago under the Biden administration.
There are also more subtle setbacks for Israel in accepting hefty American aid.
Under Biden and Obama, dependence on American aid encouraged a shift toward defensive systems at the expense of conventional readiness for an offensive campaign — which is partly what caused the IDF to be less prepared for sustained ground combat when the 2023 Gaza war erupted, Oren argued.
Because those administrations preferred that Israel rely on defensive, rather than offensive, operations, US funding emphasized missile defense systems like Iron Dome, claimed the former envoy. “We were dependent on the aid, and the aid was geared to making us defensive, not offensive… This not just created leverage, it contributed to a change of our military culture, which was profound and immensely harmful.”
The aid [was] geared to making us defensive, not offensive…This not just created leverage, it contributed to a change of our military culture, which was profound and immensely harmful.
Oren encouraged Jerusalem to gradually phase out annual aid while preserving a close strategic partnership with the US, an option that could allow cooperation to flourish outside the military procurement sphere in areas like technology cooperation, intelligence sharing, and joint projects.
It would also free up Israel to procure weapons systems outside the US, fostering the expansion of multilateral ties and reducing its dependence on a single relationship.
That could help shift the current power dynamic, which has resulted in the US effectively wielding veto power over who Israel can make arms deals with.
In 2000, then-president Bill Clinton blocked a nearly $1 billion sale of Phalcon surveillance aircraft to Beijing. Four years later, president George W. Bush pressured Israel over plans to service Harpy drones previously sold to China.
As Israel moves to build up its own arms industry, it will rely on sales to foreign countries to fund the sector, with each of them a potential friction point with Washington, whether due to geopolitical issues or market competition. For Israel, ensuring that the US relationship survives those challenges may mean reducing the level to which that partnership is linked to military aid and procurement, though there could also be pitfalls in navigating those shifting ties.
Eran Lerman, vice president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security and former deputy director of Israel’s National Security Council, encouraged shifting from an aid model to a deeper technological partnership, while reinforcing the US commitment to deterring dangerous actors.
The dynamic of the US being seen as Israel’s ATM helped promulgate a false perception of Israel as weak and fragile without the US. That means deterrence, a major part of Israel’s defense strategy in dealing with regional enemies, is put at risk any time support from Washington seems to waver, Lerman warned.
“The main difficulty inherent in [the MOU] lies in the image that has been created of one-sided dependence, when in practice Israel also contributes quite a bit to US security,” he said.
Going it alone
Even with its limitations on Israel, the current aid framework serves as a key stabilizer of procurement pipelines and US-Israel military integration. Without it, Israel could face new challenges in planning, budgeting, and financing arms procurements.
The US is likely to remain Israel’s main arms supplier, but, absent the funding guarantees of an MOU, Jerusalem will have a tougher time securing expensive, long-lead multi-year contracts.
Current contracting often relies on the assurance of future MOU funding even before Congress appropriates it, Shapiro explained; without such a framework, Israel will need new budgeting structures to reassure suppliers and sustain long-term agreements.
To many, Netanyahu’s call to decrease assistance is seen as an attempt to get in front of negative trends in US politics toward supplying the aid — from Democrats citing humanitarian concerns to a growing bloc of “America First” isolationists within the GOP.
Israel may diversify suppliers over time to avoid the effects of these trends, though Shapiro predicted that it would not be an immediate shift, especially for the Air Force, which would strongly prefer US systems for interoperability with Washington and coordination with CENTCOM.
The problem is that with or without the MOU, the US is always able to limit weapons sales.
Requests for Tomahawk missiles and strategic bombers have often been denied, and, even when Israel buys systems like the F-35, the IDF does not receive full access to their operating software.
“To the extent that one of the drivers of heightened skepticism about aiding Israel in the US is concerns about civilian casualties, humanitarian assistance, and those kinds of considerations — those also apply to sales of weapons, not only arms provided through assistance programs,” Shapiro said, noting that Congress can still attach conditions to assistance, review sales, and, although rarely put into practice, block sales or try to condition them.
Retired US Air Force Gen. Charles Wald, a former deputy head of US European Command, warned that Israel moving away from US aid could make it easier for Washington to restrict F-35 parts, air-to-air missiles, and other advanced munitions.
While Israel has the technology to produce these items domestically, it still lacks sufficient industrial production capacity to do so, said Wald, a distinguished fellow at the Jewish Institute for the National Security of America.
Cutting aid could also signal to members of Congress who are on the fence about supporting Israel that Jerusalem is “going it alone,” possibly reducing their support, the former general added.
Israel flying F-35 fighter jets built by Lockheed Martin provides ‘billions of dollars in free advertisement.’
There is reason, however, to believe that arms sales would continue smoothly, thanks to the US interest in keeping its top Middle Eastern ally well-armed.
“The number one objective ought to be that Israel remains the superpower of the Middle East,” said Wald.
Defense firms are also eager to keep selling to Israel, noted Oren. Israel already jumps procurement lines for F-35 fighter jets because the IDF shows off how they can be used in actual combat, a trend likely to continue.
Israel flying F-35s built by Lockheed Martin provides “billions of dollars in free advertisement,” he said.
Risky ripples
While Israel is likely to try to preserve the $500 million for missile defense, replacing the remaining annual $3.3 billion — which at present amounts to about 0.6% of Israel’s GDP — would likely cause some domestic unrest in Israel as the government cut from other services to pay for the shortfall. The need to reduce funding for healthcare, social services, or other domestic priorities would spark a public debate about defense spending, but the economic impact would be manageable if done gradually, Lerman said.
The weaning would also carry other considerable potential downsides for both Israel and the US, including weakening regional deterrence or hurting Arab normalization.
A full phase-out weakens cooperation and interoperability, not just US leverage over Israel, said Shapiro, warning about “the second- and third-order effects of how that would affect US influence and ability to protect our interests in the region, and the openings it gives to our competitors.”
Phasing out aid “would almost certainly embolden Iran and its allies in the region if they perceive reduced US support,” Shapiro continued, adding that efforts to maintain or expand the moderate Abraham Accords normalization coalition could also be harmed, since many Arab states are incentivized to normalize ties with Israel to get closer to the US and improve CENTCOM cooperation.
What’s more, if the US stops aiding Israel, Congress may be unlikely to proceed with comparable aid to Egypt and Jordan, since those packages are linked to peace with Israel, Shapiro added, which may lead to additional adverse effects.
In the absence of sufficient US assistance programs, instability in Jordan can “spill over to the West Bank, to Syria, to Iraq,” he noted, adding that Egypt would “simply buy its weapons from Russia and China. It really opens the door to US competitors.”
Similar to Shapiro’s warning, Wald maintained that phasing out aid would weaken US influence and embolden adversaries, saying that, rather than retreat from Washington, the relationship should be strengthened, formalized, and ideally upgraded through a renewed MOU.
He proposed expanding joint weapons development, deepening tech cooperation, and writing stronger guarantees into the next agreement.
There are also ways to reinforce the military alliance outside a future MOU, like moving US aircraft from Qatar to Israel and basing more forces there to strengthen deterrence.
The countries could even move toward a formal defense treaty guaranteeing protection like NATO’s Article 5 — but noted that Israel has historically resisted such treaties over fear of the US gaining veto power over Israeli military action.
Deterrence could alternatively be preserved outside of a formal aid agreement by tightening legislative guarantees protecting Israel’s qualitative military edge in the region and increasing tech partnerships, argued Lerman.
He pushed for improved partnership with the US through joint technological development, the restriction of advanced systems to Arab states, and by highlighting Israeli defense industries as strategic partners for the West.

GOP senator to oppose Trump nominee for diplomatic post over his remarks on Israel, Jews
John Curtis of Utah cites Jeremy Carl’s ‘anti-Israel views and insensitive remarks about Jewish people,’ including minimizing the Holocaust, potentially sinking the nomination
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — US President Donald Trump’s pick to be assistant secretary of state for international organizations hit a major stumbling block on Thursday when a Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said he would oppose the appointment.
Republican Senator John Curtis of Utah said he did not believe Jeremy Carl is the right person to represent the country’s best interests at international organizations. The position manages the US relationship with international organizations including the United Nations.
Carl is currently a senior fellow at the conservative Claremont Institute think tank. He was a deputy assistant secretary of the interior during Trump’s first term.
“I find his anti-Israel views and insensitive remarks about the Jewish people unbecoming of the position for which he has been nominated,” Curtis said in a statement after Carl’s nomination hearing.
The Deseret News first reported Curtis’s decision.
A White House official said that Carl remained the nominee.
At the hearing, Curtis asked Carl about past comments about Jewish people, including an appearance on a podcast in which he responded, “Right, right yeah,” when the host criticized them for “claiming special victim status” because of the Holocaust.
At the hearing, Carl said he did not remember making some of the comments read out by senators and said he regretted some others. “I made some comments in interviews about minimizing the effects of the Holocaust that were absolutely wrong,” he said.
Curtis’ objection leaves Carl unlikely to win the foreign relations panel’s approval, which could sink his nomination.
That would be a departure in the Republican-majority Senate, which to date has backed the vast majority of Trump’s nominations and policies.
There are 12 Republican and 10 Democratic members of the committee, which oversees the State Department. Every Democrat is expected to object to Carl.
‘Great replacement’
During the hearing, Democratic Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey asked Carl what he meant when he said he believed in the “Great Replacement” theory, which fosters the belief that non-white immigrants will replace white citizens.
Carl responded that the theory referred to the “international demographic replacement of Europeans in Europe.” Booker asked if Carl believed there is currently “an effort to replace Americans,” and Carl said, “I think the Democratic party, through its immigration policies, has certainly sent signs of that.”
Questions about Carl’s nomination have existed for months, over his past comments, but also his lack of diplomatic experience. In September, CNN reported that Carl had tried to delete at least 5,000 of his comments on X.com, including many that were inflammatory about racial issues.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York opposed Carl’s nomination in a Senate speech this week, saying he had a “long history of racist, white supremacist and antisemitic views.”
A nomination can be sent to a vote by the full Senate if the committee does not vote in his favor, but this is extremely rare. Trump’s Republicans have just a 53-47-seat majority in the chamber.
Asked for comment, a spokesperson for Jim Risch of Idaho, the committee’s Republican chairman, said he supported all of the president’s nominees.

How Russia Turns Gamers into Fighters
The Kremlin’s weaponization of video games for recruitment and influence is no longer a theoretical risk. To protect the digital commons, the West must treat gaming as a core frontier of contemporary hybrid warfare.
Russia’s active weaponization of video games has become ingrained in its doctrine of hybrid warfare, resulting in loss of lives across continents. Recent revelations from Bloomberg demonstrate how foreign nationals are recruited online via popular military-simulation (milsim) games and Discord chats to fight for Russia in Ukraine. These attempts fit neatly within broader influence operations and cognitive warfare tactics leveraging video games. From propaganda mods and in-game recruitment campaigns, to creating Russian-only sovereign gaming platforms, these tactics speak to the political and cultural reality of online games as contested information spaces. As previously assessed by RUSI, the immersive, interactive and transnational nature of modern gaming builds tight-knit social spaces with less moderation than conventional social media. Despite being perceived as apolitical, gaming ecosystems offer Moscow ample room to exercise hybrid tactics against audiences abroad. In effect, platforms designed for entertainment are converted into battlefields for influence and recruitment.
Recruitment from Gaming Spaces
In mid-2024, two young South African men fell victim to Russia’s gaming recruitment strategy. The pair, avid players of the milsim game Arma 3 and frequently present in related Discord servers, were approached by a recruiter using the handle ‘@Dash’. After weeks of conversation, this gaming recruiter arranged an in-person meeting in Cape Town, eventually a meeting at the Russian Consulate with officials. The pair were on a flight to St. Petersburg in July 2024, and by early September the gamers-turned-recruits had signed one-year contracts with the Russian military. Within weeks, however, one of the South Africans was killed in action in Ukraine. The episode has sparked a scandal in South Africa (where serving in a foreign army has been illegal since 1998) and exposed a clandestine pipeline for fighters recruited through gaming communities. South African political figures have also faced accusations of recruiting fighters for Russia.
What distinguishes recruitment in gaming from foreign legions or private military companies (PMCs) is its affordance of minimal state-level diplomatic fingerprints and greater plausible deniability.
Many elements of this case mirror those of terrorist radicalisation and recruitment; dynamics which have been extensively studied by the Extremism and Gaming Research Network and RUSI.
The Kremlin is instrumentalising and integrating gaming content into its broader cognitive and influence warfare toolbox
Firstly, recruiters capitalised on the military-themed gaming interests of the targets, effectively fishing in user pools already fascinated by combat and weaponry. In realistic milsim games like Arma 3 and War Thunder, the lines between simulation and real combat become hazy, in turn appealing also to active duty military players. This blurred reality is so acute that over a dozen gamers have leaked classified schematics of tanks and aircraft on War Thunder to prove how realistic, or not, the in-game depictions are.
Second, after meeting in Arma 3 or related chatrooms, the recruiters approached the targets via Discord, a massively popular community chat platform, where they could continue more private conversations. This practice, known as outlinking or off-platforming, is a well-established tactic: recruiters identify potential targets in public games (Roblox, Arma 3), move them to more private gaming chatrooms or groups (on Discord), and finally to end-to-end encrypted chats on Signal or Telegram. We saw this in the case of US Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira, who leaked classified intelligence to his gaming friends on a Discord server. Teixeira’s case demonstrates the powerful trust networks built via gaming spaces, which, while often positive, create vulnerabilities to exploitation for recruitment, espionage and other hybrid warfare tactics.
Lastly, in the South Africa case, promises of material economic incentives were leveraged to ‘level up’ their gaming fantasies, with military service posing as an extension of the virtual combat game they loved. This is also not new: prior to its 2023 collapse, the Wagner Group explicitly tried to ‘draft gamers as UAV operators’ via social media posts. In 2022, Russia’s Defence Ministry also ran targeted ads to gamers with the slogan ‘play with real rules, with no cheat codes or saves,’ openly inviting players to join the army.
These efforts are partly driven by Russia’s urgent manpower needs. Having suffered heavy losses in Ukraine, exhausting conscription and prison-based enlistment, Moscow has intensified its search for fighters abroad, with at least 18,000 known foreign fighters having enlisted in Russian units. Instead of relying on conscription or civilian recruitment, Russia now targets foreign, young men in gaming spaces, exploiting economic grievances, social desires and gaming dynamics to turn online gamers into frontline fighters.
Gamifying Cognitive Warfare: Propaganda Games
Beyond clandestine foreign recruiting, Russia is investing heavily in gaming infrastructures. The Kremlin is instrumentalising and integrating gaming content into its broader cognitive and influence warfare toolbox. Moscow’s active and heavy investments into developing ‘patriotic’ video games reflect a deliberate strategy: to shape public and political perceptions, normalise militarised narratives, and win the ‘hearts and minds’, especially among youth at home and abroad.

Under the auspices of the Internet Development Institute (IDI), a state-backed group tasked with youth-oriented internet content, Russia has poured billions of roubles into domestic game development. In 2022–2023 alone, IDI earmarked approximately RUB 2.5 billion (~ £25 million) to support domestic game developers creating ideological propagandistic titles. Games like Sparta, paying tribute to Russian PMSC and Wagner operations in Africa, and Front Edge, simulating a direct Russian-US clash in Eastern Europe, intend to normalise Kremlin propaganda and glorify war amongst domestic youth. While these games face domestic criticism and underperform commercially, their existence signals a deliberate strategy to weaponise gaming for cognitive warfare and saturate the information environment. Although largely unsuccessful and criticised, the risk of eventual success exists with continued investment and experimentation.
The Kremlin also funds patriotic game development abroad, including African Dawn, a modification of the popular game Hearts of Iron IV. In African Dawn, a game co-developed by Moscow-based African Initiative and a pro-Kremlin gaming streamer, players lead a coalition of Sahel countries (Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger) against Western influence. Its content aligns closely with Russia’s strategic narratives: projecting anti-colonial and Western narratives among young, digitally engaged African demographics. Although the player base is limited, press releases of African Dawn were done in multiple languages (English, French, Russian, Arabic), reinforcing Moscow’s strategic intent to weaponise anti-Western grievances and achieve narrative dominance both domestically and across the continent. In short, it ‘sets out Russia’s agenda for Africa – to increase its influence and discredit Western partners.’
Russian gaming propaganda echoes well-documented tactics employed by terrorist groups. By taking popular strategy games, embedding propagandistic narratives and contemporary geopolitical conflicts, and releasing them to targeted youth, Russian propagandists leverage the contemporary narrative power of games to substantial effect. This holds particularly true in a rapidly digitising Africa. Yet, while African gamers are the ostensible target audience, campaign strategists likely seek wider engagement within Russia and across the West. At home, it can galvanise nationalist youth and reinforce Russia’s ‘role’ as anti-(Western) colonial champions; while abroad, it can influence perceptions by attempting to reframe Western engagements across Africa as neo-colonial or imperialistic. In all cases, Moscow benefits.
Far from an anomaly, the South African recruitment case underscores sophisticated shifts in digital ‘grey zones’ and cognitive warfare. Three years ago, the Swedish Psychological Defence Agency’s handbook, Malign Foreign Interference and Information Influence on Video Game Platforms, reported: ‘the video game domain is ripe for scandals of a similar scale and impact to 2016 [for social media platforms].’ This recent case involving South African fighters is more than a reminder. It is a predictable manifestation of risks and warnings that have, until now, largely gone unheeded.
Drawing on recommendations to counter non-state violent extremists, there are four core categories, as collaboratively developed between RUSI, EGRN and the Global Internet Forum to Counter-Terrorism (GIFCT):
Design: Game developers, platforms, and publishers must integrate safety tools into games and gaming platforms pre-release to enhance early mitigation of exploitation by Russian actors.
Prevent: Governments and platforms must publicly name and denounce malign Russian influence and exploitation efforts, while simultaneously supporting gaming communities via positive interventions.
Detect: Law enforcement, military and intelligence agencies need in-depth knowledge of gaming spaces to identify, monitor and address this new frontier of hybrid warfare. This requires training, resources and multi-sectoral information sharing and collaboration.
React: Reporting mechanisms need to be simple, available and culturally adaptable; relevant for users reporting Russian influence operations and gamers falling (potentially) victim to Russia’s cognitive warfare and recruitment efforts.
Intervening in Russia’s weaponization of gaming ecosystems is both a tactical necessity and strategic imperative. If Western security agencies continue to view the gaming domain as merely an entertainment space, we risk ceding an important hybrid war surface to the Kremlin. It is vital to avert further recruitment of foreign civilians to fight and die on Russia’s frontlines, and to defend Ukraine and protect the international digital gaming commons from malicious exploitation and hybrid warfare tactics.
