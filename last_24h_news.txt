US, Iran to hold new round of nuclear talks in Geneva this week, Swiss government says
US, Iran to hold new round of nuclear talks in Geneva this week, Swiss government says
GENEVA (AP) — Iran and the United States will hold a second round of talks over Tehran’s nuclear program next week, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
Oman, which welcomed the first round of indirect talks on Feb. 6, will host the talks in Geneva, the Swiss ministry said, without specifying which days.
After the first discussions, U.S. President Donald Trump warned Tehran that failure to reach an agreement with his administration would be “very traumatic.”
Similar talks last year broke down in June as Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program. Iran has said it would respond with an attack of its own. Trump also has threatened Iran over its deadly crackdown on recent nationwide protests there.
Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict.
Trump said Friday the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, was being sent from the Caribbean to the Mideast to join other military assets the U.S. has built up in the region. He also said a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
The indirect talks on Feb. 6 were between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff. The top military commander in the Middle East was also present for the first time.
The Trump administration has maintained that Iran can have no uranium enrichment under any deal. Tehran says it won’t agree to that.
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. However, its officials increasingly threaten to pursue a nuclear weapon. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has said his nation is “ready for any kind of verification.” However, the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, has been unable for months to inspect and verify Iran’s nuclear stockpile.
Trump has suggested in recent weeks that his top priority is for Iran to scale back its nuclear program. Iran has said it wants talks to focus solely on the nuclear program.
But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who met with Trump in Washington this week, has pressed for any deal to include steps to neutralize Iran’s ballistic missile program and end its funding for proxy groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah.

Private jet forced to land after hitting ‘multiple deer’ during takeoff at a Florida airport
The pilot reportedly told air traffic controllers he hit ‘four or five deer’

A private jet in Florida was reportedly forced to make an emergency landing after the Federal Aviation Administration said it hit “multiple deer” during takeoff.
The jet, a Cessna Citation, struck the animals Tuesday evening while taking off from North Palm Beach County General Aviation Airport, the FAA said in a statement. The plane then made an emergency landing at the nearby Palm Beach International Airport, according to The Palm Beach Post.
The plane, which was heading to Cincinnati, was carrying seven passengers when it took off near the state’s Beeline Highway, The Palm Beach Post reports. No injuries were reported, and the plane landed safely.
The Independent has contacted the Palm Beach County Department of Airports for comment.
The pilot said he was going to “declare an emergency” because he hit “four or five deer on the nose gear and possibly on the wings.” according to air traffic control audio reviewed by The Palm Beach Post.
The pilot reportedly asked air traffic controllers: “Can you let [North County Airport] know there are deer on the runway?”
Air traffic controllers then had to make changes to accommodate the private jet’s emergency landing at Palm Beach International Airport. At one point, a United pilot reportedly asked air traffic control: “Did you say they hit deer?”
“That is their report,” an air traffic controller responded.
This kind of incident is “an extremely rare event, like getting hit by lightning or getting bit by a shark,” pilot Michael Leighton told local outlet WPBF.
“It's not something that happens. You could fly your whole life, your entire life. I've got 16,000 flight hours, that's two full years off the surface of the Earth, and I've never hit an animal with an airplane. Can it happen? Sure. Is it likely to happen? Probably not," he said.
Leighton noted that it’s often not possible for planes to take a sudden turn once they reach a certain speed during takeoff.
"You're not able to swerve left or right like you can with a car. With an airplane, your range of motion is much smaller because the plane only has three wheels, so it's not made for that. It's not made to turn quickly at high speed on the ground," he added.

The education system is collapsing. It's 12,000 teachers short and 14,000 of its teachers lack either a teacher's certificate or an appropriate degree. This shortfall is so severe that principals are canceling classes, letting students go home early and even dropping entire subjects.

The singer who represents America better than Trump, according to new poll
- A recent Yahoo/YouGov poll revealed that 42 percent of U.S. adults believe Bad Bunny better represents America than the U.S. president, who received 39 percent.
- The poll, conducted between 9-12 February with 1,700 Americans, followed the U.S. president's criticism of Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show as "one of the worst, EVER!".
- Bad Bunny's historic performance, watched by over 128 million, marked the first time a Super Bowl headliner performed primarily in Spanish, celebrating his Puerto Rican heritage.
- Approximately 44 percent of U.S. adults approved of the performance, while 35 percent disapproved, with opinions largely split along party lines (78 percent Democrat favorability vs. 12 percent Republican).
- Despite conservative backlash and an alternative "All-American Halftime Show" organized by Turning Point USA, Bad Bunny's set included a message stating, "The only thing more powerful than hate is love."

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Chisinau and its Brussels curators will undoubtedly continue their course toward the "Romanianization" of Moldova, while Moscow hopes that the Moldovan people will be able to defend their identity, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
"There is no doubt that official Chisinau and its Brussels curators will continue the course toward dismantling Moldovan statehood, its sovereignty, the national identity and cultural code of Moldovans," Galuzin noted.
"The position of Bucharest itself is also noteworthy. There, despite the national elite’s strong commitment to the 'Romanianization' of Moldova, they are in no rush to support hasty statements by the Chisinau leadership about the need to unite the two countries and prefer to refer to the necessity of an expression of will by the Moldovan people on this issue. I hope that they will be able to defend their identity," the senior diplomat said.

Lindsey Vonn says "ride was worth the fall" after fourth surgery, set to return to U.S.

Lindsey Vonn says "ride was worth the fall" after fourth surgery for broken leg, set to return to U.S.
American skier Lindsey Vonn announced Saturday that her latest surgery was successful, and that she has been cleared to return to the United States after breaking her left leg in a brutal crash last weekend during her opening downhill race at the Winter Olympics in Italy.
"Surgery well well today!" the 41-year-old Vonn wrote on social media. This marks her fourth surgery since the Feb. 8 crash.
Vonn had said Friday she would need at least two more surgeries — the one Saturday and a second after she returns to the U.S.
On Wednesday, Vonn disclosed she had already undergone three surgeries since experiencing the injury. She wrote Saturday that once she's back in the U.S., she plans on giving "more updates and info about my injury."
The Olympic veteran from Colorado also reflected on her crash, saying, "I don't have regrets."
"The ride was worth the fall. When I close my eyes at night I don't have regrets and the love I have for skiing remains," Vonn said in her post. "I am still looking forward to the moment when I can stand on the top of the mountain once more. And I will."
Vonn crashed just seconds into the first run of her Olympic downhill race. She was competing despite rupturing her left ACL in a different crash during a World Cup race in the Swiss Alps last month.
"I was willing to risk and push and sacrifice for something I knew I was absolutely capable of doing," Vonn said in the post. "I will always take the risk of crashing while giving it my all, rather than not ski to my potential and have regret."
The three-time Olympic medalist had come out of retirement to compete in the Milan Cortina Games. After tearing her ACL, she had said she felt confident she could still race with the help of a knee brace.
"Please, don't be sad," Vonn said. "Empathy, love and support I welcome with an open heart, but please not sadness or sympathy. I hope instead it gives you strength to keep fighting, because that is what I am doing and that is what I will continue to do. Always."

Real Madrid thrash Real Sociedad 4-1 to move top of La Liga
Vinicius Jr strikes twice from the penalty spot as Madrid move provisionally above Barcelona, who play Girona on Monday.
Vinicius Junior scored two penalties as Real Madrid moved top of La Liga with a 4-1 win over Real Sociedad, despite missing superstar Kylian Mbappe.
Mbappe watched from the substitutes’ bench on Saturday after missing some team training sessions during the week with discomfort in his left knee.

Madrid coach Alvaro Arbeloa said on Friday that he was able to play, but evidently, he did not want to rush his star goal-scorer.
Mbappe and Jude Bellingham, out with a hamstring injury, watched as Madrid produced an assured team performance to end the visitors’ 11-game unbeaten run across all competitions, and move two points clear of Barcelona before the defending champions visit Girona on Monday.
Perhaps Tuesday’s team dinner at a fancy restaurant paid for by Mbappe and Vinicius helped focus the players before facing Benfica in the Champions League playoffs next week.
Gonzalo Garcia opened the scoring with a slight touch to Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross in the fifth minute. However, it was to be a largely frustrating game for the young attacker, who failed to make more of other good opportunities.
Dean Huijsen conceded a penalty for bringing down Yangel Herrera, and Mikel Oyarzabal duly equalised from the spot with a hard, high, centrally-placed shot in the 21st.
Referee Francisco Jose Hernandez Maeso awarded another penalty at the other end four minutes later, when Jon Aramburu caught Vinicius’s ankle, bringing him down. The Brazilian dusted himself off to score from the spot in the 25th minute.
Madrid captain Fede Valverde gratefully scored the third in the 31st after being left too much space at the edge of the penalty box. It was Valverde’s first goal of the season.
Garcia should have scored again before the break, when Valverde set him up for what looked like a simple tap-in, but Vinicius made it 4-1 with his second spot kick after the break, awarded after Aramburu was again penalised for bringing him down.
Dani Carvajal made his long-awaited return around the hour mark, when he replaced Alexander-Arnold for his first league appearance since Madrid’s 2-1 loss to Barcelona in October.
Vinicius thought he had scored a hat-trick when he headed in a free kick in the 90th minute, only for it to be ruled out for offside.
Elsewhere in La Liga on Saturday, Borja Iglesias scored in stoppage time, after having another seemingly good goal ruled out through VAR, to salvage a 2-2 draw for Celta Vigo at Espanyol.
A rueful Iglesias shook his head and smiled after having a 77th-minute goal disallowed when a long check determined there had been an offside infringement.
His frustrations grew when Ramon Terrats pulled the ball back for fellow substitute Tyrhys Dolan to score what he thought was the winner for Espanyol in the 86th minute.
But Iglesias equalised in the third minute of stoppage time when Pablo Duran set him up with his heel after a good run from Sergio Carreira.
Espanyol remained sixth, and Celta a point behind in seventh.
Also on Saturday, Getafe held on to upset visiting Villarreal 2-1, and the 10-man Sevilla drew with Alaves 1-1 in a duel between two strugglers.

More than 60 children infected in north London measles outbreak

More than 60 children have been infected by a measles outbreak in north London, it has been reported.
Seven schools and a nursery in Enfield reported the cases, with some children treated in hospital, according to the Sunday Times.
There are concerns the outbreak is linked to low levels of MMR vaccination in the capital. For every one infected person, measles can spread to up to 18 unvaccinated people.
Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health who is writing to every parent in the area, said the outbreak posed a serious threat to the wider capital and there was the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” because residents travel across the city.
She told the Sunday Times London has “one of the lowest, if not the lowest, vaccination uptake rates” in the country.
Sher-Arami said: “It is possible for it to grow. We know that measles has got some very nasty complications. It can cause deafness. It can cause brain damage and one in five children can need hospital treatment.”
Temporary vaccination clinics are being held in schools and throughout Enfield, an area in which more than a fifth of children are not inoculated against measles, mumps or rubella by the age of five.
A government campaign promoting childhood vaccination is expected to be launched next week with adverts on social media, YouTube and radio to counter vaccine scepticism. Measles usually starts with cold-like symptoms followed by a rash a few days later, according to the NHS. Some people may also get small spots in their mouths.
Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the UK is no longer considered to have eliminated measles, as transmission was re-established in 2024.
It comes after a plateau in vaccination coverage and a surge in cases, with 3,681 cases recorded in the UK in 2024.
From 2021 to 2023, the UK was considered to have “eliminated” the disease.
WHO recommends at least 95% of children should receive vaccine doses for each illness to achieve herd immunity.
According to UK Health Security Agency figures 91.9% of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine in 2024-25, unchanged from 2023-24 and the lowest level since 2010-11.
The data also showed 83.7% of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, the lowest level since 2009-10.

On Tuesday, Nahar Siddhi, a 12th-grader in my school, was violently assaulted by a passerby. His only sin was that he stood in the street with his friends and dared to express sympathy with the difficulties the Arab community in Israel is experiencing right now. Nahar is the salt of the earth. He loves Israel and has fought for years for the character of the country. Like a veteran fighter, he joked and told me that he is used to violence from hooligans who are not willing to listen to opinions labeled "leftist" or "Kaplanist."

Netanyahu, Trump agree to step up economic pressure on Iran: report

US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed to step up economic pressure on Iran, particularly targeting its oil sales to China, Axios reported Saturday.
The report, citing two American officials briefed on the issue, said the agreement occurred when Trump and Netanyahu met on Wednesday at the White House.
“We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China,” according to a senior US official.
But they differed on how to achieve that goal, with Netanyahu telling Trump that a reliable agreement with Iran is unattainable and would likely be violated, while Trump said he believes a deal is possible.
“We’ll see if it’s possible — let’s give it a shot,” Trump said, according to the US official.
American officials said Washington will pursue its maximum pressure campaign on Iran alongside nuclear negotiations and a continued military buildup in the Middle East to maintain the option of strikes if diplomatic efforts collapse.
With more than 80 percent of Iran’s oil exports going to China, any reduction in Chinese purchases would sharply intensify economic pressure on Tehran and could shift its calculations toward greater concessions on its nuclear programme.
Additionally, an executive order signed by Trump recently allows the US to intensify economic pressure on Iran, including provisions enabling the heads of state and commerce departments to recommend tariffs of up to 25 percent on countries that maintain trade ties with Tehran.

What is dart frog toxin, the poison linked to Alexei Navalny’s death?
The toxin is reportedly 100 times more powerful than morphine
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Epibatidine, the highly potent toxin Britain has linked to the death of Alexei Navalny, is reportedly 100 times more powerful than morphine.
This extremely toxic, nicotine-like compound originates from the Epipedobates genus of poison dart frogs, found exclusively in northern South America. Crucially, these amphibians are not indigenous to Russia.
Species such as the brightly coloured Anthony’s poison arrow frog and the Phantasmal poison frog secrete this substance onto their skin. Researchers theorise that the frogs acquire the toxin through their diet, as captive-bred animals lack it, and wild populations exhibit varying levels depending on their habitat.
Epibatidine has been investigated as a pain killer and for relief from painful inflammatory conditions of the lung such as asthma and pulmonary fibrosis.
However, it is about a hundred times more potent than morphine and because of its toxicity is not used clinically.
Professor Alastair Hay said Epibatidine acts to inhibit nerve action by blocking nicotinic receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems.
The Professor (Emeritus) of Environmental Toxicology at the University of Leeds added: “The effect of blocking these receptors is muscle paralysis and paralysis of the respiratory system.
“So, breathing is blocked, and any person poisoned dies from suffocation.”
Professor Hay said the presence of the toxin in a person’s blood “suggests deliberate administration”.
He added: “Epibatidine toxicity can even be increased by co-administration of certain other drugs and these combinations have been researched.
“If epibatidine, a toxin, was indeed used to poison Alexei Navalny, this is in violation of the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
“The Soviet Union was a co-sponsor of the BTWC. Russia is a signatory of both the BTWC and CWC.
“If Russia used Epibatidine to poison Mr Navalny it has violated two treaties it has sworn to uphold.”
Epibatidine can be detected using a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.
Gas chromatography helps separate out compounds of interest and mass spectrometry breaks up chemicals into particular fragments to create a unique fingerprint of the substance which can then be identified.

Four new astronauts arrive at the International Space Station to replace NASA’s evacuated crew

Four new astronauts arrive at the International Space Station to replace NASA’s evacuated crew
Four new astronauts arrive at the International Space Station to replace NASA’s evacuated crew
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) — The International Space Station returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.
SpaceX delivered the U.S., French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.
Last month’s medical evacuation was NASA’s first in 65 years of human spaceflight. One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running — one American and two Russians — prompting NASA to pause spacewalks and trim research.
Moving in for eight to nine months are NASA’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have lived up there before. During her first station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.
Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to fly in space. Hathaway is a captain in the U.S. Navy.
“Bonjour!” Adenot called out once the capsule docked to the space station 277 miles (446 kilometers) up. Added Meir: “Grateful to be on board, and we’re ready to get to work.”
NASA has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on Jan. 7 or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at the hospital before returning to Houston.
The space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.

Casey Wasserman puts talent agency up for sale amid Epstein files fallout and high-profile departures
Wasserman had exchanged flirtatious emails with Maxwell in 2003, before Epstein was convicted in Florida

Casey Wasserman, the founder and CEO of talent agency Wasserman Group, told employees Friday he had begun selling his company after documents in the Epstein files revealed he had a flirtatious relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell and maintained a friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
“I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” Wasserman wrote in the message to staff, seen by The Independent. “It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about.”
Wasserman’s announcement follows a wave of departures from high-profile clients who cut ties over his relationship with Maxwell and Epstein. While Wasserman has several email exchanges with the two, there is no suggestion he participated in Maxwell and Epstein’s crimes, nor has Wasserman been formally accused of any wrongdoing.
That includes musicians Chappell Roan, Orville Peck and Chelsea Cutler, as well as soccer star Abby Wambach. Others had threatened to leave unless Wasserman stepped down, including DJ John Summit.
Wasserman, 51, told employees he would devote his attention to preparing for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, which he is overseeing as chairman of the organizing committee.
The Independent has asked Wasserman Group for comment.
Executives of the 2028 Olympics confirmed earlier this week to reporters that Wasserman would continue chairing the committee. It’s unclear if that decision will remain firm.
Wasserman’s relationship with Maxwell and Epstein became apparent after the Justice Department released three million pages of documents in the Epstein files, many of which include email correspondence between Maxwell, Epstein and third parties.
In 2002, years before Epstein was first convicted of solicitation of prostitution in Florida, Wasserman and his then-wife flew on Epstein’s private plane as part of a charitable trip with former President Bill Clinton and others.
Emails from 2003 show Wasserman flirting with Maxwell over email. At the time, Wasserman was in his late 20s and married.
In one email, Wasserman told Maxwell, “Where are you, I miss you. I will be in nyc for 4 days starting april 22...can we book that massage now?” In another, he wrote to Maxwell, “So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?
Wasserman had previously apologized for his presence in the files. He reiterated his regret in his email to staff Friday and said he had “limited interactions” with Epstein and Maxwell before criminal charges were brought against either of them. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial in 2019. Maxwell is serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking among other charges.
“The pain experienced by the victims of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell is unimaginable — and I’m glad, as I’m sure you all are, that those who helped them commit their crimes are rightly being held accountable,” Wasserman wrote.
While Wasserman is in the process of selling his company, Mike Watts, the company’s chief operating officer, would assume day-to-day control of the business, Wasserman told employees.

US ‘too often’ asks Ukraine, not Russia, for concessions
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced hope on Feb 14 that US-brokered peace talks in Geneva next week would be substantive, but he said Ukraine was being asked “too often” to make concessions.
He also accused Moscow of seeking to delay decisions by changing its lead negotiator.
Ukrainian, Russian and American delegations are due to meet in the Swiss lakeside city on Feb 17 and 18 as US President Donald Trump seeks to push through a deal to end Europe’s biggest war since 1945.
“We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,” Mr Zelensky said, in a speech at the annual Munich Security Conference.
Son of Iran’s last shah urges US military intervention
Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Feb 14 said US military intervention in Iran could save lives, and urged US President Donald Trump’s administration not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran’s clerical rulers on a nuclear deal.
The exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian government was on the brink of collapse, and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall.
Mr Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
French prosecutors announce team for Epstein files
The Paris prosecutor’s office on Feb 14 announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
With Epstein’s known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents by the US authorities, the prosecutor’s office said it would also thoroughly re-examine the case a former French modelling agency executive Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the American financier, who died in custody in 2022.
The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor’s office told AFP.
Dart frog poison killed Navalny, European allies say
Five European allies on Feb 14 blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively” confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny’s death.
Muchova ends six-year title drought with Qatar win
Former French Open finalist Karolina Muchova ended a six-year trophy drought on Feb 14, when she beat Canadian Victoria Mboko 6-4 7-5 to win the Qatar Open and clinch her first WTA 1000 title.
The Czech Republic’s Muchova, who has struggled with multiple injuries and was sidelined for 10 months after a wrist injury suffered in 2023, had not won a title on the WTA tour since the Korea Open in September 2019.
But the 29-year-old Muchova kept mistakes to a minimum as she switched up the rhythm against Mboko to clinch victory in an hour and 34 minutes.

The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River have missed a deadline for the second time to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages

The seven Western states that depend on the Colorado River missed a deadline for the second time Saturday to agree on a plan addressing record drought and water shortages.
Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo released a joint statement calling on Upper Basin states to offer more concessions. Those states include Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.
“The Colorado River is essential to our communities and economies, and our states have conserved large volumes of water in recent years to stabilize the basin’s water supplies for years to come,” the governors said. “Our stance remains firm and fair: all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation.”
Arizona, California and Nevada have offered to decrease Colorado River allocation by 27%, 10% and 17%, respectively, according to those states.
Colorado Sen. John Hickenlooper. who helped negotiate a river contingency plan in 2019 as governor, called the situation in the Colorado Basin “dire," pointing to the state's low snowpack.
"If we don’t address this problem together –- head-on and fast –- our communities, farms, and economies will suffer. The best path forward is the one we take together. Litigation won’t solve the problem of this long-term aridification," Hickenlooper said in a statement.
John Entsminger, the general manager of the Southern Nevada Water Authority, also expressed frustration at the lack of progress.
“The actions we have taken over the past two-plus decades are less about raising Lake Mead’s elevation than they are about protecting ourselves if things go from bad to worse,” Entsminger said in a statement.
The states previously let pass a November deadline set by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to devise a strategy to face water shortages after this year, when current guidelines will expire.
Over 40 million people across these states along with Mexico and Native American tribes rely on Colorado River water. The river is crucial to farming as well as water and electricity for millions of homes and businesses. Much of the water starts out as winter mountain snowfall in the Upper Basin, which amasses far more that way than it consumes. Lower Basin states, including agriculture-heavy regions, are bigger consumers.
Major cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles, are also big water consumers. Chronic overuse, drought and rising temperatures linked to climate change have lessened water flows.
How the water is allocated — especially in dry spells — and conserved has been the center of agreements among the states for decades. The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on water amounts that doesn’t exist today, especially with the long-term drought.
The current round of negotiations among states have been going on over two years.
If no consensus can be reached, the federal government could step in and devise a plan that leaves parties dissatisfied and could even result in litigation.
Scientists recently found snow cover and snow depth in the West are at their lowest in decades. Some areas have seen their warmest December through early February. Normally, snow cover this time of year spans 460,000 square miles — about the size of California, Utah, Idaho and Montana. But, this year it is only California-sized, about 155,000 square miles, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center.

Onsite gunmen force MSF to stop work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital
Medical charity’s announcement comes on the heels of Israel’s recent ban on its operations in Gaza.
Doctors Without Borders, known by its French initials MSF, has suspended some operations at a Nasser Hospital in Gaza after its staff and patients saw “armed men, some masked” posing “serious security threats” inside the building.
The Geneva-based medical charity reported on its website that non-essential work at the hospital in Khan Younis was halted on January 20 due to concerns with the “management of the structure, the safeguarding of its neutrality, and security breaches”.

“MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons”, said the site’s “frequently asked questions” section, last updated on February 11.
“Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care”, it said, adding that the charity expressed concern to the “relevant” authorities.
Under the suspension, MSF will continue supporting critical services, such as inpatient and surgical departments, but will end support to the paediatrics and maternity wards, including the neonatal intensive care unit, and will no longer offer a range of outpatient consultations and other services.
The organisation was not able to indicate the armed men’s affiliation, but said its concerns were heightened by previous, deliberate Israeli attacks on health facilities.
Israel has decimated the enclave’s health infrastructure and continues to hold captive 95 Palestinian doctors and medical workers, including 80 from Gaza.
Zaher al-Waheidi, the head of the records department at Gaza’s Ministry of Health, said that MSF’s suspension will have a significant impact as hundreds of patients are admitted to the maternity and burn wards daily. He said the ministry would take over maternity patient care.
Gaza’s Ministry of Interior said in a statement that it is committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action will be taken against violators. It suggested that armed members of certain families recently entered hospitals, but did not identify those involved.
Israeli ban on aid organisations
MSF’s announcement comes after Israel recently ordered the charity and dozens of other international organisations to stop their work in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank if they did not meet new rules, including sharing details about their staff.
Two weeks ago, MSF – which provides international staff for six hospitals, and operates two field hospitals and eight primary health centres, clinics and medical points – said it would not submit a staff list to Israel after failing to receive assurances for their safety.
Israel has repeatedly attacked hospitals and healthcare workers throughout its genocidal war on Gaza.
In other developments on Saturday, Israel’s military said its troops “eliminated” a person in northern Gaza, alleging that the unidentified individual crossed the “yellow line“. The demarcation divides Gaza into an eastern area under Israeli military control and a western area where Palestinians face fewer movement restrictions but are under constant threat of air strikes and forced displacement.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas slammed Israel for violating the US-brokered “ceasefire”, during which Israel has killed nearly 600 Palestinians since October 10.
In a speech by Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia, he called on Israel to remove all “obstacles” to implementing phase two of the “truce” deal, including the work of a technocratic committee that will oversee the daily governance of Gaza.
More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed and 171,000 wounded in attacks in Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza since October 2023.

Searching ruins: Father in Gaza digs for family killed in Israeli strike
Mahmoud Hammad lost wife, 6 children, relatives when his home was hit by 2,000-pound bomb
- Officials say nearly 9,500 Palestinians remain missing under debris amid limited recovery capacity
GAZA City, Palestine
On a mound of sand and shattered concrete that once formed the foundation of his six-story home in Gaza City, Mahmoud Hammad digs methodically through the debris, searching for the remains of his wife and children killed beneath the rubble.
Armed with little more than a small shovel and a metal sieve, the 45-year-old father filters sand by hand, hoping to find bone fragments that would allow him to lay his family to rest.
“In the absence of machinery, this is what we have,” he said, holding up the sieve.
Home reduced to dust
Hammad’s house in the Sabra neighborhood was destroyed Dec. 6, 2023, during heavy Israeli bombardment. He said a powerful bomb weighing around 2,000 pounds (907 kilograms) struck the building while the family was inside.
He lost his wife, six children, his brother, his brother’s wife and their four children.
Hammad survived but sustained severe injuries, including multiple rib fractures and injuries to his shoulder and pelvis. After months of partial recovery, he returned to the site to begin searching for his family’s remains.
“I wanted to bury them properly,” he said.
With the help of neighbors, he managed to retrieve and bury his brother and his brother’s family. But the bodies of his wife and children remain under layers of hardened debris.
“I collect what I can, piece by piece,” he said.
Missing under the rubble
Nearly 9,500 Palestinians are missing beneath destroyed buildings across the territory, according to official estimates in Gaza.
Officials said recovery efforts are severely hindered by the lack of heavy equipment needed to clear the debris. Despite a ceasefire that took effect in October, authorities said the entry of large-scale machinery remains restricted, limiting the ability of rescue teams to reach buried bodies.
Civil defense crews have repeatedly warned that the longer debris remains uncleared, the harder it becomes to recover remains.
Private grief amid mass destruction
Hammad said his wife was pregnant and close to delivery when the strike occurred, as medical services across Gaza were collapsing under the strain of the war.
“She and our unborn child died together,” he said.
Since December, Gaza has been battered by repeated storms that further displaced families living in makeshift shelters after their homes were destroyed.
For Hammad, however, the focus remains on the ruins before him.
Each day, he returns to sift through dust and fragments of concrete, driven by what he describes as a simple duty.
“They deserve to be buried with dignity,” he said.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and more than 1,598 injured in Israeli attacks since a ceasefire deal took effect Oct. 10, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.
Israel’s war on Gaza, which began Oct. 8, 2023, and lasted two years, has killed more than 72,000 Palestinians and wounded over 171,000, most of them women and children, and destroyed about 90% of Gaza’s civilian infrastructure.

Asia-Pacific, Western officials discuss connected security challenges at Munich Security Conference
Japanese, Dutch top diplomats, New Zealand, Australian defense chiefs, US defense official discuss challenges linking Europe, Indo-Pacific
ISTANBUL
Asia-Pacific and Western officials discussed shared security challenges linking Europe and the Indo-Pacific at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi outlined three key concerns: growing turbulence in the international order; a strong sense of urgency over the linked security of the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific; and cooperation as the cornerstone of Japan’s alliance with the US, as well as Tokyo’s responsibility to deter and repel any aggression.
“Going forward, Japan will contribute to the stability and peace of the international society,” he said.
Motegi expressed Tokyo's concern about “the advancement of cooperation among China, Russia and North Korea and its impact on regional security,” saying that Japan will continue to monitor the situation "closely."
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel highlighted similarities between Europe and the Indo-Pacific across domains such as defense and economy.
“If you look at cyberspace, if you look at hybrid threats, then we are all in the same arena, and we're all facing the same enemies there. If you look at the economic arena, our dependencies and our need to diversify, or the export control measures that we're being hit with, those are all the same,” he said. “We live in one world. We need friends in this very turbulent world.”
Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said global relations are increasingly power-centered and stressed burden-sharing, adding Canberra wants to be a “better ally” to Washington.
Marles highlighted “the biggest conventional military buildup we've seen in the world since the end of the Second World War, being undertaken by China, but being done so without strategic reassurance.”
“From an Australian point of view, we are very much about working with the US and other partners like Japan to try and put forward deterrence within the Indo-Pacific so that we can maintain peace, stability, and prosperity -- a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he added.
New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins described the world as “a very dangerous place at the moment,” urging greater collective awareness.
“We'll have to understand that we can't just keep thinking that we can go on as we have, without significant improvements,” she said. “I would say to you, think about us too, because what happens to us is going to affect you just as what happens to you affects us.”
US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby emphasized the need to view global affairs as interconnected.
"It's better to keep, to keep jaw-jawing, rather than war-warring, even if there's a crisis or conflict in one or more theaters," he said.

IDF eliminates terrorists emerging from Gaza tunnel, strikes Hezbollah sites in Lebanon

The IDF said Saturday it killed armed terrorists in northern Gaza after identifying them near Israeli forces operating in an area under Israeli control, describing the incident as “another blatant violation” of the ceasefire agreement.
The military said the terrorists were spotted moving while covered and attempting to conceal themselves among ruins close to troops in Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza.
Separately, the military said it carried out strikes on infrastructure belonging to the Hezbollah terrorist group in southern Lebanon. The Lebanese Hezbollah-affiliated channel Al Manar reported that fighter jets launched a series of strikes in the village of Bouslaiya, between Houmine al-Fawqa and Deir al-Zahrani, and in the Jabal al-Rihan area.
Following reports of explosions, the Upper Galilee Regional Council informed residents that “a wave of strikes will continue for several hours in Lebanese territory.” It warned that blasts may be heard in eastern Galilee and the northern Golan Heights but said there was no change in security guidelines for civilians.
Earlier Saturday, the medical aid group Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said it had suspended operations at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis after its staff identified armed men, some masked, inside the facility. The organization’s activities in Gaza had recently been halted after it refused to provide Israel with a list of its Palestinian employees.
During the week, the IDF carried out several strikes in Gaza in response to ceasefire violations. On Monday, the army said it killed Ahmad Hassan, whom it described as responsible for the deaths of seven soldiers and injuries to others in separate incidents during the war.
The killing came after four terrorists emerged from a tunnel in Rafah and opened fire on Israeli forces. 7th Armored Brigade troops returned fire, killing the attackers. No Israeli casualties were reported in that incident, the military said.

Israel prepares to deploy tear gas drones in occupied West Bank ahead of Ramadan: report

Israel’s National Guard is preparing to deploy drones equipped to fire tear gas at Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, as part of “security” preparations for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israeli Channel 12 reported on Saturday.
The police tenders committee approved the purchase of three drone-mounted systems designed to drop tear gas capsules, the channel said. The contract is valued at about $49,000.
The systems, known as “Surprise Egg,” are designed to be mounted on Matrice-type drones and used to disperse demonstrations by releasing tear gas from the air, according to the report.
Israeli police already operate 19 similar systems, Channel 12 said.
Tender documents described the purchase as “urgent,” for “expected events during Ramadan,” the outlet reported.
Israel’s National Guard was formed under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister. Opposition figures have described the force as “a militia effectively operating under his authority.”
Military buildup
Earlier this week, Channel 12 reported that the Israeli army decided to reinforce its presence in the occupied West Bank during Ramadan, including deploying a commando brigade.
In addition to the 22 battalions currently deployed in the occupied territory, the army plans to send additional units, the report said.
More companies are also expected to be stationed at checkpoints ahead of the entry of thousands of worshippers into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem.
The army has recommended to Defence Minister Israel Katz that up to 10,000 worshippers be allowed to enter the compound each Friday during Ramadan, according to Channel 12. It also recommended allowing entry only for men over 55 and women over 50.
On Friday, Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, preacher at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, said he regretted Israel’s decision to restrict access during Ramadan and warned that the government was implementing “an aggressive plan targeting the holy site.”
Access restrictions
Each year during Ramadan, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians travel from the occupied West Bank to occupied East Jerusalem to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Since the start of Israel’s genocide in Gaza in October 2023, Israeli authorities have imposed tight restrictions on occupied West Bank residents crossing military checkpoints into occupied East Jerusalem.
Over the past two years, only limited numbers have been allowed entry after obtaining Israeli-issued permits, which Palestinians say are difficult to secure.
Israel has not announced any special easing measures for Ramadan this year.

At least 6,000 killed over 3 days during RSF attack on Sudan’s el-Fasher, UN says
Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces killed more than 6,000 people in three days during an assault on el-Fasher, the U.N. Human Rights Office has said
- Bookmark
More than 6,000 people were killed in over three days when a Sudanese paramilitary group unleashed “a wave of intense violence … shocking in its scale and brutality” in Sudan's Darfur region in late October, according to the United Nations.
The Rapid Support Forces' offensive to capture the city of el-Fasher included widespread atrocities that amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, the U.N. Human Rights Office said in a report released on Friday.
“The wanton violations that were perpetrated by the RSF and allied Arab militia in the final offensive on el-Fasher underscore that persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence,” said U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
The RSF and their allied Arab militias, known as Janjaweed, overran el-Fasher, the Sudanese army’s only remaining stronghold in Darfur, on Oct. 26 and rampaged through the city and its surroundings after more than 18 months of siege.
The 29-page U.N. report detailed a set of atrocities that ranged from mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment to detention and disappearances. In many cases, the attacks were ethnicity-motivated, it said.
The RSF did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment.
The paramilitaries' Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo has previously acknowledged abuses by his fighters, but disputed the scale of atrocities.
‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’
The alleged atrocities in el-Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur, mirror a pattern of RSF conduct in its war against the Sudanese miliary. The war began in April 2023 when a power struggle between the two sides exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum and elsewhere across the country.
The conflict created the world's largest humanitarian crisis with parts of the country pushed into famine. It has also been marked by heinous atrocities which the International Criminal Court said it was investigating as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The RSF was also accused by the Biden administration of carrying out genocide in the ongoing war.
The U.N. Human Rights Office said it documented the killing of at least 4,400 people inside el-Fasher between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27, while more than 1,600 others were killed as they were trying to flee the RSF rampage. The report said it drew its toll from interviews with 140 victims and witnesses which were “are consistent with independent analysis of contemporaneous satellite imagery and video footage."
In one case, RSF fighters opened fire from heavy weapons on a crowd of 1,000 people sheltering in the Rashid dormitory in el-Fasher university on Oct. 26, killing around 500 people, the report said. One witness was quoted as saying that he saw bodies thrown into the air, “like a scene out of a horror movie,” according to the report.
In another case, around 600 people, including 50 children, were executed on Oct. 26 while taking shelter in the university facilities, the report said.
The report, however, warned that the actual scale of the death toll of the week-long offensive in el-Fasher was “undoubtedly significantly higher.”
The toll does not include at least 460 people who were killed by the RSF on Oct. 28 when they stormed the Saudi Maternity hospital, according to the World Health Organization.
Around 300 people were also killed in RSF shelling and drone attacks between Oct. 23 and Oct. 24 in the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people, 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) northwest of el-Fasher, the U.N. Human Rights Office’ report said.
Woman and girls sexually assaulted
Sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, was apparently widespread during el-Fasher offensive, with RSF fighters and their allied militias targeting women and girls from the African Zaghawa non-Arab tribes over allegations of having links or supporting the miliary, the report said.
Türk, who visited Sudan last month, said survivors of sexual violence recounted testimonies that showed how the practice “was systematically used as a weapon of war.”
The paramilitaries also abducted many people while attempting to flee the city, before releasing them after paying ramson. Thousands have been held in at least 10 detention centers — including the city’s Children Hospital which was turned into a detention facility — run by the RSF in el-Fasher, the report said.
The U.N. Human Rights Office also said it documented 10 detention facilities used by the paramilitaries in el-Fasher, including the Children’s Hospital which was turned into a detention center. Several thousands of people remain missing and unaccounted for, the report said.
The pattern of the RSF offensive on el-Fasher was a mirror of other attacks by the paramilitaries and their allies on the Zamzam camp for displaced people, 15 kilometers (9 miles) south of the city, and on West Darfur’s city of Geneina and the nearby town of Ardamata in 2023, the U.N. Human Rights Office said.
Türk said there were “reasonable grounds” that RSF and their allied Arab militias committed war crimes, and that their acts also amount to crimes against humanity.
He called for holding those responsible — including commanders — accountable, warning that “persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence.”

Security guarantees for Ukraine must not repeat fate of Budapest Memorandum – Pistorius
He made the remarks at the Munich Security Conference, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"When it comes to the future of Ukraine, three points are crucial in my view. First, we will keep looking for paths to a reliable peace because Ukraine's future is fundamental not just to European security, but to global security. We need a peace deal that safeguards both Ukraine's and our European interests," Pistorius said.
He stressed that the second key aspect is the need to increase pressure on Russia, which shows no willingness to compromise.
"The ball is in Putin's court. He is the one who is dragging out negotiations and is showing no willingness to compromise. He is shifting the cost of war to his own people. But he must not be mistaken. We will continue doing everything in our power to protect Ukraine as an independent, sovereign European nation. We will keep up the pressure politically, economically, and militarily," Pistorius said.
The third aspect, he stressed, is providing Ukraine with reliable security guarantees:
"Third, we will have peace. And when, not if, this day comes, we will have to make this peace last, we will have to shield Ukraine from any potential future aggression by Russia. To accomplish this huge task, Ukraine needs substantial, reliable security guarantees," he said.
Pistorius recalled that as early as 2014, then-Senator Marco Rubio (now U.S. Secretary of State) noted that the 1994 Budapest Memorandum did ultimately not serve the purpose of providing for Ukraine's security. "Quite the opposite, 20 years later, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea," he said.
"Therefore, our lesson for today, must be: we cannot afford another paper tiger like the Budapest Memorandum. To provide credible and reliable security guarantees, all of us – European and Americans – have to deliver," Pistorius said.
He also stressed the critical role of a strong and capable NATO in the face of multiple interconnected threats. He concluded that Germany remains the largest donor of aid to Ukraine, and this support will not waver even in the fifth year of the war.

Obama responds to Trump’s video of him and Michelle as apes and says MAGA lacks a sense of ‘shame’
A White House official claimed a staffer ‘erroneously made the post’ on Trump’s Truth Social account
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Former President Barack Obama has responded to a video shared on President Donald Trump’s Truth Social account depicting him and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes.
Last week, Trump’s Truth Social account shared a video that showed the Obamas’ faces superimposed onto apes as the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” played in the background. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt initially claimed the post was “from an internet meme video” and said to “stop the fake outage.”
But as criticism mounted, the post was deleted. A White House official told The Independent a staffer “erroneously made the post.”
Political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen, who published a 47-minute interview with Obama on Saturday, asked the former president about the video and other instances of “cruelty” in public discourse from Trump and his allies.
Obama replied: “First of all, I think it's important to recognize that the majority of the American people find this behavior deeply troubling.”
“It is true that it gets attention. It’s true that it’s a distraction. But, as I’m traveling around the country, as you’re traveling around the country, you meet people — they still believe in decency, courtesy, kindness,” he said.
“And there’s this sort of clown show happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn’t seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office. So that’s been lost,” he added.
“But the reason I point out that I don't think the majority of the American people approve of this is because, ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people.”
The Independent has contacted the White House for comment.
Trump refused to apologize when asked about the video on Friday, February 6, telling reporters he “didn’t make a mistake.” When asked Thursday if he “fired or disciplined” the staffer who erroneously posted the video, Trump replied: “No, I haven’t.”
The video received widespread backlash, including from several Republican lawmakers.
Senator Tim Scott, the only Black Republican in the chamber, called on Trump to remove the video after it was first posted. “Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,” Scott wrote on X.
Republican Senator Katie Britt also denounced the video, writing on X: “This content was rightfully removed, should have never been posted to begin with, and is not who we are as a nation.”
Trump was later said to be furious with both of them for having criticized the post.
Obama – the Democratic president from 2009 to 2017 – has long been a favorite target of Trump, who was a leader of the so-called “birther conspiracy” which falsely claimed that Obama was born in Kenya and was therefore ineligible to serve as U.S. president.

41 DUI arrests made by Tennessee trooper tossed — with over half of the cases involving sober drivers, report says

41 DUI arrests made by Tennessee trooper tossed — with over half of the cases involving sober drivers, report says
Local defense attorneys have raised concerns over enforcement practice, according to the report
- Bookmark
Forty-one DUI arrests made by a single Tennessee Highway Patrol trooper in Bedford County have been dismissed by prosecutors, an investigative report shows, with more than half involving drivers later found to be sober.
The dismissals stem from arrests made between 2021 and 2024 by former Trooper Asa Pearl, according to records obtained by WSMV4.
Of those 41 cases, a Bedford County District Attorney’s office spreadsheet shows that 22 incidents involving drivers who either had no drugs or alcohol in their system or whose blood alcohol was within legal limits at the time of testing, the local news outlet found.
One of those drivers, Ron LaFlamme, said he was pulled over and asked to perform a sobriety test despite having neither alcohol nor drugs in his system.
“I was surprised when he started asking me to do a sobriety test,” LaFlamme told WSMV4 in an interview that aired Tuesday. “It was wrongful arrest.”
The remaining 19 dismissals were attributed to procedural issues, including the arresting trooper’s unavailability for court or inability to recall specifics of the stop, officials said.
Attorney David McKenzie, representing LaFlamme, told the outlet that word of the dismissals spread among local defense attorneys and raised concerns about enforcement practices.
“I know that during the time that Ron’s case was making its way through the court, Ron’s case was not the only one with this particular trooper, where blood results were coming back negative,” McKenzie said.
He added: “This could happen to your child. This could happen to your parent. This could happen to your coworker.”
Pearl resigned from the Tennessee Highway Patrol in 2024, and his personnel file offers no explanation for his departure and makes no mention of the dozens of DUI cases that were later thrown out, according to the report.
Pearl did not respond to WSMV4’s requests for comment. The Tennessee Highway Patrol also declined the outlet’s request to comment on the matter.
The Independent has contacted the Tennessee Highway Patrol for comment.
This latest report is part of WSMV4’s “Sobering Problem” series, which investigates Tennessee’s troubling pattern of sober drivers being wrongly arrested for DUI and left waiting months for blood test results to prove their innocence.
Last month, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation acknowledged it had undercounted DUI cases involving people who had no drugs or alcohol in their system. New data shows that from 2017 to 2024, more than 2,500 drivers in Tennessee were sober at the time of their DUI arrest, which is more than double the number the TBI previously reported, according to WSMV4.

Faaletino Tavana has scored a try for the Wests Tigers while most of his body was outside the field of play.
Canterbury Bulldogs five-eighth Matt Burton limped off in his club's trial match against Newcastle.
What's next?
The 2026 NRL season begins with a double-header in Las Vegas on Sunday, March 1 AEDT.
Wests Tigers rookie Faaletino Tavana has laid claim to one of the best tries in 2026 during a preseason trial against the Sydney Roosters.
The Tigers came from 0-16 down on Saturday to claim a 42-26 win in a trial match of mostly second-string players.
Heamasi Makasini bagged a hat-trick for Wests, but it was Tiger teammate Tavana who produced the moment of the match.
Tavana jumped out of the field to avoid defender Enzo Griffier, then contorted himself to place the ball on the line late in the match.
Tigers coach Benji Marshall had plenty to smile about on Saturday, with the hat-trick performance by Makasini showing the teenager is ready for a big year in 2026.
Makasini's sparkling display comes at the perfect time for the Tigers, who are preparing to shuffle their backline around as Adam Doueihi begins the season in the halves.
Makasini has mostly trained on the left wing this pre-season, so is competing with Jeral Skelton for chances, but could also fill in at centre should Starford To'a or Taylan May go down while Doueihi is in the halves.
"I can cover both spots. I like both positions," Makasini said.
"I've been on the left a bit, left wing. But there's a couple of good wingers in our team. We're all fighting for the spot."
Injury puts star Bulldog in doubt for Las Vegas opener
Matt Burton is backing himself to overcome a hamstring injury in time for Canterbury's Las Vegas season opener after limping off during the Bulldogs's 28-0 pre-season thrashing of Newcastle.
Dylan Brown had a quiet first hit-out in Knights colours but the multi-million-dollar recruit's underwhelming showing was overshadowed by the poorly timed injury to his rival No.6.
Burton scored an early try but pulled up sore following a tackle from Phoenix Crossland and Brown midway through Saturday's first half.
He managed to complete a tackle on Knights winger Dom Young during the next set before leaving the field for medical assessment.
"We saw him grabbing at it, and we told the trainers to get him off," Bulldogs coach Cameron Ciraldo told reporters at Hunter Stadium in Newcastle.
"He had to make that tackle [on Young], so he couldn't have been too bad."
Burton was walking freely in the Bulldogs shed after full-time, albeit with a brace on his hamstring, and told club staff his injury felt minor.
"He said it's not too bad, it feels all right," Ciraldo said.
"He just felt a little something and just thought with it being a trial that he'd come get it checked."
Burton will nevertheless be racing the fitness clock to board Thursday's flight to the US, where the Bulldogs face St George Illawarra for their season opener at Allegiant Stadium.

The Knesset Education Committee recently discussed a bill to commemorate the disaster of October 7, 2023. During the discussion, disputes emerged not only over how it should be commemorated but, above all, over the language the state should choose to describe the event. Should the law's title include the phrase "the October 7 massacre" – that is, what actually happened on that day, which fell on the holiday or Simhat Torah – or should the worst disaster in the country's history be described as "the Simhat Torah incidents"?
It Was a Massacre, Not 'Incidents'
A national memory that isn't accurate in its language doesn't merely endanger the historical truth, but also undermines our own moral judgment of the enemy that perpetrated the massacre

A sharp warning issued by Estephan Salameh, the Palestinian Authority's Minister of Finance, according to which 2026 will be the most difficult year in the PA's history in economic terms, is not merely a technical one relating to cash flow. It is a description of an expected result of Israel's policies. Salameh explicitly links the crisis to the continued withholding of tax money Israel collects in the PA's name (tax refunds for Palestinian laborers and duties on imports) but refuses to transfer.

French President Macron urges restraint after right-wing youth fatally beaten
French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday urged calm and restraint after a far-right aligned 23-year-old man identified only as Quentin was fatally beaten on the sidelines of a conference by a hard-left lawmaker in the southeastern city of Lyon. The incident has intensified tensions between France's far-right and hard-left.
French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday urged calm and restraint after the fatal beating of a 23-year-old French youth aligned with the far-right on the sidelines of a conference by a hard-left lawmaker in the southeastern city of Lyon.
The death of the young man -- identified only as Quentin -- has intensified tensions between France's far-right and hard-left who are both eyeing 2027 presidential elections.
He had been in hospitalised in Lyon on Thursday after being attacked while providing what his supporters said was security for a protest against an appearance by hard-left MEP Rima Hassan at the Lyon branch of the Sciences Po university.

The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it added.
Macron said on X that Quentin had been the victim of "an unprecedented outburst of violence.
"Hatred that kills has no place in our country. I call for calm, restraint and respect," he added.
'Organised' attack
According to the Nemesis collective, which is close to the far-right, Quentin was part of the security team responsible for ensuring the safety of its activists.
They were demonstrating against the conference by Hassan, who is known for her outspoken criticism of Israel.
The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organised and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked".
Prosecutors have yet to give details on the circumstances of his death.

Nemesis accused members of a local anti-fascist association that was banned by the government in June of being behind the killing.
Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.
With Quentin's death sparking a wave of alarm across the political spectrum, concern also spread to the hard-left party of Hassan, France Unbowed (LFI).
"What I have feared for years in Lyon is continuing," said LFI French parliament MP Raphael Arnault.
"I offer my condolences to the family of this young man and I hope that the truth will be uncovered about this tragedy," he added.
Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) is the biggest single party by seats in the French lower house while the LFI is the biggest left-wing faction.
In the wake of the incident, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez urged authorities to "increase vigilance around political gatherings, as well as around campaign offices".

Debate in Europe over nuclear weapons gains pace amid US security doubts
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- European leaders are debating bolstering nuclear arsenals due to Russian threats and US security commitment doubts, with Germany and France discussing deterrence.
- Britain and France are enhancing nuclear cooperation. NATO and US officials affirm the US nuclear umbrella remains, but welcome greater European contributions.
- An MSC report outlined five options for Europe's nuclear future, from US reliance to new arsenals, warning of no easy, risk-free solutions.
AI generated
MUNICH, Germany - European leaders, worried about threats from a nuclear-armed Russia and doubts about the future of US security commitments, are increasingly debating whether to bolster nuclear arsenals on the continent.
While the US and Russia have thousands of nuclear warheads each, in Europe only France and Britain have atomic weapons, with the combined total in the hundreds.
US President Donald Trump’s disdainful comments about NATO and his transactional approach to foreign relations have European allies questioning whether they can risk relying on US protection.
“Europeans can no longer outsource their thinking about nuclear deterrence to the United States,” an expert group warned in a report published for the Munich Security Conference.
It called on Europe to “urgently confront a new nuclear reality” in the face of “Russia’s nuclear-backed revisionism”.
Speaking at the MSC, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he was already holding “confidential talks with the French president about European nuclear deterrence”.
Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the UK’s nuclear deterrent already protected fellow NATO members but stressed he was “enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France”.
Mr Starmer said “any adversary must know that in a crisis they could be confronted by our combined strength” alongside France.
US ‘ultimate guarantor’
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte insisted that “nobody” was considering fully replacing the American nuclear umbrella, which has shielded Europe’s NATO countries for decades.
“I think every discussion in Europe making sure that collectively the nuclear deterrence is even stronger, fine,” Mr Rutte, a former Dutch prime minister, told journalists.
“But nobody is arguing in Europe to do this as a sort of replacement of the nuclear umbrella of the United States.
“Everybody realises that is the ultimate guarantor – and all these other discussions are in addition.”
US Under Secretary of Defence Elbridge Colby said that Mr Trump “has made clear the US extended nuclear deterrent continues to apply here” in Europe.
He said there is US “receptivity to a greater European contribution to... the NATO deterrent” – but that conversations need to be “very sober” and “deliberate” because of concerns about nuclear proliferation and instability.
No good options
Discussion of nuclear armament has long been viewed as taboo in many other European countries – but Russian aggression and worries about US commitment have forced the issue into mainstream European politics.
Many European officials are convinced that Moscow’s territorial ambitions will not be confined to Ukraine, and that other European countries – including even NATO members – could face some sort of attack.
The MSC report laid out five nuclear options for Europe, while cautioning that none were good. There was “no low-cost or risk-free way out of Europe’s nuclear predicament”, they warned.
“The era in which Europe could afford strategic complacency has ended,” wrote the authors, calling on European policymakers “to confront the role of nuclear weapons in the defence of the continent directly and without delay – and to invest the resources needed to do so competently”.
It listed five options: Continue to rely on American deterrence; strengthen the role of British and French nuclear weapons in a European deterrent; jointly develop European nuclear weapons as a deterrent; increase the number of European countries with their own nuclear arsenals; or expand European conventional military power to present a more intimidating non-nuclear deterrent.
Sticking with the status quo, and relying on America’s unmatched military might, remained “the most credible and feasible option” in the short term, they argued.
‘We need action’
Very few currently believe Europeans can assume full responsibility for deterrence in the short term.
“If there’s going to be some kind of bigger European investments in France or the UK’s nuclear deterrence, that’s only a good thing,” Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen recently told AFP.
But he quickly added: “If you’re talking about to compensate US nuclear deterrence, that’s not realistic at this point.”
Experts nevertheless welcomed the increasingly serious political debate on an issue that has long worried military planners.
“That’s very positive, but now we need action,” Ms Heloise Fayet, of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), a contributor to the MSC report, told AFP.
The report noted that both France and Britain would face a range of challenges in growing their arsenals and extending nuclear protection across Europe – from hefty costs to tricky questions about who holds final authority to launch the warheads.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has previously raised the possibility of extending France’s nuclear umbrella across Europe, is scheduled to deliver a major speech on French nuclear doctrine at the end of February.
Mr Macron said in Munich he was considering a doctrine that could include “special cooperation, joint exercises, and shared security interests with certain key countries”. AFP

Why didn't Israel finish the job in Lebanon?

Israel's agreement to a ceasefire in Lebanon in November 2024, at a moment when Hezbollah was reeling from the blows it had sustained, is increasingly emerging as an unfathomable missed opportunity. We had a rare chance to decisively defeat the organization long regarded here as our most formidable and certainly most dangerous enemy. The paralyzing fear of Hezbollah not only cast a heavy shadow over daily life in northern Israel, it also prevented Israel, as many will recall, from acting against Iran's nuclear capabilities at the start of the previous decade.
Yet at the decisive moment, when victory over Hezbollah appeared within reach, we halted the fighting. In doing so, we effectively extended the organization a lifeline, one it has used well in the weeks and months since. The same "conceptzia" that led us to the October 7 catastrophe and seemed to have shattered in dramatic fashion that day is still alive and well. Once again, we hear that Hezbollah has been dealt a severe blow and is now deterred. Once again, we are told it no longer poses the kind of threat it did on the eve of October 7. And once again, we are advised to wait patiently until internal pressure within Lebanon forces the organization to surrender and disarm.
But a year and a half has already passed since the ill-fated decision to stop short of defeating Hezbollah. To everyone's surprise, the organization remains standing. It is actively rebuilding its strength, restoring its command structure and leadership, and rehabilitating its remaining military capabilities.
It is also increasingly clear that Hezbollah will never voluntarily disarm. The lull it has imposed on itself is temporary, intended solely to get Israel off its back so it can focus on reconstituting its power. Meanwhile, the Lebanese government, true to form, continues to issue declarations but refrains from taking meaningful action against the organization, neither in southern Lebanon nor north of the Litani River. Instead, it directs accusations at Israel, as though our actions are the reason Hezbollah has not disarmed.
Israel does carry out near-daily strikes in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah operatives, hampering its rehabilitation efforts in the south and applying indirect pressure by preventing its Shiite support base from returning to villages along the Israel-Lebanon border. Yet in the final analysis, important as these actions may be, they lack strategic weight. They are insufficient to defeat Hezbollah or even to halt its recovery.
It appears, then, that the October 7 disaster changed little among Israel's decision-makers, especially regarding the northern front. Before our half-closed eyes, Hezbollah is rebuilding its capabilities, just as Hamas, the terrorist organization in Gaza, is doing the same. Israel, meanwhile, refrains from decisive action and waits, heaven knows for what.
Little wonder, then, that amid the possibility of a US strike on Iran and the risk of broader regional escalation, concern is growing that Hezbollah could join the fight against us. It beggars belief: Hezbollah, which we supposedly struck and subdued, may resume hostilities. If so, what exactly have we accomplished over the past two years? Have we simply delayed the next round?
It is becoming ever clearer that the war that began on October 7, following Hamas' murderous terrorist assault, has not truly ended. At most, we are in a temporary pause. That is the case in Gaza, vis-à-vis Iran, and in Lebanon against Hezbollah. But if the next round is essentially a matter of time, would it not be wiser to preempt the threat and remove it before it is too late?
This question is especially relevant in the Lebanese front. There, the circumstances are more conducive to decisive Israeli action. Israel also enjoys broad legitimacy for such a move, from the US, from many in the international community and even from elements within Lebanon itself.
Perhaps it is time for someone in the upper echelons in Israel to wake up, so that in a few months or years we do not once again hear the familiar refrain: "I didn't know. I didn't hear."

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said on Saturday (local time).
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis in European labs of samples taken from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine”. The neurotoxin, secreted by dart frogs in South America, is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
A joint statement said: “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.”
The five countries said they were reporting Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was no immediate comment from the organisation.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the poisoning of Navalny shows “that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people in order to remain in power.”
The European nations’ assessment came as Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany, and just before the second anniversary of Navalny’s death.
She said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died. She has repeatedly blamed Putin for her husband’s death. Russian officials have vehemently denied the accusation.
Navalnaya said on Saturday that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof”.
“Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,” she wrote, also branding Putin “a murderer” who “must be held accountable”.
Russian authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.
European officials said they had a high degree of confidence in the assessment that Navalny died from epibatidine poisoning. Asked why the results had taken so long, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said that it had been “a complicated process”.
Wadephul said “no one but Putin’s henchmen will be able to say in detail what happened on February 16, 2024, in the Russian penal colony. But it is clear that Russian authorities had the possibility, the motive and the means to administer the poison to Navalny.”
Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020 with a nerve agent, in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.
The UK has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It accuses the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. Skripal and his daughter became seriously ill, and a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after she came across a discarded bottle with traces of the nerve agent.
A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorised at the highest level, by President Putin”.
The Kremlin has denied involvement. Russia also denied poisoning Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic who died in London in 2006, after ingesting the radioactive isotope polonium-210. A British inquiry concluded that two Russian agents killed Litvinenko, and Putin had “probably approved” the operation.

Zelensky devises election manipulations in Ukraine — Russian deputy foreign minister

MOSCOW, February 15. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky is attempting to resort to manipulations involving elections in Ukraine, including in order to remain in power, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin said in an interview with TASS.
As the diplomat noted, responding to mounting and well-founded accusations, both externally and domestically, of usurping power and pervasive corruption, Zelensky, in dialogue with the United States, the EU, the UK, and within Ukraine’s domestic information space, "has begun speculating about a willingness to organize elections and even a referendum on 'territorial issues.'"
"Zelensky’s fragile domestic political standing is forcing him already now to contemplate manipulations. It remains unclear what to do with internally displaced persons, which is an enormous number of people. Ideas are being floated to employ the 'Moldovan scenario' — to bar Ukrainian citizens residing in Russia from participating in elections and to make maximum use of diaspora votes in Western countries," he noted.
"It appears that the illegitimate, or, as some say, 'expired president,' Zelensky is working through options for preserving himself in power. Although back in 2019 he publicly promised Ukrainians to serve only five years and to do everything possible to ensure that peace would come to Ukraine. What his promises are worth, I think, is clear without any further words," Galuzin emphasized.
As the Russian deputy foreign minister recalled, in January the Ukrainian Central Election Commission presented its considerations on organizing and conducting a vote to the Verkhovna Rada. "A working group was established there to prepare for elections. However, no real, practical steps toward organizing them are being taken. Martial law remains in force, which makes elections impossible. Consequently, it is too early to discuss the involvement of any structures in electoral monitoring," Galuzin pointed out.

Opinion | More than funding, the UN needs restructuring
The UN’s financial strain is a chance to rethink its structure, cut inefficiencies and empower local work that delivers more impact
The UN is far from ideal. The secretariat and agency headquarters are massive bureaucracies, the General Assembly is widely derided as a talk shop and the Security Council is an arena for great powers to advance their national interests.
Reports on the impact of the UN’s potential collapse have focused more on the maintenance of its headquarters than on where the institution’s work is needed most. UN funding runs on two modalities – regular programme funding from member states and extrabudgetary funding.
The latter is project-specific and comes from donors, often responding to project proposals drafted by consultants, strategically contracted for no longer than 11 months to avoid the obligation of offering full-time work or project appointments with benefits. Donors can be member states or from the private sector. So, flagship programmes will survive, especially if member states see a strategic reason to keep them running.
But that’s not necessarily good news. While some programmes and projects are likely to keep going, they will be run off the backs of exploited and under-resourced consultants. A portion of extrabudgetary funding often goes to help keep the headquarters and field offices running, despite the fact that consultants are the ones implementing the programmes.
The UN is in financial straits not only because member states are not paying their dues, but also because it inefficiently siphons money destined for field operations to headquarters based in the Global North.

Regional governors must submit 2026-2027 resilience plans – Kuleba
According to Ukrinform, Deputy Prime Minister for Restoration and Minister for Communities and Territories Development Oleksii Kuleba said this on Telegram.
He noted that during a meeting with heads of regional military administrations, participants discussed a key issue – preparations for the 2026-2027 autumn and winter period and the overall resilience of critical life-support systems: heating, water supply, electricity, transport, hospitals, and social infrastructure – systems that must function even during attacks and blackouts.
Each regional military administration head must submit a resilience plan within two weeks, specifying concrete facilities, capacities, reserves, funding sources, and an implementation schedule. The plans will be submitted for approval to the president and prime minister.
"The country must get through the next winter stronger. We are working together with the government, concerned ministries, and the regions on the necessary decisions," Kuleba said.

Union leaders issue new leadership ultimatum to Starmer
Prime minister told a summit in Munich that he ‘ended the week much stronger’ than he started it after attempts to oust him from Downing Street
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The leaders of some of the UK’s largest unions have delivered a new ultimatum to Sir Keir Starmer, just days after he survived an attempt to oust him from power.
Demanding he change course or risk electoral disaster, Unite and Unison warn the party’s current trajectory undermines its “ability to win both people’s trust and elections”. They say they will band with concerned MPs to “reverse this damaging behaviour”.
The unions, which between them donate millions of pounds to the party, also hit out at Sir Keir’s decision to block his rival Andy Burnham’s return to Westminster in a by-election this month.
The warning comes just hours after Sir Keir was forced to deny he was almost “toppled” by his own MPs this week in a failed coup.
His government was plunged into crisis a fortnight ago when the extent of the contact between the UK’s former ambassador to Washington Lord Peter Mandelson and the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was revealed. Since then, the PM has lost three of his most senior staff and faced a battle to stay in post himself.
On Saturday, he insisted he had finished last week “stronger” than he started, during an appearance alongside other world leaders at the Munich Security Conference.
But now trade union leaders and and Labour MPs have written to the party’s deputy leader Lucy Powell to demand a change of direction.
As well as Mr Burnham, they hit out at Sir Keir’s decision to suspend Labour MPs for “standing up for their constituents”. Labour have in the past stripped the party whip from MPs for voting to scrap the two-child benefit cap and opposing other policies, such as welfare cuts.
Andrea Egan, Unison general secretary, said:“Shutting down party democracy has contributed to the government’s unpopularity and its failure to improve living standards. Rebuilding the coalition necessary to stop Reform must start with a more open and democratic culture in the party.”
Richard Burgon, a Labour MP and one of the coordinators of the statement, said:“Under Keir Starmer and (his now departed chief of staff) Morgan McSweeney, there has been a clampdown on the democratic rights of Labour members. This has led to a small clique making out-of-touch decisions that have left the prime minister and the government deeply unpopular - from the mess over Winter Fuel payments to the appalling decision to make Peter Mandelson the US Ambassador.
“We need an urgent end to this nasty factionalism coming from the top of the Party where the views of Labour members and trade unionists are treated with contempt.”
Steve Wright, FBU general secretary, said: “Firefighters know what happens when decisions are made without listening to those on the frontline. Restoring democracy in the Labour Party is essential if it is to reconnect with its members, its unions and the communities it exists to serve.”
In a statement the group, which includes more than 25 Labour MPs, said: “It’s increasingly clear that a narrow, factional agenda is being imposed upon the Party and that this is increasingly unpopular with the public.
“This approach is wrong in principle and damaging in practice. When the Labour Party sidelines its members, it weakens Labour’s roots in our communities, alienates voters, and undermines Labour’s ability to win both people’s trust and elections.
“We will work together to strengthen our democracy and reverse this damaging behaviour.”
A Labour Party spokesperson said: “The Labour Party is proud to be powered by our brilliant party members as we work to bring about the vital change we were elected to deliver.
“Our Labour Government is delivering for families across the country, including tackling the cost of living, cutting NHS waiting lists and restoring pride in local communities.”

Macron mourns the death of young man violently attacked at MEP Rima Hassan's event in Lyon

The young man died in hospital where he was admitted on Thursday to receive treatment for critical injuries on the fringes of an event held by LFI MEP Rima Hassan.
Quentin D, 23, has died in hospital from a traumatic brain injury after being violently attacked in Lyon on Thursday, on the sidelines of a conference by LFI MEP Rima Hassan at the Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po), the Lyon prosecutor’s office told AFP.
Quentin was a member of the security team responsible for providing security to the activists of right-wing group Collectif Némésis, as they staged a protest against the visit of the left-wing La France Insoumise (LFI) politician to the city.
The young man was very seriously injured after suffering multiple severe blows to the head. The hospital later said that Quentin was in critical condition after having sustained a concussion and was placed in a coma.
The Lyon Public Prosecutor's Office said they have launched an investigation into the incident. The attack is now being investigated under charges of aggravated manslaughter, officials said on Saturday.
Prosecutors also said the perpetrators of the attack have not yet been identified and police are continuing their efforts to locate the suspects.
Macron calls for 'calm, restraint and respect'
French President Emmanuel Macron mourned the young man's death, in a post on X expressing his condolences and sending his thoughts and "the nation's support" to his family and loved ones.
He denounced the "unprecedented outburst of violence" that led to Quentin's death, stressing that killing over ideological differences will never be justified in the French Republic.
"On the contrary, the very purpose of our institutions is to civilise debates and protect the free expression of arguments," wrote the French president.
Macron vowed to identify the perpetrators of this vicious assault and bring them to justice.
"The hatred that kills has no place among us."
The French leader ended his post by calling for calm, restraint and respect during this difficult time for the country.
Politicians of all ideologies condemned the event, with several figures from the right and far-right pointing the finger at the far-left, anti-fascist activists, and even La France Insoumise directly.
"The beating to death of Quentin by ultra-left militants is horrifying evidence of the extreme violence that reigns in the satellites that gravitate around LFI", said Bruno Retailleau, leader of The Republicans party.
"Given the seriousness of the threats and the criminal intentions clearly demonstrated, the government must consider these militias as terrorist groups", said Marine Le Pen.
"Please stop trying to implicate Rima Hassan and La France Insoumise in this tragedy", wrote Manuel Bompard, LFI coordinator, in a post on X on Saturday.
Hassan condemned the attack and said that her party's security detail were not involved.
LFI offices vandalised
Multiple LFI offices were vandalised in several regions in France following the incident on Thursday.
"Last night, our premises and offices were attacked all over the country after Retailleau and Le Pen made a call, covering up and repeating baseless accusations against the rebels by exploiting the tragedy in Lyon", said Jean-Luc Mélenchon, LFI founder and leader.
For the time being, it is not clear whether any arrests have been made. Sciences Po Lyon has not yet reacted to the incident which took place on their premises.

Children from at least seven schools hospitalised in north London measles outbreak
More than 60 measles cases have been reported in London this year

Measles infections have been confirmed across at least seven schools in north London as the NHS has warned parents to immunise their children.
Cases were confirmed across at several schools in Enfield and Haringey, according to a warning issued by Evergreen GP Surgery in Edmonton, who said that the infection was spreading.
More than 60 measles cases were reported in London since January, and labs have confirmed 34 cases of measles in Enfield since 12 January, with one in five of these children being hospitalised with the infection.
All of those affected had not been fully immunised, according to the GP surgery.
“There is no treatment for measles, only the vaccination to prevent catching it, which is part of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella (MMRV) injection,” the surgery said on the website.
“Parents should ensure that their children are up-to-date with all their immunisations. This can be done by checking the child’s immunisations ‘red book’ or contacting the practice nurse here at the GP practice.”
The MMR vaccine has been updated to also protect against chicken pox.
The outbreak comes after recent UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) figures showed that not a single childhood vaccine in England last year met the target needed to ensure diseases cannot spread among youngsters.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends at least 95 per cent of children should receive vaccine doses for each illness to achieve herd immunity.
Some 91.9 per cent of five-year-olds had received one dose of the MMR (measles, mumps & rubella) vaccine, unchanged from 2023/24 and the lowest level since 2010/11, while just 83.7 per cent of five-year-olds had received both MMR doses, the lowest level since 2009/10.
Uptake of the first MMR dose at 24 months stood at 88.9 per cent in 2024/25 – unchanged on the previous year, but again the lowest figure since 2009/10.
Last month, the WHO confirmed that measles is re-established in the UK following a plateau in vaccination coverage and a surge in cases in 2024.
Coverage for the Hib/MenC vaccine, which protects against haemophilus influenzae type B and meningitis C, stood at 88.9 per cent for children aged five, the lowest level since 2011/12.
Meanwhile, uptake of the four-in-one pre-school booster vaccine – which protects against polio, whooping cough, tetanus and diphtheria – stood at just 81.4 per cent among five-year-olds, the lowest since current data began in 2009/10.
Elsewhere, health chiefs could not give MPs on the committee a target for meeting 95 per cent coverage on vaccines or regaining measles elimination status.
Dr Mary Ramsay, director of public health programmes at UKHSA, said high vaccine coverage is one of the “main indicators” of regaining measles elimination status, “but it’s not the only one”.
“It’s largely related to how many cases of measles you have,” she said.
“We are now having lower levels, but we’re still seeing circulation of measles. So until we stop circulating measles, we’re not going to get back to elimination.”
She added that “when we have had low coverage, it’s often taken many years to get back”.

Myths about the army - through the eyes of a former businessman

Myths about the army - through the eyes of a former businessman
Vadym Zukin, AFU serviceman
Today I caught myself thinking that I've been in the army for 8 months now. During this time, I've noticed that there are many misconceptions and myths surrounding the service.
Myth 1. Everyone in the army must be perfectly healthy.
If your cholesterol is high, your vitamin D is low, your eyesight is "-2" - then you can't serve. That's what many people think. Especially women who don't want their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers let go.
The truth is that there are not many perfectly healthy people in general - and in civilian life too. Many have certain characteristics or chronic illnesses that do not prevent them from serving. The army is not a gathering of perfectly healthy people. As for the desire of women to come up with an excuse why their loved one should not go, this is a completely adequate and healthy female desire, given the stereotypes of our society and the lack of patriotic education for many years.
Myth 2. If you have children, how can you join the army?
In fact, a lot of military personnel have minor children. And many came voluntarily. Everyone makes their own decisions, and these are difficult decisions. But the argument “I have a child” doesn’t really work, because, apparently, most men in the army who are older than 30 or 35 years old have children.
Myth 3. If your experience is “not military”, then it is not needed.
Obviously, civilian experience is very different. Indeed, if in civilian life everything was relaxed and there was no need to delve into anything new, then here it will be necessary. But definitely previous experience is very useful. Of course, only when there is a struggle for independence, because in peacetime it is still much better if the army consists mostly of professional military personnel, and for civilians, patriotically minded, there will be a clear path to be a reservist with the possibility of involvement in times of danger to the country.
Myth 4. Military personnel are dirty and poorly eat.
Hygiene is a matter of personal responsibility, and many people take it very seriously. The food is different, as it is everywhere, but it certainly cannot be called “bad.” It is either average or even good.
Myth 5. Command always makes stupid decisions.
Often, a soldier sees a very limited piece of information. Command usually has a much broader picture. It's a bit like business: when you have only limited information about your piece of work, the leader's decisions seem strange. When you see more, they become clearer. This does not mean that mistakes do not happen. But reality is usually more complicated than it seems.
Myth 6. The rights of the military are massively violated, and this is the norm.
In most cases, this is simply unprofitable and dangerous for the unit itself. No commander is interested in treating his people badly. This directly affects the result, and is also quite dangerous for him himself. It is true that the power of commanders over personnel in wartime is very great. But it is also true that the abuse of this power is not beneficial to anyone.
Myth 7. “I’m not joining the army because I don’t want to die.”
In 8 months, I haven’t met a single person who would like to die. On the contrary, most people want to live. Preferably in a peaceful country. After victory or a peace treaty. But to live. And that’s why many are here.
Myth 8. The military are impudent in everyday matters.
Experience shows that the level of impudent behavior does not really depend on whether a person is a civilian or a military person. And my long stay away from Kyiv shows something else: the behavior of the military in public places is often quite restrained. Since the consequences of improper behavior can be very specific for violating the order even when not performing official duties, since this spoils the reputation of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Myth 9. Only the poor or “not very smart” join the army.
There are a lot of educated people, entrepreneurs, IT professionals, doctors, managers among the military. Many had a normal and not poor life before the service. The decision to go is not always about the lack of alternatives.
Myth 10. Those in the army greatly despise those who decided not to go, either officially or not very officially.
In fact, it is precisely in the army that there is less contempt for those who, for various reasons, did not join. For various reasons, but somehow there is no hatred felt anywhere for the rear, the reserved, the "evasive". And not to that extent, and there is no need to waste energy on unnecessary thoughts.
And now a little unexpected truth.
1. For some reason, when you're in the military, some people suddenly stop communicating. Or they start talking as if you "don't have very long left." This is quite strange, because statistically, even in the biggest wars in history, the vast majority of soldiers still survived. And whether a person was in the military or not should not affect the desire to communicate.
2. Many people think that most soldiers are constantly “running around with weapons” or “sitting in the trenches.”
In fact, only a part of them directly perform combat missions with weapons in their hands. The army is a huge system with a lot of different functions. And those who really don’t want to “go into the trenches” have many opportunities to find their application in a quieter place, but, of course, with less financial compensation.
3. The Pixel uniform is not as often seen in real life as it is in social networks in ceremonial photos.
The reality is much less ceremonial and more ordinary. Some say that “we will wear a pixel to the parade.” But I really hope that the authorities will have enough sense to abandon the strange tradition of parades after the war is over.
To be honest, the army is not a separate world or some other planet. These are the same people from the same society. With their own strengths, weaknesses, and features. Perhaps, the best thing society can do now is to avoid another line for the polarization of society, which is quite popular with Ukrainians. After all, we already have enough polar lines: Russian-speaking/Ukrainian-speaking, left/remained, voted for one presidential candidate/voted for another.

RSF's October 2025 attack on Sudan's Al Fasher killed at least 6,000 in over three days: UN

More than 6,000 people were killed in over three days when the paramilitary RSF unleashed “a wave of intense violence … shocking in its scale and brutality” in Sudan’s Darfur region in late October, according to the United Nations.
The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces’ offensive to capture the city of Al Fasher included widespread atrocities that amount to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, the UN Human Rights Office said in a report released on Friday.
“The wanton violations that were perpetrated by the RSF and allied militia in the final offensive on el-Fasher underscore that persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence,” said UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk.
The RSF and their allied militias, known as Janjaweed, overran Al Fasher, the Sudanese army’s only remaining stronghold in Darfur, on October 26 and rampaged through the city and its surroundings after more than 18 months of siege.
The 29-page UN report detailed a set of atrocities that ranged from mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment to detention and disappearances. In many cases, the attacks were ethnicity-motivated, it said.
‘Like a scene out of a horror movie’
The atrocities in Al Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur, mirror a pattern of RSF conduct in its war against the Sudanese military. The war began in April 2023 when a power struggle between the two sides exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum and elsewhere across the country.
The conflict created the world’s largest humanitarian crisis with parts of the country pushed into famine. It has also been marked by heinous atrocities which the International Criminal Court said it was investigating as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The RSF was also accused by the Biden administration of carrying out genocide in the ongoing war.
The UN Human Rights Office said it documented the killing of at least 4,400 people inside Al Fasher between October 25 and October 27, while more than 1,600 others were killed as they were trying to flee the RSF rampage. The report said it drew its toll from interviews with 140 victims and witnesses which were “are consistent with independent analysis of contemporaneous satellite imagery and video footage”.
In one case, RSF fighters opened fire from heavy weapons on a crowd of 1,000 people sheltering in the Rashid dormitory in Al Fasher university on October 26, killing around 500 people, the report said. One witness was quoted as saying that he saw bodies thrown into the air, “like a scene out of a horror movie,” according to the report.
In another case, around 600 people, including 50 children, were executed on October 26 while taking shelter in the university facilities, the report said.
The report, however, warned that the actual scale of the death toll of the week-long offensive in Al Fasher was “undoubtedly significantly higher.”
The toll does not include at least 460 people who were killed by the RSF on October 28 when they stormed the Saudi Maternity hospital, according to the World Health Organization.
Around 300 people were also killed in RSF shelling and drone attacks between October 23 and October 24 in the Abu Shouk camp for displaced people, 2.5 kilometres (1.5 miles) northwest of Al Fasher, the UN Human Rights Office’ report said.
Women and girls sexually assaulted
Sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, was apparently widespread during Al Fasher offensive, with RSF fighters and their allied militias targeting women and girls from the African Zaghawa tribes over allegations of having links or supporting the military, the report said.
Turk, who visited Sudan last month, said survivors of sexual violence recounted testimonies that showed how the practice “was systematically used as a weapon of war”.
The paramilitaries also abducted many people while attempting to flee the city, before releasing them after paying ramson.
The UN Human Rights Office also said it documented 10 detention facilities used by the paramilitaries in Al Fasher, including the Children’s Hospital which was turned into a detention centre. Several thousands of people remain missing and unaccounted for, the report said.
The pattern of the RSF offensive on Al Fasher was a mirror of other attacks by the paramilitaries and their allies on the Zamzam camp for displaced people, 15 kilometres (9 miles) south of the city, and on West Darfur’s city of Geneina and the nearby town of Ardamata in 2023, the UN Human Rights Office said.
Turk said there were “reasonable grounds” that RSF and their allied militias committed war crimes, and that their acts also amount to crimes against humanity.
He called for holding those responsible — including commanders — accountable, warning that “persistent impunity fuels continued cycles of violence”.

European allies say Navalny was poisoned by dart frog toxin; Russia rejects claims
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON, Feb 14 - Five European allies on Saturday blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, a claim Moscow rejected as propaganda.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to the Russian state's TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: "One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog."
Britain on Saturday said the poisoning demonstrated "an alarming pattern of behaviour". The country held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.
"When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by TASS.
"Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues," the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger "officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia".
The British government declined to comment to a Reuters query about how the samples from Navalny's body were obtained or where they were assessed. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper told reporters that "UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth" on Navalny's death.
SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF NAVALNY'S DEATH
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.
His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference and she called for Putin to be held accountable.
"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof ... I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth," she said on social media while attending this year's Munich conference on Saturday.
The Russian embassy spokesperson said the European allies' move was "not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead."
"Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace - a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign," the spokesperson added.
Saturday's statement from the European allies, almost exactly two years after Navalny's death, said Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the poison as Navalny died in prison.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the joint statement said.
His death was followed by memorial gatherings and protests across Europe, with demonstrators in cities including London, Berlin, Vilnius and Rome condemning the Kremlin and demanding accountability.
The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for "its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention." REUTERS

Trump, Netanyahu agreed US should press Iran to cut oil sales to China, Axios reports

- US and Israeli leaders agreed, Axios reported, to reduce Iran's oil exports to China under "maximum pressure".
- China buys over 80% of Iran's oil, so reducing trade would significantly lower Iran's oil revenue.
- US held nuclear talks but also positioned a naval flotilla, preparing for potential sustained military operations against Iran.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed at a White House meeting on Feb 11
"We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China," Axios reported on Feb 14, quoting a senior US official.
China accounts for more than 80 per cent of Iran's oil exports.
Any reduction in that trade would mean lower oil revenue for Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held nuclear talks through Omani mediators last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after the US president positioned a naval flotilla in the region as the American military prepares for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran. REUTERS

Lindsey Vonn shares health update on latest surgery and plans to return to US
Vonn ustained a "complex tibia fracture" during an Olympic downhill event last Sunday
- Bookmark
Lindsey Vonn said Saturday that her latest surgery on the left leg she broke in the Olympic downhill “went well” and she “will be able to finally go back to the U.S.”
The 41-year-old skier is receiving treatment at a hospital in Treviso.
Vonn sustained a "complex tibia fracture" during an Olympic downhill event last Sunday, crashing just 13 seconds into her run before being airlifted from the course.
She stated on Monday that the injury "will require multiple surgeries to fix properly," later announcing a "successful" third operation on Wednesday.
Nine days before Sunday’s crash, Vonn ruptured the ACL in her left knee in another crash. Even before then, all eyes had been on her as the feel-good story heading into the Olympics for her comeback after nearly six years of retirement.
“I have been reading a lot of messages and comments saying that what has happened to me makes them sad,” Vonn said on Instagram. “Please, don’t be sad. Empathy, love and support I welcome with an open heart, but please not sadness or sympathy. I hope instead it gives you strength to keep fighting, because that is what I am doing and that is what I will continue to do. Always.
“When I think back on my crash, I didn’t stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences. I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk.”
Vonn’s father, Alan Kildow, told The Associated Press on Monday that his daughter will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision.
But Vonn concluded her latest message by saying she is “still looking forward to the moment when I can stand on the top of the mountain once more. And I will.”

Trump’s ‘desire’ to own Greenland persists, says Danish PM

- Danish PM Mette Frederiksen believes US President Trump still wants to own Greenland, despite recent threats being dialled back.
- Trump's desire for mineral-rich Greenland caused US-Europe tension, as he sees it vital for US/NATO security against Russia and China.
- A US-Denmark-Greenland working group formed to discuss Arctic security concerns. Denmark states "red lines" for Greenland's autonomy will not be crossed.
AI generated
MUNICH, Germany - Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Feb 14 she believed US President Donald Trump still desires to own Greenland despite dialling back his recent threats to seize it by force.
Asked at a security conference in Munich if Mr Trump still wanted to own the Arctic island, Ms Frederiksen said: “Unfortunately, I think the desire is the same.”
Mr Trump’s designs on Greenland
In January, he backed down from his threats to seize the island, an autonomous territory of ally Denmark, after striking what he called a “framework” deal
But relations have remained strained.
“Everybody asks us, do we think it’s over? I mean, no, we don’t think it’s over,” Ms Frederiksen said, participating in a panel discussion on Arctic security.
Mr Trump insists mineral-rich Greenland is vital for US and NATO security against Russia and China as a melting Arctic opens up and the superpowers jostle for strategic advantage.
Ms Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Mr Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said the pressure on the island’s people was “unacceptable”.
But Mr Nielsen said “some steps” had been taken “in the right direction”.
A US-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington’s security concerns in the Arctic, but details have not been made public.
“We now have a working group, it’s good. We will try to see if we can find a solution... But of course, there are red lines that will not be crossed. And we will stick to our strategy,” Ms Frederiksen said.
The remarks came after Ms Frederiksen and Mr Nielsen had a 15-minute meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Feb 13 on the sidelines of the security conference, which Ms Frederiksen afterwards described as “constructive”. AFP

Zelensky accepts Munich Security Conference award on behalf of Ukrainian people
According to an Ukrinform correspondent, the award ceremony took place at the Munich Residence on Saturday evening.
"I'm very proud to be here and it's a great honor for me. I'm very proud to have such friends and to be the president of Ukraine, of our people, our great nation. I thank Germany and your people who are supporting us from the very beginning of the full-scale war," Zelensky said during the ceremony.
The Ukrainian leader stressed that Germany is currently the country providing the largest volume of assistance to Ukraine. In particular, Zelensky highlighted Germany's contribution to building a critically important air defense system amid Russian strikes on energy infrastructure and civilian facilities.
The Ewald von Kleist Award, established by the founder of the Munich Security Conference, Ewald von Kleist-Schmenzin, has been presented since 2009 for outstanding contributions to international cooperation and conflict resolution.
Earlier, the Chairman of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, announced that the 2026 award would go to the Ukrainian people, who have been fighting for their freedom, independence, and dignity for more than ten years.

Azerbaijan's president accuses Russia of 'deliberate attack' on country's embassy in Ukraine
Russia deliberately targeted Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure and embassy during attacks against Ukraine, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14.
The comments came on the same day Aliyev met with President Volodymyr Zelensky, who addressed the conference and held talks with various leaders in Munich.
Aliyev's remarks also highlight the growing strain in Russia–Azerbaijan relations, despite recent efforts by Moscow and Baku to normalize ties.
"There were three attacks on the energy infrastructure of Azerbaijan in Ukraine, and there were also three attacks on the Azerbaijani embassy in Ukraine," Aliyev told the independent media outlet Ukrainska Pravda in Munich.
"After the first attack, we could assume that it was accidental, and we gave our Russian colleagues all the coordinates of the diplomatic missions of Azerbaijan, including the consular department, our cultural centers, and everything else. Despite this, two more attacks took place. So it was a deliberate attack on the diplomatic mission of Azerbaijan."
The reported strikes come amid Russia's all-out assault on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, an ongoing campaign that intensified in fall 2025 as temperatures began to plunge. In November, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to voice a "strong protest" after the Azerbaijani Embassy in Kyiv was damaged by an Iskander-type missile in a Russian aerial attack.
Previously, in August 2025, Azerbaijian's Embassy in Kyiv suffered damage due to a Russian strike. That same month, a Russian drone attack also damaged a diesel pipeline and injured four workers at an Azerbaijan State Oil Company (SOCAR) depot in Odesa Oblast. Another attack that summer targeted a gas distribution station near Orlivka, part of the Trans-Balkan pipeline that began carrying Azerbaijani gas to Ukraine in July.
Azerbaijan's honorary consulate in Kharkiv also suffered damage in March 2022, shortly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.
Azerbaijan has maintained a neutral stance in the Russia-Ukraine war, balancing its long-standing partnership with Moscow while offering humanitarian and energy assistance to Kyiv. Following Aliyev and Zelensky's meeting on Feb. 14, the Presidential Office said that Azerbaijan "is ready to deepen cooperation" with Ukraine.
"The leaders discussed the development of bilateral relations and the implementation of projects in the energy sector," the Presidential Office said. "Azerbaijan is interested in them and is ready to deepen cooperation. Volodymyr Zelensky and Ilham Aliyev agreed that the teams would work out all necessary issues."
Aliyev also told Ukrainska Pravda that Baku sees Moscow's recent strikes as hostile.
Russia's actions are "of course, regarded as an unfriendly step towards Azerbaijan," he said.

Destanee Aiava announces retirement, calls out online trolls and 'racist' tennis culture
In short:
Destanee Aiava has announced her retirement from tennis in an explosive social media post.
The 25-year-old called out online trolls, while also claiming the sport had a "culture that’s racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn’t fit the mould".
Aiava last played at the Australian Open, where she was knocked out with Maddison Inglis in the first round of the women's doubles.
Australian tennis player Destanee Aiava says 2026 will be her last year in professional tennis, announcing her impending retirement in an expletive-laden statement on social media.
Aiava, 25, described tennis as her "toxic boyfriend", while also calling out a culture in the sport she said is "racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn't fit its mould".
The Victorian did not make the main singles draw of January's Australian Open, and was eliminated with partner Maddison Inglis in the first round of the women's doubles.
Aiava has not played since the Australian Open, which will now be her last home slam.
In a post to social media on Saturday evening, Aiava said she had trusted the wrong people early in her career, something she was unable to overcome.
"2026 will be my final year on tour playing professional tennis," Aiava wrote.
"From the moment I had my first lesson at Casey Tennis Club, my entire life was tennis. I often wondered what my life would have looked like if I'd chosen anything else and whether everything I sacrificed for this sport was actually worth the cost.
"There was a time in my career when I had reached the point that comes just before you make your big breakthrough, when the world is at your feet and nothing can touch you.
"I was only 17, unprepared and dangerously naive to the consequences of trusting the wrong people.
"The trajectory of my career was never the same after that."
The 25-year-old said she kept playing tennis because she believed it was owed to herself and "everyone who had helped me throughout my career".
Aiava called tennis "my toxic boyfriend", stating she did not know what her passions were outside of the sport.
But the most explosive aspects of her retirement post were reserved for those Aiava claimed "made me feel less than".
"I want to say a ginormous f*** you to everyone in the tennis community who’s ever made me feel less than," she wrote.
"F*** you to every single gambler who's sent me hate or death threats.
"F*** you to the people who sit behind screens on social media, commenting on my body, my career or whatever the f*** they want to nitpick."
Aiava has been vocal about online abuse in the past.
After losing in this year's Australian Open qualifiers, she shared a comment that had been left on her page, which addressed her ability and body image.
She also dealt with comments about her appearance following her breakthrough performance at the 2025 Australian Open, where she made it to the second round.
In a video addressing online abuse published in January, the Victorian said she had dealt with the trolling for years.
"The way that people think it's OK just because someone is a public figure, that they comment this s***? F***ing disgusting," she said in January.
"Body shaming is not a f***ing opinion, and neither is bullying."
On Saturday, Aiava said she was proud to have represented the Pasifika community on the international tennis stage.
Aiava has a New Zealand-born father, Mark, whose parents were Samoan, while her mother Rosie was born in American Samoa.
She called out a culture in tennis that she called "hostile" to people like her.
"And f*** you to a sport that hides behind so-called class and gentlemanly values," she wrote.
"Behind the white outfits and traditions is a culture that's racist, misogynistic, homophobic and hostile to anyone who doesn’t fit the mould."
Aiava is currently ranked number 321 in the WTA, with a career high of 147.
She won 10 singles titles on the women's ITF tour, the last coming in Brisbane in 2024.
"Life is not meant to be lived in misery or half assed," Aiava wrote on Saturday.
"My ultimate goal is to be able to wake up everyday and genuinely say I love what I do — which I think everyone deserves the chance at.
"I'm 25, turning 26 this year and I feel so far behind everyone else, like I'm starting from scratch. I'm also scared. But that's better than living a life that's misaligned, or being around constant comparison and losing yourself."

LUGANSK, February 14. /TASS/. International Reporters journalist Vincenzo Lorusso, who operates in Donbass, has expressed his aspiration to acquire Russian citizenship. Speaking to TASS, Lorusso emphasized that holding a Russian passport would provide him with greater peace of mind.
"Yes, of course, it's my wish - more precisely, my dream - to obtain Russian citizenship," he stated. "Having Russian citizenship would allow me to work with a sense of security, especially given the political pressures I face. The Vice-President of the European Parliament has already twice called for sanctions against me and submitted a dossier to Kaja Kallas, head of the EU External Action Service, requesting EU sanctions. Additionally, the Ukrainian ambassador to Italy has urged Italian mayors not to allow me to speak at conferences or participate in online debates," he explained to TASS.
Lorusso clarified that his primary goal as a journalist working in Donbass is "to maintain a bridge of friendship between Italy and Russia, promoting people-to-people diplomacy."
"Beyond my personal desire for peace of mind, I love Russia - its history, its people, its culture and literature. I consider Russophobia a crime that must be confronted. It moves me deeply when I see the Russian tricolor flying. That flag is in my heart and always will be, but I would very much like it to be reflected on my official documents as well," he added.
In February, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Irina Volk announced that Lorusso had been granted a residence permit.

BrewDog could be broken up as craft beer business put up for sale

The beer-maker BrewDog could be broken up after consultants were called in to help find new investors.
The Scotland-based brewer, which makes craft beer such as Punk IPA and Elvis Juice, has appointed consultants AlixPartners to oversee the sale process.
BrewDog last month announced it was closing its distilling brands, prompting concerns for jobs at its facility in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
The company, which was founded in 2007 by friends James Watt and Martin Dickie, said it made the decision to focus on its beer products.
No decision has been made in respect of the sale process.
A spokesperson for BrewDog said: “As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company.
“Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.
“This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.”
The spokesperson added: “BrewDog remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No 1 independent brewer in the UK and with a highly engaged global community.
“We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.
“Our breweries, bars, and venues continue to operate as normal. We will not comment on any further speculation.”
The company announced job cuts across the business in October last year after posting a £37m loss.
BrewDog operates 72 bars around the world, as well as four breweries.
The firm employs about 1,400 people and has breweries in Ellon, as well as in the US, Australia and Germany.

From competition to communication: Removing the strategic games in relationships - comment
Unknown

After nearly 25 years, I can’t remember how many people have tried to give me the “perfect advice” for finding a partner.
“Just be yourself!”
“Don’t tell them how much you read; it’s scary.”
“Put yourself out there!”
“Maybe a little more makeup?”
So when I was handed a copy of the 2006 book Why Men Marry Bitches, by Sherry Argov, I figured, what do I have to lose? After all, I am indeed – depending on whom you ask – a bitch myself, so I thought maybe I’d learn something.
Contrary to its title, this book is not “A woman’s guide to winning her man’s heart.” It is a rule book for the most ridiculous games men and women play with each other instead of just having a single conversation.
Less than 50 pages in, you get this gem: Don’t even mention the word “commitment.” The less you say about it, the closer you are to getting it.
What? Were men in the early aughts really so terrified of admitting they liked someone? Why do relationships need to be treated like a chess match, where you need to maintain the upper hand?
The book has an entire chart about how long to wait between phone calls so you don’t accidentally reveal that maybe you’re interested in more than a situationship.
The idea that you should tell a partner to “Please give me the same courtesy that you would give to a client you work with” was one that really blew me away because, for the record, if my future person is out there: dear God, don’t.
The strategy of dating
To be fair to Argov, Why Men Marry Bitches was publishing gold in 2006 because it spoke directly to the anxieties of its moment.
This was peak strategic dating era, when the books Sex and the City had women analyzing every phone call like CIA operatives; when He’s Just Not That Into You convinced us that men were simple creatures whose feelings could be decoded with the right manual; when The Rules still cast a long shadow over how women approached relationships.
The underlying philosophy was pure game theory: Relationships were fundamentally adversarial, and you needed a competitive edge to win. Being “too available” signaled desperation. Showing genuine interest meant losing leverage. Vulnerability wasn’t intimacy – it was tactical weakness.
Women consumed these books religiously because we’d been taught that love was something you strategized your way into, that the right combination of aloofness and intrigue would unlock commitment.
Women needed instruction manuals because they’d been sold the idea that honesty, directness, and emotional transparency were relationship repellents.
Reading Argov’s advice now feels like watching someone describe an elaborate heist, when you could just knock on the door.
The shift to healthy relationships
The entire premise – that you need to strategically withhold parts of yourself to seem valuable – contradicts everything we’ve (hopefully) learned about healthy relationships. We talk about attachment styles now, not manipulation tactics. We value emotional availability, not calculated distance. The idea of performing cool indifference for months or years sounds genuinely exhausting when you could just communicate like adults.
Beyond the sheer effort required, the book’s framework feels archaic in its assumptions. It presumes a rigidly heteronormative dynamic where men chase, and women gatekeep, where traditional gender roles are so fixed that they can be gamed like a predictable algorithm.
It completely misses that good relationships aren’t about winning – they’re about finding someone who enthusiastically chooses you without needing to be tricked into it. The “power” Argov promises isn’t actually power; it’s performing a character until someone proposes to your act instead of to you.
That’s not a victory. That’s a setup for years of wondering when he’ll figure out you’ve been pretending all along.
Maybe the saddest thing about Why Men Marry Bitches isn’t the advice itself; it’s that millions of women bought it – and truly, it’s part of why I read the book to begin with – because we genuinely feared that being ourselves was too much; that our authentic enthusiasm, our emotional honesty, our desire for partnership, would scare men away.
Twenty years later, we’re finally learning what actual power looks like: showing up as yourself and trusting that the right person won’t need a performance.

Valentine’s Day 2026: The aphrodisiac myth that could spoil your romantic dinner

Oysters, exotic spices, chocolate desserts and a glass of champagne are Valentine’s Day staples, long associated with whispers of aphrodisiac power.
However, according to medical experts, romance may owe more to atmosphere than to ingredients.
“The belief that aphrodisiac foods exist is ancient and present in every culture, but currently there is numerous scientific evidence that refutes it,” experts from the online anti-hoax platform “Doctor, but is it true that…?” said in a Valentine’s Day note. The platform is curated by the National Federation of Orders of Physicians, Surgeons and Dentists (Fnomceo).
“It is not necessary to avoid foods like chili pepper or chocolate on Valentine’s Day, but it is good not to expect miracles.”
Can foods really increase desire or physical pleasure?
The term “aphrodisiac,” derived from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love, refers to foods or substances believed to increase desire and physical pleasure. Yet, experts stress that such claims lack scientific grounding.
For a substance to truly merit the label, they explain, it would need to increase blood flow to organs involved in sexual response, stimulate physical and psychological sensitivity, influence hormones regulating desire and pleasure, and produce a rapid effect after a single intake.
“Such results,” they note, “are sometimes achievable with pharmacological therapy or psychotherapy.” Food, however, does not meet that standard.
Chili pepper, often cited because of its capsaicin content, has recognized anti-inflammatory, digestive and analgesic properties - but no proven aphrodisiac effect. Oysters are rich in zinc, a mineral associated with testosterone production, yet there is no scientific evidence linking them to improved male sexual function.
Cocoa can raise levels of serotonin and phenylethylamine, hormones associated with pleasure and satisfaction, but meaningful effects would require unhealthy quantities. And while alcohol may appear to lower inhibitions, doctors warn that as blood alcohol levels rise, bodily functions - including those related to sexual performance - are actually depressed, with possible consequences such as erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation.
In the end, experts suggest, Valentine’s Day magic is more likely to come from connection than from the menu.

Rabbi Shmuel Yerish: From teaching in Ukraine to creating Jewish kids' toys in Hadera
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

20:51:30 UTC
05:51:30 KST

‘My name is Shmuel. I am the father of 15 children, ages one to 20. Three years ago, I made aliyah from Ukraine to Hadera with nothing. With zero dollars in my pocket. Here, I started a brand producing toys connected with Jewish tradition.”
With an intro like that, it was abundantly clear that Rabbi Shmuel Yerish has a fascinating story to tell.
Let’s start with his brand, Reb Shmuel Toys (rebshmueltoys@gmail.com).
From Rachel and Leah dolls (Leah has glasses because of the verse describing her “weak eyes”), to a Yetziat Mitzrayim (Exodus from Egypt) play set, to portable play tents resembling the Holy Temple or 770 Eastern Parkway (Lubavitch headquarters in Brooklyn, New York), Reb Shmuel’s toys are produced in China – some items are now starting to be manufactured in Israel – and are sold in Israel through social networks, communities, and kindergartens.
Everything has a Jewish twist and is designed with real kids in mind.
Inspiration for toys comes from personal experience
“The ideas for toys come from my vast experience as a teacher and a father,” Yerish says. “The biggest difficulty was taking the first step, choosing the path of an entrepreneur. Like Nachshon ben Aminadav” – whom a rabbinic legend credits with walking into the Red Sea as an act of faith even before it parted – “I moved forward step by step, with only the desire. I had experience creating board games in Ukraine, but building my own brand would be a completely different experience.”
This 48-year-old Jewish educator, event coordinator, and game developer also runs children’s birthday parties and stars in his original one-man musical, Better To Be Jewish. In true Lubavitch style, he calls himself Shaliach Simcha (“emissary of joy”).
Ukraine was still part of the Soviet Union when he was born in 1977, so he knew nothing about Judaism except that he was Jewish. Once the Iron Curtain fell, when he was 14, his Jewish identity and knowledge blossomed.
“I was the coordinator and one of the leaders of the wonderful Hillel organization in Odessa. On my first trip to Israel, near the Kotel, they put tefillin on me for the first time. And they told me to recite the “Shema” before bed. Well, what do you think the chances are that a secular guy would start doing that? And yet, I started reading the first line, then the second, and so on.”
After graduating from a technical college in Odessa, he learned in a yeshiva and then a Chabad kollel (yeshiva for married men) after marrying Chana Gitl in 2004. He received his rabbinic ordination at the kollel in 2010.
“I worked as a teacher and vice principal in a Talmud Torah and realized that Jewish education should be brought directly into people’s homes,” he says. “I worked for five years as a cash-register technician, but later fully devoted my life to Jewish education.”
Meanwhile, his wife became a world expert in the study of Chabad nigunim (melodies) and began presenting concerts, lectures, and master classes. In Israel, she teaches at a music school and gives private piano lessons. The couple and their children “more or less spoke Hebrew before making aliyah – we read books and understood it to some degree.”
It goes without saying that the idea of relocating to Israel became more of an imperative following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Yerish’s parents came to the same conclusion and made aliyah that year as well, all with the assistance of the Jewish Agency. They had some distant relatives in Israel.
“The war in Ukraine removed the last bit of doubt,” Yerish says. “Security was the last deterrent. But when I found myself in Israel and experienced its war, I realized it was a war at home. And it felt different. Moreover, I didn’t want to choose between Ukraine and Russia. I chose to be Jewish, and Israel is our land.”
The process was not easy, especially with a large family to uproot from one country and resettle in another, but Yerish saw a divine hand guiding everything. “Absolutely, it was like the Exodus from Egypt. The number of miracles was overwhelming.”
One of these “miracles” occurred at the airport in Berlin, a stop along the way. The Jewish Agency had not informed the Yerish family that they’d need COVID-related paperwork in order to get on the plane to Israel. Airport officials told them to fill out forms for each member of the family. And the only way to do it was one by one, on their phones.
“My wife and I only had two phones. And they wouldn’t let us on the plane until we finished filling out the forms. My pregnant wife, I, and our 13 children were stuck between two worlds. We spent the night on the floor at the airport. I filled out all the forms that night. Well, in the morning, through the highest connections, they got us tickets for the morning flight. The plane waited for us for a whole hour. And we flew to Israel,” he recounts.
When asked why the family chose to live in Hadera, Yerish answers, “The reason was simple. We found a suitable place to live, and as it turned out, the city was perfect for us.”
He is grateful that “here in Israel you can live a full Jewish life, without judgment or reproach.”
And now, with two more additions to the family since their arrival, Yerish says his challenge is to scale up his Reb Shmuel Toys production to make it a profitable business. He has also started making Jewish community games and is participating in a tender from the Diaspora Ministry for social programs featuring Jewish identity.
He says, “There is a Mishnaic saying that inspires me: ‘If I am not for myself, who will be for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?’”

Pakistan captain says it is up to India to decide whether to shake hands at the T20 World Cup
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha says it is up to India's players to decide if they will shake hands with his team before and after Sunday's much-anticipated T20 World Cup clash

Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha says it is up to India’s players to decide whether they will shake hands with his team before and after Sunday’s much-anticipated T20 World Cup match.
Political and diplomatic tensions between the two nations have often boiled over on to the cricket field. The game in Colombo will be the first time they have met since last year's acrimonious Asia Cup tournament in the United Arab Emirates won by India and where players refused to shake hands.
Pakistan's government threatened a boycott of Sunday's match after the International Cricket Council kicked Bangladesh out of the World Cup for refusing to play matches in India, citing security concerns.
Pakistan only agreed to play after intense discussions with the ICC. The fixture is the major revenue earner for the ICC.
Tensions came to a head in the Asia Cup when India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused to shake hands with Agha. Heated moments followed between the two sides throughout the tournament, with Suryakumar and Pakistan's Haris Rauf fined for breaching the ICC's code of conduct.
India went on to win the Asia Cup but refused to accept the trophy from Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi.
“The game should be played in real spirit, the way it has been played since it started. The rest is up to them (India), what they want to do,” Agha told media on Saturday about the possibility of the players shaking hands.
Suryakumar, for his part, was non-committal.
“Why are you highlighting that?” Suryakumar asked reporters. “We are here to play cricket. We will play good cricket. We will take all those calls tomorrow. We will see tomorrow.”
Political and military tensions have meant the two teams have not played a bilateral series for years.
India has not traveled to Pakistan since 2008 and Pakistan visited India for the 50-over World Cup in 2023 but has since played ICC tournaments at neutral venues.
India has defeated Pakistan 12 times in the 16 T20 games they have played. It also has an impressive 6-1 record in the eight T20 World Cup matches since the first edition in 2007, with one being tied.
“We don’t have a good record against them in World Cups," Agha said. "But whenever you come to play a new match, it’s a new day and you have to play good cricket to win.
“You can’t change history. You can learn from it. We learned from it and we’ll try to do a good performance tomorrow and win the match.”
Suryakumar also said his players will put history behind them because past memories can lead to complacency.
Pakistan spinner Usman Tariq's bowling action has been the subject of discussion in recent days.
The Indian media has questioned whether Tariq's action is legal because he pauses before delivering the ball.
“The guy has been cleared twice and he has done whatever the ICC said, and whatever it requires to bowl in international cricket,” Agha said of Tariq. “I don’t know why people are saying so many things about him, but the one thing I can assure you, he doesn’t care about that because he’s very used to this stuff."
India's aggressive opening batter Abhishek Sharma’s health has also been the subject of discussion after he missed the match against Namibia due to a stomach infection.

Jordan Stolz, Double Olympic Champion at 21, Could Already Be the Speedskating GOAT
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

05:50:27 KST

Before the 500-m men’s event at the Milano Speed Skating Stadium on Saturday, American Olympic champion Jordan Stolz, who won the 1000-m race here three nights ago, had a conversation with Bob Corby, his coach. Corby reminded Stolz that even if his start time in this sprint trailed his competition, the race would be won on the backstretch. “So you’ve got to burn, like you’ve never burned before,” Corby said. “And then everything will be fine.”
Stolz brought the required fire to the Olympic ice, again, and he’s now a double-Olympic champ. He set a new Olympic record in the 500, finishing the race in 33.77 seconds, .11 seconds ahead of Dutch speedskater Jenning de Boo, with whom he was paired on the oval. The rivals also dueled in the 500, and de Boo finished second there too, behind Stolz, who also set an Olympic best-ever time in the 1,000.

After crossing the finish line and looking up at the board to see his second-place time, a frustrated de Boo clutched his head, fell, and slid into the padded wall of the track, which seemed fitting. While back-to-back silvers are no small accomplishment, against Stolz, the Dutchman can’t seem to catch a break.
“I have a bit more of a bitter taste in my mouth than in the 1,000 meters, because I think the 500 is my best distance,” says de Boo, 22, who was not injured in his fall. “So this would have been the distance I should have done it at.”
Stolz’s time was also the fastest-ever 500 on sea level. The world record of 33.61 seconds, set by Russia’s Pavel Kulizhnikov in 2019, was in altitude, in a World Cup Final in Salt Lake City. Stolz is the first American Olympian to win two individual gold medals at a single Winter Games in 32 years; Bonnie Blair doubled in the 500 and 1,000 as well. Stolz is expected to win the 1,500 m on Feb. 19. If he pulls that off, a victory in the Feb. 21 mass start would give him four gold medals, just one short of American Eric Heiden’s record for most golds by a men’s speedskater at a single Olympics.
At least one competitor is already anointing Stolz, a seven-time world champ who’s just 21— and only halfway through the Olympic program in Milan—the best ever. “I think Jordan's the greatest speedskater of all-time,” says Canada’s Laurent Dubreuil, who briefly held the Olympic record on Saturday, with a time of 34.26 seconds. But three pairs later, Stolz and de Boo both broke the 34-second barrier. Dubreuil finished with the bronze.
“Not a lot of guys open faster than him, and all those that do just die after 3[00], 400 meters,” says Dubreuil. “And he's the huge favorite for the 1,500. If I raced a 1,500, I would finish last and wouldn't even probably medal against the women. Because I'm training for 500. I'm just a sprinter. He's good at everything. That's what's incredible. His ability to put power in the ice when all the other top sprinters are dead. It's unbelievable to watch, but it's not something I think we can copy. He’s just physically superior to us.”
After receiving his gold atop the podium, Stolz walked underneath the stands and embraced Heiden, who was at the race—as was Simone Biles, another GOAT. He also hugged his parents, Dirk and Jane, and his older sister Hannah. Stolz showed his family his newest hardware.
Hannah, older by a year, and Jordan both started skating on their family’s backyard frozen pond in Kewaskum, Wisconsin, after the 2010 Olympics; they loved watching Apolo Ohno at those Games. By all accounts, Hannah was the better skater at first. They competed with each other on the pond, and on hunting and fishing trips. Hannah stopped skating, however, and pursued bird taxidermy. She’s won a national taxidermy title and placed third at a recent world championship.
She’s still competing with little bro. “When I got third in the world championships with taxidermy, my medal and plaque was bigger than all of his World Championship medals,” says Hannah. “And heavier up until he got these gold medals. I wish I would have brought my medal, because we could compare them and really figure out whose is actually bigger. But I think this might have me on the weight.”
Backstage after the race, Heiden joked that he was thankful Stolz won’t suit up for the team pursuit, ensuring that Stolz can’t leave with more than four golds, thus keeping Heiden’s record intact. “Well, makes me want to do it now,” Stolz quipped back, when relayed Heiden’s remarks.
Heiden is widely regarded as the GOAT of his sport, a sort of Michael Jordan-like figure on the ice. But if people like Dubreuil want to throw Stolz in that conversation, it appears Heiden himself wouldn’t object.
“I'm proud to be mentioned in the same sentence as Jordan Stolz,” says Heiden. “That kid’s a stud.”

Syria says talks with Israel aim to stop interference, not accept terms imposed by force in south
Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani says negotiations seek Israeli withdrawal from areas entered after fall of Assad regime and end to strikes and airspace violations
ISTANBUL
Syria’s foreign minister said talks with Israel are aimed at ending Israeli interference and military actions in southern Syria, not at accepting a new reality imposed by force.
Speaking at a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Asaad al-Shaibani said Syria had adopted a “realistic path” towards Israel focused on reconstruction and national recovery following the Dec. 8, 2024 fall of the Assad regime.
He said that since then, Syria has faced more than 1,000 Israeli airstrikes targeting civilian and military facilities, as well as ground incursions and new territorial advances in the south.
Damascus chose diplomacy to address the situation and, with US support, brought Israel to direct negotiations, he added.
“These negotiations will not lead to accepting the fait accompli imposed by Israel in southern Syria,” he said. “Their outcome should be Israel’s withdrawal from areas it entered after Dec. 8, an end to interference in Syria’s internal affairs, and a halt to airspace violations.”
He added that security must be mutual. “Whoever seeks to preserve their own security must also respect the security of others,” he said, adding that Syria remains open in this regard.
Asked whether the current Israeli government is responsive to these demands, Shaibani said Israel is overstating perceived threats.
“I believe this approach is a mistake,” he said. “The policy you pursue could become the greatest risk to yourself.” He added that Israel would not be able to evade “Syria’s realistic approach.”
The top Syrian diplomat also cited US support for security discussions, mentioning President Donald Trump and Washington’s backing of talks.
Israeli forces have been carrying out near-daily incursions into Syrian territory, particularly in rural areas of Quneitra, detaining civilians, setting up checkpoints, questioning those passing through, and destroying farmland.
The developments came despite an agreement reached by Syria and Israel on Jan. 6 to establish a US-supervised communication mechanism aimed at coordinating information sharing, reducing military escalation, engaging diplomatically, and exploring trade opportunities.
After the fall of the Assad regime, Israel expanded its occupation of Syria’s Golan Heights by seizing the demilitarized buffer zone in violation of a 1974 disengagement agreement.
Syrians say the continued Israeli violations are undermining efforts to restore stability and hindering government attempts to attract investment to improve the country’s economy.

Children playing in a forest near Jerusalem discovered what appeared to be human skeletal remains Friday evening, police said on Saturday.
The remains were found in a wooded area adjacent to the Pisgat Ze’ev neighborhood in northern Jerusalem shortly before the start of the Jewish Sabbath.
According to police, the children told their father about the bones they had found, and he alerted authorities.
Officers who searched the scene located additional evidence, including a foreign passport. Police said they are examining whether there is any connection between the passport and the remains.
The human remains and other items recovered at the scene were transferred to the National Center for Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv for examination and identification, police said.

Four new astronauts arrive via SpaceX rocket at International Space Station

The International Space Station (ISS) returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.
SpaceX delivered the US, French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.
Last month’s medical evacuation was Nasa’s first in 65 years of human spaceflight. One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running – one American and two Russians – prompting Nasa to pause spacewalks and trim research.
Moving in for eight to nine months are Nasa’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot, and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have visited the ISS before. During her first space station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.
Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to visit space. Hathaway is a captain in the US navy.
Nasa has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on 7 January or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at a hospital before returning to Houston.
The space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.

US House speaker blames Democrats for partial shutdown at Homeland Security Department

US House speaker blames Democrats for partial shutdown at Homeland Security Department
Mike Johnson says Democrats are 'risking public safety,' but they object to funding ICE agents' aggressive tactics, which they say have left the public feeling traumatized and much less safe
WASHINGTON
US House Speaker Mike Johnson on Saturday accused Democrats of risking public safety amid a looming funding lapse for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), warning that essential services could be disrupted.
"Here we go again. The new Democrat shutdown -- this time of the Dept. of Homeland Security -- will hit some very important programs like FEMA disaster response, TSA (Transportation Safety Authority) security lines, and Coast Guard operations," Johnson said on the US social media platform X.
The partial government shutdown at the DHS began early Saturday after Congress did not pass a funding bill before the Friday midnight deadline, with Democrats blocking the measure, demanding reforms to DHS and especially its Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the agency whose aggressive crackdowns in US cities have met widespread opposition.
Johnson said that the shutdown would lead to delayed disaster assistance, airport disruptions, and weakened law enforcement capabilities.
"Democrats are once again risking public safety just to stage a pointless political stunt," he added.
The shutdown follows weeks of negotiations between Democrats and Republicans on reforms to immigration enforcement and oversight of agencies such as ICE and Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Democrats demand stronger oversight of ICE
DHS is now the only federal agency without funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2026, which continues through Sept. 30, while lawmakers have already approved spending bills covering the rest of the government since a record-long shutdown ended in November.
The latest funding measure, passed at the end of January, gave DHS a two-week extension to allow Congress additional time to negotiate changes to the agency’s immigration enforcement practices -- a stipulation pushed by Senate Democrats following the killing of two Americans by ICE agents in the state of Minnesota in January.
Democrats have insisted on stronger oversight and tighter limits on immigration enforcement -- including banning the use of masks by ICE officers, requiring body cameras to remain on, and mandating visible identification -- as a condition for supporting the funding bill.
They say ICE agents were deployed to American cities in the name of "public safety," but instead have left the public feeling terrorized, traumatized, and much less safe.
As Republicans have rejected the Democrats’ demands and called them "unreasonable," the Senate failed to advance a measure Thursday to fund the department, with lawmakers in both chambers leaving Washington without a deal.
The funding lapse affects DHS and its constellation of agencies, including the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Without funding, many of the workers deemed essential will be forced to work without pay, or furloughed, while others will be told to stay home.
But two of the agencies that have stoked Democratic furor amid President Donald Trump's migrant crackdown, ICE and CBP, are unlikely to suffer major operational effects from the partial shutdown through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed last year.
Lawmakers are expected to resume negotiations in an effort to end the partial shutdown, though there was no immediate indication of when a vote might occur.
If the partial shutdown drags on, tens of thousands of federal workers could be required to continue to work without pay, while some agencies might be compelled to scale back staffing levels until funding is restored.

Washington wants 'stable, respectful' relationship with Beijing: Senior US defense official
US seeks to avoid conflict, wants to engage in mutually beneficial commerce with China, says Elbridge Colby
ISTANBUL
Washington wants a "stable and respectful" relationship with Beijing, a senior US defense official said Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.
Elbridge Colby, US under secretary of defense for policy, said that while Washington seeks to avoid conflict, it also wants to engage in mutually beneficial commerce. “But we obviously recognize … that we need to do that from a position of strength,” he said.
He also said that Washington “understands and respects” Beijing's accomplishments and military buildup, towards which the US is “acting accordingly.”
“We are looking at it clear in a clear-eyed way” with the goal of achieving a favorable balance of power and stability, he said.
On the 2026 US National Security Strategy not mentioning Taiwan, he said US President Donald Trump “is actually quite consistent with our traditional position one-China policy position.”
“We are seeking stability, a willingness to engage, but also clarity and strength and we're all about building up a position of strength” in the Pacific, he said.
The US needs to work with allies, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, to “build up a position of collective strength,” Colby added.
On a new phase for NATO, he said Washington is now pushing “NATO 3.0.”
It involves “a couple of things,” including “flexible realism ... a refocusing on, in a sense, going back to … NATO as a military alliance,” he said.
Refocusing the military is critical for the “homeland hemisphere,” he said. “Obviously, a lot of that is not the military domain, but it is a critical part of that supply chain and stability there – deterring China through strength, not confrontation.”
Colby also said modern conflicts would be “wars of production,” stressing the importance of manufacturing capacity.
“We need to have a defense industry that can produce for ourselves and for our allies," Colby said, also extending support for US allies growing their defense industrial base.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. The United States is trying to prevent the destruction of Western civilization by European bureaucrats, Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and special representative of the Russian president, said on his social media page.
"The US cares deeply and tries to prevent EU bureaucrats from destroying Western civilization. But EU bureaucrats are highly focused and skilled at destroying it through false narratives, migration, warmongering, and economic decline," the post reads.
In this way the Russian president's special representative commented on US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's speech on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, in which he called Americans part of Western civilization.
"It's unclear who wins," Dmitriev added.
Previously he stated that European leaders are reconsidering their approach to resolving the conflict in Ukraine because they fear cooperation between Russia and the United States.

Cuba postpones its annual cigar fair as a US oil siege causes severe fuel shortages and blackouts
Organizers say Cuba’s annual cigar fair, which was set to be held the last week of February, has been postponed
- Bookmark
Cuba’s annual cigar fair, which was set to be held the last week of February, has been postponed organizers said Saturday, as the island faces blackouts and severe fuel shortages brought about by a U.S oil embargo.
In a statement, the cigar fair’s organizer, Habanos S.A. said it decided to postpone the iconic event to “preserve its high standard of quality.”
Habanos S.A., a joint venture between the state-owned company Cubatabaco and international firm Altadis, holds the global monopoly on Cuban cigar sales.
Every year, the company hosts the annual Habanos Festival, a key event for cigar aficionados and distributors worldwide, where attendees tour tobacco plantations, participate in auctions and witness the latest in craftsmanship.
The statement by Habanos S.A. did not set a new date for the 26th edition of the cigar fair.
Last year, the event closed with an auction in which $18 million was paid for a batch of highly coveted, hand rolled cigars. The company last year also reported record sales of $827 million.
Several cultural events, including a book fair, have been postponed in Cuba this month as the island grapples with the most severe fuel shortages and power blackouts in years.
In late January, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose tariffs on any country that sold oil to Cuba, as Washington puts more pressure on the island’s communist leadership to implement political and economic reforms.
Cuba imports about 60% of its energy supply, and had long relied on Venezuela and Mexico for much of its oil.
But shipments from Venezuela were canceled in January following the removal of that nation’s then-president Nicolas Maduro in a U.S. military raid, a move that also resulted in greater U.S. oversight over Venezuela’s oil industry.
Shipments from Mexico stopped in mid-February following Trump’s tariff threat.
Earlier this week, three Canadian airlines canceled flights to Cuba after the island’s government announced there would be no jet fuel for planes seeking to refuel at Cuba’s airports. Other airlines have maintained their flights to the island but will be refueling their planes with stopovers in the Dominican Republic.
The fuel shortages have also hurt tourism on the island, with some agencies canceling trips as the government shuts down some hotels, and relocates tourists in a bid to save electricity.
Tabacuba, a state-run tobacco company, lamented the postponement of this year's cigar fair in a statement, saying it had come about due to “the complex economic situation that the nation is facing, as a result of the intensification of the economic, commercial and financial blockade” imposed by the United States.

Over 100 artists for Palestine back UN’s Albanese after resignation calls
France and Germany call for UN special rapporteur for occupied Palestinian territory, Francesca Albanese, to step down over her critical comments.
More than 100 prominent artists – including musicians, actors and writers – have signed an open letter in support of the United Nations special rapporteur for occupied Palestinian territory who faces international calls to step down.
In a letter from the group Artists for Palestine on Saturday, the signatories offered “full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and, therefore, also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist”.

“There are infinitely more of us in every corner of the Earth who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means,” the letter said.
Among the supporters were actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel Prize-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
At last week’s Al Jazeera Forum, Albanese, an outspoken critic of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza, said “we as humanity have a common enemy”, but a fake video that was later debunked had her accusing Israel of being the “common enemy”.
She later explained in a social media post she was referencing “the system that has enabled the genocide in Palestine” as the “common enemy”.
‘Crush any criticism of Israel’
Still, European countries, including France and Germany, continue to call for her removal.
On Tuesday, a group of French lawmakers sent a letter to Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot condemning Albanese’s remarks as “anti-Semitic”. A day later, Barrot called on her to step down, saying France “unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks”.
On Thursday, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called her position “untenable”.
Frank Barat, an author and film producer, said French President Emmanuel Macron and Barrot have repeatedly said they support international law “while the facts show the complete opposite”.
Albanese has highlighted for the past two years that under international law, “states have a duty to act to prevent genocide, and they’ve been failing completely” in Gaza, Barat told Al Jazeera.
“Because Francesca has been highlighting this hypocrisy, she’s been targeted by most Western governments. The political agenda of these governments is to crush any criticism of Israel. We’ve seen it in the streets of Europe. We’ve seen it in the streets of the US,” he added.
People who have spoken out against Israel’s war on Palestine are “criminalised while the perpetrators of genocide continue to be let go“, Barat said.
Marta Hurtado, a spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said at a news briefing on Friday that her colleagues are “very worried” about the backlash against Albanese.
“We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues,” Hurtado said.
Nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in Gaza since an October 10 “ceasefire” alone. At least 72,000 Palestinians have been killed and 171,000 wounded in Israel’s war since October 2023

Herzog demands answers from Netanyahu after Trump pardon broadside

President Isaac Herzog is seeking clarification from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following sharp criticism directed at him by U.S. President Donald Trump, a day after Trump met with Netanyahu in Washington.
Trump said Thursday called Herzog “disgraceful” for not granting Netanyahu a pardon in his ongoing corruption trial. Herzog’s office said the president wants to know whether Netanyahu was behind the remarks, which officials described as a serious affront to Israel’s sovereign institutions.
Sources close to Herzog said that if it emerges that Netanyahu encouraged Trump to make the comments, it would constitute a “red line.”
“There is a difference between criticism and insult, and what we heard from Trump was an insult. Someone clearly stirred him up,” one official said. “Over the weekend, the president received dozens of inquiries from the United States and Israel, and there was a need to seek clarification from Netanyahu.”
Herzog’s office emphasized that the demand for clarification is public and that it wants to understand whether Netanyahu asked Trump to issue such pointed criticism. “Do Trump’s remarks that President Herzog is irrelevant and that the Israeli public should be ashamed of him reflect the position of Netanyahu’s own office?” an official said.
ynet has learned that contacts took place over the weekend between Herzog and American officials. Herzog was said to have been stunned by Trump’s comments, which came while he was on a return flight to Israel from a visit to Australia.
Officials in Herzog’s circle said they suspect Netanyahu may have encouraged Trump’s remarks and are also questioning whether there was any “quid pro quo” in exchange for the public criticism.
On Thursday, a day after meeting Netanyahu, Trump launched an unprecedented attack on Herzog. “Bibi's been a great wartime prime minister,” Trump said, using Netanyahu's nickname. “The president of Israel, the primary power he's got is the power to give pardons, and he’s not [doing it]. He said he’s given it five different times, but he doesn’t want to do it because I guess he loses his power. I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He's disgraceful for not giving it. He should give it.”
On Friday, Trump reiterated his position when asked whether he believed Netanyahu would receive a pardon. “I think so,” he said.
People who have spoken with Netanyahu said they assess his chances of receiving a pardon from Herzog as relatively low, around 30%. It is possible Trump was aware of that assessment when he made his remarks.
In November, Netanyahu submitted a formal request for a pardon to Herzog. The President’s Residence described it as an unusual request with significant implications.
The submission included two documents: a detailed letter signed by Netanyahu’s attorney and a separate letter signed by the prime minister.
According to the request, the grounds for a pardon are “the good of the state,” which Netanyahu argues would allow him to manage state affairs effectively. The document states that Netanyahu believes the legal proceedings, if carried through to their conclusion, would result in a full acquittal.
“He has had and continues to have substantial criticism of the conduct of law enforcement authorities in handling his case, matters that have been proven and continue to be proven in court,” the request said, adding that for years Netanyahu had been determined to prove his claims through all lawful means available to him.

Madagascar declares Cyclone Gezani a national disaster
Storm kills 43, destroys thousands of homes as government calls for climate resilience
LUSAKA, Zambia
Madagascar on Saturday declared Cyclone Gezani a national disaster after the storm killed 43 people and caused widespread destruction across the Indian Ocean island nation.
Prime Minister Rajaonarivelo Heritsalama said in the capital, Antananarivo, that the cyclone had affected the country’s economy and people’s lives. He said the government would focus on strengthening resilience to mitigate the impact of climate change in the future.
According to statistics released Saturday by Madagascar’s disaster agency, the cyclone claimed 43 lives across 25 districts in five regions. A total of 427 people were injured and six were reported missing.
The agency said 357,014 homes were destroyed, 16,428 people were displaced and 42,219 buildings were damaged.
France, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations have led humanitarian relief efforts, providing food and medical supplies.
Madagascar is one of Africa’s most storm-prone countries and is still grappling with the effects of Tropical Cyclone Fytia, which struck a fortnight ago, killing seven people and affecting more than 54,000 others.

Rubio says Europe and US 'belong together'
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so a strong Europe could help the United States on its mission of global "renewal".
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by President Donald Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said, calling for "a reinvigorated alliance".
"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the United States "belong together."
He echoed the Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration poses a threat, saying that "mass migration" is "a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West".
He said Europe and the United States were "heirs to the same great and noble civilisation" and that he hoped Europe "together with us are willing and able to defend it".
Change in tone
Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture-war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday had deepened a "rift" between US and Europe.
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues including free speech, shocking European allies.
The Trump administration has also charged that Europe faces a "civilisational decline", and has courted far-right parties on the continent.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.
Some breathed a sigh of relief after Rubio's speech, with Estonia's Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur telling AFP: "It was needed to show that we are still allies and partners."
But others said they did not mark a shift in the US stance, with former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis saying: "It was simply delivered in more polite terms. I am not sure the white paint will hold."
European security
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British leader Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying, "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," and calling to build "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production".
NATO chief Mark Rutte told reporters that although France and Britain, Europe's only nuclear powers, have discussed greater cooperation to make their nuclear deterrence stronger, "nobody is arguing in Europe to do this as a sort of replacement of the nuclear umbrella of the United States."
Ukraine war
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine's Western-supplied air defence systems.
He said that "there is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes," after Russia stepped up its attacks on infrastructure over the past few months, as the coldest snap since the war started in February 2022 hit the country.
"No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kyiv to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... (Zelensky) has to move," he said.
But Rubio - who met Zelensky on the sidelines in Munich - said on Saturday: "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."

Passenger ferry capsizes in Sudan’s White Nile state, 4 rescued
Search continues for 12 missing as doctors group urges safety review
ISTANBUL
A passenger ferry carrying 16 people capsized Saturday in Sudan’s White Nile state, with four survivors rescued and search operations underway for the remaining passengers, the Sudan Doctors Network said.
The group said the boat sank in the Wad al-Zaki area with 16 people aboard, including women. Rescue efforts were continuing to determine the fate of the other passengers, it said.
The Sudan Doctors Network urged authorities to review all riverboats and ferries, enforce safety requirements, set clear load limits and ensure the availability of rescue equipment to prevent further accidents.
The incident comes days after at least 21 people were killed when a passenger ferry carrying more than 27 people capsized in the Nile River in northern Sudan, according to local authorities.
The Nile River state government said Thursday that 21 bodies had been recovered after the boat sank Wednesday, and that search efforts were continuing for those still missing.
Local media reported that the vessel was traveling between Taiba Al-Khawad and Deim Al-Qarray in the Shendi locality when it capsized, carrying women, children and elderly passengers.
At the time, the Sudan Doctors Network said the tragedy underscored the vulnerability of river transport and the lack of basic safety measures, as well as the absence of local authorities and civil defense teams in the initial hours, “which exacerbated the scale of the disaster.”

Boy, 16, charged with murder after teenager stabbed in Feltham
Maliki Sharma has been described as a ‘lovely boy’ who had hopes of becoming an electrician

A 16-year-old boy has been charged with murder after an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death in north-west London.
Metropolitan Police officers were called to Victoria Road, Feltham, ar around 5pm on 12 January where they found Maliki Sharma with multiple stab wounds.
He was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead, with his family now being supported by specialist officers.
Three teenagers have since been arrested in connection, with one boy from Hounslow charged with murder on Friday.
The boy, who cannot be named due to his age, appeared at Willesden Magistrates’ Court on Saturday and has been remanded into custody to appear at the Old Bailey on Tuesday.
A spokesperson for the family described Maliki as a “lovely boy” who was close to his mother and older brother.
He said: “It’s just devastating, it’s absolutely devastating. He was such a funny, kind, caring, lovely young man. He had his whole life ahead of him.”
Mr Sharma was a student at West Thames College, where he was training to become an electrician. The family friend said: “He wanted to go down that route – get a trade, do his own business, so that he could look after his mum, that’s what he always said.”
He added: “He really, really was a lovely boy. He was cheeky, funny.”
Two other 16-year-old boys, also from Hounslow, were charged with conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and have been remanded into youth detention.
Rhys Huskinson, 19, of North Road, Feltham was charged on Wednesday with affray and possession of an offensive weapon in connection with the investigation.
Police said that following further inquiries, the charges have been amended to attempted grievous bodily harm.
Detective Chief Inspector Allam Bhangoo, who is leading this investigation, said: “My thoughts remain with Maliki’s friends and family during this unimaginably difficult time.
“We understand that this incident has been distressing for the local community and residents can expect to see an increased police presence over the coming days.”

Burglars ransack safe-deposit boxes in German bank heist
February 14, 2026Burglars ransacked several safe-deposit boxes in a bank in the town of Stuhr in Lower Saxony in northern Germany, police said Saturday.
Police said they have not identified the perpetrators or established what was stolen.
"We can't say anything about the contents," a police spokesman told Germany's DPA news agency. "We don't know what the bank customers had stored there," he said.
The bank had 728 safe-deposit boxes in total, 14 of which were broken into, according to police.
"All the other boxes are intact," the bank was cited by DPA as saying.
Police said the break-in was carried out between 12 p.m. and 2 p.m. local time (1100 and 1300 UTC).
According to initial witness reports, three men in blue overalls were seen walking toward a car in front of the bank around midday.
Unknown liquid spotted at crime scene
A police spokesperson told DPA that a bank employee made her way to the bank's basement after her lunch break, where she noticed a "pungent smell" that made her feel nauseous.
Emergency workers found an unknown liquid on the doors but said it did not pose a health risk.
Two bank employees were treated by emergency services, according to northern German regional public broadcaster NDR.
The break-in comes a little over a month after burglars stole about €30 million from a bank in Gelsenkirchen in western Germany after drilling into its vault.

Four new astronauts arrive at the International Space Station to replace NASA's evacuated crew
The International Space Station is back to full strength with the arrival of four new astronauts
- Bookmark
The International Space Station returned to full strength with Saturday’s arrival of four new astronauts to replace colleagues who bailed early because of health concerns.
SpaceX delivered the U.S., French and Russian astronauts a day after launching them from Cape Canaveral.
Last month’s medical evacuation was NASA’s first in 65 years of human spaceflight. One of four astronauts launched by SpaceX last summer suffered what officials described as a serious health issue, prompting their hasty return. That left only three crew members to keep the place running — one American and two Russians — prompting NASA to pause spacewalks and trim research.
Moving in for eight to nine months are NASA’s Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, France’s Sophie Adenot and Russia’s Andrei Fedyaev. Meir, a marine biologist, and Fedyaev, a former military pilot, have lived up there before. During her first station visit in 2019, Meir took part in the first all-female spacewalk.
Adenot, a military helicopter pilot, is only the second French woman to fly in space. Hathaway is a captain in the U.S. Navy.
NASA has refused to divulge the identity of the astronaut who fell ill in orbit on Jan. 7 or explain what happened, citing medical privacy. The ailing astronaut and three others returned to Earth more than a month sooner than planned. They spent their first night back on Earth at the hospital before returning to Houston.
The space agency said it did not alter its preflight medical checks for their replacements.

Voices: Keir Starmer is right to embrace our European future
United Kingdom
Unknown Publisher

05:15:19 KST

The prime minister is to be congratulated on his clear-sighted speech to the Munich Security Conference. In unscripted remarks referring to questions about his leadership at home, he claimed that he had “ended the week much stronger than I started it”. If that is true, let us hope that he has the strength to deliver the closer cooperation with our European neighbours of which he spoke so eloquently.
The speech struck the right balance between resisting the bullying bluster of Donald Trump and acknowledging that Europe needs to do more to secure its own defence. Sir Keir Starmer reminded his audience that Nato members had defended each other’s sovereignty on the issue of Greenland. He reminded President Trump, again, that Nato members had come to the aid of the United States in Afghanistan – “at terrible cost to many in my country”.
But he also spoke of the need for “greater European autonomy”, while saying that it “does not herald US withdrawal, but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.
His warning of the threat of Vladimir Putin’s aggression may have been a little hyperbolic for some tastes. Sir Keir said: “In the 1930s, leaders were too slow to level with the public about the fundamental shift in mindset that was required.” That is true, and there is a similar absence of urgency today, but it is unwise to make comparisons with the Nazis.
President Putin is bad enough – as the evidence presented about the murder of Alexei Navalny confirmed – but he is not Hitler, and he does not pose a direct military threat to most European nations. Such exaggerations risk undermining, rather than reinforcing, the argument for higher defence spending that Sir Keir was right to make.
Sir Keir was justified in warning that “the peddlers of easy answers are ready on the extremes of left and right”, although it was evidence of weakness rather than strength that he used his platform in Munich to attack the Green Party and Reform for being “soft on Russia and weak on Nato”.
Better to make the case for stronger European defence, and to let the British people make up their own minds about how serious Zack Polanski and Nigel Farage are about addressing it.
The bulk of the speech made a good argument for greater European defence cooperation. Indeed, Sir Keir’s speechwriter should be commended for resolutely avoiding the usual clichés. “To break the convention of a thousand speeches,” the prime minister said, “we are not at a crossroads today – the road ahead is straight and it is clear.”
He called for “a generational shift in defence industrial cooperation”, and said that “this includes looking again at closer economic alignment”. He is absolutely right that Britain should be closer to the European Union on both defence and economics, and indeed on the economics of the defence industry. As he said, “The prize here is greater security, stronger growth for the UK and the EU, which will fuel increased defence spending, and the chance to place the UK at the centre of a wave of European industrial renewal.”
This has implications for domestic politics, of course. As Sir Keir also said, “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more. Because we know that, in a dangerous world, we would not take control by turning inward – we would surrender it.”
But it would be a mistake to try to reopen the arguments of the EU referendum 10 years later. Sir Keir was right to focus most of his speech on making the positive case for closer European cooperation – and to let his domestic audience draw its own conclusions.

Volatile Ramadan begins amid Iran tensions, Temple Mount dispute
Unknown

05:12:53 KST

After two years in which Ramadan passed relatively quietly under the shadow of war, Israeli security officials now warn that this year's observances could prove especially volatile. The central concern is a combination of lone-wolf terrorist attacks, renewed activity by Hamas and other terrorist organizations' infrastructure in Judea and Samaria, and the potential for broader unrest among a frustrated Palestinian public.
Many Palestinians had expected a return to normal life following the end of fighting in Gaza. That expectation, security officials believe, has not been met, deepening public disappointment and anger.
Israeli officials describe this year's "entry angle" into Ramadan as more troubling than in recent years. Two years ago, shortly after the outbreak of the war, Ramadan remained relatively calm amid widespread Palestinian concern over a harsh Israeli response. Last year, the month fell shortly after the IDF launched a large-scale operation in refugee camps in northern Samaria, a move that deterred terrorists and disrupted their operations.
This year, despite a relatively low number of significant attacks in recent months, the assessment is that friction potential is higher.
Iran, the Temple Mount and settlement moves
One major factor is the timing of Ramadan, which coincides with growing reports of a possible US strike on Iran. Security officials say Tehran has recently intensified efforts to transfer weapons and funds and to recruit terrorist operatives in Judea and Samaria, intending to activate them when ordered.
There is concern that a direct confrontation with the Islamic Republic of Iran could inflame the Palestinian street, already on edge, particularly if Tehran's proxies, including Hezbollah and the Houthis, join the fighting.
At the same time, recent decisions by Israel's political leadership have been poorly received among Palestinians in Judea and Samaria. The decision not to lower the minimum age for Muslim worshippers permitted to enter the Temple Mount during Ramadan, and not to increase the quota of entrants, has sparked anger. Many Palestinians had expected broader easing of restrictions following the end of the Gaza war and a return to policies in place before October 7.
Tensions are also fueled by renewed talk in Israel of annexation and by a government decision to reestablish the community of Sa-Nur in northern Samaria. The government has said that the renewed presence there will take place by the Jewish holiday of Purim, which this year falls during Ramadan, a convergence that adds to the strain.
Economic despair and security concerns
The economic situation in Judea and Samaria adds another layer of pressure. Unemployment, which stood at about 13% before the war, has risen to roughly 29%. Israel is not currently permitting Palestinian laborers to return to work inside its territory. Palestinian officials and residents speak of growing economic despair, compounded by a sense of political stagnation.
The delay in moving to phase two of the Gaza framework has also affected public sentiment in Judea and Samaria. Many had anticipated a different reality by now, and disappointment is mounting. This is compounded by the presence of hundreds of terrorists released in hostage exchange deals over the past two years. Experience following the 2011 Gilad Schalit deal showed that many released prisoners returned to terrorist activity in various forms. Security officials fear that heightened religious fervor during Ramadan, combined with the physical strain of fasting, could accelerate radicalization processes.
Officials also point to a recent rise in what they describe as "hate crimes" by elements within the Jewish population. Increased friction raises the risk of casualties, and a single "successful" attack could further destabilize the situation.
Tension mounts as IDF reinforces
Although no large-scale, successful terrorist attacks have been recorded recently, largely due to ongoing counterterrorism operations, data from recent weeks show an uptick in stone-throwing and Molotov cocktail attacks, seen as an indication of renewed agitation on the ground.
The IDF is preparing for Ramadan with reinforced forces. The Commando Brigade is expected to operate in the sector and remain on immediate standby for any incident. The Judea and Samaria Division will receive several additional companies, mainly in the seam zone and at crossings around Jerusalem. Security officials anticipate attempts to infiltrate into Israeli territory with the aim of reaching the Temple Mount. The Israel Police's Judea and Samaria District is also bolstering its presence along the seam line.
Over the past week, the division intensified operations, arresting 104 suspects and seizing nine weapons, including a machine gun, a shotgun, a long gun, two pistols, a hunting weapon and an M-16 rifle, as well as two airsoft guns. Authorities also confiscated terror funds totaling 1,560 shekels, 15,430 shekels and 2,200 dinars, along with gold worth approximately 3 million shekels and a BMW vehicle valued at around 200,000 shekels.
The IDF has stressed that operational activity will continue as usual during Ramadan, unlike in previous years when non-urgent operations were reduced out of consideration for the fasting month. A significant test is expected this coming Friday, the first Friday of Ramadan. The military will deploy reinforced forces, expressing hope that despite the destabilizing factors, the month will pass without escalation and without Israeli casualties.

Trump shares furious rant about Bill Maher and gives bizarre details about dinner they had at White House
‘Sometimes in life you waste time!’ Trump said of his dinner with Maher last year
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
In a Valentine’s Day Truth Social message, President Donald Trump railed against “jerk” TV host Bill Maher for being “anti Trump” on his show, despite the two enjoying a “great dinner” together at the White House last year.
The president, who often uses his social media to lash out at late-night hosts, claimed he had indulged Maher’s request to have dinner at the White House, and even invited him to the White House Christmas Party, only to have Maher insult him on Real Time with Bill Maher.
“I’d much rather spend my time MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN than wasting it on him,” Trump wrote Saturday. “Bill continues to suffer from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS!), and there is nothing that will ever be done to cure him of this very serious disease.”
Hitting at Maher, Trump said the late-night host was “extremely nervous” and “had ZERO confidence” when he met him last year in the Oval Office.
“To soothe his nerves, immediately, within seconds, asked for a ‘Vodka Tonic,’” Trump wrote, later calling Maher an “underrated lightweight.”
“I’ve never felt like this before, I’m actually scared,” Trump claimed Maher said to him. The president went on to say that Maher “seemed to be a great guy” and was “very respectful” about their meeting on his show.
However, his opinion on Maher seems to have changed after comments made on his show Friday evening, in which he mocked the president for writing on Truth Social that China will take over Canada and “terminate all ice hockey.”
“What the f***,” Maher said on his show after reading Trump’s Truth Social post out loud. “I think this is the kinda thing that is causing his popularity to go down.”
The president insisted he “jokingly” remarked about China taking over Canada and terminating ice hockey.
“He went on and on about the Hockey statement, like ‘What kind of a person would say such a foolish thing as this,’ as though I were being serious when I said it,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Despite his frustration, Trump said he thought Maher was still “slightly more talented” than fellow late night hosts Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Fallon, or Stephen Colbert.
The Independent has asked Maher’s representative for comment.
Maher, known for his political satire, often uses his show to bring on a diverse group of voices in an effort to unify the country at a polarizing time.
Last year, Maher dined with Trump, alongside Kid Rock and Dana White, at the White House. Afterward, he gave a relatively positive review of the president, calling him “gracious.”
But Trump appeared angry Saturday that Maher has returned to criticizing him and his administration, rather than acknowledging his perceived successes such as the Dow hitting 50,000 points and Trump’s immigration agenda.
“Fortunately, his Television Ratings are so low that nobody will learn about his various Fake News statements about me.”,Trump wrote.

Ukraine War Is “Killing Russia” – Rutte to MT

05:04:27 KST

MUNICH, Germany — The Russian people should know that the war is destroying their country and should do everything they can to stop it, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told The Moscow Times.
Speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the former Dutch prime minister discussed what the Russian people should know about their country’s leadership and place in the world as the Kremlin further restricts their access to the global information ecosystem by blocking Telegram and WhatsApp.
“In December, they lost 35,000 of their own men, and in January — 30,000,” he said, pointing to figures that Western officials say show that more Russians were killed in Ukraine than were recruited to fight in the same period.
These casualties “do not come from Moscow and St. Petersburg, so the elite may not immediately experience this,” Rutte said. “But this will come soon, because at this [rate] of so many people dying in action, it's unavoidable that it will also reach Moscow and St. Petersburg.
“I would say, ‘Do everything you can to stop this, because it is killing Russia. It is so bad for Russia’,” he said.
The conference took place the day after NATO defense ministers met in Brussels and announced another package of $500 million in military aid to Ukraine through the Prioritized Ukrainian Requirements List (PURL), which allows countries to buy U.S. weapons for Ukraine.
The figure included over $200 million from Britain to buy air defense missiles, as Russia continues targeting Ukraine’s cities and energy infrastructure.
On the main stage at Munich, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky thanked the U.S. and European countries for their support and said Ukraine was ready to strike a peace deal.
But he said that while Ukraine was willing to make concessions, he saw no evidence that Russia would.
Several speakers at the conference, including U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, openly doubted whether there was clear evidence Russia wanted to end the war.
In remarks to journalists ahead of his meeting with Rubio, Zelensky said he believed that Russia’s only goal in invading his country was its total occupation and it was a mistake to believe that ceding the Donbas to Russia would bring peace.
Not only does how the war ends look unclear, but so does the relationship Russia will have with the rest of the world.
“I'm afraid under the current leadership of Russia, a return to normal relations with the West is unlikely,” Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski told The Moscow Times on Friday. “Colonial wars, if you look historically, are only ended by a different team than started them.”
“Let’s have a peace deal first and then see what happens after that,” Rutte said. “But for NATO, it’s clear as we see things now, Russia is a long term threat to the whole of NATO’s territory.”
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.
Remind me later.

Rio police in 'Money Heist' and Jason masks apprehend Carnival phone thieves
Rio police are using costumes at Carnival to blend into street crowds and catch cellphone thieves
- Bookmark
Rio de Janeiro police officers kitted themselves out as thieves from the series “Money Heist” and as Jason Voorhees from the “Friday the 13th” horror movie franchise to blend in with crowds celebrating Carnival and catch criminals stealing cellphones.
Carnival officially kicked off on Friday in Rio, and for many revelers participating in the megalopolis’ raucous, dazzling street parties, one of the biggest concerns is holding on to their phones — as thefts are all too common.
To tackle this phenomenon, officers in the Santa Teresa neighborhood Friday donned costumes to fly under thieves’ radar. The undercover agents noticed a woman snatching a cellphone from someone’s hand, followed her and saw her hand the device to an accomplice, Rio’s civil police said in a statement Saturday.
Police arrested the pair and found five cellphones in their possession.
That wasn’t the first time Brazilian police officers wearing costumes have sought to mingle with the crowds during festivities to catch wrongdoers.
Last Sunday, police officers dressed as characters from “Ghostbusters” caught a woman with 12 cellphones stolen in downtown Sao Paulo. A day prior, officers in alien outfits caught a man with three phones hidden under his clothing.
Cellphone thefts have declined overall in Brazil, according to the 2025 annual report by the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety think-tank. They dropped from approximately 980,000 per year in 2022 to some 850,000 in 2024.
But fear of both armed robberies and discreet pocketing of cellphones remains high, and opinion polls consistently show that violence and crime are Brazilians’ main concern.

Wuthering Heights director addresses differences between film and novel
- Emerald Fennell has discussed the significant changes made in her film adaptation of Emily Brontë’s Wuthering Heights, primarily due to time constraints.
- The film, starring Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie as Heathcliff and Catherine, focuses mainly on the first part of the novel and their tumultuous relationship.
- To streamline the narrative, Fennell cut characters such as Mr. Lockwood and Hindley, integrating aspects of Hindley's character into Earnshaw, portrayed by Martin Clunes.
- Earnshaw is depicted as a more prominent, drunken and abusive antagonist in the film, combining traits of a deeply loving yet cruel individual.
- The adaptation has received divided critical reception, with some praising it as “oozy and wild” while others, including The Independent, have called it an “astonishingly bad adaptation.”

Hungary’s Orban says EU bigger threat than Russia before April elections
‘Illiberal’ PM, endorsed by ally Trump this week, to receive US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Sunday.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban says his country should fear the European Union more than Russia while promising to clear away the EU’s “oppressive machinery” before what looks will be heated parliamentary elections.
Delivering his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Saturday, Orban pledged to push out “the foreign influence that limits our sovereignty together with its agents” as the opposition Tisza Party maintains an 8 to 12 percentage point lead over Orban’s ruling Fidesz party eight weeks from the April 12 elections.

“Fear-mongering about [Russian President Vladimir] Putin is primitive and unserious. Brussels, however, is a palpable reality and a source of imminent danger,” said the 62-year-old leader, who compared the EU to the repressive Soviet regime that dominated Hungary for decades last century.
Since returning to power for a second time in 2010, Orban has waged a campaign against “pseudo-civil organisations”, “bought journalists”, judges and politicians in his drive to build what he calls an “illiberal state”.
His crackdown on immigration has provided a blueprint for right-wing leaders, such as United States President Donald Trump.
‘War or peace’?
In Saturday’s speech, Orban signalled his work of clearing liberal forces from the country is only “half-done”, noting that Trump, who is backing him to win the upcoming vote, “rebelled against the liberals’ global-scale business, media and political network, thereby improving our chances as well”.
On Friday, Trump posted a new endorsement of Orban on his Truth Social platform, saying he’s a “truly strong and powerful leader with a proven track record of delivering phenomenal results”.
The US president’s comments came as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio prepares to visit Hungary on Sunday. Rubio will fly in from the Munich Security Conference in Germany with a stopover in Slovakia for talks with nationalist Prime Minister Robert Fico.
Orban, who has cultivated warm relations with Putin during his current stretch in power, this week cast the April elections as a stark choice between “war or peace”, warning in a Facebook post that Peter Magyar’s Tisza Party would drag the country into the conflict raging next door in Ukraine.
The prime minister has doubled down on his strategy of portraying Magyar as a “Brussels puppet” with billboards depicting him saying “yes” to a demand for “Money for Ukraine!” from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

Nobel laureate transferred to prison in northern Iran without warning

Iranian authorities have without prior warning transferred Nobel peace prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to a prison in the north of the country as concern grows over her health, her family said on Saturday.
Mohammadi, who won the peace prize in 2023 in recognition for more than two decades of campaigning, was arrested on 12 December in the eastern city of Mashhad after speaking out against Iran’s clerical authorities at a funeral ceremony.
She spent time on hunger strike earlier this month and had been hospitalised before being returned to prison.
The Norwegian Nobel committee said this week it was “deeply appalled” by reports detailing “physical abuse and ongoing life-threatening mistreatment” of Mohammadi during her arrest and in detention.
After her arrest, Mohammadi had been held in Mashhad at the detention facility of the intelligence ministry.
But she has now been transferred to a prison in the city of Zanjan in the north of the country, said her husband, Taghi Rahmani, who is based in Paris.
“This action was carried out without informing her family or her lawyer,” he said on X, adding it was “intended to exile and displace Narges”.
Mohammadi’s foundation, which is run by her supporters and family, said she had been transferred on Tuesday but she had only been able to reveal the news on Saturday in a phone call with her Iranian lawyer, Mostafa Nili.
Since her arrest in December, she has only been allowed one phone call with a brother inside Iran and now just two more with her Iranian lawyer.
“In our short conversation, she spoke of the violence inflicted during her arrest, the pressure of interrogations, and particularly severe blows to her head,” Nili wrote in a post on X.
“These blows have resulted in dizziness, double vision and blurred vision. Bruises and marks of severe physical assault remain on her body,” he added.
Mohammadi was arrested before protests erupted nationwide later in December. The movement peaked in January, with authorities launching a crackdown that activists say has left thousands dead.
Earlier this month she was handed a further six years in prison on charges of harming national security and a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda against Iran’s Islamic system. She also went on hunger strike for almost a week to protest the conditions of her detention.
Over the past quarter of a century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her campaigning against Iran’s use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.
She was born in Zanjan but is resident in Tehran. Her foundation said she had on two occasions during previous jail stints been transferred to Zanjan prison where she suffered ill treatment.

She tried to fix the Liberals’ women problem. Now she’s quitting the party
Updated ,first published
The founder of a key Liberal women’s network has resigned from the organisation and quit the party altogether, two days after federal MPs toppled Sussan Ley as their first female leader.
The announcement from Charlotte Mortlock, who founded Hilma’s Network four years ago to boost female representation in the Liberals, also comes a week after the party’s NSW branch dumped a planned vote on gender quotas. Mortlock had worked on the proposal with five other Liberal women.
“Due to recent events I have decided there are other ways I can support women and Australia,” the former Coalition staffer and Sky journalist said in a statement on Sunday morning.
“I have decided the time has come for me to step down as executive director of Hilma’s Network and I have also relinquished my Liberal Party membership.”
The resignation of one of the Liberals’ most vocal grassroots advocates for women’s representation is a sign of the fallout that awaits the party in some sections of its membership after Ley, the first federal female leader, was turfed out of the job within nine months.
Ley’s tenure was marred by disunity. An image of high-profile right faction MPs arriving at a home in Melbourne to discuss Ley’s leadership before the funeral for former Liberal MP Katie Allen was a sign that the opposition leader was being undermined within her own ranks.
The six men included leadership aspirants Andrew Hastie and Angus Taylor, as well as senators Jonno Duniam and James Paterson, who were members of Ley’s leadership team.
It came to a head last week when Taylor challenged for the Liberal leadership, and on Friday won the ballot convincingly, 34 to 17, after several MPs who supported Ley in last year’s leadership ballot switched their vote.
Most of those Liberal MPs insist their decision was about Ley’s performance, given the Coalition was sinking in the polls to new lows each month. However, Ley’s supporters argue she was never given a fair go by colleagues, and some think gender played a part in that.
The Liberals have struggled to win women’s votes in the last two elections, and the gender imbalance in its ranks of MPs has barely changed in a decade.
The party has a target of 50 per cent female representation, but only a third of its MPS are women. There are six women in the lower house – which will drop to five when Ley leaves parliament – and 22 men. In the upper house, there are 11 Liberal women and 12 Liberal men.
Mortlock said state and federal gender quotas should be a “bare minimum” to improve both representation and policy offerings for women after last May’s election defeat made the problem worse.
Quotas mandate that a certain proportion of seats be held by women, and have helped women become a majority of Labor’s caucus. However, the Liberal Party’s aversion to identity politics and belief in individual merit has made quotas a contentious issue for the party.
In Ley’s first major speech as leader in June, she said she was open to gender quotas but not wedded to them, adding that “what is not fine is not having enough women”.
Taylor quickly rejected the prospect of quotas, claiming Labor had “subverted democracy” with its processes. He argued that mentoring and recruitment support were better options.
The federal review of the Liberal Party’s 2025 election loss has not yet been published, but this masthead reported last November that the document will not recommend a rigid quota system.
Mortlock at the time said the decision was one for the state divisions, not the federal leadership.
But that too hit a roadblock, when the NSW Liberals this month dumped a vote on a proposal to introduce quotas from their agenda for next month’s state council meeting.
Six Liberal women in NSW, including Mortlock, had drafted a plan to boost female representation at the federal level by introducing a 40 per cent gender target for women MPs, and ensuring half the candidates in preselection contests were women.
Forty per cent of seats in NSW would also be reserved for women candidates, and hold women-only preselection, to stop female candidates being shoehorned into unwinnable seats, according to reports of the plan in The Australian.
It was dumped from the state council’s March meeting agenda over concerns it could provoke a drawn-out debate on gender representation before next year’s state election, that masthead also reported.
In her statement on Sunday, Mortlock said she was proud of everything the network had achieved, and the women candidates it had supported, since she formed the grassroots group after Scott Morrison’s 2022 federal election loss.
“From inception, we quickly grew to multiple states hosting events that challenged the party to evolve,” she said. “I wish Hilma’s and the Liberal Party success in the future.”
The network’s board of directors said in a statement: “We extend our deepest appreciation to Charlotte for having the passion and vision to create Hilma’s network and thank her for her commitment, energy and bravery to support women in politics.”
Hilma’s Victorian representative, Erin Watson, will take over as chief executive. The statement said Watson would help bolster Victorian Liberal leader Jess Wilson’s campaign ahead of the state election.
“Our mission remains unchanged, and we are committed as ever to attracting and promoting the next wave of Liberal women,” the statement said.

Wave of lawsuits by Trump tests limits of press freedom

ALBAWABA - Donald Trump, the President of the United States, has started a huge legal battle against major media companies by filing a number of high-profile lawsuits. Legal experts say these lawsuits could change the balance between political power and press freedom in the United States.
Trump has sued eight media companies since 2024, asking for $65 billion in damages. He has also sued the IRS separately because they gave The New York Times access to his tax returns. There have already been settlements for multimillion-dollar amounts in two cases, but at least seven more are still pending in federal courts. Trump has said that more lawsuits may come.
This is a big change from his first term, when he often criticized the media but didn't file a lot of lawsuits against them. After he left office, a number of lawsuits he filed against major news organizations were thrown out. His new legal strategy during his second term shows that he is taking a more aggressive stance.
It is hard to win a defamation case against a public figure. To win, the plaintiffs must show that the statements were false, harmful, and made with "actual malice," which means that the publisher knew they were spreading false information or didn't care about the truth. Some legal experts think that Trump's bigger goal might be to use the discovery process to look into how the editorial staff works.
Several well-known cases have gotten a lot of attention. The parent company of CBS News, Paramount Global, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a disagreement over how to edit an interview for the 2024 campaign. ABC News also settled for $15 million after an anchor got facts wrong about a civil verdict involving Trump. At the same time, a $10 billion lawsuit against the BBC for allegedly misleading editing of coverage of January 6 is getting closer to going to trial.
Trump has also sued the Pulitzer Prize Board, The Wall Street Journal, and Penguin Random House, among others, for reporting that he says hurt his reputation.
Supporters say that the lawsuits are a way to make media companies responsible. Critics say they could make journalism less free. The cases have brought up the question of where the constitutional line is between free speech and protecting someone's reputation, no matter what the outcomes are. This is especially important in a political climate that is becoming more divided.

Israel to deploy tear gas drones in West Bank ahead of Ramadan: Report
Security forces step up presence as access to Al-Aqsa faces restrictions, says Channel 12
JERUSALEM
Israel’s National Guard is preparing to deploy drones equipped to fire tear gas at Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as part of security preparations for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Israeli Channel 12 reported Saturday.
The police tenders committee approved the purchase of three drone-mounted systems designed to drop tear gas capsules, the channel said. The contract is valued at about $49,000.
The systems, known as “Surprise Egg,” are designed to be mounted on Matrice-type drones and used to disperse demonstrations by releasing tear gas from the air, according to the report.
Israeli police already operate 19 similar systems, Channel 12 said.
Tender documents described the purchase as “urgent,” citing operational preparations “for expected events during Ramadan,” the outlet reported.
Israel’s National Guard was formed under National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a far-right minister. Opposition figures have described the force as “a militia effectively operating under his authority.”
Military buildup
Earlier this week, Channel 12 reported that the Israeli army decided to reinforce its presence in the West Bank during Ramadan, including deploying a commando brigade.
In addition to the 22 battalions currently conducting routine security operations in the occupied territory, the army plans to send additional units, the report said.
More companies are also expected to be stationed at checkpoints ahead of the entry of thousands of worshippers into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in East Jerusalem.
The army has recommended to Defense Minister Israel Katz that up to 10,000 worshippers be allowed to enter the compound each Friday during Ramadan, according to Channel 12. It also recommended allowing entry for men over 55 and women over 50.
On Friday, Sheikh Ikrima Sabri, preacher at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, told Anadolu that he regretted Israel’s decision to restrict access during Ramadan and warned that the government was implementing “an aggressive plan targeting the holy site.”
Access restrictions
Each year during Ramadan, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians travel from the West Bank to East Jerusalem to pray at the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
Since the start of Israel’s genocide in Gaza in October 2023, Israeli authorities have imposed tight restrictions on West Bank residents crossing military checkpoints into Jerusalem.
Over the past two years, only limited numbers have been allowed entry after obtaining Israeli-issued permits, which Palestinians say are difficult to secure.
Israel has not announced any special easing measures for Ramadan this year.
Palestinians view East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state, while Israel considers the city, in both its eastern and western parts, its capital.

Zelenskyy seeks up to 50-year US security guarantees for investors
Ukrainian leader says shorter terms insufficient for long-term stability
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Kyiv is seeking long-term security guarantees from the US lasting at least 30 years to provide stability for international investors.
Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy said Washington has proposed guarantees lasting 15 years, but Ukraine wants a longer timeframe.
“Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years; we want to have 20 years plus, 30–50. It depends on what the administration and Congress decide,” he said.
Zelenskyy said guarantees of five to 10 years would not be enough to reassure investors, who require more durable security assurances.
He also said he hopes the war will end this year, while suggesting Moscow is adjusting its diplomatic approach.
“Russia is changing the head of the negotiation group to Medinsky. It seems they want to postpone decision-making,” Zelenskyy said, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin aims to capture the entire Donbas region to “sell” a victory to the Russian public.
On prisoners of war, Zelenskyy said there is a possibility of an “all-for-all” exchange if Moscow agrees. He said Russia is holding about 7,000 Ukrainian soldiers, while Ukraine is holding more than 4,000 Russian troops.
Addressing the military situation in eastern Ukraine, Zelenskyy reiterated Kyiv’s position on territorial integrity.
“We will never withdraw troops,” he said.

YouTube restores pro-Palestinian US activist’s account after backlash
Guy Christensen is known for using his platform to speak out against Israel’s genocide in Gaza
ANKARA
Following a backlash, YouTube has reinstated the account of pro-Palestinian US activist Guy Christensen after briefly suspending it.
The US video-sharing platform shut down Christensen’s account on Friday, drawing criticism from users after he pleaded his case on other social media platforms. Christensen is known for content supportive of Palestinians and sharply critical of Israel’s genocide in the Gaza.
After the backlash, YouTube restored the account.
Posting on US social media platform X, Christensen said the company reversed its decision after initially rejecting his appeal.
“We actually did it,” he wrote.
“YouTube was forced to restore my entire channel + monetization after REJECTING the appeal last night, promising I would stay banned forever. This is the power of collective action and solidarity. If we don’t stand together, we’ll be picked apart 1 by 1.”

Officials discuss US action in Venezuela at Munich Security Conference

WASHINGTON
Senior US and international officials voiced divergent views Saturday on the US military’s controversial capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro during a panel discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Asked whether he supported the US operation in Venezuela, US Sen. Ruben Gallego, a Democratic member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, said he was “glad he’s (Maduro) gone,” but warned that the way it was done has serious consequences for the international system.
“The violation of rules-based orders from this should really concern everyone that actually lives, dies and prospers by the rules-based order,” Gallego said, underscoring concerns that the Trump administration move -- carried out without broad international backing -- may weaken global norms.
After months of heightened tensions, the US captured Maduro on Jan. 3, triggering a series of developments, including Delcy Rodriguez being sworn in as interim president, changes to the country’s flagship oil law, and the release of some political prisoners.
Arnoldo Andre Tinoco, Costa Rica's foreign minister, said his country’s experience with Venezuelan migration shaped its perspective.
“When talking about Venezuela, I agree that we have to bear in mind that 8 million Venezuelans left the country. Most of them passed through Costa Rica,” Tinoco said, referencing the ongoing humanitarian fallout from years of political turmoil in Caracas.
Tinoco said a poll done after Maduro’s removal showed 84% of Costa Ricans approved of the US action.
He also outlined Costa Rica’s core areas of cooperation with Washington, citing migration, organized crime and narcotics trafficking, and Chinese investment in security-sensitive areas as shared priorities.
"We are struggling against organized crime and narco trafficking with the support of the US," he added.
Portuguese Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel offered a more nuanced view, reflecting his country’s deep ties to Venezuela through its large expatriate community.
"I have to say that these are very, very important matter for Portugal, because we have a Portuguese community of half million people in Venezuela," he said.
He stressed that respect for international law and the UN Charter is fundamental, even as his government never recognized Maduro’s disputed election.
Rangel acknowledged that Maduro’s ouster represented a break with international norms, but argued that restoring legitimate governance -- rather than returning Maduro to power -- must be the focus.
“There was a break, that international law was broken, but the way to reintegrate, to restore international law, is not to bring again Maduro. So this means that probably is not so white and black as people normally say,” he said.

French prosecutors announce special team for Epstein files
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Paris prosecutors formed a team to investigate Jeffrey Epstein files for crimes involving French nationals, re-examining Jean-Luc Brunel's case.
- Jeffrey Epstein died in prison awaiting child trafficking trial; Jean-Luc Brunel died in custody charged with raping minors.
- Recent US Epstein files named French figures; however, being mentioned does not automatically imply an offence was committed.
AI generated
PARIS - The Paris prosecutor’s office on Feb 14 announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
With Epstein’s known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents
The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor’s office told AFP.
The aim is “to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework”, it said.
Brunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022
Prosecutors said an investigation had showed Brunel was “a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein” who had offered modelling jobs to young girls from poor backgrounds.
He had engaged in sexual acts with underage girls in the United States, the US Virgin Islands, Paris and the south of France, they said.
Ten women had made accusations against Brunel, several describing how they had been led to drink alcohol and had been subjected to forced sexual penetration, according to the prosecutor’s office.
New cases
Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.
The prosecutor’s office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.
At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities.
“An investigation is under way to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report,” the prosecutor’s office stated.
The prosecutor’s office has also received a complaint filed by a Swedish woman against Mr Daniel Siad, a model recruiter with close ties to Epstein. She accused him of “sexual acts that she describes as rape and that may have been committed in France in 1990”.
The office has also received a complaint filed against French conductor Frederic Chaslin alleging acts of sexual harassment allegedly committed in 2016, it said.
The latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position
Mr Lang has, however, denied any wrongdoing, saying he was “shocked” that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company Epstein founded in 2016.
The office of the national financial prosecutor said it had opened a preliminary investigation for “aggravated tax fraud and money laundering” against Mr Lang and his daughter, Ms Caroline Lang.
Following this announcement, Mr Lang resigned from the presidency of the Arab World Institute (IMA).
Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial

Olympic athletes promised fresh stocks of condoms on Valentine’s Day after villages run short
On Valentine’s Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week
- Bookmark
On Valentine’s Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week.
“We can confirm that condom supplies in the Olympic Villages were temporarily depleted due to higher-than-anticipated demand,” the Italian organizing committee said in a statement Saturday. “Additional supplies are being delivered and will be distributed across all villages between today and Monday.”
Providing condoms for athletes has been a gift from organizers — and a constant fascination to the world — for decades.
While 300,000 condoms were provided for more than 10,500 athletes at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, the original stock was much lower for these Winter Games.
“I think 10,000 have been used, 2,800 athletes — you can go figure, as they say,” International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said Saturday. “It clearly shows that Valentine’s Day is in full swing in the village.”
Reports of no condoms in week one of the games followed an absence of plush toys of the official mascots, Milo and Tina, in the opening days. They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.
Condoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home from as “a kind of gift” to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.
“I’m not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already,” said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. “There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village."
"Every day, everything was (gone),” she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.
“I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it’s a kind of gift for them,” Clerc said.
There should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony Feb. 22.
“They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability,” the local organizing committee said.

How a hair stylist's client list became a campaign to change surrogacy laws

Cambodia's Surrogacy Crackdown
episode • Dateline • News And Current Affairs • 27m

Perth hair stylist Jay Lazarus always dreamed of becoming a dad.
"Three days before my 21st birthday, my mum was like: 'So when am I going to be a grandmother?' And I was like, 'It's a little bit harder for me, mum — but soon, hopefully one day.'"
Landmark changes to Western Australia's reproductive laws mean that dream may now finally become a reality.
Jay has four godsons and is known as Uncle Jay to many of his friends' children.
"A lot of my clients' kids have grown up around me," he said.
"They all know mummy's hairdresser is Uncle Jay."
But as a gay couple, Jay and his husband Jeremy's options for parenthood were extremely limited because WA’s laws barred couples like them from accessing surrogacy.
They tried to explore pathways that might lead them to a surrogate, including using an international agency, but found themselves up against high costs and opaque processes.
After one consultation, Jay says the experience left him devastated.
"I ended up having four or five sleepless nights after the consult, crying. It became all about money. There was no emotional side of it at all. It was all 'have you got the money to do this, otherwise you're wasting our time'."
"It was completely transactional and it was the most awful experience."
Those barriers pushed him further into advocacy around surrogacy laws in Western Australia.
"I wanted to do it for people to know what the law was and how awful and discriminative it was towards us," he said, "but also hopefully opening a door for us to potentially meet a surrogate."
The state of surrogacy in Australia
Until late 2025, WA's laws barred gay couples from accessing altruistic surrogacy.
While commercial surrogacy — where the surrogate gets paid — is banned across Australia, altruistic arrangements allow for a woman to carry a baby for someone without being financially rewarded. Under this model, a surrogate can be compensated for reasonable medical expenses, but cannot make a profit.
WA previously restricted altruistic surrogacy to married heterosexual couples who could prove medical infertility. This is defined as biological conditions that mean someone cannot conceive naturally. The state's laws were the most restrictive in Australia.
'Social infertility', on the other hand, refers to the social circumstances that present barriers to a couple for having children, for example being part of a same-sex couple.
WA's recent reforms have now removed the requirement for people to prove medical infertility. This means social infertility is now recognised as a legitimate reason to access Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) and surrogacy.
With record numbers of Australians seeking out surrogacy options, the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) is currently reviewing surrogacy laws. Surrogacy in Australia is primarily legislated and regulated at the state level, leading to what many have described as a "patchwork" of laws that can make complex processes even more challenging.
In an attempt to standardise the industry with best practice ethical guidelines, the ALRC has collected the opinions of professionals, community members and industry providers to be delivered to the government in a report in July 2026.
As part of its recommendations, surrogates across the country may soon be compensated up to $2,000 a month for the physical toll of pregnancy.
With 75 per cent of babies born via surrogacy born overseas, the ALRC hopes it will incentivise local surrogates and reduce barriers for intended parents who would otherwise have to look abroad.
For some parents, engaging in international surrogacy can be stressful, and requires dealing with unfamiliar systems, processes and governments.
Anthony and Joseph's international surrogacy journey
When Anthony Fisk and Joseph Huang started their journey to become parents more than a decade ago, they were just one of many gay couples in Western Australia forced to look overseas to have children.
For the couple, pursuing surrogacy abroad became complex and dangerous amid government crackdowns on the practice in Thailand and Cambodia.
Their first daughter was born to a surrogate in Thailand, but during her pregnancy, the country changed its laws and banned surrogacy for foreigners in the wake of the Baby Gammy scandal.
For their second pregnancy, they looked to Cambodia. But while their surrogate was pregnant with twins, Cambodia also cracked down on surrogacy, meaning the couple had to smuggle her out of the country to give birth.
"There were a lot of sleepless nights thinking about it and ensuring that this was the right thing," Anthony told Dateline in 2024.
It was a time fraught with legal risk, emotional and financial strain — all for the dream of growing a family that they couldn't build back home.
"There weren't many other options for us," he said. "I would have wanted it to be different."
But now, after years of agitation, advocacy and debate, the laws around altruistic surrogacy in WA have changed.
How WA's legal reform came into effect
The Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Act was passed in Western Australian parliament on 3 December.
The new legislation aims to protect the best interests of surrogacy-born children, including enabling donor-conceived children to have access to information about their genetic and social heritage.
WA Premier Roger Cook said these changes would "bring WA into line" with the rest of Australia".
When these changes are implemented in approximately mid 2027, WA's laws will align with other jurisdictions, including Victoria, South Australia, NSW, the ACT and Queensland.
Same-sex couples will now be able to pursue surrogacy at home under clearer safeguards and oversight.
The 'help Jay and Jeremy have a baby' campaign
Jay Lazarus unexpectedly became central to the campaign to overhaul WA's restrictive surrogacy laws. He mobilised support through his extensive client list, built up over decades as a hair stylist.
"I sent an email out to my database and the subject was 'Help Jay and Jeremy have a baby'," he says.
"I sent this to 6,000 people. I smashed it on my social media and just got as many people as possible to fill out this form."
The email automatically forwarded to every recipient's local MP, urging them to support the reforms. What began as a personal plea turned into a grassroots lobbying effort that helped turn the tide on WA's laws.
"The traction that we got from it… I think I've just gotten more and more involved, helping out as much as I can on that side — the awareness, getting as many people around Western Australia knowing about us."
When the legislation finally passed, Jay watched years of community effort crystallise into change.
"We've changed it. We've crushed it. We've nailed it. It's happened. And this is going to be the best thing for Western Australia."
He's clear about why it mattered.
"I think a lot of it did come down to discrimination ... So having that completely lifted is just incredible.
"It needed to change."
For Jay and Jeremy, the reform isn't only a legal victory, it's a personal one. The couple are now getting to know a potential surrogate.
"She met our family, we met her kids. We're just getting to know each other. Hopefully in the next few months we'll start our journey."
"It changes a lot of things for a lot of people."

Zelensky: Only Europe is providing funding for Ukraine now
He made the remarks during a briefing in Munich on Saturday, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"First of all, today it is only Europe that is spending money on Ukraine. Let's be honest – our partners from Canada are helping, Japan is providing humanitarian support, but most of the funding comes exclusively from Europe," Zelensky said.
At the same time, he noted that Europe is largely absent from the peace negotiations.
"So far, unfortunately, Europe is not very present in the negotiations. […] By the way, Russia also does not really see Europe at the negotiating table. But this is unfair, because security guarantees from Europe are important for us," Zelensky said.
On February 11, the European Parliament adopted, under an urgent procedure, a package of proposals aimed at supporting Ukraine, including the provision of an EU loan of EUR 90 billion for 2026-2027.
Of this amount, EUR 30 billion will be allocated for macro-financial assistance or budget support to be provided through the EU's Ukraine Facility, while EUR 60 billion will go toward strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities and supporting the procurement of military equipment.

Israeli FM Saar to attend Trump's first Board of Peace meeting on Thursday
Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar will attend US President Donald Trump's first formal Board of Peace meeting on 19 February, two Israeli officials said on Saturday.
US officials told Reuters this week that Trump will announce a multi-billion-dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and detail plans for a UN-authorised stabilisation force for the Palestinian enclave at the meeting in Washington.
Delegations from at least 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting of the board whose creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.
While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western US allies have been more cautious.
The US officials said the meeting will focus on Gaza, where two years of war have left much of the Palestinian enclave in ruins.
Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to Trump's plan last year, with a ceasefire taking effect in October. More than 590 Palestinians have been killed in rounds of violence that have erupted since.
Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, even as Trump's administration has pressed for progress to the next steps envisaged in the plan.
One of those is the deployment of the International Stabilisation Force, as Israeli troops further withdraw and Hamas disarms.
The US officials said Trump will announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilisation force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead.
Hamas has so far rejected demands to lay down its weapons, and Israel has said that if the group does not disarm peacefully, Israel will have to force it to do so.

Canada says no relations with Iran without regime change, mum on support for US strike

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Canada wants a change of government in Iran but would not say whether it would support a US military strike, the Globe and Mail reported on Saturday.
“We will not open diplomatic relationships with Iran unless there is a regime change. Period,” Anand told the Globe and Mail in an interview in Germany, where she is attending the Munich Security Conference.
Canada has particularly poor relations with Iran and cut off diplomatic ties in 2012.
Anand on Saturday announced further sanctions against seven individuals who are connected with the Iranian government and said Canada’s focus in the region is on the repression of human rights.
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if US President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
On Friday, Trump embraced potential government change in Iran as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
Canadian killed in Iranian anti-regime protest, FM says
Last month, Anand announced that a Canadian citizen had been killed by Iranian forces during anti-regime protests in the country.
At the time, Anand extended her “deepest condolences” in a statement released on X/Twitter and announced that Canadian consular officials are “in contact with the victim’s family in Canada.”
She slammed the “Iranian regime’s repression and ongoing human rights violations,” condemning and calling for an “immediate end” to the violence against protesters.
To date, conservative estimates amid the Islamic regime's deadly crackdown on protesters place the death toll between 40,000 and 50,000. While the US-based Iranian rights group HRANA has confirmed just over 7,000 deaths, the group is reviewing an additional 11,730 cases.

'Nothing quite like it': UK Treasure Act names Roman carriage ornament Essex's first 'treasure'

A rare Roman carriage ornament displayed in late January at the British Museum marked Essex’s first archaeological find and is set to be declared a “treasure,” under the 2023 amendment to the UK’s 1996 Treasure Act.
The ornament, made of copper alloy, depicts a panther with its paws atop a bearded man’s severed head, while the back of the panther is hollow and filled with lead.
Under the Act, archaeological finds can be designated as a treasure if they are deemed to be of historical, archaeological, or cultural importance.
The ornament, which was originally found in 2024 by metal detectorists outside the town of Harlow in Essex, has been dated by researchers to circa 43-200 CE.

“The size of the Harlow fitting, and the presence of a motif beneath the front paw are closer to finds identified as fittings which attached the strap linking draught animal collars to the yoke,” according to the government’s official description of the find.
Essex Portable Antiquities Scheme (PAS), a government-sanctioned group dedicated to recording local archaeological finds, announced the ornament’s new status in a January social media post, during an event at the British Museum.
“Big cats represent the power of the Roman Empire, and the paw on the severed head, domination over its enemies,” Essex PAS’s post added, noting that careful blending of Roman and local styles represents the Roman conquest of Britain.
“This is unparalleled in vehicle fittings across the Empire, making this example unique.”
County Finds Liason Officer Lori Rogerson and archaeologist Dr. John Pearce of King’s College echoed the sentiment to the BBC. “There is nothing quite like it in Romano-Britain,” Pearce said.
Rising number of reported archaeological finds in Britain
The ornament was one of 79,616 artifacts discovered by the public and reported to British authorities in 2024, showing a significant rise in reported finds since 2022 and 2023.
“The continued rise in the number of finds reported through the Portable Antiquities Scheme is a testament to the dedication of finders across the country,” Ian Richardson, Acting Head of Portable Antiquities and Treasure at the British Museum, said in a January statement.
“Their responsible reporting allows us to build a richer and more detailed picture of life in the past, while ensuring that important objects are preserved for public benefit.”

German archaeologists discover medieval tunnel system inside Neolithic burial site

A medieval tunnel system, formally known as an “erdstall,” was discovered by the Saxony-Anhalt State Office for Heritage Management and Archaeology (LDA) during excavations near Reinstedt in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany.
The discovery was announced in a January social media post saying that “a very special discovery was documented at the end of 2025 in the area of a Middle Neolithic burial site.”
Erdstalls, a combination of Middle High German’s erde (“earth”) and stelle (“place”), are tunnel systems believed by researchers to have been constructed in the Middle Ages, though their precise dating is a challenge, as they are commonly found empty.
Even so, a horseshoe, a fox skeleton, and the bones of several other small mammals were unearthed in Reinstedt, according to the LDA.
The Spanish-language publication La Brújula Verde (LBV) added that archaeologists had also discovered a layer of charcoal in the erdstall’s lower levels, believing that the fire was “short-lived, perhaps merely a source of light.”
A pile of large stones found by archaeologists near one of the tunnel’s entrances may have been stacked there as a way to seal off the entrance, LBV said.
LBV further noted that the Reinstedt erdstall’s height ranged between “one and 1.25 meters, with a width of between 50 and 70 centimeters, and in some stretches, it featured a gabled, vaulted ceiling.”
According to the LBV, archaeologists also discovered the remains of a possible Bronze Age burial mound near the erdstall and Neolithic tomb.
What were erdstalls used for?
Thousands of similar tunnel systems have been discovered across Europe. Nevertheless, their purpose has been subject to decades of theory and debate.
Some researchers believed that these tunnels were used as temporary hideouts or escape routes, like those used by Jewish rebels during the Bar Kochba revolt.
LBV, however, explained that the late archaeologist Lambert Karner disregarded this theory in his 1903 book “Künstliche Höhlen aus alter Zeit,” claiming that, based on the tunnels’ design, such a use was impractical.
According to LBV, Historian Anton Haschner proposed that the tunnels may have been “empty symbolic tombs, erected by medieval settlers in their new settlements as dwellings for the souls of their ancestors, awaiting the Final Judgment.”
“Other interpretations insist on their possible use for initiation rituals, as places of spiritual retreat, or simply as temporary hideouts for people and valuable goods during periods of instability, although the absence of a second exit complicates this last explanation,” LBV went on.
“Their location, often in the basements of old farmhouses, near churches, cemeteries, or in remote forests, adds further layers of mystery to their original purpose.”

Herzog's camp questions Netanyahu’s role in Trump's 'he should be ashamed' comments

Sources close to President Herzog are demanding clarifications from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu regarding whether he is connected to US President Donald Trump's statement that Herzog "should be ashamed" for not giving the prime minister a pardon.
"If so, this constitutes crossing a red line," the sources said.
On Thursday, in comments to the press, Trump said that Netanyahu should receive a pardon for corruption charges and that Herzog should be "ashamed of himself" for not granting one.
Trump: The people of Israel should really shame Herzog
"I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He's disgraceful for not giving it. He should give it," Trump said at the time.
Herzog's office subsequently responded, reiterating its commitment to examine the pardon request, but only after it had been reviewed by the Justice Ministry, as required by Israeli law.
"President Herzog values President Trump for his significant contribution to the State of Israel and its security. Israel is a sovereign state governed by the rule of law," Herzog's office stated, adding, "contrary to the impression created by President Trump's remarks, President Herzog has not yet made any decision on the matter."
The statement was released as Herzog was mid-flight, returning to Israel after his visit to Australia.
Asked by one of the reporters traveling with him for his personal reaction, Herzog said, “To the best of my recollection, I am the president of Israel.”

Stressed about Lunar New Year? Here are tips to look after your mental health
Unknown

As Lunar New Year approaches, many Asian Australian families are planning an annual gathering to celebrate the festival — but not everyone feels happy about it.
The two-week cultural festival is often considered a time for family reunions, connections and new beginnings, but increased family time can also create pressure and reopen old wounds, according to Maria Cassaniti, manager of the NSW government's Transcultural Mental Health Centre in western Sydney.
"Lunar New Year, similar to other events for different communities … is a time of excitement and celebration for many, but we also know that these kinds of events … can come with [their] own stress," she tells SBS News.
While some multicultural communities may still grapple with stigma about mental health, Cassaniti says many have become more aware of its importance in recent years, including during cultural events such as Lunar New Year.
SBS News has spoken with several psychologists and mental health experts ahead of the festival, which starts on 17 February, about how to look after your mental health during the Lunar New Year. Here are their tips.
From dinner table arguments to inappropriate comments
In China and Vietnam, where people can enjoy a week-long holiday for Lunar New Year, local media have reported on youth disengagement with the traditional festival, citing stress from dealing with family expectations.
In Australia, young people from the Asian diaspora may also find themselves in similar shoes, as their values may differ from those held by older generations who grew up in Asia, says Christopher Tran, a Sydney-based psychologist dedicated to multicultural mental health.
"There's a bunch of things in Asian cultures that don't necessarily make things difficult, but it's interesting when it interacts with the culture we have here [in Australia]," he tells SBS News.
Tran says many of his clients have found it difficult to deal with "personal questions" and comments from family members — on subjects ranging from marriage to career progression — as well as managing family expectations.
Tip: Be prepared, and set a boundary for engagement
If you feel stressed about interacting with other family members, Cassaniti suggests it could be helpful to prepare for questions from senior relatives.
Veronica Ing, a Sydney-based psychologist, also suggests people practise self-soothing exercises to ensure a calm state of mind and increase tolerance for potentially uncomfortable conversations before family dinners.
"Coming in with a higher tolerance means that you're more likely able to deal with any emotional triggers while you're in the presence of your family," she says.
Tran suggests setting a time limit for engagement and considering booking a follow-up event to give yourself an excuse to leave on time.
"The general thing is just remembering that: 'my parents or my uncles and aunties, they carry their own values, their own anxieties, I carry my stuff. I'm allowed to choose how much I let in of this,'" he says.
"And basically it's just about every time they try to shine that spotlight on you, just click it away."
Cassaniti, Ing and Tran say it's also important to keep in mind that people can choose whom they do and don't want to spend the Lunar New Year with.
Loneliness and homesickness
While some Asian Australians face stress from family estrangement, some international students and first-generation migrants living away from their loved ones might feel homesick and lonely during the festive period.
Loneliness has been described as "the silent epidemic" by the Australian Psychological Society. University of Sydney research from 2025 found 43 per cent of Australians aged 15 to 25 feel lonely.
Dr Eric Fu, senior research fellow at the Youth Research Centre at the University of Melbourne, says many young people start university expecting a rich social life, only to find themselves isolated by their living arrangements, which can foster "a heightened sense of loneliness".
He's noticed loneliness has become a "big issue" among Chinese international students in particular, as many struggle to integrate and connect with local communities due to cultural and linguistic barriers.
"Because they are only here for a short period of time, and also they didn't really get the chance to really set their roots into the local community," he says.
Tip: Use social media well, and go for a walk
Fu, who has conducted research about the well-being of Chinese international students in Australia, found many turn to social media to seek interest groups and build connections with peers.
He says students also use social media to stay connected with families, friends and even strangers with similar cultural backgrounds.
"Sometimes even some unknown people clicked a like or collected their notes on Xiaohongshu or WeChat [Chinese social media apps], even that kind of recognition or identification can really play a role for them to really feel less lonely in Australia."
But while agreeing that social media can be a useful engagement tool for students, Fu also warns them to be cautious about online scams, especially if they have recently arrived in Australia.
More importantly, he encourages international students to "leave their accommodation and just go out for a walk" to explore their neighbourhoods and local communities.
"I think that will be a good way, you know, to really overcome that kind of sense of acute loneliness, you know, especially during this kind of traditional Chinese [festival] period."
Tran and Ing also point out that the Lunar New Year could be a good opportunity to build connections, as councils and local libraries often host community events.
Besides staying connected with people in Australia, Ing and Cassaniti also encourage people to use video calls and online chats to stay connected with families living overseas as a way to counter loneliness.
"[Don't] be afraid to reach out and practice being vulnerable when you're initiating contact," Ing says, adding that in some Asian cultures, people may not be used to directly expressing their love and vulnerability.
Gambling
Huangyuan Chen, a counsellor at the GambleAware Multicultural Service, tells SBS News that some members of Asian communities participate in gambling — such as playing mahjong with money — as a means of social connection during festive seasons.
Major casinos in Australia have also invested in Lunar New Year celebrations to try to attract overseas visitors.
Chen says it's key that people maintain control of their behaviours and take strategies to prevent themselves from engaging in problematic gambling.
This could include talking to casino staff to impose a ban on themselves from entering the venues, blocking gambling websites and talking to a gambling counsellor, Chen says.
She says people also need to be mindful of their motivations for gambling and the potential effect on others.
"Think about the people around you, because we know that people can be socially influenced [by] gambling," she says.
"Keep a distance from people influencing you to gamble, or keep away from the social influence, the online influence, and at the same time, spend more time with people with other interests, away from gambling, if possible."
Consider taking leave
Except for Christmas Island, Lunar New Year isn't a public holiday in Australia. But with upcoming gatherings and other cultural practices, maintaining work-life balance can be challenging for those who celebrate amid competing priorities.
Tran suggests people start with the practical steps, such as speaking to their manager.
"That could feel scary, and we don't know exactly if that's going to be successful," he says."But it's worth a try, because there are some workplaces that will actually respect this [cultural festival]."
He says people should weigh up their priorities and focus on what they think is most important.
"If you're leaning on work, then speak to your family and see if you can rearrange things; if you know family is more important, then you might just bite the bullet and just take some leave."
Post-Lunar New Year care
If people find family gatherings during the Lunar New Year stressful, it may be worth considering seeking professional help in the future to unpack the source of pressure, Tran says.
In recent years, there have been practitioner-led initiatives and government-supported multicultural programs that encourage people with multicultural backgrounds to seek culturally inclusive mental health care, with interpreting services available.
But in the case of international students, previous research by Dr Michelle Peterie from the Sydney Centre for Healthy Societies at the University of Sydney shows that international students are less likely to access psychological support services than domestic students, as they may not know about services or worry about the costs.
"There is a real need for government-led, sector-wide action to both address some of the challenges international students face in Australia, and ensure appropriate help is available and accessible when required," she says.

Brumbies shines as Force wilt in the Perth heat

ACT Brumbies defeat Western Force 56-24 in Super Rugby Pacific
In short:
The ACT Brumbies have scored more than 50 points to claim a commanding Super Rugby Pacific victory over the Western Force.
The Brumbies are a perfect six wins from six first round matches against the Force, since the WA franchise joined Super Rugby 20 years ago.
What's next?
The Brumbies travel to Christchurch next week to face the Crusaders, while the Force host the Blues in Perth.
The ACT Brumbies have turned up the heat to blitz the Western Force 56-24 in a sapping season-opening Super Rugby Pacific clash in Perth.
Temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius forced officials to apply heat stress protocols and it was the home side who wilted when it mattered most on Saturday.
The Force relinquished a 10-point lead and conceded 28 straight points mid-match as the Brumbies overcame the loss of a glut of Wallabies stars to once again claim derby bragging rights.
The victory was the ACT's sixth out of six in season openers against the WA franchise, which has yet to make the finals since entering the competition 20 years ago.
Reigning John Eales Medallist Len Ikitau and fellow Test players Noah Lolesio and Tom Hooper departed in the off-season, while fellow Wallabies Tom Wright (knee) and captain Allan Alaalatoa (back) remain sidelined.
But the Brumbies clinically showed the more things change, the more they stay the same as two-time Australian player of the year Rob Valetini led the visitors' fightback in Perth.
While Valetini offered the physical presence and power, fellow back-rower Charlie Cale played a fine role, showing pace and footwork down the left flank to drag the Brumbies into the contest with his side's first try, then turning unlikely provider with another vital second-half try.
The Force had enjoyed all the early running, camping themselves in the Brumbies' half and bagging the opening try through flanker Vaiolini Ekuasi.
A Ben Donaldson penalty goal immediately after the first of two three-minute water breaks skipped the hosts out to a 10-0 lead after 21 minutes.
It took the Brumbies 22 minutes to even enter the Force's quarter but, as soon as they did, Cale crossed.
Livewire flyhalf Declan Meredith then left Wallabies stars Carlo Tizzano and Brandon Paenga-Amosa clutching at air to give the Brumbies a 14-10 halftime lead that never looked likely.
Any home hopes of a second-half turnaround were snuffed out when Rhys Van Nek forced his way over a minute after the resumption and then Cale put Meredith over for his second try with a deft face ball.
Veteran Kurtley Beale did his best to inject some enterprise into the Force's play, combining with fellow former NSW Waratahs playmaker Donaldson to create a try for energetic Argentine lock Franco Molina to briefly cut the deficit to 11 points.
But second tries each for Meredith and Cale, a typically opportunistic strike for speedster Corey Toole and one for fellow winger Ollie Sapsford after the siren secured the Brumbies an emphatic first-round bonus point victory.
On debut for the Brumbies, Wallabies flyhalf and yet another former NSW Waratah, Tane Edmed, nailed his first points for the ACT franchise with three conversions from three attempts after being thrust into the action late on for Meredith.

Damascus, Washington stress Syria's sovereignty, territorial integrity at Munich meeting

Syrian and US officials stressed Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity during talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a Friday Syrian Foreign Ministry statement.
The Syrian delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Asaad al Shaibani, met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss key local and regional developments.
Both sides emphasised the unity of Syria, its sovereignty, and the integrity of its territory. The US reaffirmed its support for the Syrian government.
Washington also expressed support for the recent integration agreement between the government and the YPG terror organisation, as well as Syria’s efforts to combat the Daesh terror group.
Syria formally joined the anti-Daesh coalition last November. The coalition was formed in 2014 and has carried out military operations against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, though Damascus was not previously a member.
The talks also addressed relations between Syria and the US and ways to develop cooperation in various fields.
US reiterates support for stable, peaceful Syria
The US State Department said in a separate statement on Saturday that Rubio affirmed US support for a Syria that is "stable, at peace" with its neighbors, and protects the rights of all its ethnic and religious minority groups.
Rubio "welcomed the Syrian government’s commitment to fully cooperate with the United States and the Global Coalition to Defeat Daesh," deputy spokesman Tommy Pigott said.
The secretary of state also emphasised the importance of implementing the permanent ceasefire and integration agreement in northeastern Syria, and ensuring full respect and safety for the rights of all Syrians, Pigott added.
On January 18 the Syrian government and the YPG reached a comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement, outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.
Syrian security forces and administrative bodies have entered areas previously controlled by the YPG, including Hasakah, Qamishli and Ayn al Arab (Kobani), as well as strategic facilities such as airports, oil fields, and border crossings.
The agreement provides for the gradual handover of security responsibilities, the deployment of state institutions, and the integration of YPG forces into official government structures.
The Syrian Army launched an operation against the YPG on January 16 in areas west of the Euphrates River. The operation later expanded east of the river with the participation of tribal forces, leading to all of the territories previously occupied by the group coming under government control.

Russia ‘will not change,’ leaders warn as NATO allies call for tougher deterrence
Ukraine war 'a total strategic failure from Russia’s part,' says Finnish president
ISTANBUL
European leaders warned Saturday that Russia poses a continuing long-term threat to Europe and must be countered with stronger deterrence and sustained military support for Ukraine, as officials speaking at the Munich Security Conference stressed the need for faster defense investment.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Moscow’s actions show that it is not seeking peace.
“Russia will not change … they are not interested in peace,” she said, arguing that the Western alliance must respond with strength.
She cautioned that Europe faces simultaneous security pressures: “We have an eastern flank … a southern flank … a northern flank … and a flank when it comes to new technologies.”
Frederiksen warned that current defense spending levels may fall short.
“Now we spend 3.5% of our GDP in Denmark on defense. I’m not sure it will be enough,” she said, adding that targets set for later decades could be too slow.
She also dismissed any suggestion of territorial bargaining over Greenland, saying: “If one NATO country attacks another NATO country, then NATO ends. It’s game over.”
Joint defense efforts
Finnish President Alexander Stubb argued that Russia has failed strategically despite the war’s intensity.
“Putin wanted to take over Ukraine … it became European,” he said, adding that Moscow’s goals of preventing NATO expansion and weakening European defense spending also backfired.
He cited battlefield losses to underline his point: “In December, 35,000 Russian soldiers died. In January, 30,000 Russian soldiers died … that’s 65,000 soldiers dead in two months.”
Stubb called the war “a total strategic failure from Russia’s part” and said the allies must act decisively.
Finland, which has the longest border of any NATO country with Russia, held off an invasion by the USSR for three months in late 1939 and early 1940, before surrendering.
Pedro Sanchez, Spain’s prime minister, said Europe must focus on joint defense efforts rather than simply boosting spending targets.
“We need to focus more on not only how much do we spend, but how much do we spend together,” he said. He warned that raising targets too quickly could have unintended consequences:
“If we agree with this idea of 5%, at the end of the day we will become more dependent on the US defense industry.”
Sanchez added that the war represents a broader geopolitical challenge. “This is not only an attack on Ukraine, it’s also an attack against the European Union as a whole,” he said, urging unity among allies.

De Minaur reaches third-straight Rotterdam final

Alex de Minaur through to ATP Rotterdam Open final with win over Ugo Humbert
In short:
Alex de Minaur survived all 10 break points he faced to defeat Ugo Humbert and reach the ATP Rotterdam final.
The Australian has become the first player to reach three straight finals in Rotterdam.
What's next?
De Minaur will face either Alexander Bublik or Felix Auger-Aliassime in the final.
Alex de Minaur has become the first man to reach three consecutive finals at the Rotterdam Open after a display that showcased Australia's lion-heart at his most resolute and resilient.
In a gritty semifinal, de Minaur managed to save all 10 of the break points he faced as the world number eight outlasted French left-hander Ugo Humbert 6-4, 6-3 on Saturday.
De Minaur, who lost in the last two Rotterdam final showdowns to Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, will this time meet either Felix Auger-Aliassime or Alexander Bublik on Sunday in his bid to become Australia's first victor in the celebrated ATP 500 tournament's 54-year history since Lleyton Hewitt back in 2004.
"I'm super proud of the effort," the 26-year-old said.
"Again, a lot of tough moments, a lot of break points, a lot of tricky situations, but I managed to kind of dig myself out of them. Yeah, super pumped to give myself another chance of hopefully getting the title."
It was an afternoon when all of de Minaur's patience and speedy defensive nous was on show, as he was unable to hit his way through Humbert in the slow conditions on the Ahoy Arena hardcourt, managing to hit only three winners all match.
But while the French world number 36 looked to have more firepower, each time he gleaned an opening, de Minaur shut down the break points with the help of fine serving. When he got his own chance, the Australian was ruthless, converting three of his four break points.
"It's hard to get a lot of rhythm against him," de Minaur said.
"It's hard to really feel comfortable, so a lot today was just about trying to be solid, trying to make that extra ball, to keep asking questions.
"It's not every match you get the chance to be aggressive, and today was certainly one where I was not able to do that, but hey, I found a way. And on to the next."
Having lost to the best two players on the planet in his previous finals, he could afford to feel a bit more confident this year — and he reckons he will leave nothing out there.
"The plan is to go for the title. No regrets. Whatever happens tomorrow happens, go for it," said de Minaur, who will be featuring in his 20th ATP final.
"I don't want to leave the court thinking about the 'what ifs'. Ultimately, these are the types of matches you go to to win the title and not hope the other player loses it, and that's going to be my mindset."

10 Surprising Facts About Presidents’ Day
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
19:29:52 UTC
04:29:52 KST

One of the earliest federal holidays enacted by Congress, Presidents’ Day honors the birthday and legacy of the first U.S. President, George Washington.
Observed on the third Monday of February each year, the special day is celebrated through patriotic parades, historical reenactments, and readings of major presidential speeches, including Washington’s Farewell Address.
“It’s a really good opportunity to reflect on the origins of the [presidential] office and what was intended by Washington and the other framers at the Constitutional Convention,” Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon, tells TIME.
Here are 10 facts that make Presidents’ Day a distinct, and often misunderstood, national holiday.
Presidents’ Day goes by another name
Despite its popular moniker, the federal holiday known as Presidents’ Day is officially called “Washington’s Birthday” under Section 6103(a) in Title 5 of the U.S. Code.
“Americans, prior to the revolution, celebrated the King's birthday quite regularly, and they started to transition to celebrating Washington's birthday about halfway through the war,” says Chervinsky. “By 1778, states and localities were celebrating Washington's birthday, largely because it was common practice to have a sort of a birthday celebration, and he was a good stand-in.”
The holiday was established by an Act of Congress introduced by Republican Sen. Stephen Wallace Dorsey of Arkansas and signed into law by President Rutherford B. Hayes on Jan. 31, 1879. Initially observed by federal offices in Washington, it was expanded in 1885 to include all federal offices.
George Washington had two birthdays
Washington was born in Virginia on Feb. 11, 1731, according to the Julian calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar and used throughout the British Empire at the time.
In 1752, Britain and its colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar, introduced by Pope Gregory XIII to correct inaccuracies in the Julian system. The shift moved Washington’s birthday forward by 11 days and into a new year.
As a result, Washington’s birthday came to be recognized as Feb. 22, 1732.
Presidents’ Day never falls on Washington’s birthday anymore
Although the holiday retains its name, Congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1968, shifting several federal holidays to Mondays when it came into effect in 1971.
The goal was to create more three-day weekends and reduce disruptions to the workweek.
Under the law, Washington’s birthday is now observed on the third Monday of February, meaning it does not coincide with Feb. 22.
It was the first federal holiday honoring an individual’s birth date
Although the U.S. now observes other federal holidays spotlighting prominent individuals, such as Martin Luther King, Jr., Washington’s Birthday was the first federal holiday dedicated to a single person’s birth date.
Peter Kastor, a history professor at Washington University in St. Louis, tells TIME that “during the revolution, but especially after his death, Americans concluded that Washington would be their symbol of what the American Revolution and the American experiment was supposed to be.”
After Washington’s death in 1799, his birthday continued to be celebrated informally nationwide for decades before receiving federal recognition nearly a century later.
Washington may not have enjoyed celebrating his own birthday
Historical records suggest that Washington paid little attention to his own birthday.
Domestic accounts from Mount Vernon, his plantation estate, show no evidence of large celebrations or regular family observances.
“He really wasn't much one for celebrations,” says Chervinsky. “For his birthday, he usually wrote down that it was his birthday and acknowledged it. And maybe there was something small among the family, but he was not going to be having lavish birthday parties.”
One diary entry from Washington’s birthday reflects his understated approach.
“About 10 o'clock last night it began to snow and continued to do so all night and till afternoon this day—but as it drifted much the depth cd. [could] not be ascertained. I remained at home all day,” the excerpt reads.
Abraham Lincoln became linked to the holiday
During debates over the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, some lawmakers proposed renaming the holiday Presidents’ Day to honor both Washington and Abraham Lincoln, the 16th U.S. President whose own birthday falls on Feb. 12.
Lincoln’s birthday was already a celebrated day in many states, as people chose to honor his role in preserving the Union during the Civil War and moving to abolish slavery through the Emancipation Proclamation.
“Lincoln became the symbol of the Union and the symbol of personal sacrifice, when he died in office,” says Kastor.
Although Congress rejected the proposed name change in 1968, the association stuck, and many Americans now view the holiday as honoring multiple Presidents.
Retail branding helped popularize the holiday
After the new Monday observance took effect in 1971, some retailers began using the long weekend for promotions.
By the 1980s, “Presidents’ Day Sales” had become a common marketing strategy in the U.S., with targeted advertisements often featuring patriotic imagery such as American flags or depictions of Mount Rushmore.
“Think about how many mattress stores do sales on Presidents’ Day,” says Kastor, noting that the holiday marks the first tentpole event of the year.
Cherry pie is loosely associated with the holiday
Cherry pie has become symbolically linked to Presidents’ Day. The association appears to stem from the famous, but fictional, story of Washington chopping down a cherry tree as a child.
“There is this long-standing story that Americans celebrated Presidents’ Day by eating cherry pie,” says Kastor. “It isn't in the way that people eat pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving. But rather, there's some people who've done it, and these stories that have propagated over time.”
The first seven Presidents weren’t (technically) born in the United States
The Constitution requires presidential candidates to be natural-born citizens. But for the nation’s first six decades, every President had technically been born before the United States even existed.
The first seven Presidents—Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson—were all born before 1776, when the colonies were still part of the British Empire. Their birthplaces later became U.S. soil.
The first President born after the signing of the Declaration of Independence was Martin Van Buren. Born in Kinderhook, N.Y., in 1782, he became the first native-born American President and the first from New York.
The Senate still reads Washington’s Farewell Address each year
In 1796, as his second term in office drew to a close, Washington opted not to seek a third term, announcing his decision in a public letter that became known as his “Farewell Address.” This also established the precedent of a two-term presidency, later formalized in the Constitution.
Each year, the Senate selects one of its members, alternating parties, to read Washington’s 7,641-word address aloud in a legislative session. The practice began on Feb. 22, 1862, as “a morale-boosting gesture during the darkest days of the Civil War.”
At the conclusion of the annual reading, the appointed senator signs a black leather-bound book maintained by the secretary of the Senate, adding brief remarks to memorialize the occasion.
Chervinsky calls the observance “an opportunity to reflect on the best leadership practices and what we can also learn from the darker moments” of U.S. history.
Republican Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi recited the farewell address on Feb. 18, 2025. He said he was “grateful” for the opportunity to read Washington’s words aloud.

Epstein affair: French prosecutors announce special team of magistrates to investigate suspected crimes

The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday, February 14 announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse files relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the office told AFP.
As part of that initiative, they will be reopening their files on the late Jean-Luc Brunel, a former French modeling agency executive. The aim is "to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework," said prosecutors.
Brunel, who had links with Epstein, was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors.
Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children, in what the US authorities ruled was a suicide.
Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.
Three new specific cases
The prosecutor's office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.
At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities. "An investigation is underway to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report," the prosecutor's office stated.
The prosecutor's office has also received a complaint filed by a Swedish woman against Daniel Siad, a model recruiter with close ties to Epstein. She accused him of "sexual acts that she describes as rape and that may have been committed in France in 1990", it said.
The office has also received a complaint filed against French conductor Frederic Chaslin alleging acts of sexual harassment allegedly committed in 2016, it said.
The latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position as the head of a top cultural body, the Arab World Institute (IMA).

New poll says Bad Bunny represents America better than Donald Trump - after president’s Super Bowl rage
About 44 percent of U.S. adults said they approved of Bad Bunny’s historic Super Bowl halftime performance
- Bookmark

A new poll reveals more than 40 percent of U.S. adults believe Super Bowl halftime show headliner Bad Bunny represents America better than the U.S. president.
When asked who “better represents America,” 42 percent of U.S. adults surveyed selected Bad Bunny, while 39 percent chose President Donald Trump, according to a Yahoo/YouGov poll conducted after the Super Bowl. This comes after Trump labeled Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl performance “one of the worst, EVER!”
Last Sunday, more than 128 million people tuned in to watch Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, make history as the first Super Bowl halftime headliner to perform primarily in Spanish.
Despite the backlash from Trump and other conservatives, about 44 percent of U.S. adults said they approved of Bad Bunny’s performance, according to the survey. Meanwhile, about 35 percent said they disapproved and 21 percent said they weren’t sure.
The opinion of Bad Bunny is also party-dependent, according to the poll, which was carried out between February 9-12 and included 1,700 Americans across the political spectrum. Among Democrats, 78 percent see Bad Bunny favorably, compared to just 12 percent of Republicans.
Bad Bunny’s set celebrated his heritage and all countries of the Americas with scenes showing Puerto Rico life, a display of flags and even a wedding, as he was joined by surprise guests like Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin.
The 31-year-old artist performed a selection of his biggest hits, including "Tití Me Preguntó" and "DtMF.” During his performance, a message was displayed across a large screen in the stadium: "The only thing more powerful than hate is love."
When organizers announced Bad Bunny, an outspoken critic of Trump, would be headlining the halftime show, many conservatives were quick to push back. Turning Point USA, a conservative advocacy organization, even announced its own “All-American Halftime Show” to protest Bad Bunny’s performance.
Kid Rock headlined that concert, which was streamed online at the same time as Bad Bunny’s show. An estimated 6.1 million concurrent viewers watched Turning Point USA’s YouTube livestream, according to The Athletic.
Trump slammed Bad Bunny’s performance in a Truth Social post, but made no mention of Turning Point USA’s alternative event.
“It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,” Trump wrote. “Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children that are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”

Zelenskyy says halt to energy infrastructure attacks to be discussed at Geneva talks
Kyiv declines details ahead of US-mediated negotiations with Russia
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said a proposed halt to attacks on energy infrastructure will be discussed at upcoming peace talks in Geneva but declined to provide details, saying the matter will not be addressed publicly at this stage.
Speaking to reporters in Munich, Zelenskyy refrained from elaborating when asked whether the matter would be part of the agenda at the next round of negotiations.
“We will not speak publicly about the energy truce yet,” he said in response to a question from an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent.
Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov also confirmed the issue is expected to be raised.
“This issue will be discussed during the negotiations, but we cannot discuss it publicly,” Umerov said.
An energy truce refers to a mutual suspension of strikes on power plants, transmission facilities and other critical energy infrastructure, which have been frequent targets during the conflict.
Zelenskyy did not specify what such an arrangement could include, as exchanges of attacks on infrastructure continue.
The comments came ahead of a new round of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine scheduled for Feb. 17-18 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Kremlin has said the meeting will take place in a trilateral format involving Russia, the US and Ukraine, without European representatives.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia’s delegation will be led by presidential aide Vladimir Medinsky and described the talks as the next step in a US-mediated process.
Russia and Ukraine previously held two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi in January and earlier this month that resulted in an agreement on a prisoner exchange. Ukrainian officials, including Umerov, have said Kyiv’s delegation has begun preparations for the Geneva meeting with the aim of achieving what they call a sustainable and lasting peace.

Russian Opposition Leader Navalny Poisoned With Deadly ‘Dart Frog’ Toxin, European Governments Say

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in a remote Siberian prison two years ago, was almost certainly poisoned with a deadly toxin found in South American dart frogs, five European governments said Saturday.
A joint statement from Britain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands said they were “confident” Navanly had been poisoned after an analysis of samples taken from his body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine,” and that the Russian government was the likely culprit.
“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin, and it is not found naturally in Russia. There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body,” the statement said.

“Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him,” it continued.
The five countries said they were reporting the case to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, alleging Russia violated the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Russian authorities had previously claimed Navalny, 47, died of natural causes while serving several sentences totaling more than 30 years at a high-security prison above the Arctic Circle.
Navalny rose to prominence as an anti-corruption campaigner and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests, becoming a key opponent of President Vladimir Putin.
Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, appeared at a press conference during the Munich Security Conference alongside European foreign ministers to announce the findings.
“Scientists from five European countries have established: my husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with epibatidine—a neurotoxin, one of the deadliest poisons on earth. In nature, this poison can be found on the skin of the Ecuadorian dart frog. It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death,” she said.
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said the poisoning shows that “Vladimir Putin is prepared to use chemical weapons against his own people to remain in power. France pays tribute to this opposition figure, killed for his fight in favor of a free and democratic Russia.”
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper added: "Only the Russian government had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to use that toxin against Alexei Navalny in prison. We are here today to shine a spotlight on the Kremlin’s barbaric attempt to silence Alexei Navalny’s voice.”
Russia announced Navalny’s death on Feb. 16, 2024, just as that year’s Munich Security Conference opened. On that day, Navalnaya delivered a speech, pledging that Putin “would pay for what they have done to our country, to my family, and to my husband.” After a weeklong dispute over custody, Russia released Navalny’s body to his mother.
Last September, Navalnaya said her team had transferred some biological samples from his body abroad, and two laboratories confirmed he had been poisoned. She described a photograph of her husband’s prison cell showing vomit on the floor the day he died, and said excerpts from official incident reports submitted by five prison officials indicated he suffered heavy vomiting and convulsions shortly before his death.
Six months after his death, Russia’s Investigative Committee declined to open a criminal investigation, citing a combination of medical conditions. Its report listed hypertension, chronic hepatitis, and a damaged vertebra as contributing factors, and claimed a rise in blood pressure disrupted his heart rhythm. One of Navalny’s former doctors called the diagnosis “implausible.”
Navalny had survived a prior assassination attempt in 2020, collapsing on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow after exposure to a nerve agent. He later said he had gathered evidence that Russian security agents had targeted him.
European officials said it remains unclear how the toxin, which is roughly 200 times more potent than morphine, was administered to Navalny.
Navalny’s aides said he was close to being released in a prison exchange when he died. Flowers and portraits of the late opposition leader have appeared in memorials across Europe, including outside the former Russian consulate in Frankfurt, highlighting international outrage over his death.

Russia bewildered by Baku claims of ‘deliberate’ Russian attacks on embassy in Kiev — MFA

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Russia has expressed its bewilderment over Baku's claims of allegedly deliberate Russian attacks on the Azerbaijani embassy in Kiev, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry's statement to TASS.
"We are perplexed by Baku's assertions regarding purported deliberate Russian missile strikes on the Azerbaijani embassy in Kiev," the Ministry stated. "We would like to remind you that the Azerbaijani side was promptly provided with necessary clarifications. Specifically, on November 21, 2025, during a conversation at the Russian Foreign Ministry, Azerbaijan's ambassador to Moscow expressed sincere regret over the damage to the buildings and grounds of the Azerbaijani diplomatic mission in Ukraine. It was also noted that the damage to the Azerbaijani diplomatic mission’s compound in Kiev was likely caused by a malfunction of Ukrainian air defense systems, presumably the impact of a Patriot missile."
The statement further emphasized, "The Azerbaijani side was once again informed that during the special military operation, the Russian Armed Forces are targeting legitimate military objectives, such as Ukrainian defense industry facilities, including those situated in Kiev. When planning strikes, combat data is meticulously monitored to minimize civilian harm, and the locations of foreign diplomatic missions are carefully taken into account."
In this context, it was particularly emphasized that claims of the allegedly targeted missile strikes on Azerbaijani facilities in Ukraine are untrue. "Attention was also drawn to the fact that the Kiev regime, in violation of international humanitarian law, continues to deploy military installations, including air defense systems, in residential areas, thereby endangering the civilian population. The Russian side believes that Ukraine's military-political leadership must bear responsibility for any consequences of such criminal actions," the Russian Foreign Ministry concluded.

Police said the family has requested privacy to grieve.
In a shared statement, the family said: “Demi was a beloved daughter, granddaughter, sister, cousin and niece. Demi loved her friends, and she was loved by all.”
Inquiries are ongoing and police have asked anyone with information including CCTV or dashcam footage to get in contact quoting log reference 2600 046 163.
The Welsh ambulance service also attended the incident.

Swiss say Oman to host US-Iran talks in Geneva next week
Switzerland said Saturday that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
"Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran," a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.
On 6 February, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic Republic.
Go-between
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
Renowned for its neutrality, Switzerland has been representing US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
In its role as the so-called protecting power, Switzerland has for decades allowed the two feuding nations to maintain a minimum of diplomatic and consular relations.
The Swiss embassy in Tehran handles all consular affairs between the United States and Iran, including passport requests, altering civil status and consular protection for US citizens in Iran.
Under the protecting power mandate, "Switzerland can either offer to act as a go-between on its own initiative or can fulfil this function at the request of the parties concerned, provided that all those involved agree," the foreign ministry says on its website.
The United States will be holding separate talks, also in Geneva next week, between Russia and Ukraine.
Moscow and Kyiv will hold US-brokered talks on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Swiss city, both countries have said, announcing the next leg in fraught negotiations seeking to end the four-year war.
Trump is pushing to halt the conflict, but two previous rounds of US-mediated talks in Abu Dhabi have not yielded signs of a breakthrough.

Bill Maher makes crass comparison between Taylor Swift’s exes and her fiance Travis Kelce
‘That second she got some old school wood from the Heartland, it was game over,” Maher quipped
- Bookmark

Bill Maher didn’t hold back while comparing Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriends and her fiance, NFL star Travis Kelce.
During Friday’s episode of Real Time With Bill Maher, the host was monologuing about sexual intimacy rates among Americans and the rise of the “romantasy” book genre — which often features mythical creatures as part of a love plot — when he broached the topic of Swift and Kelce, who announced their engagement in August 2025.
Describing the plot of one such novel in the popular genre, Morning Glory Milking Farm, Maher said: “One thing leads to another and she winds up f****** a guy who’s half bull ... which brings me to Taylor Swift.”
As a photo of Swift and Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, flashed on the screen, Maher continued, “Hear me out. I think Taylor Swift epitomizes the journey a lot of women have been going through. Yes, women wanted men to be more sensitive — sensitive, but not some noodle-bodied human turtleneck who wears the same clothes they do.”
“Taylor Swift went from writing songs about what a d*** this guy was to her, and what a d*** this guy was to her, to what a d*** this guy has,” Maher continued, seemingly referring to Swift’s song “Wood” from her latest album, The Life of a Showgirl. “She dated a procession of skinny, gay-adjacent, meek porcelain doll, shy guy, twink-like, tortured poet metrosexuals in America and Europe. But that second she got some old school wood from the Heartland, it was game over,” he added.
The ninth track on the pop star’s latest album, which launched in October, is replete with sexual innuendos about how Kelce’s love changed her life.
“Forgive me, it sounds cocky / He ah-matized me and opened my еyes / Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see / His love was the key that opened my thighs,” Swift, 36, sings in the post-chorus.
“And baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious (Superstitious) / The curse on me was broken by your magic wand (Ah) / Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck / New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood),” continues Swift, referencing Kelce’s popular New Heights podcast. “I ain’t gotta knock on wood.”
Kelce shared his verdict on the tune during an October episode of his podcast, hosted alongside his brother, Jason Kelce, saying: “It’s a great song!”
Jason later gave his seal of approval as well, saying: “I think inserting wood innuendos is always childish enough for me that I can get on board with that.”

Venezuela frees 17 political prisoners, opposition movement says
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 14 - Venezuela on Saturday freed 17 political prisoners, the human rights committee of opposition movement Vente Venezuela said in a post on X.
CLIPPVE, a nongovernmental organization, separately reported the release of the political prisoners, who included 10 men and seven women from the Zona 7 Prison in Caracas.
Relatives outside the prison joined a hunger strike initiated by prisoners after only 17 of more than 50 detainees were released, human rights groups said.
CLIPPVE said the protest is a demand for the government to fulfill a pledge made last week by Jorge Rodriguez, head of Venezuela's National Assembly, to grant liberty to everyone held at the center.
Venezuela has been gradually releasing detainees following the January 3 capture of President Nicolas Maduro by the United States, though the process has drawn criticism from rights groups and families who say the pace has been slow and lacks transparency.
The releases come after Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday postponed a debate on an amnesty bill that is meant to grant immediate clemency to individuals jailed for participating in political protests.
Rights group Foro Penal says it has verified more than 430 releases of political prisoners since January 8, though it does not include those moved to house arrest in its count.
The group estimated on Saturday that more than 644 political prisoners remain jailed, a figure that includes 47 people whose whereabouts are unknown and 57 people recently reported as prisoners.
The government denies holding political prisoners and says those jailed have committed crimes. Officials have given a much higher figure of releases - nearly 900 - counting liberations from previous years in their figure.
The government has never provided an official list of how many prisoners will be released, nor who they are. REUTERS

MUNICH, Germany — The U.S. is being much less offensive at this year’s Munich Security Conference but one of Europe’s top Trump whisperers sees it as a shift in tone, not substance.
“American foreign policy has changed,” Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland and occasional golf buddy of President Donald Trump, said in a live interview with POLITICO, pointing to the U.S. National Security Strategy that reserved some of its harshest remarks for American allies in Europe and recent messaging from senior officials.
The American approach combines ideology and hierarchy, he said: “One is ideological: It’s very MAGA … and then the second strand is America First.”

French prosecutors announce special team to analyse Epstein files
The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday announced it was setting up a special team to analyse files relating to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and investigate suspected crimes involving French nationals. As part of that initiative, they will be reopening their files on the late Jean-Luc Brunel, a former French modelling agency executive.
The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday announced it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
With Epstein's known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents by the US authorities, the prosecutor's office said it would also thoroughly re-examine the case a former French modelling agency executive Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the American financier, who died in custody in 2022.
The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor's office told AFP.
The aim is "to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework", it said.
Read moreNew conspiracy theories hold that Jeffrey Epstein is alive and well
Brunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors. The case against him was dropped in 2023 in the wake of his death, with no other person charged.
Prosecutors said an investigation had showed Brunel was "a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein" who had offered modelling jobs to young girls from poor backgrounds.
He had engaged in sexual acts with underage girls in the United States, the US Virgin Islands, Paris and the south of France, they said.
Ten women had made accusations against Brunel, several describing how they had been led to drink alcohol and had been subjected to forced sexual penetration, according to the prosecutor's office.
New cases
Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.
The prosecutor's office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.
At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities.

The latest release of Epstein files has led to French former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position as the head of a top cultural body, the Arab World Institute.
Lang has however denied any wrongdoing, saying he was "shocked" that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company Epstein founded in 2016.
The office of the national financial prosecutor said it had opened a preliminary investigation for "aggravated tax fraud and money laundering" against Lang and his daughter Caroline Lang.
Following this announcement, Lang resigned from the presidency of the Arab World Institute (IMA).
Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children, in what the US authorities ruled was a suicide.

Trump made the remarks Thursday, shortly after Netanyahu departed Washington at the end of a brief visit. "The Israeli president should be ashamed that he has still not granted a pardon to Prime Minister Netanyahu," Trump said.
Herzog heard the comments while flying back to Israel from a multi-day state visit to Australia. He responded in an official statement, saying: "Israel is a sovereign state."
On Friday, Trump was asked again about the issue and said he was convinced that Netanyahu would receive a pardon.
Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry is expected in the coming days to transfer its legal opinion regarding a possible pardon for Netanyahu to the President's Residence, where the Pardon Department operates. The opinion is being formulated by representatives of the attorney general, the State Attorney's Office and the ministry's Pardon Department.
As of now, no official response has been issued by Netanyahu or by the Likud party. However, sources close to Likud estimate that the prime minister is expected to contact Herzog this week in an effort to ease tensions.

With Brazil entering the joyous throes of Carnival, Alpine ski racer Lucas Pinheiro Braathen on Saturday gave it another reason to celebrate — an Olympic medal.
It was the first-ever medal at the Winter Games for any country in South America. And not just any medal: Gold.
The win for the 25-year-old known in Brazil as “O cara do ski” — the skiing dude — happened on the first full day of Carnival, the pre-Lenten party that fills city streets with revelers drinking and dancing to their hearts' content. Even if lots of ordinary Brazilians were more preoccupied with that bacchanal, Pinheiro Braathen's gold-medal glory bumped Carnival news from top spots on major news websites and many commemorated. It was another in a series of recent scores for Brazil on top global stages that have provided what some view as long-overdue acclaim.
“This has become one of my top five Brazil gold medals in Olympic history, no doubt,” radio host and sports fanatic Thiago Varella, 41, told The Associated Press from Campinas, a city where Pinheiro Braathen has relatives and took several childhood vacations. “He will be our skiing dude forever. Even people who don’t understand the sport now will come to admire his story and his Brazilian-ness.”
In Milan, several hundred fans packed into Brazil House, a gathering spot organized by its Olympic committee. They erupted, toasting their beer bottles and singing soccer-style chants with Lucas' name. Michelin-starred Brazilian chef Raphael Rego distributed warm cheese bread, traditional breakfast fare back home, before dancing to samba alongside Bruno Fratus, a bronze-winning swimmer in Tokyo’s Summer Games. Wearing green-and-gold, many joined a conga line led by Ginga, the Brazilian Olympic team’s mascot.
“We’re used to this feeling a lot in (soccer), sometimes in volleyball, but, you know, it’s a winter sport, it’s a snow sport,” said Aline Fialho of Recife, in Brazil's northeast. “We don’t have snow in Brazil, so it’s a little bit surreal, but I feel very proud.”
Waking up to a win
The soccer-mad nation of 213 million excels at sports in the Summer Olympics, but not so for those on ice and snow. So Pinheiro Braathen and skiing were unlikely to have been at the top of most Brazilians' minds even in a non-Carnival weekend.
Still, the nation started getting excited as it woke up to the possibility of his achievement. At 6 a.m. local time Saturday, the country’s dominant TV network, Globo, was showing alpine skiing alongside Carnival coverage.
After his second and final run, Globo played a song that many Brazilian men, women and children know, bringing home his victory's importance. “Tema da Victoria” ("Victory Theme," in Portuguese) was the soundtrack after every win by Formula 1 driver Ayrton Senna, a national hero and three-time champion who often challenged and defeated European rivals.
“It is a Brazilian Carnival in the Italian snow!” said TV Globo commentator Paulo Andrade.
In Rio de Janeiro, people were split between curious and celebratory.
Driver Alexandre Novais heard about the skier competing in Italy, but didn't know his name. Stopping at a gas station in Rio’s up-market Ipanema neighborhood, he was impressed that anyone from Brazil could compete in the snow — a far cry from the 30 Celsius degrees (86 Fahrenheit) in Rio. Pinheiro Braathen until 2023 competed for Norway, switching to Brazil last season and adding his mother’s surname.
“I heard of him, I am glad he won," said Novais, 35. "I'm more of a soccer fan, but anyone who chooses to be Brazilian deserves our support.”
Nathalia Martínez, a 25-year-old Colombian in Rio for Carnival, was in her hotel’s lobby when people started screaming with joy. She said she felt proud to see the Brazilian cry as he tried to sing the national anthem.
“That’s 100% Latin America. No Norwegian athlete would be so emotional on the podium. I can say I felt a little represented by him, too,” Martinez said. “I'm really curious to see whether Brazilians will start wearing skiing gear as Carnival costumes.”
Another big win for Brazil on a global stage
Pinheiro Braathen, 25, has embraced his Brazilian heritage, giving interviews in Portuguese and decorating his helmet with “Vamos Dançar” — “Let’s Dance”. He has said his start in sports came from soccer, not skiing, and that his first hero was the World Cup-winning Ronaldinho.
Pinheiro Braathen’s quest for Olympic glory forms part of the nation’s recent achievements on the world’s biggest stages. Many Brazilians have lamented that the country and its cultural makeup and output have long gone underappreciated. There's even an infamous term that for decades encapsulated what writer Nelson Rodrigues perceived as Brazil’s sense of inferiority compared to other nations: “mongrel complex." He coined it in 1950, following the national soccer team’s humiliating World Cup loss at home.
That has been changing. The feature film “I’m Still Here” had box office success at home and abroad, and its nomination for three Academy Awards created something of a frenzy ahead of the awards ceremony last March. It won best international feature, giving Brazil its first Oscar. This year, the film “The Secret Agent” has been nominated for three more, including best picture and best actor.
Pinheiro Braathen’s supporters in Milan said he has helped Brazil gain recognition beyond its usual claims to fame.
“We are showing that we are more than samba and football,” said Giovana Biondo, who is from Sao Paulo and volunteering at the Games. “We love both and we are still very good at both. But I think it’s really sending a message to the whole planet that we are more than the Carnival.”
After his win, Pinheiro Braathen told Globo that he wanted to share his victory with everyone cheering for him in Brazil.
“This can be a point of inspiration for the next generation of children, showing them that nothing is impossible. It doesn’t matter where you’re from. What matters is what’s inside. What the heart does," he said. "I bring Brazilian strength today to bring this flag to the podium. This is Brazil’s.”

When antisemitism becomes normal, what comes next?

Antisemitism has risen to such high levels around the world that William Daroff says he does not know if there will ever be a moment when Jews can declare victory. The best they can hope for, he told the ILTV Podcast, is to reach a point where Jews can say “that people feel a little safer.”
Daroff, the CEO of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, is in Israel for the group’s annual event, which kicks off on February 15. He visited the ILTV studio to discuss the state of world Jewry in the aftermath of October 7, pointing to the “metastasizing of antisemitism and Jew hatred to a point where it is normalized in a way that also wouldn’t have been fathomable 10 years ago.”
He described the situation as “incredibly troubling” and warned that the “biggest danger” for Jews is when any level of antisemitism becomes acceptable, especially when there is a belief that as long as it stays at a low simmer, it can be managed.
“I think what we’ve learned since October 7 is that there is no baseline that’s acceptable,” Daroff told ILTV.
According to Daroff, antisemitism has increasingly shifted to focus on Israel. While openly attacking Jews is no longer socially acceptable in many spaces, attacking Israelis often is. He said antisemites now hide behind what they call “legitimate criticism” of Israel, but stressed that it is not legitimate.
Since October 7, Daroff said many progressive Jews in the United States have become politically homeless, feeling alienated both from the Democratic Party and from more conservative figures like President Donald Trump.
“I think there are moderates in both parties who are looking to try to engage and bring a bigger audience towards them,” Daroff said. “I think in the mainstream in both parties there are leadership roles that [Jews] can take and are taking. I think that it is incumbent upon all of us, but particularly those who are involved in both parties, to say that this antisemitic, anti-Israel filth on the far left of the Democratic Party and the far right of the Republican Party are totally unacceptable.”
Watch previous ILTV Podcasts:
At the same time, Daroff noted reports suggesting that as many as one-third of Jewish voters in New York supported Mayor Zohran Mamdani, who is openly anti-Israel and, some argue, antisemitic. Daroff said he believes the figure is somewhat lower, but said the result highlights a deeper political failure.
“You cannot beat someone with no one,” he said.
Daroff added that “with all due respect to Mayor [Eric] Adams and Governor [Andrew] Cuomo, they were both flawed candidates, particularly flawed against a young, charismatic candidate with no negative record.”
He said the two older leaders were running against someone who promoted ideas like unicorns, free rent, and free buses, without facing serious scrutiny.
“If there had been a credible opposition, I think there would have been a credible campaign against him,” Daroff said. “It is troubling that his statements and beliefs weren’t disqualifying, but I think given the opposition, we didn’t give the voters of New York really a fair shot at voting up or down on Mayor Mamdani.”

Will Warsaw become the seat of a new EU agency? To be decided in March

Warsaw is one of the candidates for the location of the new EU Customs Office. In the background, however, there is a political battle and a race against a gigantic technological challenge.
At stake is prestige, hundreds of jobs and influence over how the European Union will protect its economic borders for decades to come. The new office is expected to be operational this year and will become fully operational two years later.
Who will Warsaw face?
The list of candidates is long. In addition to Warsaw, the following are Liège (Belgium), Malaga (Spain), Lille (France), Zagreb (Croatia), Rome (Italy), The Hague (Netherlands), Porto (Portugal) and Bucharest (Romania).
Each city plays its own card. The Hague is promoting closer ties with Europol. Belgium and France are betting on logistics.
Poland is bringing geopolitical and operational arguments to the table: Warsaw is already home to the EU border agency Frontex, and the Polish government argues that, in an age of hybrid warfare, security and the synergy among these institutions are key.
The argument is simple: since customs officers and guards are fighting the same threats, they should work side by side.
Why is it worth the effort?
"On the one hand, hosting the headquarters of the EUCA offers more opportunities to actively participate in the process of reforming the customs union. On the other hand, it is an economic growth opportunity for the host city," Małgorzata Krok, Plenipotentiary of the Minister of Finance and Economy for the application to establish the headquarters of the EU Customs Authority (EUCA), told Euronews.
"The new agency means increased business and tourist traffic, as well as the arrival of EUCA employees with their families. The EUCA is expected to eventually employ 250 people, but this number may increase in the future," she said.
"Warsaw offers direct flights to all EU countries, as well as to candidate and partner countries. The synergy with Frontex, the proximity to all types of border crossings and the experience of our administration in customs matters and the creation of large-scale tax and customs IT systems, create optimal conditions for the development of the EUCA," Krok added.
Polish diplomats also point out, behind the scenes, the weaknesses of rivals, noting that being a logistical hub for e-commerce, like Belgium or the Netherlands, in the era of the flood of cheap parcels from Asia can be a burden.
Poland's biggest rival, however, is identified as France, which has been courting the agency for quite some time.
Not only taxes, but also security and technology
"The role of the tax collector has evolved into a guardian of the single market, the competitiveness of the economy and the security of citizens. It's not just a question of smuggling or terrorism, but product compliance," Magdalena Rzeczkowska, former Minister of Finance, added in an interview with Euronews. Rzeczkowska also previously managed the National Tax Administration and observed the evolution of customs from paper declarations to the digital age.
The former minister draws attention to our asset, namely the Frontex seat. The argument about the synergy of institutions is considered crucial, especially in the context of the security of the eastern flank: "We are talking about integrated border management, and this synergy is an important element. It is at the interface of the work of these institutions that security can really be built."
Furthermore, the former minister points out that EUCA will also be a technology hub. "It should definitely not be officials in a suit, for the reason that the main task will be not only to build but also to maintain the EU Customs Data Hub," she points out.
Rzeczkowska is echoed by Minister Krok: "The heart of the current customs reform will precisely be the data hub. The agency itself, on the other hand, will be the brain, analysing customs issues and risk at the EU level. With this, the agency has the potential to become a research and development centre in the customs area."
What is the Customs Data Hub?
The struggle for localisation is only one dimension of the story. The real challenge is what the EUCA is supposed to manage: The EU Customs Data Hub.
Experts call this system the 'nervous system' of the new customs union. Instead of 27 separate national systems, the Union wants to create a single, unified database. This is supposed to enable real-time tracking of goods and the detection of dangerous products using artificial intelligence.
The reform is being driven by the crisis. According to European Commission forecasts, 5.6 billion parcels, the vast majority of which come from China, were expected to enter the Union in 2025. The current system is inefficient, and customs officials themselves are unable to physically control such a mass. The result? Europeans lose billions of euros in unpaid customs duties and taxes. It is this system that the new authority aims to seal.
However, business warns: without cooperation with the private sector (courier companies, e-commerce platforms), the construction of the 'Data Hub' could end up paralysing trade. The logistics industry has warned that the deadlines for implementing the changes are very tight and that the technical specifications remain unclear.
The industry itself adds that, without consultation with practitioners, the ambitious digital reform could lead to bottlenecks that will hit European consumers. At the same time, the Polish bid relies precisely on the argument that only a 'digital stronghold' with experience in crisis management will bear the burden.
This is why Warsaw, in fighting for the EUCA, is bidding not just to host officials, but to be the operational centre that must bear the biggest customs reform in the history of the European Union.
EUCA. The backstage of the competition
And what does the behind-the-scenes look like at the moment? Here, Minister Rzeczkowska is under no illusions about the nature of the choice of seat: "At the end of the day, it will be a political decision, although it shouldn't quite be. We should look from the point of view of the independence of the institution".
"We made a conscious decision to run for this office because we believe that it is in Warsaw that it will develop best. We are now actively persuading the decision-makers to do so," indicates Krok, recalling that the decision will be made by the EU Council and the European Parliament.
The final verdict will come in March 2026. That is when it will become clear whether Brussels prefers to bet on the proven trade routes of the west or on a digital shield on the eastern flank - and whether the centre of gravity is finally shifting to the east in Europe's new architecture.

MUNICH, Germany — The U.S. is being much less offensive at this year’s Munich Security Conference but one of Europe’s top Trump whisperers sees it as a shift in tone, not substance.
“American foreign policy has changed,” Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland and occasional golf buddy of President Donald Trump, said in a live interview with POLITICO, pointing to the U.S. National Security Strategy that reserved some of its harshest remarks for American allies in Europe and recent messaging from senior officials.
The American approach combines ideology and hierarchy, he said: “One is ideological: It’s very MAGA … and then the second strand is America First.”

Ilia Malinin crashed during the men's figure skating free programme, ending his medal hopes.
Alpine skiing legend Lindsey Vonn broke her left leg in the women's downhill, while Liu Jiayu injured herself in a fall during the women's snowboard half-pipe qualifying.
This photo gallery, selected by the Associated Press, highlights some of the most spectacular falls of the Milan Winter Olympics.
The most shocking event in the figure skating arena
Malinin, the heavy favourite for gold, experienced a catastrophic collapse during his free skate on Friday
Malinin attempted his signature quadruple Axel but "popped" the jump, being able to complete only a single rotation. He followed this with two more falls on quadruple Lutz attempts. As a result, he finished in 8th place, nearly 30 points behind the gold medalist, Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan.
Malinin was visibly distraught, telling reporters that the "pressure of the Olympics really gets you" and admitting he felt overwhelmed before his music even started.
Lindsey Vonn’s heartbreaking comeback
At 41 years old, Alpine skiing legend Vonn’s highly anticipated Olympic return ended in tragedy on the Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina d'Ampezzo.
Just 13 seconds into her downhill run on Sunday, Vonn clipped a gate with her right arm, sending her pinwheeling down the slope at high speed. She was airlifted from the mountain and underwent surgery in Treviso for a complex tibia fracture in her left leg.
While the crash likely marks the final end of her competitive career, "no regrets" about attempting the comeback, Vonn posted on social media that

Netanyahu to skip Trump's Gaza summit, Sa’ar to attend

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend next week’s Gaza Board of Peace summit in Washington, with Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar set to represent Israel instead, officials said.
Netanyahu’s office announced Wednesday, during his visit to the United States, that he would not travel to the summit and would participate remotely in the annual policy conference of AIPAC. Both events were seen as politically sensitive for the prime minister.
At the AIPAC conference, Netanyahu had been expected to speak alongside opposition leader Yair Lapid. The Gaza Board of Peace includes a number of Arab and Muslim leaders and senior officials, including representatives from Turkey and Qatar.
Sa'ar’s participation comes amid concerns in Jerusalem about possible external pressure to impose a Gaza settlement under terms the government views as unfavorable.
Last month, after the names of members of the Gaza Executive Board were made public — including officials from Turkey and Egypt — Netanyahu’s office said the composition had not been coordinated with Israel and ran counter to its policy. The prime minister instructed Sa'ar at the time to raise the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
The summit is scheduled for Thursday. According to Reuters, U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce a multibillion-dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and outline proposals for a UN-authorized stabilization force for the Palestinian enclave.
Delegations from at least 20 countries are expected to attend, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar. One official described contributions to the reconstruction effort as “generous,” adding that the United States had not formally requested donations. “People came to us and offered,” the official said.
Trump is also expected to announce that several countries plan to provide thousands of troops to the stabilization force, which could be deployed in Gaza in the coming months, officials told Reuters.
A key concern is the disarmament of Hamas fighters, who have shown resistance to relinquishing their weapons. Under Trump’s Gaza plan, members of the terrorist group who commit to peaceful coexistence and disarmament would be granted amnesty, while those seeking to leave Gaza would be given safe passage to host countries.
The summit will also include detailed briefings on the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, established to replace Hamas in the territory’s day-to-day civilian governance. The committee announced its members and held its first meeting in January.
Additional updates are expected on humanitarian aid to Gaza and on plans to establish a local police force in the enclave.

UK premier, EU Commission chief agree Europe must step up toward 'more European NATO'
Keir Starmer, Ursula von der Leyen reaffirm commitment to continue work to bolster collective defenses 'in face of growing threats to European security'
LONDON
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed that Europe must step up efforts to build a stronger European pillar within NATO while safeguarding transatlantic ties, according to a statement on Saturday.
Meeting on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, the EU Commission chief and the British premier reaffirmed their commitment to continue work that will bolster collective defenses "in the face of growing threats to European security."
"They agreed that Europe needs to step up and work towards becoming a more European NATO, while protecting our strong transatlantic ties," Starmer's office said in the statement.
Sharing his "high ambition" for the future UK-EU partnership, Starmer set out his desire for further integration across the economy, defense, and technology.
During the meeting, the pair committed to take forward further work ahead of the next UK-EU summit and also agreed to double down on existing negotiations to reach a food and drink deal which could lower prices.
In his address at the conference earlier on Saturday, Starmer said Europe must focus on decreasing "some dependencies," and called for creating a "more European NATO."

Hundreds of thousands gather in Munich demanding regime change in Iran amid ongoing protests

Hundreds of thousands gathered in Munich to stage a major demonstration against the brutalities of the Iranian government amid ongoing nationwide protests. The protest comes as world leaders convene in the southern German city for a conference on global security.
Some 200,000 people demonstrated on Saturday against Iran's government on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference where world leaders gather, answering a call from Iran ’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for cranked up international pressure on Tehran.
Protesters carried placards, waved flags, banged drums and chanted for regime change as they participated in the protest Pahlavi described as a “global call to action” to support Iranians from abroad amid their continued struggle in the ongoing anti-government protests.
“Change, change, regime change” the huge crowd chanted, waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems, the flag Iran used prior to the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.
Pahlavi warned as he addressed the Munich conference on Saturday of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch" following Iran’s deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked.
He added that the survival of Iran's government “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”
Pahlavi also praised the US for its supportive stance towards the protesters and urged President Donald Trump to make good on his promise to deliver help to them during their time of need.
He also thanked Trump for his decisive action after the US president announced on Friday that he had ordered the deployment of a second aircraft carrier group to the region, as his administration continues to weigh military action in Iran.
At the Munich rally, demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again" red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by Trump and his supporters.
Many waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran’s deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in the country’s future.
“We have huge hopes and (are) looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator who travelled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.
“There is an internet blackout and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.
Protests in Iran started in late December over the declining economic conditions and the collapse of the country’s currency, the rial. Demonstrations were met with brutal crackdown, triggering nationwide demonstrations against the government.
Protests have by eyewitness accounts been extremely deadly, with many protesters saying dozens were being killed, assaulted or arrested daily.
It’s unclear how many precisely have died in government crackdown on protests so far. Some activist groups estimate the death toll to be nearing the 30,000 mark, while more conservative estimate have them hovering around the 7,000 to 10,000 mark.
The government, who have not released official figures, denounced the estimates being floated by activist groups, saying the numbers are being “politicised” to stir chaos, but did acknowledge that several thousand people were killed in clashes with security forces.

The ‘grey divorce’ phenomenon doesn’t signal a retreat from love. It’s a redefinition of it | Lisa Portolan
Unknown

As Valentine’s Day approached this week, we were once again flooded with the usual suspects: roses, chocolates, sophisticated dinners and glossy ads featuring young heterosexual couples staring earnestly into each other’s eyes. The problem isn’t just that this version of romance is exclusionary – though it is – it’s that it’s profoundly out of step with how love is actually being lived, negotiated and reimagined in contemporary Australia.
Culturally, love has long been framed as a pursuit of the young. From Romeo and Juliet to Normal People, from Bridget Jones to When Harry Met Sally, romantic fulfilment is depicted as something you secure early; ideally before your knees give out or your mortgage locks in. The message is consistent: find love in your twenties or thirties, settle down, and then coast (emotionally paired and narratively complete) until death do you part.
That story no longer holds (if it ever truly did).
In Australia, people over 50 are one of the fastest-growing cohorts actively seeking love – or, at the very least, rethinking what intimacy, partnership and companionship might look like in the second half of life. This shift isn’t marginal, it’s structural.
New research shows that close to a third of Australian divorces now occur after the age of 50; a phenomenon known as “grey divorce”. While overall divorce rates have declined since their 1990s peak, separations among over-50s have bucked that trend. Empty nest syndrome, financial pressures and retirement adjustments are all major drivers, but beneath these factors lies something deeper: a recalibration of expectations about happiness, fulfilment and selfhood later in life. For many, the end of a long marriage isn’t a failure. It’s a reset.
This is where our cultural narratives lag behind reality.
In my research on dating, gender and intimacy, I found that ideas about love remain stubbornly temporal. There is still a perceived “right” time to marry, a sense that one should sow wild oats before settling down in one’s late twenties or early thirties. Miss that window and the language turns anxious: you’ve “missed the boat”, done things “out of order” or fallen behind the life schedule.
For people dating in their 50s and beyond, that temporal anxiety is amplified. They are acutely aware that they are out of sync with the story they were promised, and yet, paradoxically, often far more intentional about what they want.
What became clear in my research is that older Australians come to love differently. Many women in their 50s, in particular, are seeking connection and companionship without cohabitation. They are reluctant to merge households, unwilling to take on unpaid caring roles for a new partner, and wary of financial entanglements that could jeopardise hard-won stability. This isn’t emotional coldness; it’s structural realism.
After decades of gendered labour – caregiving, part-time work or interrupted careers – many women enter later life with less superannuation, fewer assets and greater financial vulnerability. Add to this rising rates of homelessness among older women, and the romantic ideal of “starting over” through shared property or pooled finances begins to look less like love and more like a risk.
Men and women do not arrive at later-life dating on equal footing, and pretending otherwise only reinforces outdated ideals of romance that no longer serve anyone.
Then, there’s the dating landscape itself. For many over-50s, dating apps arrived suddenly and without warning; a brutal technological intervention into a world where courtship once involved friends, workplaces or chance encounters. For some, apps offered an unexpected abundance: a buffet of possibility, a way back into desire. For others, the swipe-and-discard logic felt alienating, even dehumanising, a sharp departure from slower and relational forms of connection.
Still, people adapt.
What’s striking is that despite the upheaval, many older Australians report being content on their own. Over half say they are satisfied with single life, particularly women, who cite independence, peace and personal space as key benefits. This doesn’t signal a retreat from love. It signals a redefinition of it.
We’re already seeing cultural green shoots. Programs like The Golden Bachelor have drawn large Australian audiences, suggesting a hunger for romantic stories that don’t centre youth. More broadly, as generation X moves into its 50s and 60s – the same generation that rebranded parenting, ageing and even grandparenthood (goodbye “Grandma”, hello “Gigi”), it’s unlikely they’ll accept inherited scripts about love without revision.
Love is about to be shaken up again.
The challenge now is to let our cultural narratives catch up with our social realities. Love doesn’t expire at 40. Romance isn’t invalidated by divorce. Intimacy doesn’t have to mean cohabitation, financial merger or lifelong sacrifice. For a growing proportion of Australians, love in later life is about alignment rather than aspiration, companionship rather than completion.
Love doesn’t belong to the young, and the sooner we rebrand it the better off we’ll all be.

The moment I knew: as soon as we parted I realised Hitomi was the one. I waited years to see her again

In my early 20s, I quit my job in New Zealand and moved to Sydney to study martial arts. In 1982, after competing in the World Pugilist championships in Hong Kong, I hitchhiked around Japan for a month or so, then headed for Korea via ferry in January of 1983. I’d heard air fares were cheap from Korea. No internet back then!
While boarding, I was approached by a very attractive Japanese woman, with limited English, who told me that if I bought one box of bananas and a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black label, I could pay for most of my trip in Korea. These items were very much in demand back then.
Her name was Hitomi. We ended up talking on the ferry – I had absolutely no Japanese, and she was learning English as a hobby. She and her friend were travelling to Korea to buy clothes and accessories to sell in Japan. I didn’t know anything about Korea, so she suggested we travel together.
We stayed in Busan for a week, then in Seoul for another. Together, we’d visit local temples or Busan Tower. We’d just met – I didn’t think there were any romantic feelings.
It turned out air fares were expensive in Korea, so Hitomi suggested I come back to Japan and spend some time in Miyazaki, Kyushu, where she lived with her mother. They lived in a valley, surrounded by rice paddies and koi ponds, with no other residences for a kilometre or so. Life was very simple. Hitomi’s mother was amused by me, and treated me well – at the time.
Hitomi and I spent a lot of time traveling around Kyushu, visiting older people living on their own, others living with disabilities. She would often bring small gifts. I was becoming very attracted to her kindness, her always-cheerful personality, her lilting voice and laugh. She was beautiful on the inside and out. One local told me they thought she was an angel.
One day we visited Takachiho, a famous mountain gorge. Because of the snow and ice, we decided to spend the night in a local tavern. That night she asked me when I would return home. I told her I was falling in love with her and wanted to stay longer. She said: “Me too!” I had no idea she felt the same way, and was ecstatic. We kissed. It was soft and delicate, just like her.
Eventually my visa ran out and I had to return to Australia. She came as far as Narita to see me off; we kissed forever and I almost missed the plane. We had plans for her to come to Australia as soon as she was able. I wasn’t thinking as far as marriage – this whole affair was completely unexpected for us both– but we were keen to see where it would lead.
As soon as I got back I realised Hitomi was the one. We had the odd phone call – expensive back then, so we primarily communicated through letters, in English. I have no idea how much she understood my writing although I tried to keep it as simple as I could, and I had an enjoyable but often difficult time understanding what she had written. All that mattered was the “love you” at the end.
She was trying hard to come to Australia but her mother was dead against it. So after a year I went back to Japan and hitchhiked down to a business hotel in Kyushu. Hitomi was working late, and I was just waiting in my room for her to arrive. There was a knock on my door. I opened it and she rushed into my arms, and a year’s worth of feelings spilled out. It was not a very romantic place, but I’d already decided I was going to ask her to marry me. And she said yes.
Her mother did not approve. Looking back, I can understand: I was an unknown quantity, a foreigner who was possibly going to take her daughter away. If Hitomi and I were going to be together, I would have to come to Japan.
I went back to Australia to start applying for a visa. Unbeknownst to me, her mother was burning all my letters, and hung up whenever I tried to call.
When I finally arrived back in Japan in 1988, I couldn’t contact Hitomi at all. She’d entered a singing competition, won a recording contract, and was travelling the country as a professional singer. Her manager and mother were blocking my attempts to contact her – their verdict was Hitomi had obligations and I would just complicate things.
This was a gut punch. Knowing I wasn’t welcome in Miyazaki, I stayed in Tokyo, enrolled in Japanese language school, and worked in pubs, pachinko parlours and gyms.
One day a mutual friend called: Hitomi is in Tokyo and wants to meet you. We met at Shinagawa station in a coffee shop. We hadn’t seen each other in years. She had matured, and was as beautiful as ever, with her same sweet voice and manner. By this time, my Japanese was better than her English and she was pleasantly surprised. After that, we rekindled our relationship very quickly. We were madly in love. We were now 30 years old and, according to her mother, no one else was going to marry a woman that old!
In 1990, seven years after we first met on that ferry, we had a wedding ceremony in a beautiful old church in Thames, New Zealand. Hitomi wore a white wedding dress, then later changed into a kimono, which certainly turned heads in my small home town. Hitomi’s mother wore a kimono too – she’d come to accept that we could never be apart. My parents were totally enamoured of Hitomi, and said to me on the day: “If you stuff this up, don’t bother coming home!”
We built a beautiful life together in Japan, with our two sons, and supported each other through thick and thin.
Hitomi passed away three and a half years ago. I consider myself lucky that we were able to find each other again, after so many years apart. We always said it was fate that we boarded that ferry. If we had a choice, we would have married much earlier. For 40 years, I could never take my eyes off her. She was always the most beautiful woman in the room.

Rubio gives Europe a Valentine’s bouquet, but the roses still have thorns

Rubio gives Europe a Valentine’s bouquet, but the roses still have thorns
What a difference a year makes. Or does it?
Twelve months ago, US Vice President JD Vance stormed into the Munich Security Conference, warning Europe that it was destroying democracy with its restrictions on free speech, censorship of social media and embrace of unvetted immigrants who didn’t share its way of life.
His dark speech, just weeks after his ascension to power, alarmed his European audience and put them on notice that under President Donald Trump, “there is a new sheriff in town”.
This year, the messenger was different - Secretary of State Marco Rubio - and so was the rhetoric. “The United States and Europe, we belong together,” Rubio said. “Ultimately, our destiny is, and will always be, intertwined with yours. We know that the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own.”
Rubio directly repudiated what he said were headlines suggesting that the US sought to end the transatlantic alliance. “This is neither our goal nor our wish,” he said. “For us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
MSC chairman Wolfgang Ischinger, a former German ambassador to Europe, told Rubio there was an audible “sigh of relief” running through the room during his speech, characterising it as a “message of reassurance”.
That might be a case of hearing what you want to hear.
Rubio’s language may have been more conciliatory than Vance’s, but he hit upon much the same themes and priorities.
If Americans could sometimes seem “a little direct and urgent in our counsel”, Rubio said, it was only because they were so profoundly concerned about Europe’s direction.
Most pressing was the scourge of mass migration, which was not a fringe concern of little consequence but “a crisis which is destabilising societies all across the West”.
Controlling migration was not hateful or xenophobic, Rubio said. Rather, “the failure to do is not just an abdication of one of our most basic duties owed to our people, it is an urgent threat to the fabric of our societies and the survival of our civilisation itself”.
It was not dissimilar to what we heard from Opposition Leader Angus Taylor in his first pitch to the Australian public on Friday, vowing to shut the door to migrants who “hate our way of life”.
Rubio was scathing about what he described as a western civilisation that was racked by guilt and shame, rather than being proud of its history, ancestry, language, Christian faith and shared sacrifices.
The West was also too fearful, he said: fearful of war, fearful of technology and fearful of climate change - which he described as a “cult”, echoing the language of his boss.
The so-called rules-based global order, which prioritises a set of international laws and norms above the use of raw power, was an “overused term”, Rubio said. The notion of a world without borders, where everybody was a global citizen, was “a foolish idea [that] has cost us dearly”. And the notion of free and unfettered trade was a delusion that had been exploited by the West’s adversaries.
Where Rubio differed slightly from Trump and Vance was the extent to which he conceded the same errors had been made by the United States.
“We made these mistakes together,” he said. “And now together we owe it to our people to face those facts, to move forward and to rebuild.”
Rubio’s remarks came hot on the heels of arguably the most consequential recent speech on the world stage - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s declaration at Davos last month that there had been a “rupture in the world order”, and that middle powers like Canada or Australia had to forge a new path.
Although Carney didn’t mention Trump by name, he was clearly taking aim at the US president’s upheaval of global norms and institutions.
Rubio said those old institutions did not need to be dismantled, but they needed to be reformed and rebuilt. He pointed to the impotency of the United Nations, arguing it played “virtually no role” in forging the ceasefire in Gaza, pursuing peace between Russia and Ukraine, constraining Iran’s nuclear ambitions or ending the tyranny of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro - all of which were led by the US.
“In a perfect world all of these problems would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world,” Rubio said.
One might quibble with how the US has gone about its actions - especially its handling of Russia and Vladimir Putin - but Rubio has a point when he says Washington is the one horse that’s always trying.
Appearing on a later panel in Munich, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles was asked about the apparent death throes of the rules-based world order.
He said it was never the case that rules, and the enforcement of them, could be separated from pure power. But he seized on Rubio’s remarks as a happy middle ground.
“What Secretary Rubio said today was that there is an order which we should not be removing - repairing, but not removing - and I think it is well to remember that,” Marles said. “We should not easily cede the idea of what rules can do.”
Neither Europe nor the rest of the world should think they are off the hook. Rubio speaks with more diplomatic graces than Vance, but the substance is the same.
He may have handed Europe a Valentine’s Day bouquet, but the roses were still full of thorns.

Rise of Australia's public economy compares to mining boom of the 2000s

analysis
Rise of Australia's public economy is comparable to the mining boom of the 2000s, analyst says
You can't say the Albanese government didn't warn us.
Three years ago, after its 2022 election win, the government drew attention to some huge structural shifts that were hitting Australia's economy.
In its first major budget, it dedicated an entire section to talk about them: "Structural shifts shaping the economy."
"The Australian economy is changing in profound ways, with implications for society, policy, and public finances," it warned.
"While there are many structural shifts shaping our economy, this statement focuses on three, common across many advanced economies: the growing care and support economy; our expanding use of data and digital technology; and climate change and the net-zero transformation."
The government was signalling that its policies would be adapted to those long-term trends.
Fast forward three years, and what do we see?
Australia's care economy (childcare, aged care, disability care, etc) is expanding significantly to meet the needs of our population, and that has big implications for measured "productivity" and our public finances.
The global AI-race has become so intense that water-hungry and energy-hungry data centres are a new form of currency, in the ruthless war for data dominance, and it's sparking legitimate fears about the reality of the western surveillance state and Silicon Valley's techno-feudalism.
And the problems posed by climate change and the net-zero transformation are clear.
Should we pretend these things aren't happening?
Long-term trends, short-term spikes in inflation
That's why it was refreshing to see Westpac senior economist Pat Bustamante circulate a note on Friday that reminded everyone that long-term structural shifts have gravitational forces that are hard to escape.
In case you missed it, in recent weeks, there has been a heated debate in the daily news cycle about the return of inflation in Australia and the Albanese government's spending choices.
Economists and politicians have been arguing about public and private spending, and how public and private demand contribute to aggregate demand, the output gap, and inflation.
But some participants in the debate appear to have amnesia about the government's warning (from three years ago) that big structural shifts would dominate our economy in the coming years.
Those structural shifts are part of today's inflation story, too.
Thankfully, Mr Bustamante has reminded us that long-term trends are much bigger forces than any short-term spike in inflation.
"Australia is undergoing one of the largest structural changes in modern history, comparable in scale to the mining investment boom of the 2000s," he pointed out.
"Public spending now generates a record 35 per cent of domestic output, around 7 percentage points higher than a decade ago, and is linked to nearly 40 per cent of total employment.
"This shift is not inherently negative. However, it carries important macro implications."
What's he talking about?
As big as the mining boom
Mr Bustamante says a big expansion in public spending started in Australia a decade ago, it accelerated sharply during the pandemic, and persistently elevated public spending on expanded government programs since then has pushed the public footprint even higher.
See the chart below.
He says that increase in public spending means a greater share of the economy's resources is being directed toward the provision of public services, and a huge labour market reallocation has taken place that is "substantially larger" than occurred during the mining investment boom.
"Reflecting this expansion, public spending has generated an estimated 2.3 million additional jobs over the past decade, around 40 per cent of which are in market sectors," he says.
"Around 1.3 million of these jobs are attributable to the increased public share of economic activity, with the remainder driven by population growth.
"The breadth of these effects highlights that public spending influences labour market outcomes well beyond the non-market sector, with important implications for capacity, skills demand and wage dynamics."
See the impact on employment in the chart below.
He says the growth in public spending is also contributing to capacity constraints in sectors such as construction, health, education, and rental and real estate services.
He says with less spare capacity available, those sectors have a reduced ability to accommodate an upswing in private demand without generating upward pressure on prices and wages.
"This is consistent with the persistence of inflationary pressures in housing related costs, construction inputs, and health services," he says about our current problem with inflation.
A broader conversation, deeper understanding
Now, Mr Bustamante says the infrastructure pipeline in Australia appears to have peaked at a high level, and that may mean that the public share of construction output will gradually decline.
He says as we saw in the mining investment boom in the early 2000s, the resulting capital deepening that will result from that surge in infrastructure spending should support higher productivity levels for our economy.
But he says the large increase in employment in the care economy will weigh on labour productivity for a time, given how labour-intensive the childcare, aged care, and disability care sectors are.
He says he also thinks the expansion in public spending will probably peak in the next 12 months (roughly), although he says that forecast could be wrong.
But overall, his analysis helps to put things into better perspective.
The big expansion in public spending in Australia started a decade ago, and it has accelerated since then. It may be peaking soon. It is connected to some huge structural shifts in the economy, but it is also contributing to capacity constraints.
At the same time, the RBA has been trying to keep unemployment as low as possible without contributing to inflationary pressures, but it admits that it's a risky strategy that may be making the economy more susceptible to demand-side shocks at the moment (and more inflation-prone).
How much can we blame the Albanese government's spending choices for the pick-up in inflation in the second half of 2025?
This is not to say that it can't blamed.
But a good discussion about today's inflation would reference some of those big long-term economic trends that are grinding away in the background, which are changing the structure of the economy, alongside the daily inflation politics.

Zelensky hopes French support will not decline after Macron leaves office
He made the remarks during a briefing in Munich while responding to a question about Macron's term ending next year, Ukrinform reports.
"Emmanuel is with us. One year is still, essentially, a quarter of this war – it is a long period. I hope we can end this war within a year. Of course, much depends on the leader, but no less depends on public support. I believe the people of France support Ukraine and do not support Putin. That is why we count on this support and hope it will not decrease," Zelensky said.
At the same time, he noted that it would be a serious problem if France's future leader were to promote Russian narratives.
Macron was re-elected for a second consecutive term as President of France in 2022. His term is set to expire in May 2027.

More than 50,000 Israeli military personnel hold at least one additional foreign nationality, according to figures published Saturday by daily Yedioth Ahronoth based on official army data.
The newspaper said the information was released in response to a freedom of information request filed by the transparency advocacy group Hatzlacha.
Army data show that 50,632 soldiers have foreign citizenship alongside Israeli nationality. Of those, 12,135 hold US citizenship, the largest share by a significant margin, followed by 6,127 with French nationality and just over 5,000 with Russian citizenship.
The figures also include more than 3,000 soldiers holding German nationality and a similar number with Ukrainian citizenship. Over 1,000 troops apiece hold British, Romanian, Polish, Ethiopian, and Canadian citizenship, while the remainder are distributed among other countries.
According to the disclosure, 4,440 soldiers hold two foreign citizenships in addition to Israeli nationality, and 162 hold three foreign nationalities.
The report noted that the request was submitted nearly a year ago, in March 2025, marking what it described as the first detailed public breakdown of foreign citizenships among Israeli military personnel. The army did not clarify whether the data cover active-duty troops, reservists, or both.
Israeli media estimates put the number of active-duty soldiers at roughly 170,000, with some 400,000-460,000 registered reservists.

Chinese police detain woman over fake AI-generated video of Shanghai road collapse

Chinese state media said that a widely shared video purporting to show a major road collapse in Shanghai was generated by artificial intelligence and was false.
A 49-year-old woman, identified only as Luo, was placed under administrative detention for spreading the misinformation, according to a notice from a local branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau cited by the Global Times.
Luo was accused of “claiming a partial ground collapse in a metro construction site in Shanghai to attract followers, causing adverse social impact,” the notice said.
The video circulated widely on social media Thursday and Friday. It claimed that a partial ground collapse had occurred at the construction site of the Jia-Min Line metro project in Shanghai’s Jiading district. The post also alleged it was the second such collapse risk in less than four months, according to the notice.
“After verification by the public security authorities, the information was found to be fake,” the notice said on Saturday.
Shanghai Metro said on its WeChat account that a localised leakage occurred on Wednesday on the Jia-Min Line. No casualties were reported.
On Thursday afternoon, however, Shanghai Shentong Metro Group told reporters that a collapse had occurred at the site in the same area as the leakage the previous day.
The area was sealed off and no one was injured, the company said. The cause remains under investigation.

US-Iran talks to resume in Geneva as tensions simmer

Switzerland announced Saturday the resumption of talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, as Washington presses Tehran to reach an agreement aimed in part at limiting its nuclear program.
“I confirm that the Sultanate of Oman will host discussions next week in Geneva between the United States and Iran. Switzerland welcomes and supports these talks,” a Foreign Ministry spokesperson told AFP, without specifying a date.
“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” the spokesperson added, noting that the ministry “is in contact with the parties and has reiterated its readiness to support any diplomatic initiative aimed at promoting de-escalation.”
On Feb. 6 in Oman, discussions were held between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, accompanied by Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Those talks were conducted indirectly, under Omani mediation.
Trump has recently focused military threats on Iran’s nuclear program, which U.S. forces struck in July during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran.
On Friday, the U.S. president openly raised the possibility of regime change in Iran, saying “that would be the best thing that could happen.”
Shortly beforehand, he confirmed that a second U.S. aircraft carrier would be sent to the region “very soon.”
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the United States for decades.
Known for its neutrality, the country has represented U.S. interests in Iran since Washington severed relations following the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after Iran’s revolution.
It allows for the maintenance of minimal diplomatic and consular relations between the two countries.
The Swiss Embassy in Tehran handles all consular matters between the United States and Iran, including passport applications, civil status changes and consular protection for U.S. citizens in Iran.

X removes verification badges from Iranian officials after sanctions report
Platform faces scrutiny over alleged paid services to sanctioned figures
ANKARA
The US social media platform X has removed blue verification badges from the accounts of several senior Iranian officials following a report alleging the platform provided paid services to individuals under US sanctions.
The move came after the Tech Transparency Project said X was offering its paid X Premium service to Iranian figures subject to US restrictions.
Accounts that lost verification included Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, Judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei and Ali Larijani, secretary of the country’s Supreme National Security Council.
US sanctions on Iran prohibit American companies from conducting business with certain individuals and entities. X has not publicly commented on the removals.
The platform, owned by Elon Musk, previously replaced the Iranian flag emoji on its web platform with an older flag used by pro-monarchy groups opposed to the country’s current leadership.
Last month, amid a wave of protests in Iran, X updated the design of the Iran flag emoji shown on its web platform, replacing the emblem of the Islamic Republic with the older Lion and Sun symbol used by pro-monarchy groups.

Ukraine wants 20-year US security guarantee to sign peace deal

Ukraine wants security guarantees for a minimum of 20 years from the US before it can sign a peace deal with dignity, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of talks with Russia and the US scheduled for next week.
Speaking in Munich on Saturday, he also called for a clear date for Ukraine to be allowed to join the EU. Some EU officials have put the date as early as 2027.
Speaking to the annual Munich security summit, Ukraine’s president said he hoped “the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all of us but, honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things”.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” he added.
The issue of Europe’s frustration with a perceived US reluctance to spell out the security guarantees it is prepared to offer Ukraine in the event of a peace deal, and the need for the guarantees to be spelled out before an agreement is signed, likely remains the biggest wound in the badly fractured relationship between the US and Europe.
In a speech that was welcomed by European leaders keen to see any sign of a thaw in the relationship, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, put forward an offer to work in partnership with Europe.
However, this proposition, he stressed, was highly conditional and the US would go it alone if Washington’s highly Trumpian conditions were not met on climate, migration and tariffs.
Using a diplomatic tone that the US vice-president, JD Vance, shunned in his speech at the conference a year ago, Rubio said “Europe and the US belong together”.
He added that the US was ready to undertake the task of rebuilding the world order alone if necessary, but “we prefer it – and hope – to do it together with you, our friends in Europe”.
He made almost no reference to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, besides claiming that the US had pressed India to stop importing Russian oil, a claim Russia disputes.
At a press conference in Munich, Zelenskyy said the US had told him that if Ukraine withdrew from the Donbas, peace would come as quickly as possible, but he insisted this concession was not possible since Ukrainians live there.
He disclosed that the US had so far offered a 15-year security guarantee, but Ukraine wanted a minimum 20-year, legally water-tight agreement, setting out the specific help the US would provide to a planned European reassurance force due to be put inside Ukraine in the event of a peace deal.
Details of a so-called prosperity plan whereby the US would have access to Ukrainian mineral resources had not yet been exchanged, Zelenskyy said.
He also queried why the head of the Russian negotiation delegation had been changed, saying he feared it meant the Russians were playing for time, rather than shifting strategy.
Zelenskyy also complained about Europe having been practically absent from the table. “That’s a big mistake, in my opinion,” he said, a view that was shared by the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi.
On Friday, Donald Trump called on Zelenskyy to “get moving” to reach an agreement with Russia.
Zelenskyy insisted that the elections that the US has pressed Ukraine to hold by 15 May can only take place two months after a ceasefire is declared, to ensure voters have adequate security.
Trump has been trying to put pressure on Zelenskyy to agree a deal within months, but has not spelled out the consequences if Ukraine is not sufficiently flexible for the US.
Zelenskyy also said the Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy plants would be raised in the talks in Geneva, adding that not a single energy plant inside Ukraine had now been left unscathed.
European leaders appear gloomy that a diplomatic breakthrough will be secured, with the consensus being that Vladimir Putin is not yet economically or militarily exhausted.
Zelenskyy said his ambition was to lift the number of Russians killed or seriously injured to 50,000 a month.
One European leader predicted at least another two years of war, and insisted Europe had the resources to sustain Ukraine for that long.
Zelenskyy also mounted a fierce attack on the Iranian regime for providing the Shahed drones that had caused so much damage inside Ukraine.
With as many as 200,000 protesters attending a demonstration in Munich calling for the Iranian regime to be toppled, Zelenskyy said: “We have never had a conflict of interests with the Iranian regime.
“But the Iranian Shahed drones they sold to Russia are killing our people and destroying our infrastructure.”
He argued that if Iran is given time, it will cause more destruction. “Regimes like the one in Iran must not be given time. When they have time, they only kill more.
“They must be stopped immediately, and this is exactly what should have happened with the Ayatollah after all the wars his regime unleashed and all the lives it took.”

Cynical Pakistan fans brace for heartbreak in India T20 World Cup match
As the match approaches, Pakistani fans hope and pray for their team to flip the script against their rivals.
Karachi, Pakistan – As rain and thunder threatened to disrupt their team’s T20 World Cup match against India on Sunday, Pakistan’s cricket fans are bracing for a different storm – the now-customary loss against their archrivals at global events.
Pakistan have not beaten India in the tournament since 2021 when they recorded a solitary win in eight T20 World Cup encounters against their formidable opponents.

Despondent fans have now shifted from anticipating a thrilling, unpredictable game to praying for a miracle as Salman Ali Agha’s team step on the field at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
Pakistan’s latest “win” came in the form of a move to boycott the match on political grounds. Despite the eventual reversal of the decision after weeklong negotiations with the International Cricket Council (ICC), the initial decision to not take the field against India was seen as a triumph by cricket fans in Pakistan.
Despondent or optimistic, fans still eager for match
Escalating political tensions between the South Asian neighbours have seen a decades-old sporting rivalry turn into an ugly debacle both on and off the pitch with customary handshakes avoided and light jibes replaced by controversial hand gestures invoking their most recent armed conflict in May.
Politics and sport blur boundaries on both sides of the border, making these fixtures an exhibition of nationalistic pride that can sometimes turn distasteful.
The pre-match jingoism in Pakistan, though, was short-lived. It has been replaced by bitterly disappointed fans airing their thoughts in the form of self-deprecating memes or reels depicting the “foolishness” of a section of fans expecting a win.
“We’ll have heartbreak on February 14 and 15,” read the captions of several social media posts set to melancholic songs on Valentine’s Day, the eve of the match.
Supporters – both hardcore and casual – will religiously watch the three-plus-hour encounters. Come 6:30pm (13:30 GMT) on Sunday, the public will be glued to screens across the country to watch the high-stakes match.
Roadside tea stalls will be thronged by male spectators filling up wooden benches, plastic chairs or squatting on their haunches in front of small TV screens.
Food delivery riders busy with an overflow of match-day meal orders will occasionally halt their journeys to catch a glimpse of the action on their phones or through restaurant windows.
Upscale eateries will bring in large screens and host groups of young fans and families.
Domestic responsibilities will be wrapped up before the start of the match, and extended families will gather around a living room TV with drinks, snacks and feasts of biryani.
The weekend – now the standard time that all India-Pakistan matches are played for economic and logistical reasons – will offer some respite from an otherwise hectic schedule of school and office routines that throw the heaving metropolis of Karachi into transport turbulence.
India favourites, but Usman Tariq could spin a win
Despite the days of anticipation and hours spent preparing for the showpiece, fans remain realistic in their expectations.
On a balmy late Friday afternoon in Karachi as life gradually returned to its normal pace after an hour-long pause for midday prayers at mosques across the city, a group of young law students picked up their kits for a local league match.
“It’s looking 70-30 in India’s favour,” Talha Bandayal, a law student, told Al Jazeera as he watched his teammates play a cricket match in their local lawyers league at the historic Karachi Parsi Institute on Friday.
Bandayal and his friends plan to watch the match at a restaurant in one of Karachi’s posh localities.
“It’s a Pakistan-India match. We’re excited regardless of the result!”
Syed Ahmed Shah, who officiated the league match as a third umpire, was more sceptical of the team’s chances and more in tune with the country’s overall opinion of Pakistan’s expected performance.
“Sport is just like politics in our country,” a bespectacled Shah opined dryly to everyone’s amusement, drawing comparisons between the nation’s two most favoured topics.
“India is far superior to us, not just in cricket but everything,” Shah told Al Jazeera.
Cricket analysts have appeared on national talk shows throughout the week, dissecting the team’s shortcomings, the Pakistan Cricket Board’s organisational failures and the squad’s weak mental fortitude for a match of this proportion.
Local cricketers like Bandayal have been analysing Pakistani players’ strengths and weaknesses. Usman Tariq’s unreadable spin action and variations are being seen as Pakistan’s secret weapon.
When life comes to a standstill
When it comes to off-field behaviour, though, India’s trend of avoiding handshakes with Pakistani teams has been frowned upon.
“Politics should strictly be kept separate from sports,” a local cricket coach who requested anonymity said of Suryakumar Yadav and his team’s controversial actions from the Asia Cup last year.
“But if India takes that stance, Pakistan also needs to have some self-respect and respond accordingly,” the 46-year-old coach said.
Admittedly, the handshake row has taken centre stage in a fixture that has historically been remembered for scintillating bowling performances, swashbuckling innings or nail-biting finishes.
When Pakistan awakes on Sunday morning, most cricket fans will begin their day by playing their own cricket games – whether in narrow neighbourhood streets or vast, dusty fields hosting multiple matches simultaneously. As the evening draws closer, the clothes will be dusted off and equipment packed away for the showdown in Colombo.
Just as the hustle and bustle of life gave way for prayers two days earlier, the India-Pakistan match will do the same.
After all, it’s only cricket and Friday prayers that can bring life to a standstill in Pakistan.

Sánchez warns against nuclear rearmament in Munich and calls for 'moral rearmament' against Putin

The Spanish president participates in the Munich Security Conference for the first time and questions the rearmament strategies of the powers. Faced with Putin, he advocates investing in values instead of nuclear arsenals.
On Saturday, Pedro Sánchez stepped onto the stage of the Munich Security Conference for the first time as Prime Minister of Spain. He did so with a speech that clashed head-on with the current trend among world powers. His message was direct: nuclear rearmament will not protect anyone from Vladimir Putin.
The figures Sánchez used put his argument into context. The powers spend more than $11 million every hour on nuclear weapons. The US alone will spend $946 billion on nuclear weapons over the next decade.
"This is enough to eradicate extreme poverty in the world," the Spanish president pointed out. To this, he added concern about artificial intelligence applied to the nuclear arsenal, a factor he considers particularly dangerous.
Sánchez quoted Ronald Reagan to reinforce his position: "A nuclear war cannot be won." He did not frame the debate as an ideological question of left or right, but as a practical choice between paths that lead to real security and those that do not.
European military engagement without vassalage
Sánchez made it clear that rejecting nuclear rearmament does not mean neglecting defence. Spain has tripled its military spending and doubled its deployed troops, in his own words. He backed the creation of a true European army and assured that his country "will collaborate with whatever is necessary."
The context of the conference was particularly tense. Europe and the United States are at one of their most divisive moments, with Marco Rubio representing the Trump administration.
Other leaders present, such as Finland's Alexander Stubb and Denmark's Mette Frederiksen, unambiguously advocated increasing defence spending and sending more weapons to Ukraine. Stubb even responded indirectly to Sánchez's comments by recalling that Finland joined NATO to be a "security provider, not a consumer."
A strong EU in the face of those who see it as a threat
The Spanish president spent part of his speech denouncing that there are sectors in the US that perceive the EU as a threat rather than a partner. "Some would like to see a more fragmented EU," he said, although he was convinced that European countries are working in the opposite direction.
The Spanish president has been one of the most critical leaders of Donald Trump since his return to the White House. He defends the transatlantic link, but without implying what he himself has called "vassalage." In Munich, he insisted that Europe must enlarge the Union to include Ukraine, carry out internal reforms and increase its economic competitiveness.
The conference, held since 1963, brought together some 200 government representatives from 120 countries this weekend. Sánchez was the first Spanish prime minister to take part in the forum, which this year was held amid the most serious diplomatic tensions between the two sides of the Atlantic in decades.

German defence minister: Security guarantees for Ukraine must not become another Budapest Memorandum
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has stressed that future security guarantees for Ukraine must not meet the same fate as the Budapest Memorandum.
Source: Pistorius on Saturday during his speech at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Pistorius noted that as the potential ceasefire approaches, it will be necessary to ensure that any peace is lasting.
"We will have to protect Ukraine from any potential future aggression by Russia. For this major task, Ukraine needs substantial and reliable security guarantees," the German defence minister emphasised.
He recalled that Marco Rubio pointed out in the US Senate in 2014 that the 1994 Budapest Memorandum had failed to fulfil its purpose and did not protect Ukraine, as Russia invaded and annexed Crimea.
"So the lesson for us, ladies and gentlemen, must be that we must not allow another 'paper tiger' like the Budapest Memorandum. And in order to provide credible security guarantees, all of us – all of us, both Europe and the United States – must contribute. Europe and Germany are ready to do their part," Pistorius said.
Background:
- During a panel discussion earlier on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expressed scepticism about Russia's willingness to engage in genuine negotiations and warned the West not to misjudge Moscow's intentions.
- During a visit to Kyiv, Rutte stressed that Ukraine's partners, just like Ukrainians themselves, "would not want a second Budapest Memorandum or another 'Minsk'."

Olympic organizers promise Valentine's weekend restock after condoms run out

Olympic villages ran out of free condoms. Organizers promise a Valentine's weekend restock.
On Valentine's Day at the Milan Cortina Olympics, a renewed supply of free condoms for the athlete villages was promised by the organizers after going short during the week.
"We can confirm that condom supplies in the Olympic Villages were temporarily depleted due to higher-than-anticipated demand," the Italian organizing committee said in a statement Saturday. "Additional supplies are being delivered and will be distributed across all villages between today and Monday."
Providing condoms for athletes has been a gift from organizers — and a constant fascination to the world — for decades.
While 300,000 condoms were provided for more than 10,500 athletes at the 2024 Paris Summer Games, the original stock was much lower for these Winter Games.
"I think 10,000 have been used, 2,800 athletes — you can go figure, as they say," International Olympic Committee spokesman Mark Adams said Saturday. "It clearly shows that Valentine's Day is in full swing in the village."
Reports of no condoms in week one of the games followed an absence of plush toys of the official mascots, Milo and Tina, in the opening days. They proved more popular than expected in the official Olympics merchandise stores.
Condoms are traditionally popular for Olympic athletes to take home as "a kind of gift" to friends, Alpine skier Mialitiana Clerc said Saturday.
"I'm not so shocked. I saw it in Beijing already," said Clerc, who also competed for Madagascar four years ago at the Winter Games in China. "There were some boxes with a lot of condoms at the entrance of every building where we were staying at the village."
"Every day, everything was (gone)," she recalled about Beijing at an IOC news conference Saturday to promote its scholarship program that helps hundreds of athletes to train and qualify for the Olympics.
"I already know that a lot of people are using some condoms or just taking them to give to their friends outside of the Olympics because it's a kind of gift for them," Clerc said.
There should be no further shortage in Italy until the Winter Games closing ceremony on Feb. 22.
"They will be continuously replenished until the end of the games to ensure continued availability," the local organizing committee said.

Large Flamingo missile production line destroyed in Ukraine, Zelensky admits

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. One of Ukraine's Flamingo missile production lines was destroyed in a missile strike, Vladimir Zelensky announced at a news conference on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"We don't have many of them. One large production line was destroyed as a result of a missile strike," he said, responding to a question about whether Ukraine had managed to resume production of Flamingo missiles as planned.
Zelensky added that he could speak about this because the incident occurred some time ago.
On August 21, Zelensky stated that Ukraine allegedly possessed a Flamingo missile with a range of 3,000 km, but that mass production would not resume for several more months. Later, a video purportedly from the missile production workshop appeared in Ukrainian media. Meanwhile, even Ukrainian analysts noted that the new allegedly "Ukrainian missile" is very similar to the British FP-5 Milanion.

Orban says EU bigger threat to Hungary than Russia
February 14, 2026Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Saturday that the European Union (EU) poses a greater threat to Hungary than Russia, accusing Brussels of seeking to undermine his government by supporting the opposition.
Orban, who has been prime minister since 2010, is facing his biggest domestic challenge in years, as his nationalist Fidesz party has been behind the conservative Tisza party in most polls leading up to April elections.
Brussels a 'source of imminent danger' — Orban
Orban, who had long been critical of European military aid to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion, took aim at the EU in a speech to supporters.
"We must get used to the idea that those who love freedom should not fear the East, but Brussels," the prime minister said.
"Fear-mongering about Putin is primitive and unserious. Brussels, however, is a palpable reality and a source of imminent danger," he said.
"This is the bitter truth, and we will not tolerate it," Orban said.
What did Orban say about the EU and the Hungarian opposition?
On Saturday, Orban also accused the EU of propping up his main challenger, Tisza party leader Peter Magyar.
"We already knew that our real opponents are not the Hungarian opposition parties. Our real opponents are their masters in Brussels," he said.
Orban claimed that the rise of Magyar's opposition Tisza party was orchestrated by German lawmaker Manfred Weber, who heads the conservative faction in the European Parliament (EPP), and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.
"It is crystal clear that in Hungary the oil business, the banking world and the Brussels elite are preparing to form a government," he said. "They need someone in Hungary who will never say no to Brussels' demands."
"The Germans know they need a Hungarian party," he said.
Magyar was a former member of Fidesz who broke from the party in February 2024 after public outcry over a presidential pardon for a man convicted of covering up cases of child sex abuse. He then took over the at the time little-known Tisza party, catapulting it into becoming Hungary's main opposition party.
Tisza has pledged to end what it describes as Hungary's "seesaw" foreign policy and align Budapest firmly with the West.
Orban vows to remove 'foreign influence' on civil society
Orban also vowed to target Hungarian civil society if he won re-election in April, describing it as being made up of "pseudo-civil organisations, bought journalists, judges, politicians."
"The Brussels repressive machine is still operating in Hungary. We'll clean it up after April," he said.
He praised US President Donald Trump, saying that he "rebelled against the liberals' global-scale business, media and political network, thereby improving our chances as well."
"We too can take seven-league strides and push out of Hungary the foreign influence that limits our sovereignty, together with its agents," Orban said.
Orban is a longtime Trump ally and has supported his push for negotiations with Russia to end the war in Ukraine.
In November 2025, Washington said it had granted Hungary a one-year exemption from secondary sanctions on Russian energy.

SBU's Alpha special forces destroy half of Russia's Pantsir air defense systems in 2025
That is according to the SBU press center, Ukrinform reports.
"Pantsir is one of Russia's modern and key air defense systems. The cost of one system ranges from 15 to 20 million U.S. dollars. These gun-missile systems are the most effective in countering Ukraine's long-range drones," the statement said.
According to the security service, this is why the systematic destruction of Pantsir systems has a strategic objective: breaking through the enemy's air defenses and creating corridors to strike targets deep in the rear.
In particular, this enables Ukrainian forces to effectively hit Russian military bases, warehouses, airfields, and other enemy facilities.
The SBU also recalled that the total value of all Russian air defense systems destroyed by the Alpha unit in 2025 is estimated at around $4 billion.

Over 50,000 Israeli soldiers hold foreign citizenship: Report
More than 12,000 carry US nationality, the largest group by far, according to army data given in response to information request
JERUSALEM
More than 50,000 Israeli military personnel hold at least one additional foreign nationality, according to figures published Saturday by daily Yedioth Ahronoth based on official army data.
The newspaper said the information was released in response to a freedom of information request filed by the transparency advocacy group Hatzlacha.
Army data show that 50,632 soldiers have foreign citizenship alongside Israeli nationality. Of those, 12,135 hold US citizenship, the largest share by a significant margin, followed by 6,127 with French nationality and just over 5,000 with Russian citizenship.
The figures also include more than 3,000 soldiers holding German nationality and a similar number with Ukrainian citizenship. Over 1,000 troops apiece hold British, Romanian, Polish, Ethiopian, and Canadian citizenship, while the remainder are distributed among other countries.
According to the disclosure, 4,440 soldiers hold two foreign citizenships in addition to Israeli nationality, and 162 hold three foreign nationalities.
The report noted that the request was submitted nearly a year ago, in March 2025, marking what it described as the first detailed public breakdown of foreign citizenships among Israeli military personnel. The army did not clarify whether the data cover active-duty troops, reservists, or both.
Israeli media estimates put the number of active-duty soldiers at roughly 170,000, with some 400,000-460,000 registered reservists.

Russian embassy calls Western claims about Navalny's poisoning circus act, propaganda

LONDON, February 14. /TASS/. The Russian embassy in London has dismissed Western allegations regarding the poisoning of blogger Alexey Navalny - who is designated as a terrorist and extremist within Russia - as nothing more than a circus trick and necro-propaganda.
"We are once again compelled to highlight the political spectacle orchestrated on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference by representatives from Britain and several European nations," the embassy stated in a message obtained by TASS. "London claims that the toxin epibatidine was detected in certain samples allegedly linked to the death of a Russian citizen in 2024. Based on this, Russia is accused of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention."
The embassy further criticized the coordinated efforts of Western media outlets, political figures, and intelligence agencies, describing them as servile and complicit. "The purpose of this farcical performance is clear: to inflame waning anti-Russian sentiment within Western societies. When no real pretext exists, they simply manufacture one," the statement read.
Expressing disdain for what it called Western "fabrications," the embassy remarked, "What kind of person would believe such nonsense about a frog? Yet, the most troubling aspect is the necro-propaganda employed by Western politicians - an appalling attempt to mock the deceased. Even after a Russian citizen's death, London and European capitals refuse to let him rest in peace, revealing the true motives behind this campaign."
Russian diplomats also voiced skepticism about the Western 'conclusions.' "We place no faith in these so-called 'expert' assessments. Just as with the Skripal case - high-profile accusations, media hysteria, and no concrete evidence - there remain numerous unanswered questions that authorities prefer to ignore. So, in the end: is it poison from a South American frog’s skin or Novichok?" the embassy questioned.
On February 14, Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France issued a joint statement asserting that Navalny was allegedly poisoned with epibatidine, a toxin derived from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog. Their conclusion was reportedly based on analyses of Navalny's biological samples. These countries accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention in connection with the incident.

Finland beat Italy 11-0, set Olympic ice hockey shot record

Finland beat Italy 11-0 in their final men’s Olympic ice hockey group match in Milan, registering 62 shots on goal and breaking the Olympic single-game record.
The previous mark of 60 shots belonged to Sweden. Finland surpassed it in the closing minutes when Joel Kiviranta scored the team’s 11th goal.
The result leaves Finland on six points and with a goal difference of +11, placing them in strong position to advance directly to the quarter-finals as the best group runner-up.
Finland needed a three-point win to remain in contention for a direct place in Wednesday’s quarter-finals. Goal difference could prove decisive between group runners-up, and the margin against Italy reshaped the standings in Group B.
Slovakia topped the group, while Sweden dropped to third after results elsewhere. Without a late Slovak goal against Sweden earlier in the day, Finland’s scoring margin would not have carried the same weight.
Head coach Antti Pennanen praised his players after the match. “The players did a fine job again today. They prepared themselves and were efficient,” Pennanen told Yle.
He added that Italy, coached by former Finland head coach Jukka Jalonen, had competed well in the tournament.
“Italy have played well and credit to them for how they have fought in this event. Today they hit a wall,” Pennanen said.
Finland led 6-0 after two periods, outshooting Italy 38-8 at that stage. The third period brought five more goals and the record for shots.
In total, Finland directed 62 shots on goal compared with Italy’s 15.
The 11-0 victory ranks among Finland’s largest in Olympic history, though not the biggest. At the 1960 Winter Games in Squaw Valley, Finland defeated Australia 19-2.
Finland will learn their quarter-final opponent after the completion of the remaining group matches.

'I fought the only way I knew how, with my heart in my hands': a Valentine’s letter after 738 days in captivity

Six months ago, on Tu B’Av, often described as the Jewish Valentine's Day, Rivka Bohbot wrote a letter to her husband, Elkana Bohbot, while he was being held captive by Hamas.
In October, Elkana was released as part of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Now, as Valentine’s Day falls on Saturday, Rivka has written to him again — this time about a love she says has been reborn after two years of separation.
“My beloved Elkana, this Valentine’s Day is unlike any we have ever known,” Rivka wrote to her husband.
“It carries within it everything we were, everything we survived and everything we are still learning to be. I want you to know that I waited for you. I waited through the long days and endless nights, when the uncertainty was overwhelming and hope was the only thing that held me up. I waited in fear, in faith, sometimes even in anger — but always in love. I fought the only way I knew how, with my heart in my hands, with a trembling voice and a weary soul, because giving up was never an option when it came to you.”
“I went through moments I never imagined I would face,” she continued. “There were days when I felt the world falling apart, and others when a small sign restored my strength. And in every one of those moments, you were there — in my thoughts, in my prayers, in every beat of my heart. And then you came back. And with your return came joy and relief … and also ups and downs. Because coming back does not erase what was experienced, and loving after so much pain requires patience, courage and tenderness.”
“We have had easy days and hard days, silences and learning, but even in the most complicated moments I never stopped choosing you,” Rivka added. “Today I want to tell you that I love you not only for who we once were, but for who we are today. I love you for your strength and also for your fragility, for your laughter and also for your wounds, for being here, for continuing to try. Our love is not perfect, but it is real, deep and full of hope. On this Valentine’s Day, I do not promise a path without challenges, but a hand that does not let go, a heart that believes and a love that continues to choose us. After everything we have been through, I still choose you. Today, tomorrow and every day. With all my love, yours always, Rivka.”
Elkana Bohbot was abducted from the Nova music festival on Oct. 7 and held in the Gaza Strip for 738 days.
On Tu B’Av, a video was released showing the wives of hostages addressing their partners in captivity. “I’m sorry that I’m crying — I know the last thing you want is to see me like this,” Rivka said in the video. “I miss you in every way that can be explained. It hurts in my bones.”

Israel's foreign minister to attend Board of Peace launch in Washington

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar is expected to represent Israel at the Board of Peace launch meeting set to convene in Washington this week.
The upcoming summit will be the first gathering of the Board of Peace since the charter signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland in January.
According to an invitation sent to member states, the Board of Peace is set to initiate international efforts to promote Gaza's reconstruction. The document states the effort aims to unite "countries, institutions and partners" in an ongoing campaign to "lay the foundations" for prosperity in Gaza.
Two senior U.S. officials told Reuters on Tuesday that during the summit, Trump will announce the plan of several countries to send thousands of troops each to the international stabilization force that is supposed to be stationed in Gaza as part of the Trump's plan to end the war.
The officials added that Trump will also outline the reconstruction plan for Gaza, amounting to billions of dollars. They said delegations from about 20 countries are expected to attend, including many heads of state.
The agenda for the meeting in Washington has not yet been publicized. Gaza's reconstruction is among the issues to be addressed, according to a source who added that the United States has already pledged funding for humanitarian efforts and administration for one year, and that the United Arab Emirates has committed to financing the effort.
He noted that the United States is exerting pressure on additional countries to finance reconstruction efforts and that the Board of Peace meeting is expected to focus on raising funds for a broader and longer-term reconstruction initiative.
On Friday, Board of Peace High Representative Nikolay Mladenov, outlined his vision for the near future of the Gaza Strip. In a speech delivered at the Munich Security Conference, he said that "Gaza needs to be governed by a transitional authority, as authorized by the Security Council resolution, under which it needs to take on the full civilian and security control of Gaza," referring to a technocratic committee operating under the supervision of the Board of Peace.
According to Mladenov, that requires "the disarmament of all factions in Gaza, not just Hamas: Hamas, Islamic Jihad and others," is the condition for Israel's withdrawal from the Yellow Line and for the start of Gaza.

South Africa’s Markram mauls New Zealand in seven-wicket T20 World Cup win
Captain Aiden Markram hits an unbeaten 86 in seven-wicket defeat of New Zealand in Ahmedabad.
South Africa are on the brink of reaching the Twenty20 World Cup’s Super Eight stage after captain Aiden Markram’s storming half-century led them to a dominant seven-wicket victory over New Zealand, securing their third straight Group D win.
New Zealand on Saturday suffered their first loss in the campaign after they posted 175-7 as South Africa’s Marco Jansen took four wickets.

In response, opener Markram hit four sixes and eight boundaries in his unbeaten knock of 86 off 44 balls, the highest by a South African captain in the tournament’s history, helping his team reach 178-3 with 17 balls to spare.
Last edition’s finalists South Africa chose to bowl first in Ahmedabad, India, and it immediately paid off as player of the match Jansen (4-40) dismissed most of New Zealand’s top order by the seventh over.
Finn Allen (31 off 17 balls) tried to mitigate the damage after Tim Seifert and Rachin Ravindra fell to Jansen. But Jansen got Allen caught at mid-off in the sixth over, leaving New Zealand struggling at 58-3.
Mark Chapman (48) and Daryl Mitchell (32) turned things around with a 74-run partnership for the fifth wicket until Jansen got Chapman caught by Ryan Rickelton at backward point in the 14th.
New Zealand scored only 17 runs in the next four overs until James Neesham’s unbeaten 23 off 15 balls got them to a fighting total.
Markram’s magic seals the deal for South Africa
Chasing 176, South Africa got off to a fast start with Markram hitting three sixes and five boundaries to steer his team to 62-0 in four overs.
Losing fellow opener Quinton de Kock (20) did not affect Markram, who hit Mitchell Santner for a six down long-on to reach his half-century in just 19 balls. By the time Rickelton (21) fell in the eighth over, South Africa had already crossed the 100-run mark.
With the required run rate falling below six per over, Markram did not hit a single boundary in the next seven overs and focused on rotating the strike, getting South Africa within 28 runs of victory with 30 balls left.
“It’s about managing it through the right phases, I guess, but up front, you’ve seen how teams are taking on the powerplay and we’d be silly not to try that. It’s not always going to come off, but when it does, … we can get ahead of the game,” Markram said.
David Miller, who scored an unbeaten 24, cleared the mid-wicket boundary to bring up the winning runs.
South Africa will conclude their group campaign against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, a day after New Zealand play Canada.

Documents reveal Epstein's money moved quietly through major investment firms

ALBAWABA - The U.S. Justice Department has just made public records that show how Jeffrey Epstein kept sending tens of millions of dollars, and in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars, into hedge funds years after his 2008 conviction. He did this by using a network of personal connections in the financial world.
Bloomberg says that documents show that an email exchange in 2016 between a hedge fund manager in Palm Beach and Epstein led to a big investment in Honeycomb Asset Management. Eva Andersson-Dubin, a doctor and long-time friend of Epstein's who later married hedge fund executive Glenn Dubin, is said to have made the introduction.
First Person to Support Honeycomb
The records show that Epstein was an early and important investor in Honeycomb, and he is called a "day-one" participant and co-investment partner. He kept putting money into the fund until just before his arrest and death in 2019, even though he was worried about how it would affect his reputation and major banks had cut ties with him.
The documents quote an email from 2017 that called Epstein a "great partner" when the fund was managing hundreds of millions of dollars. Honeycomb's assets rose to about $1.5 billion in 2020, but they fell in the years that followed.
Disputed Numbers in Highbridge Investment
The files also talk about Epstein's connections to Highbridge Capital Management again. Epstein said in a deposition in 2011 that he first put in between $50 million and $100 million, and then he raised his stake to more than $300 million. However, Glenn Dubin's representatives have disagreed with those numbers, saying that the initial investment was much lower and then completely withdrawn.
Epstein also said he made $20 million for helping JPMorgan Chase buy Highbridge in 2004, but Dubin's representatives disagree with this description.
Banking Scrutiny and Financial Disputes
The papers talk about more investments, like in DB Zwirn, where there were problems after accounting mistakes were found. At one point, Epstein wanted to get back more than $140 million, which caused long legal battles.
JPMorgan closed Epstein's accounts in 2013 because of concerns about regulations and his reputation. Still, hedge funds like Boothbay Fund Management, King Street Capital Management, and funds connected to Valar Ventures, which Peter Thiel co-founded, kept managing money that was connected to him.
Network Continued Access to Money
The records show that Epstein's long-term social and professional ties were very important for keeping his access to financial markets. Several fund managers have said that their relationships with him were only business, but the disclosures show that his money stayed in major investment vehicles until 2019.
The new information has brought back questions about how Epstein was able to keep up high-level business relationships even after being convicted of a crime and getting a lot of bad press.

EU accession process 'designed for peace,' needs 'solution' to bring Ukraine into bloc sooner, official says

EU accession process 'designed for peace,' needs 'solution' to bring Ukraine into bloc sooner, official says
The European Union's current accession processes and timelines do not reflect the geopolitical challenges faced by both Ukraine and the EU, Marta Kos, the European Commissioner for Enlargement, said on Feb. 14.
The official's comments address the possibility of Ukraine joining the bloc by 2027, a goal announced recently by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Reports then emerged that the EU is exploring a partial membership plan for Ukraine that would allow the country to join before completing all the necessary reforms required as part of the so-called accession process.
Previously, Kos made it clear that there would be no shortcut to Ukraine's EU membership: "(F)ull membership comes only after full reforms," she said on Feb. 13.
But speaking at a "Ukrainian Lunch" event organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation at the Munich Security Conference, Kos acknowledged that the bloc's current process doesn't take into account the realities of war.
"The methodology we are using now is designed for peace," Kos said on Feb. 14, as reported by Ukrainian outlet European Pravda.
"It is designed for times when there is plenty of time for a country to carry out all the necessary reforms. Sweden, for example, was the most developed country to apply for EU membership — but even Sweden took three years."
Kos said it was "not possible" for Ukraine to join the EU by 2027 under current structures, but called for a "solution" that would address the security crisis.
"So, based on the current methodology, accession on January 1, 2027 is not possible," Kos said.
"But we have to find a solution to bridge the gap between the current methodology and the geopolitical challenges. We cannot wait any longer."
Kos also said that Ukraine has already "made a positive contribution to the development of Europe." In particular, Ukraine has helped the bloc to remember "how important security is in Europe."
"Perhaps we have forgotten about this," she added.
Zelensky has said that Ukraine's EU membership is an essential security guarantee for Kyiv as it looks to negotiate an end to Russia's full-scale war, now nearing its fifth year. He also said he would not sign any peace agreement with the U.S., Russia, and Europe if it did not include a specific date for Ukraine's EU accession.
Ukraine applied to join the EU in February 2022, mere days after Russia launched its full-scale invasion.
Kyiv was granted candidate status in 2022, and the EU formally opened accession talks with Ukraine in 2024. However, de facto negotiations on specific accession clusters have not yet begun, and Hungary has used its veto power to block the process.

'Major travel impacts' expected as winter storm watch is issued for northern California
A winter storm watch was issued by the National Weather Service for parts of northern California this holiday weekend
- Bookmark
As people travel for the holiday weekend, much of Northern California is under a winter storm watch, with communities bracing for several feet of snow.
The National Weather Service warned people traveling to and from the Sierra Nevada and its popular ski resorts to expect “major travel impacts” and to use “extreme caution.”
But there is still time for people to get to their destinations for Presidents Day weekend.
Dakari Anderson, a National Weather Service meteorologist in the Sacramento office, told The Associated Press that Saturday through Sunday morning is going to be the “best travel window” ahead of the incoming cold weather system.
While there was some snow earlier in the week, conditions remained “quiet” on Saturday, Anderson said. But things are expected to pick up Sunday afternoon — with communities that are situated at elevations of 3,000 to 4,000 feet (914 to 1,219 meters) expecting to be blanketed with between 1 and 2 feet (30 and 60 centimeters) of snow.
“Our highest (snow) accumulations are going to be in those kind of more hard to reach places, but we’re still going to see some of those heavier amounts in communities that are populated,” Anderson said.
Communities in higher elevations could see much more snow — possibly 6 to 8 feet (1.8 to 2.4 meters). Among them, Anderson said, may be Blue Canyon, a sparsely populated unincorporated community that sits at 4,695 feet (1,431 meters) of elevation and is about 51 miles (82 kilometers) west of Lake Tahoe.
The winter event is expected to span several days and could also impact portions of Western Nevada and Southern Oregon.

Shocking footage appears to show scared children running from New Jersey bus stop as school blames nearby ICE operation
Students in doorbell camera footage can be heard warning other children about the presence of ICE agents

Shocking Ring doorbell camera footage appears to shows the moment scared New Jersey schoolchildren ran from their bus stop as federal ICE agents carried out an operation nearby.
Lindenwold School District families were notified Thursday about a federal immigration enforcement operation that occurred around 8 a.m. at the Woodland Village Apartments. The district said 4th and 5th-grade students waiting for their buses were frightened and confused by the presence of multiple immigration enforcement vehicles and agents, causing some children to run from the bus stop, according to NBC10.
Students in the footage, posted to the public Hispanos Unidos en NJ Lindenwold Facebook page, can be heard yelling, “ICE, ICE.” In another video obtained by NBC10, one student alerts the others in Spanish, “ICE is there.”
“Our bus driver acted quickly and responsibly, circling back multiple times to ensure as many children as possible were safely transported to school. I would like to sincerely thank him for caring for our children and putting their safety first,” a school official said in a letter to parents also shared on the district’s Facebook page.
Hugo Cuello, 10, told NBC10, with his mother’s permission, that federal immigration agents were looking for his father and that he was at the bus stop with his mother when multiple vehicles arrived, prompting him to warn other children that ICE officers were present.
The outlet did not report what became of the alleged search for Cuello’s father, but obtained a separate video that appears to show several federal agents knocking on a door and waiting for someone to answer.
Fellow student Valery Pachecho Nunez claimed that ICE agents chased the fleeing students, and that she ran to a neighbor’s house because her mother was at work.
"It makes me feel sad because some people are leaving this country without their parents," she told NBC10.
Support was provided to upset students at the bilingual school, with counselors on hand to help, according to the report.
ICE agents were not present at any Lindenwold School District facilities and staff said they would closely supervise dismissal and bus loading.
“If your child is experiencing anxiety or distress related to this morning's events, I encourage you to reach out to your building principal so we can provide additional support,” school officials said.
In response to the incident, district officials reported reaching out to county and state representatives to advocate for protocols that prioritize the safety of children during any future enforcement operations.
The Independent has contacted the Lindenwold School District, Lindenwold Police Department and ICE for further comment.
The widespread footage prompted Lindenwold residents to protest Friday near the Woodland Village Apartments, WPVI reports. The crowd carried signs, played music and honked horns to show support for the local immigrant community.
U.S. Rep. Donald Norcross, a Democrat from New Jersey, joined the protest and said the video footage troubled him.
"What I saw in that video, children running away scared, this is how bad ICE is. That as soon as they heard, they ran home to their parents to see if they're OK," Norcross told the outlet.

What is epibatidine, and how did it kill Navalny? A guide to the frog neurotoxin that five countries say poisoned Russia’s opposition leader.

What is epibatidine, and how did it kill Navalny? A guide to the frog neurotoxin that five countries say poisoned Russia’s opposition leader.
The poison used to kill Navalny
The United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands announced that a substance called epibatidine killed Alexey Navalny, the opposition leader who died in a Russian prison in February 2024. The discovery followed testing of biological samples that Navalny’s associates had smuggled out of Russia.
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
What is epibatidine?
Epibatidine is a potent neurotoxin that disrupts nerve cell function.
Epibatidine accumulates in the skin of Epipedobates frogs, which are native to Ecuador and Peru, protecting the animals from predators.
Epibatidine is far more effective as a painkiller than morphine. However, the gap between an effective dose and a toxic one is so narrow that researchers abandoned it as a potential drug in the 1990s. Scientists — including some in Russia — have since explored safer derivatives.
In animal studies, toxic doses of epibatidine have caused elevated blood pressure, convulsions, respiratory arrest, and death.
Documented human exposure to epibatidine is extremely rare. The first known case occurred in 2010, when a laboratory worker who had handled the substance developed hives and sought medical attention. He survived after treatment with antihistamines.
At higher doses, epibatidine poisoning would likely resemble nicotine poisoning, producing symptoms such as confusion, wheezing, vomiting, tremors, muscle twitching, impaired coordination, agitation, and lethargy. Death may occur before the full range of symptoms develops.
Alexander Polupan, an intensive care specialist, told The Insider that the publicly available data about Navalny’s symptoms matches what is known about epibatidine’s effects:
The clinical picture is in some ways similar to poisoning by organophosphorus compounds, which include the Novichok poison used in the 2020 attempt to kill Navalny, but with a less pronounced muscarinic cholinergic component. [These effects include slowed heart rate, drops in blood pressure, bronchospasm, excessive salivation, urinary incontinence, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and impaired vision.] Atropine is essentially ineffective.
Epibatidine can cause poisoning through skin contact or injection — the method used in animal studies. However, the scientific literature has documented only these routes of exposure. Inhalation or ingestion would likely also cause poisoning.
Scientists in Russia have reported that epibatidine poisoning can be detected by analyzing blood, cells from the mouth, or urine samples.
Where did the Russian authorities obtain this poison?
Today, epibatidine can be synthesized in a laboratory, eliminating the need to harvest it from Ecuadorian frogs. Scientists at Russia’s Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology — which developed the Novichok group of nerve agents — have reportedly synthesized epibatidine.
In its pure form, epibatidine is a powder that dissolves in certain liquids, including beverages.
Before Navalny’s death, no state was known to have used epibatidine as a weapon. However, the toxin’s properties make it well-suited for assassination.

Russia’s Alexey Navalny killed by dart frog poison, European nations allege
Five European countries say findings ‘conclusively’ confirm the deadly toxin in the Russian opposition leader’s body as Moscow calls it Western propaganda.
Five European countries – the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands – have accused Russia of poisoning and killing opposition leader Alexey Navalny in 2024 based on lab results from a sample taken from his body.
The five governments said in a statement on Saturday that tissue samples “conclusively” confirmed the lethal toxin epibatidine. The poison is found in wild dart frogs from South America.

“The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands are confident that Alexey Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the statement issued during the Munich Security Conference said.
Russia had “the means, motive, and opportunity to administer this poison”, the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office added in a statement.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova told state-run RIA Novosti news agency she’ll comment once the test results are publicly presented – something she noted has not yet been done.
The five countries said they’re reporting Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was no immediate comment from the organisation.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence he called politically motivated.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs and can also be manufactured in a lab, something European scientists suspect was the case in the alleged poisoning of Navalny.
The poison works by causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures and a slowed heart rate and can kill on contact.
The five countries said Russia needs to be held accountable for its “repeated violations” of the convention.
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper met Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, at the Munich Security Conference. She said the new findings are “shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice”.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X the alleged poisoning shows “Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people in order to remain in power.”
The Russian government has repeatedly denied any involvement in Navalny’s death. Authorities said he became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
“Once there are test results – once there are formulas for the substances – there will be a comment. Without this, all talk and statements are just information leaks aimed at distracting attention from the West’s pressing problems,” said Zakharova.
‘Science-proven fact’?
It’s unclear how the samples from Navalny’s body were obtained or where they were assessed. Cooper told reporters “UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth” on Navalny’s death.
Navalnaya said the “murder” of her husband is now a “science-proven fact”.
“Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
“I was, of course, certain that it was a murder, … but back then, it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven fact,” Navalnaya added.
Navalny was the previous target of a nerve agent poisoning in 2020 that he blamed on the Kremlin.
He was flown to Germany for treatment, and when he returned to Russia five months later, he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the remaining three years of his life.
The UK held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergey Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year that Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack. The Kremlin has denied involvement.
Russia also denied poisoning Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent-turned-Kremlin critic who died in London in 2006 after ingesting the radioactive isotope polonium-210. A British inquiry concluded that two Russian agents killed Litvinenko.

NRB convention to spotlight Israel, Iran, antisemitism, and AI

With the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) convention just days away, Troy Miller isn’t pretending the timing is easy. But the NRB president and CEO is betting that thousands of attendees will arrive ready to talk, and ready to build, at a moment when faith, politics, and technology are colliding fast.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
“This is the largest gathering of Christian communicators,” Miller said, describing an event he called unmatched not only in the US but worldwide. The week will open with a “state of broadcasting” session and updates on NRB initiatives that reflect how much the organization’s agenda has broadened. He cited priorities ranging from Israel and global Christian persecution to veterans’ ministries and a major effort titled “America Reads the Bible.”
The convention’s structure is meant to mirror the modern media ecosystem. NRB will run multiple stages, including forums focused on the legal landscape, courts, legislation, culture, and mainstream media. Alongside those panels, the schedule includes hands-on talks and workshops, hundreds of sessions in all, Miller said, including a full stage dedicated to artificial intelligence.
A centerpiece event will lean hard into history. NRB plans a Thursday night celebration of America’s upcoming 250th anniversary, a “real fun night,” Miller promised, though he said he couldn’t yet name every speaker. He did confirm participation from PragerU, David and Tim Barton of Wall Builders, Core Ridge Ministries, and Seth Dillon of The Babylon Bee.
NRB is also expanding its exhibit floor. Miller said more than 230 exhibitors will fill two rooms this year, and the America 250 team will bring what he described as a traveling museum: a mobile truck designed to tour the country and spotlight America’s founding, with an emphasis on what he called the Judeo-Christian influence behind it.
That phrase - Judeo-Christian - captures what Miller says is a deliberate shift at NRB.
Judeo-Christian
In a polarized America, he argued, the answer is broader unity, not narrower lanes. He compared today’s divisions to the disputes between states during the country’s founding, saying the essential lesson is that “they all came together.” NRB, he said, has worked in recent years to build greater unity “in the body of Christ” and to expand cooperation to “our Jewish brothers and sisters,” along with Catholic participants. He described shared ground on “pro-life” and “pro-family” issues, and said global Christian persecution remains a central concern.
Iran, he added, will be a major focus at the convention. Miller said NRB plans a press statement “standing in solidarity with the people of Iran,” framing it as both a foreign policy and a human rights issue.
The conversation turned to antisemitism, which Miller framed as inseparable from hostility toward Christians. “Absolutely,” he said when asked whether hatred of Jews also implicates hatred of Christians, pointing to Christianity’s Jewish roots and arguing that antisemitism carries an implicit anti-Christian dimension.
He also pointed to what he described as gestures of mutual support, citing comments he said were made by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about Christian persecution and Israel’s commitment to protecting Christians globally. Miller recalled remarks by Deputy Foreign Minister Sharon Haskell, saying she spoke about Christians somewhere in the world experiencing “an October 7th every day.” “We need to lock arms if we’re going to defeat this,” he said.
Not every Christian community is aligned. Asked about a recent controversy involving the Greek Orthodox Church and criticism of Christian Zionists, Miller emphasized internal diversity within Orthodoxy and suggested local pressures shaped the episode. He called the stance “unfortunate,” but said the broader trend remains one of cooperation, noting that members of the Coptic Orthodox Church will attend NRB and describing widespread unity on antisemitism and persecution.
Debate over the West Bank and Iran
From there, the conversation shifted to Israel’s internal debate over the West Bank - also known as Judea and Samaria - and the competing language used to describe it. Miller blamed “outside influence” for complicating the conflict and said his preference is for international actors to step back while Israel and local authorities work toward practical arrangements. He pointed to the United Arab Emirates as an example of cracking down on radicalism and building a more unified society where “Arabs, Christians, and Jews are getting along.” He also said many Christians are firm in viewing the territory as the West Bank, referencing biblical narratives as part of that understanding.
Iran returned as the dominant theme. Miller spoke from personal experience, recalling his US Navy service in the 1980s and months spent in the Persian Gulf during a period when Iran sought to disrupt oil routes. He also described working with Iranian employees during his time in the tech industry at Gateway, Inc. Those connections, he said, sharpened his focus on the Iranian people rather than the regime.
He described what he said he had heard from an Iran-focused ministry: “tens of thousands” killed in a crackdown, with “tens, even hundreds of thousands” confined to their homes and facing shortages and infrastructure cutoffs. “This is a human rights issue that the world should just be screaming about,” he said, adding that he doesn’t understand why Iran “gets a pass.” He said he hopes US leadership will respond forcefully, pushing Iran toward serious negotiations, while warning that Iran’s proxies also brutalize populations across the region. In his view, reducing Tehran’s reach would “save millions and millions of lives.”
The sprint to deploy AI tools
From geopolitics, the discussion moved to artificial intelligence, an issue Miller says is already reshaping media faster than ethics can keep up. He pointed to a line from Jurassic Park: “You didn’t stop to think about whether you should.” The quote, he suggested, captures the problem with the current sprint to deploy AI tools.
Miller said NRB plans to confront thorny questions: what to do with fully AI-generated music; how to address the fact that models “learn from somebody” rather than create from the “human spirit”; whether AI-written sermons cross a line; and whether virtual reality pastors, deepfakes, and synthetic content threaten trust. The goal, he said, isn’t to halt innovation but to set moral guardrails before the technology remakes the field.
The conversation ended with the question of youth and faith. Miller said he sees signs of renewed interest among younger Americans: increased church attendance, higher turnout at youth events, and growing online searches related to belief. He attributed some momentum to a recent tragedy, the murder of Charlie Kirk, which he said had a significant impact on young people in the US. More broadly, he argued that many young people are confronting “emptiness” and loneliness, and are discovering that secular culture does not fill the gap.
He also described a rise in youth-led media aimed at reaching peers, a generation raised with constant media and fluent in how to use it. But, he warned, the low barrier to entry can reward popularity over truth. Christian media, he said, remains “one of the most well-kept secrets” and faces bias and marginalization on digital platforms and in traditional broadcasting. Even so, he called this a pivotal time to teach journalism, integrity, and truth “over the number of likes.”
On media ethics, Miller was blunt. “It’s gone,” he said, arguing that much of mainstream and legacy news has become “propaganda houses.” He invoked the idea of the press as a “fourth leg of the stool” meant to balance the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and said that role has been undermined by partisanship. What the country needs, he said, is a free press that is “uninfluenced and unadulterated.”
For Miller, the coming NRB convention is not just a gathering of broadcasters. It is a test of whether faith-based communicators can hold a coalition together, across Christian denominations and with Jewish partners, while confronting the pressures of a polarized political climate, a volatile Middle East, and a technological revolution that can manufacture reality on demand.

Amid Tehran's deadly crackdown, some 250,000 rally in Munich against Iranian regime

Some 250,000 people demonstrated against Iran's Islamic regime in Munich's Theresienwiese on Saturday afternoon, according to local police.
The demonstration was part of a global day of action called for by Reza Pahlavi, the son of the last Shah of Persia. Pahlavi was in Germany to attend the Munich Security Conference over the weekend.
The demonstration's slogan was "Human rights and freedom for Iran. International solidarity with the Iranian people."
Chants calling for the end of the mullahs in Iran were heard repeatedly, and flags of the USA and Israel were visible, according to reports from the German public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR).
Pahalvi, who spoke at the rally after attending the Munich Security Conference, said he wanted to lead the "transition" in Iran and enable a democratic future for the country, BR reported.
At the conference, he told journalists that Iran's future was a critical test for global security and asserted that the Iranian regime had been exporting instability for nearly fifty years, undermining the sovereignty of its neighbors, fueling conflicts in various regions, and advancing its nuclear ambitions.
In his speech at the Theresienwiese, Pahlavi urged the international community to support the freedom of the Iranian people, according to BR.
"Above all, the free nations of this world and their governments should place themselves on the right side of history," he said.
'I have chosen the Iranian people over the ayatollah'
US Senator Lindsey Graham also spoke at the Munich rally and commented on his participation in a post on X/twitter.
“I have chosen the Iranian people over the ayatollah. I believe they could be good allies of the United States and would march the region toward the light.” Senator Graham wrote.
“I believe the ayatollah is a religious Nazi, who would keep the region and the world in turmoil. He's a religious fanatic who wants to purify Islam, destroy the Jewish people, and come after the United States, which he refers to as the Great Satan.”
International protests
Munich was not the only gathering for those eager to respond to Pahlavi's call that weekend.
Large demonstrations took place in cities around the world, including Toronto, Melbourne, Athens, Tokyo, and London.
CBC News reported that people marched down Yonge Street in Toronto, accompanied by the beat of drums and chants of "King Reza Pahlavi."
Tens of thousands potentially killed in Iran protests
In Iran, conservative estimates amid the Islamic regime's deadly crackdown on protesters suggest that the death toll could be between 40,000 and 50,000. The US-based Iranian rights group HRANA has confirmed just over 7,000 deaths, and the organization is currently reviewing an additional 11,730 cases.
In addition to the large number of casualties, a campaign of mass arrests and intimidation has led to the detention of thousands, as Iranian authorities attempt to prevent further protests following last month's crackdown, which was the bloodiest unrest since 1979.
The protests began on December 28 as a small demonstration in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, fueled by economic hardship, and quickly spread across the country.

Death of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi deepens Libya’s political fragmentation - analysis

The killing of Saif al-Islam Gadhafi removes from Libya’s political arena the last figure capable of simultaneously embodying the legacy of the former regime, engaging in tribal mediation, and participating in the post-revolution political process. More than a personal loss for his supporters, analysts describe the event as a structural rupture in a system that had gradually reorganized itself around his presence.
For more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org
Saif al-Islam had emerged after 2011 not as a restorationist leader in the traditional sense but as a negotiator between eras. He represented a constituency that never disappeared after the fall of his father, Moammar Gadhafi, consisting of former officials, tribal networks, bureaucratic structures, and communities that experienced deterioration after the revolution.
Other members of the family had long been removed from the political field. Some were killed during the uprising, others were sidelined, imprisoned, or politically marginalized, leaving him as the only figure able to operate simultaneously in revolutionary Libya and in the memory of the previous state.
Ibrahim M. S. Grada, a former Libyan ambassador and UN senior advisor, describes this role to The Media Line in structural rather than personal terms: “During this period, the line led by Saif al-Islam emerged and advanced as the leading current among the various supporters of the former regime, to the extent that he became almost their official representative and the representative of their popular base.”
Saif al-Islam also functioned as the only political reference point for what remained of the former Jamahiriyah constituency, often informally referred to as the “Greens.” This was never a unified ideological movement but a loose ecosystem made up of tribal strongholds, including the cities of Sirte and Bani Waled, bureaucratic networks embedded in state institutions, security officials from the previous system, and communities whose status deteriorated after 2011.
Saif al-Islam’s relevance lies with his power to unify
Since the fall of the regime, these networks have survived less as an organized political party than as a dispersed social current waiting for representation. Over time, both western-based authorities in Tripoli and eastern authorities aligned with Khalifa Haftar attempted to absorb parts of this constituency into their own coalitions, particularly in the military and administrative spheres. Saif al-Islam’s relevance, therefore, lay not in controlling institutions but in remaining the only figure who could potentially consolidate these fragmented actors into a single negotiating bloc.
His presence shaped political calculations even when he was absent from daily politics. The possibility that he could re-enter elections or endorse a camp forced rivals to treat the former-regime constituency as a decisive electoral and security factor. Without Saif al-Islam, that constituency does not disappear; it simply loses a focal point. It now faces a choice between dispersion into existing power centres or gradual political irrelevance, a shift that may reduce immediate confrontation while simultaneously weakening prospects for an inclusive settlement.
Grada characterizes the magnitude of this event directly: “Saif al-Islam Gadhafi’s disappearance from the political scene is literally an earthquake, because the vacuum he left is difficult to fill.”
On the ground, reaction has been limited to tiny demonstrations but remains psychologically significant. Misbah Omar, an Institute for Integrated Transitions expert on Libyan affairs, notes shock rather than mobilization. “Only in two cities, maybe Sirte, Bani Waled, the Libyan people took [to] the streets since they were shocked when they got the news. They didn’t expect Saif al-Islam could be alone without any security, any armed team to protect him. Nobody accepted that,” he told The Media Line.
Omar also stresses uncertainty over responsibility. “About who killed him, I think nobody knows yet. There is a lot of pressure from the people on the ground, on the investigation office, and on the government to find that out.”
This uncertainty contributes to a wider political reading with each faction interpreting the assassination through its own strategic lens. Omar points out that Saif al-Islam had multiple adversaries. “There’s kind of tension between Saif al-Islam and some countries abroad and some international organizations. He knew many secrets and could have been a target for that reason,” he noted.
Libya’s divisions since the revolution have never followed a simple binary. The “pro” and “anti-Gadhafi” line that defined the civil war gradually evolved into overlapping political, economic, and local power struggles. Yet Saif al-Islam functioned as a rare cross-cutting actor linking those layers.
“He succeeded in representing a political side in the Libyan equation as the central linking element between the different pro-regime constituencies socially, tribally, and politically,” Grada explained.
His death risks refragmenting those constituencies: “This vacuum will produce competition among prominent figures of the former regime to replace him, and this competition will necessarily reflect on their social and political bases, and it will take a long time,” Grada added.
Omar similarly anticipates redistribution of loyalties: “Before we had Saif al-Islam. Now we have only two representatives left, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and Khalifa Haftar. Each one will try to polarize the former regime supporters to his side, fragmenting even more the situation.”
Rather than resolving tensions, the removal of a controversial figure may dissolve a stabilizing center. Grada notes that emotional mobilization may occur only under escalation: “Unless a sharp political or military escalation occurs, even then it will not be easy socially or politically unless a leadership emerges with a developed narrative capable of uniting the popular base.”
A lengthy political struggle
Omar’s assessment portends a lengthy political struggle: “We will see a long political struggle since the key for transition has been eliminated from the equation.”
These scenarios will likely impact the elections, according to Grada: “All Libyan and international parties need time to understand the current developments, therefore the timing of the elections will likely be postponed,” he said.
The Libyan state remains a negotiated space among armed actors, administrative networks, and international influence. Saif al-Islam’s absence affects each differently.
Omar warns that his killing may not be an isolated event, but part of a broader pattern of political violence ahead: “More than Saif al-Islam will be killed… Many important leaders or armed group leaders will be killed this year,” suggesting a potential phase of targeted eliminations accompanying this political vacuum.
Grada describes possible institutional consequences: “Former regime figures still influential in the deep state may find themselves without political or social cover, which may increase chaos in state institutions.”
Omar also situates the fragmentation within a wider external competition over the Libyan state itself: “We have three different projects for Libya right now, one supported by Egypt, another under the influence of the United States but not clear, and a third led by the United Nations.” He noted that public trust in international mediation, especially in the UN, has eroded.
“More than 12 countries [which are] part of the Security Council are supporting opposing armed groups in Libya,” he added, reinforcing the extent to which domestic political balance is intertwined with foreign security calculations.
Both interviews converged on the same structural issue, reconciliation depended on representation.
“Saif al-Islam was the only leader who could represent all the former regime; now nobody knows who should talk to whom,” Omar observed, while Grada noted that “national reconciliation needs political, economic, and social reconciliation. The first step is decentralization, maybe a federal system with 13 or 16 states,” with a connection to building a state.
Grada links this to economic governance as well, arguing that centralized control over resources had reinforced corruption and exclusion, and that redistribution of economic authority to municipalities will be necessary for reconciliation to function in practice.
Omar similarly focuses on administrative reform, instead of focusing on funding the army: “We need to reform the Ministry of Interior, not the army. Only this will allow us to go back on track. Ideally, we are trying to establish all these processes in a maximum two years.”
Monarchy, revolutionary republic, and fragmented post-revolution
Since independence, Libya has repeatedly reorganized its political order: monarchy, revolutionary republic, and fragmented post-revolution state. The removal of Saif al-Islam does not restore the past nor complete the revolution; it eliminates a bridge between them.
Grada describes the social pressure behind potential unrest: “Declining living standards, widespread corruption, and increasing inequality may lead to a new uprising, more likely chaotic disorder, which benefits no one.”
Saif al-Islam’s political importance lay not in governing, but in structuring competition. He represented a bloc that could be negotiated with. Without him, the bloc dissolves into multiple actors, tribal, political, bureaucratic, and armed.
That shift changes Libya’s transition from a negotiation among defined sides into a fluid contest among overlapping networks. The assassination does not resolve the post-2011 conflict. It removes one of the few actors capable of translating the past into the present.
Whether Libya moves toward a unified state or renewed fragmentation now depends less on ideology than on whether a new mediator, institutional or personal, emerges to replace the one that is gone.

An Israeli man described by Thai authorities as a major drug trafficker was arrested Friday on the island of Koh Phangan with narcotics worth more than 50 million baht, or $1.6 million, the Bangkok Post reported Saturday.
The suspect, identified as Shai Alfasi, 42, allegedly operated from a restaurant he owned on the popular tourist island. Thailand’s tourist police commander told the newspaper that Alfasi sold drugs through a WhatsApp Business account using a Hebrew name.
According to police, customers placed orders via the app, after which the drugs — concealed inside black socks — were left at prearranged locations. Photos of the drop-off points were sent to buyers. Payments were made in cash and hidden inside the same socks, investigators said.
Undercover officers posed as customers and arrested Alfasi when he arrived at a designated location on a motorcycle to collect the cash, the police commander said.
A search of his belongings and hidden compartments uncovered a range of illegal drugs, including cocaine, ketamine, MDMA, LSD, heroin, psychedelic mushrooms and heart-shaped ecstasy pills known locally as “Labubu.” The estimated street value of the seized drugs exceeded 50 million baht, police said.
Alfasi was identified as the owner of the restaurant “Lola” on Koh Phangan. Authorities said that during an enforcement operation launched Monday on the island, six suspects were arrested on drug trafficking charges, with Alfasi described as the most senior figure detained so far.
Last month, Koh Phangan police arrested four Israelis in their 20s staying at a villa on the island on suspicion of drug use. Officers raided the property following complaints of a loud party and suspicious behavior, and reported finding “Labubu,” cocaine and MDMA.
Earlier that month, Thailand’s tourist police raided a luxury villa on the island and arrested four Israelis suspected of operating a drug trafficking network targeting foreign tourists, primarily Israelis. Large quantities of drugs and cash were seized in that operation, authorities said.

US-Iran talks to be held in Geneva next week, hosted by Oman
The son of Iran’s last shah called for US action, as Trump sends a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East
Switzerland said on Saturday that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman said.
On February 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel’s unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic republic.

Ukraine holds over 4,000 Russian POWs – Zelensky
The head of state said this while speaking with journalists in Munich on Saturday, Ukrinform reports.
"Prisoner exchanges. They [the Russians] are currently holding about 7,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war. We, at this moment, have more than 4,000. This is good news, because we used to have 1,500. Now we have slightly more than 4,000. That means we can carry out exchanges," he said.
Zelensky noted that the ideal scenario would be for the Russian side to agree to an "all-for-all" exchange. At the same time, Ukraine is also ready for "1,000 for 1,000" prisoner swaps.
"It would be good if they were ready even for '100 for 100.' Any step in this direction is a positive decision for us," he said.
The latest prisoner exchange between Ukraine and Russia took place on February 5, 2026, with 157 Ukrainians returning home.

BRATISLAVA, February 14. /TASS/. Despite the suspension of Russian oil deliveries via the Druzhba pipeline, Slovakia maintains adequate reserves of oil and petroleum products, according to the State Reserves Administration of Slovakia. The agency assured that, with government approval, it is prepared to release the necessary reserves to ensure supply stability.
An emergency meeting of Slovakia’s Energy Security Commission is scheduled for Monday, February 16. The session will evaluate the current situation and discuss strategic measures to secure the country’s oil supply. Bratislava is actively monitoring developments related to the Druzhba pipeline, which has been suspended since early February.
The Slovak Ministry of Economy reported on Friday that the nation’s strategic reserves are sufficient to cover approximately 90 days of consumption. The ministry remains optimistic that energy supplies via the Druzhba pipeline will be restored in the coming days.
It is noteworthy that Hungary and Slovakia receive oil directly from other EU countries through the Druzhba pipeline, which passes through Hungary to Croatia and then on to Serbia.

Syria’s foreign minister, Iraq’s Kurdish region president discuss reconstruction, economy
Talks on sidelines of Munich Security Conference focus on rebuilding Syria’s economy, boosting bilateral ties
ISTANBUL
Syria’s Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani on Saturday met with Nechirvan Barzani, the president of Iraq’s northern Kurdish region, to discuss reconstruction and economic cooperation in Syria.
The meeting took place in Germany on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, which began Friday and runs for three days, according to a Syrian Foreign Ministry source cited by the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA).
The two sides discussed Syria’s economic situation and the country’s postwar reconstruction and stressed the importance of intensifying economic and development ties in the coming days, the source said.
Barzani reaffirmed his support for Syria’s unity and stability, describing them as “a fundamental pillar for the stability of Iraq and its Kurdish region alike,” according to the same source.
He also praised several steps taken by Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, expressing “great satisfaction” with a recent presidential decree concerning Syrian Kurds' rights.
In January, Sharaa issued a decree recognizing the cultural and linguistic rights of Syrian Kurds, addressing civil and legal issues affecting stateless residents, and tackling long-standing property rights cases, in a move aimed at building an inclusive state that protects citizens’ rights without discrimination.
Later that month, the Syrian government announced it had reached a “comprehensive agreement” with the YPG/SDF terrorist organization, aimed at ending internal divisions and launching a new phase of integration.
The government said the agreement covering the northeastern cities of Hasakah and Qamishli and the integration of military forces complements a previous deal signed on Jan. 18.

BERLIN, February 14. /TASS/. Alice Weidel, co-chair of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), has called on German authorities to cease supporting Kiev and instead pursue diplomatic negotiations, echoing the approach taken by US President Donald Trump.
In a speech at an AfD event, Weidel emphasized the urgency of peace, criticizing what she described as "completely anti-Russian rhetoric" and the ongoing provision of financial and military aid to Ukraine. She posted a video of her remarks on her X social media platform, stating, "We need peace as soon as possible. We must stop further fueling this war with such rhetoric and resources."
Weidel argued that Germany should stop "feeding" the Ukrainian regime and instead pressure it into negotiations, aligning her stance with Trump's diplomatic strategy. She concluded by asserting that this should be the primary responsibility of German policymakers.

Armed assailants on motorbikes killed at least 30 people and burned houses and shops during raids on three villages in north-west Nigeria’s Niger state early on Saturday, residents who escaped the violence told Reuters.
The attacks on villages in the Borgu local government area, near the border with Benin Republic, are part of a surge in attacks blamed on “bandits” who have carried out deadly assaults, abductions for ransom, and displaced communities across northern Nigeria.
Insecurity is a pressing concern in Nigeria and the government is under mounting pressure to restore stability.
Wasiu Abiodun, Niger state police spokesperson, confirmed the attack in one of the villages.
“Suspected bandits invaded Tunga-Makeri village, six persons lost their lives, some houses were also set ablaze and a yet-to-be ascertained number of persons were abducted,” Abiodun said.
He added that the assailants had moved on to Konkoso village, while details of other attacks remained unclear.
Jeremiah Timothy, a resident of Konkoso who fled to a nearby locality, said the attack on his village began in the early hours with sporadic gunfire.
“At least 26 people were killed so far in the village after they set the police station ablaze,” said Timothy, adding that the attackers entered Konkoso around 6am (5am GMT), shooting indiscriminately.
He said residents heard military jets flying overhead.
Another witness, who requested anonymity, said the attackers, riding more than 200 motorbikes, swept through the area targeting the villages.
Auwal Ibrahim, a resident of Tunga-Makeri, recounted the early-morning assault on his village at approximately 2am GMT.
“The bandits stormed our town around 3am (local time), riding so many motorcycles while shooting sporadically, beheading six people and killing others. They set shops on fire and forced the whole village to flee,” Ibrahim said.
He added that many villagers fear returning as the gunmen remain nearby.

Opinion
I want to fairly give my three nephews money. How should I do it?
I would like to gift/loan some money to my adult nephews to help them buy homes and am uncertain how best to do this. One is married with children, one is in a de facto relationship with no children, and the third is single. I would like to give/loan the money in such a way as to protect them financially in the event of a relationship ending, but I also want to act fairly, particularly in relation to my nephew’s children and their mother. I am in a good position financially and so have no need for any gift/loan to be repaid.
You will certainly lock in favourite aunty status with this plan! Great to hear that you are sufficiently across your financial position to be aware that you have more than you need.
Dying with millions of dollars in the bank is not winning. The impact your gifts will have on your nephews now will be far more significant than if they have to wait until you pass away.
You should discuss this with your solicitor. My understanding is that you can structure your assistance as a loan, which can provide protection in the event of a relationship breakdown.
However, for it to stand up to a legal challenge, it needs to be conducted as a legitimate loan, with interest charged, repayments made, and perhaps security taken.
I am 61, single, and had to resign from work due to health issues. I have $351,000 in super and $150,000 in savings. I own my home and have no debts, and I am intending to apply for the disability support pension. Can I also draw on my super if I’m on a DSP?
Yes, you can. As you are over age 60 and have ceased employment, your super will be accessible.
Whilst it would be possible to commence a pension from your super, I would delay this until you get a determination on the DSP. For means-testing purposes, money in super will be ignored until you turn 67. But if you convert it into a pension it will get included in the test, and is likely to reduce how much you receive in DSP.
A suitable solution here might be to live off the DSP and supplement this via draw-downs from your savings. Leave your super alone until you reach age 67 and transition to an age pension.
If you pursue this plan, and your super is left to compound for six years, ensure it is invested with a bias towards growth assets so that you maximise the compounding impact across that period.
I invest in an actively managed international share fund that has been underperforming for years. If I withdraw the funds, I will incur capital gains tax. However, if I transfer my money from this share fund to a different share fund with the same fund manager, will capital gains tax still apply?
Yes it will, as you will be selling units in the current fund that you are in. I don’t know the amounts involved here, but if you are in a high-cost fund that is not performing, it might be worth copping the CGT hit to move onto greener pastures.
Perhaps you could make a tax-deductible super contribution to offset the capital gain if you can do so. Alternatively, if you have any investments that are sitting on losses, perhaps you take the opportunity to clear those out at the same time, which would provide an offset.

French ambassador to Moscow from 2020 to 2024, Pierre Lévy witnessed the mounting tensions that led, in February 2022, to Russian President Vladimir Putin's "special military operation" against Ukraine. In Au cœur de la Russie en guerre ("At the Heart of Wartime Russia" 2025, untranslated), he recounts this "descent into the abyss." Le Monde interviewed him ahead of his participation in the La Nuit de l'Europe ("Europe Night") conference, organized by Sciences Po University in Strasbourg on February 20-21.
On February 24, the anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the start of the war, the United Nations is expected to adopt a resolution. Will this be a mere formality, or will the vote reveal the new geopolitical realities?
This vote in the United Nations General Assembly will serve as a barometer. On March 2, 2022, just after the invasion of Ukraine, 141 countries [out of 193] voted for the resolution condemning Russian aggression, calling for respect for territorial integrity and the principles of the UN Charter. Five countries voted against (Russia, Belarus, Eritrea, North Korea, Syria) and 35 abstained, including China. The situation was clear. Then, in 2025, there were two resolutions: One submitted by Ukraine and backed by the Europeans, the other by the US under Donald Trump, who, de facto, allied with Vladimir Putin's Russia to promote their shared idea of a quick peace, without condemnation of Russian aggression or defense of Ukraine's territorial integrity.

Snakes on a plane, skinks in the post: The slippery and growing problem of animal smuggling
Crime gangs are being caught in record numbers smuggling rare Australian animals for global underground networks, but experts say it’s just the tip of the iceberg in an illegal trade worth billions.
Australian reptiles worth up to $100,000 each on international black markets are being intercepted in the $32 billion annual global trade – the world’s fourth-largest illegal market behind drugs, counterfeiting and human trafficking.
A crackdown on wildlife trafficking syndicates has caused the number of smuggled animal seizures to more than double in the past two years. Federal authorities stopped more than 1100 trafficked native animals at the border last year.
Victoria’s Conservation Regulator has recorded a 254 per cent rise in wildlife-related crime reports over the past five years, including instances of trafficking and cruelty.
Despite the surge in enforcement, wildlife crime experts mapping the illegal trade have found nine out of 10 animal-smuggling attempts in and out of Australia are successful, earning millions of dollars each year for crime gangs, decimating animal populations and risking the nation’s biosecurity.
Australia’s unique reptiles are the most frequently targeted species, particularly blue‑tongue skinks, shinglebacks and rare snakes. Hong Kong continues to be the top destination for illegal exports, with most leaving the country via New South Wales.
Federal Environment Minister Murray Watt said the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water had set up specialist environmental crime units in Sydney and Melbourne over the past two years as part of an effort to tackle the growing “barbaric trade”.
“Illegal trafficking and wildlife crime is fast becoming a threat for many of our species that are already at risk of extinction,” Watt said. “The growing global trade in native plants and animals is illegal, cruel and threatens the future of many of our beloved plants and animals.
“Through targeted intelligence analysis, on-ground investigations, and close collaboration with partner agencies, we’re detecting the methods used to traffic native species and closing the gaps criminals rely on.
“This work is delivering results – seizures, prosecutions and deterrence – and strengthening Australia’s broader biosecurity and conservation outcomes by making it harder for offenders to profit from the illegal wildlife trade.”
A popcorn moment
Following one of Australia’s largest animal-smuggling busts, the ringleader of a Sydney-based syndicate on Friday received a record jail sentence.
Between 2018 and 2023, authorities intercepted 15 packages bound for Hong Kong, Romania, South Korea and Sri Lanka, which contained a total of 101 native reptiles hidden in bags of popcorn, biscuit tins and a handbag.
Under Operations Buckland and Pandora, Commonwealth and NSW investigators teamed up with Australia Post and university-based wildlife crime researchers to track down the traffickers, leading to search warrants that uncovered several hundred more live reptiles – shingleback lizards, western blue-tongue lizards, Centralian blue-tongue lizards, bearded dragons, southern pygmy spiny-tail skinks, Eastern Pilbara spiny-tailed skinks, desert skinks, narrow-banded sand swimmers and major skinks – as well as the ringleader, Neil Simpson, 61.
On Friday, the Sydney Downing Centre District Court sentenced Simpson to eight years in jail with a non-parole period of five years and four months. Three lower-level syndicate members were previously convicted for their roles.
Smokes and lizards
An investigation by this masthead can also reveal that recent busts have shown an overlap with other forms of organised crime.
During a January 22 raid on a Melbourne apartment, federal environmental crime investigators uncovered 800 cartons of illicit tobacco along with native reptiles allegedly being prepared for trafficking.
The raid, codenamed Operation Sam, was launched late last year after 24 live reptiles – including 14 shingleback skinks, three eastern blue‑tongue skinks, three lace monitors and four children’s pythons – were uncovered stuffed into toys, table lamps, clothing bags, socks and plastic tubs bound for Hong Kong.
A 26-year-old Chinese national was arrested and charged with three counts of attempting to export specimens.
This masthead is aware of at least nine alleged wildlife traffickers slated to face courts in Victoria, NSW, Queensland and Tasmania in the next three months after being identified through a series of ongoing investigations.
They follow at least 14 major operations in Australia since 2020, which have brought together a range of agencies – including the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force, the Department of Agriculture Fisheries and Forestry, state and territory police services and environment agencies, as well as international agencies including Interpol – and ended with about 30 people convicted of charges connected to the illegal wildlife trade.
The Australian convictions include people from China, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia, while there have also been a handful of convictions in the United States, Hong Kong and Germany over the past six years for smugglers in possession of Australian rusty monitors, spiny-tailed skinks and earless monitor lizards.
But those convicted are often low-level mules, including international students recruited on Chinese e-commerce and social media sites to conceal live animals in everyday goods and send them through the post and courier channels.
Snakes on a plane
Cal Heppell, the director of regulatory operations at the Conservation Regulator, said the Victorian agency was seeing more reptiles being taken from the wild, with shingleback and blue‑tongue lizards often targeted, driven by their high value in the illicit overseas pet trade.
After raiding properties in Noble Park North and Caroline Springs, the Conservation Regulator and Victoria Police seized dozens of illegally sourced native reptiles, including shingleback lizards, blue-tongued lizards and various species of geckos, as part of Operation Pike, which targeted an illegal Victorian syndicate operating with links to other states.
In February 2025, the syndicate’s ringleader, Zehong Zheng, 21, was fined $30,000 after pleading guilty to 67 charges including importing and exporting wildlife without a permit, while two women in their 20s were also fined for their roles.
Like counterpart agencies around the country, the Victorian authority had detected high demand in Australia and internationally for native species as pets, and reports of illegal wildlife trafficking were rising, Heppell said.
“We are working more closely than ever with national and state agencies to disrupt the illegal trafficking of both protected native species and exotic pest animals,” he said.
The series of complex operations involving informants, data scraping, postal X-ray and organic scanning has intercepted hundreds of shipments that often include dozens of animals cruelly stuffed into hollowed-out electrical equipment, toys, socks, boots, music boxes, rice cookers and other packages bound for underground markets, most commonly in Hong Kong and Germany.
Organisations including Rapiscan technologies, Taronga Zoo and the Australian Museum have also been called in to develop world-leading scanning technology capable of detecting live animals at Australia’s borders.
As a result, the federal wildlife watchdog last year seized 1118 specimens being smuggled out of Australia – a huge increase on the 331 live specimens seized in 2024, and the 584 specimens seized in 2023.
While the crackdown has made it more difficult for organised criminals to operate, intelligence gathered by the federal wildlife watchdog reveals syndicates are adapting to the increased focus and have moved towards “higher‑risk, higher‑volume” shipments.
This shift is also apparent in detection figures, provided to this masthead, which reveal a decline in the number of illegal parcels detected last year – from 151 in 2023 to 75 in 2024, and 102 in 2025 – despite a near tripling in the overall number of animals they contained.
In response, authorities are undertaking lengthy investigations to trace the source of the shipments. The number of warrants executed by federal Environment Department officials at smuggling headquarters has risen from 11 in 2023 to 16 in 2025.
Pet peeves
Wildlife Crime Research Hub manager Katie Smith and her colleagues are using wildlife forensics and cyber-crime tracking technology to not only research the illegal markets in Australia, but to uncover those operating within them.
Although they have recorded a significant increase in detections, Smith said only 10 per cent of animals being illegally traded were being detected.
“Since COVID, we’re seeing almost an exponential increase again in the number of seizures being made,” Smith said.
“Australia, because of its geographic positioning, has a whole heap of unique species found nowhere else. The exotic pet trade, which is the biggest place we see Australian species being laundered into, is driven by rarity.
“They’re really highly sought after in the international markets.”
The scale(s) of the problem
Based at the University of Adelaide and backed by the Australian Research Council, the research hub has worked with state and federal agencies to co-ordinate seizures across the country – including Operations Buckland and Pandora – by tracking poachers in the wild, as well as the networks they use to ship animals out of the country.
Using data-scraping technology, the unit’s researchers are tracing purchasing orders, sale offers and smuggler recruitment advertisements on social media, wildlife chat groups and in e-commerce sites dating back to 2019.
The results not only provide a map of the illegal international trades, but uncover those who are still operating within it for authorities to target with detections and covert operations.
The intelligence also reveals two realities: the escalating prices driving the market, and the fact detection operations are barely making a dent.
Illegal sales data shows that a shingleback sold domestically in Australia for $200 to $300 fetches an average $11,000 in Hong Kong.
Rarer species, such as the Oenpelli python, found only in Arnhem Land, sell for $100,000. Escalating demand for the snakes from 2017 caused them to become the first species to be listed as “vulnerable” due to the impact of illegal trade rather than conservation issues.
Once out of their native Australia, where they can be laundered and passed off as captive-bred, an animal’s price jumps further for seemingly legal sales into Asia, Europe and North America.
“It shows that Australian native species that should never have been leaving the country are everywhere,” Smith said. “There are huge markets in North America, there are huge markets in Europe
“It’s an exponential price increase. We’ve got cases of national movement in Australia where people are moving 90 shinglebacks at once.
“In Adelaide, you can go on a hike on a sunny day and pick up 10 species, and we’re then talking $100,000 in Hong Kong, if you can get them there.
“And the maximum you could be fined for something like this is $3000, so if you can get just one out of the country, you’ve already covered your costs. That’s just the cost of doing business.”
Global wildlife trade expert Professor Alice Hughes, of the University of Melbourne, said that once an animal was smuggled out of its native country, a system similar to money laundering made it difficult, or nearly impossible, to track from there.
‘No one cares’ about lizards
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species – or CITES – is the global tool to combat wildlife trafficking. It requires nations to list native animals that are targets of wildlife traffickers, so they can then only be traded under a regulated licensing system.
But Hughes points to huge gaps in the international treaty, such as the fact only 9.5 per cent of reptile species are listed on CITES despite 45 per cent of species being detected in illegal trade. She said these gaps were being exploited and even promoted on wildlife trading chat pages and social media sites.
Crime networks can then smuggle a native species to regional hubs, such as Hong Kong or Germany’s massive Hamm reptile market, where they can be recorded as being bred in captivity to sidestep the regulations.
“We’re actually doing another assessment at the moment, which is quite terrifying, just the volumes of species that we’re finding in trade,” Hughes said.
“When you talk about illegal trade, people talk about ivory, or maybe they’ll talk about rhino horn, and then they’ll talk about pangolins – we never talk about exotic animal trade in the context of the pet trade, and it is booming.
“They will put radioactive material in rhino horns so they can trace it and so on. There have been all these sting operations, but they have been solely focused on a very small subset of species.
“They’re not going to put effort into tracing down your lizard dealer. No one, sadly, cares about it.”
The whole hedgehog
The impact of the gaps in international regulations is clear in the intelligence gathered by the Wildlife Crime Research Hub. As well as monitoring animals being smuggled out, the hub is also scraping data to see what is for sale within our shores, and building a “species accumulation curve” to plot the number detected in Australia over time.
After four years of scraping, the curve is still climbing because the number of species detected as having already been smuggled into the country keeps rising, including animals that are illegal to keep as pets, such as hedgehogs.
Even more concerning, it shows that the global trade moves so fast and wide that one in four of the exotic animals being sold within Australia is not even officially recorded yet by science.
When a new species is identified in the wild, it is typically analysed by scientists to confirm its origins before being officially recognised and recorded. But illegal market tracing shows demand to own the rarest animals means species are now being smuggled and sold to pet collectors long before they can even be published in scientific journals.
This is not only dangerous for the animals, but fuels organised crime and could be catastrophic for Australia’s environment and native species.
“Twenty-five per cent of the species identified are actually not described to science – so we know nothing about their potential environmental risk to Australia, or the biosecurity implications,” Smith said.
TikTok traffic
Influencers are one of the biggest drivers of the rare animal market, and the impact of social media is changing the nature of markets that have existed for hundreds of years, according to Hughes.
Wildlife investigators cite the impact of a single US-based reptile influencer as almost wiping out a newly detected species of New Caledonia skinks. Although the man’s posts focus on captive breeding, investigators believe his huge reach fuelled subsistence poaching for New Caledonians desperate to make a living from collectors who may have no idea where their new pets came from.
When jumping spiders began to trend on TikTok in 2021, the tiny and previously unheralded big-eyed creatures suddenly became the second most traded arachnid on the global market, behind ever-popular tarantulas.
The increasing lust for rare and small pets has meant space-limited Japan has emerged as a rapidly increasing market for species that have not previously been traded elsewhere, including small and rare Australian reptiles that can be easily housed in small indoor enclosures.
While China’s traditional medicine market has long fuelled the underground trade, Hughes said it was rapidly being overtaken by illegally sourced pets for a new generation.
“These are tiny little things, but yet, there’s this massive diverse market for them,” Hughes said.
“The market in China is growing, and it’s not regulated at all for these things.
“These animals are very compatible with the modern lifestyle because they are low maintenance, because they take up less space, because they don’t eat as much, and a lot of people will have them just because it’s easier.
“In the last month, there have been so many seizures in places like Hong Kong, where they’re starting to check a bit more, because wildlife trade for pets is absolutely huge, and it is under-regulated and totally neglected.”

How a promising lawyer was unmasked as the culprit in a bizarre years-long crime spree

How a promising lawyer was unmasked as the culprit in a bizarre years-long crime spree
The elusive thief raided affluent homes in Sydney and Melbourne over eight years. A decade later, he’s been at it again.
A single swipe card inside a former promising lawyer’s wallet unlocked the largest burglary investigation its lead detective had faced, having baffled police for years.
Phillip See, the wallet’s owner and one-time paralegal at the Crown Solicitor’s Office in Sydney, was a suspect in more than 100 burglaries across affluent suburbs in the harbour city and Melbourne.
The card – discovered by the case’s lead investigator, Victoria Police’s Detective acting Sergeant Cliff Pickett – became the smoking gun. It opened a Sydney storage unit hiding a $5.5 million treasure trove linked to about 150 robberies over eight years. An Olympian and war veteran were among the victims.
Phillip See was sentenced to 12 years’ jail for these crimes a decade ago, with a non-parole period of 7½ years.
The “sheer volume of robberies, coupled with the amounts of money that he stole”, made it the largest burglary investigation Pickett had confronted.
To this day, he wonders how some sophisticated thefts were executed, and what motivated a man who rarely spent his dirty cash.
“I’ve never, ever found someone as invested in researching different ways to commit crime,” he said.
“I couldn’t really get inside his head as to why he was doing the things he was doing. It wasn’t to lead an extravagant lifestyle … maybe it was the challenge of doing things and the thrill of getting away with it.”
Pickett can recall the elation he felt when he and his Victorian and NSW colleagues finally cracked the case – mainly because it was unique and bizarre.
Now, the 47-year-old has quietly avoided prison after returning to his old tricks and stealing tens of thousands of dollars worth of valuables from Sydney’s north shore and northern beaches.
Robbery manuals replace legal books
As a young adult, the future looked bright for the quick-witted law and economics graduate.
But as Phillip See fell into drug use and mental health challenges, he began committing petty thefts and trespasses. He spent the next decades visiting courtrooms, but not for reasons he’d hoped.
‘I’ve never, ever found someone as invested in researching different ways to commit crime.’Victoria Police’s Detective acting Sergeant Cliff Pickett
After his first jail stint in the early 2000s, his crimes – and ability to evade capture – escalated.
From 2010 to 2011, Victorian and NSW Police noticed similarities in many unsolved and sophisticated burglaries. Families in wealthy areas were targeted while on holiday. Fleeing without a trace, the culprit would even repair and repaint damaged window frames, often leaving victims unaware of the intrusion until police returned their valuables.
“A lot of the time the safe would be removed and not located,” Pickett said.
“Now, these were quite heavy safes … How he did that, I don’t know.”
A breakthrough came when NSW detectives traced jewellery, stolen from Sydney and sold at a Melbourne auction under a fake name, to Phillip See. He was a prime suspect, using fake IDs, names and credit cards.
Investigations uncovered that he and his father, Christopher See, committed a daring $900,000 heist in a Melbourne warehouse in late 2011.
Court documents state they remained on a police-tapped call throughout the burglary. Christopher See kept watch from a nearby church, while his son scaled and cut a tall barbed wire fence. Inside, Phillip See used a portable power saw to slice a timber door that protected a safe deposit box room and would only spark an alarm if opened. He covered a CCTV camera and cut the locks of dozens of security boxes while his father removed valuables.
“Wait till you see it, Dad,” Phillip See told his father on the phone.
Upon his arrest in Sydney, the pair were extradited to Melbourne. While searching Phillip See, Pickett found the swipe card. His NSW counterparts tracked down the Sydney storage unit.
The $5.5 million stash contained valuables from the Melbourne warehouse and auction thefts. Police uncovered more than $2.3 million in Australian and foreign currency, 145 kilograms of silver bars, 100 ounces of gold, several firearms, 8500 pieces of jewellery and hundreds of bottles of expensive wine.
At a See family member’s Bellevue Hill home in Sydney’s east, police found piles of “how to” books, including those titled How to Crack Safes, Locks, Safes and Security and Understanding and Servicing Alarm Systems.
This masthead earlier reported that lower north shore resident, Trish Howman-Giles, burst into tears when her wedding and engagement rings, anniversary gifts and family heirlooms were recovered.
Busted with gold tucked under pillow
By dealing with so much cash and “stealing any valuable item you could think of”, Phillip See could have lived in a luxury penthouse, taken lavish holidays and dressed in designer clothing.
But when he was caught, he was found living in a “crappy boarding house”, owning only casual clothes. The sole sign of his newfound wealth? A gold bar hidden under his pillow.
He remained cool, calm and collected upon his arrest.
“Reserved and cocky don’t usually go together, but he had an air of cockiness and confidence about him, but he also didn’t talk too much; he didn’t get angry,” Pickett said.
“I think the only time he showed any emotion was when he realised we were taking this swipe card from him … [he was] either frustrated or a little bit belligerent.”
Large amounts of money were spent on specialised lock-picking equipment ordered from the US, safe-picking manuals and even a submersible drone. His technology skills were far ahead of his time.
“He appeared to be of high intelligence, but with limited social skills,” Pickett said.
“We would [ask ourselves], ‘OK, why is this person able to do this? Who are they?’ ”
‘Reserved and cocky don’t usually go together, but he had an air of cockiness and confidence about him.’Detective acting Sergeant Cliff Pickett
Police were surprised he mostly carried out his work alone, bar the occasional help of his father. This suggested a “really unusual type of relationship”.
After their extradition to Victoria and discovery of the card, the father and son pleaded guilty to the Melbourne offences. Both men were jailed for up to four years.
Following the younger See’s release, in 2016 he was sentenced in NSW for the Sydney crimes to a maximum of 12 years’ jail. These included a raft of dishonesty and firearm crimes, as well as dealing with the proceeds of crime over the $5.5 million stash.
The sentencing judge noted his diagnosis of schizoid personality disorder (SzPD) – characterised by detachment from social relationships, limited emotional expression and preference for isolation. He was also abusing drugs and not taking antipsychotic medication properly.
While it was accepted his mental illness “had some role to play”, other motivations included “a desire for greater closeness with his father and greed for money to pay for regular visits to sex workers”, documents state.
Thief avoids jail for 2022 spree
Phillip See was released to parole in July 2020. A mere 19 months later, he struck again.
In February 2022, he stole tens of thousands of dollars worth of jewellery from three Sydney homes in the upper north shore and northern beaches, court documents state.
When one Lindfield family returned from a Queensland holiday, they could not disarm the alarm at their home. Power was cut; a broken deadlock lay near scattered belongings. About $59,000 worth of jewellery was missing.
In the same week, $50,000 of jewellery was collectively reported stolen from homes in Killarney Heights and Allambie Heights.
Phillip See’s latest undoing came when his DNA was matched to the Lindfield house and he was arrested.
Five months after being released on bail, he was arrested again. Police found plastic bags containing jewellery from all three addresses in his pocket.
He pleaded guilty in the NSW District Court to breaking-and-entering to steal less than $60,000, with one count of receiving more than $5,000 worth of property and another count of suspected stolen goods in custody considered. Last month, he was sentenced to a 359-day Intensive Corrective Order.
Judge Stephen Hanley took account of his mental illnesses and prior drug use.
He said there was “potential disagreement” between doctors about a current schizophrenia diagnosis, and noted suggestions he previously used the diagnosis to “some extent, milk the system”, but concluded the illness was a “valid psychiatric opinion”.
The nature of his recent offending was affected by his schizophrenia, antisocial behaviour, and other mental health issues – alongside financial motive, Hanley found.
The judge described the crimes as “extremely distressing” for the victims, but said full-time prison may risk “interrupting what appears to be a genuine, sustained course of rehabilitation in all the circumstances. There has been a significant change in insight he’s demonstrated.”
Phillip See, who was supported in court by his mother, sat emotionless as he learnt he would not return to jail.
His reoffending – albeit on a smaller scale – was not shocking for Pickett.
“It didn’t surprise me at all that he went back to do it,” he said.
“The lack of sophistication and type of burglary [this time] surprised me.”

El Jannah’s cousin has entered Sydney’s chicken shop wars

El Jannah’s cousin has entered Sydney’s chicken shop wars
James Estephan’s new Lebanese charcoal chicken shop, nestled on the single shopping strip of Belfield in Sydney’s south-west, is surrounded.
There are two El Jannah outlets in the neighbouring suburbs of Punchbowl and Burwood. Then there is Anar in Croydon and Awafy in Belmore, not to be confused with Awafi (named for an Arabic saying that loosely means “good health”), which has locations in Punchbowl and Revesby.
“This area actually knows what good charcoal chicken is supposed to taste like,” Estephan says.
Then come the fighting words. “But like, tasting good charcoal chicken with heaps of flavour – I just think that’s missing,” he says.
The success of his new chicken shop Char’d will come down to its rivals, Estephan believes, not despite them. This is a baptism of fire: the suburbs of western Sydney are full of residents of Lebanese heritage, the top nominated ancestry that comprises 14-17 per cent of the local population on Australian Bureau of Statistics figures.
It is the same hotspot that gave rise to national chain El Jannah, which was founded in 1998, already has 50 locations and is rapidly expanding towards a goal of 500, aided by an $800 million injection last year from US investment giant General Atlantic.
El Jannah’s undeniable role in introducing thousands of Australians to Lebanese charcoal chicken for the first time and proving its broad appeal across mainstream Australia has meant it is the standard against which Char’d (and any other Lebanese charcoal chicken merchant) will be measured.
Then there’s the family name: James Estephan’s grandfather is a cousin of the father of Andre Estephan, co-founder of El Jannah. That makes the two men second cousins once removed. Lineage aside, their respective families have lived largely separate lives.
“I just want to set a new standard,” Estephan says. “But if the standard is El Jannah and everyone compares me to them, that’s pretty fine.”
If you can’t join ’em, beat ’em
Prowess with poultry seems to run in the family. After starting his working life at McDonald’s at the age of 14, James Estephan spent three years in the digital marketing and brand management team of Red Rooster, one of four chicken chains run by Craveable Brands. At the time, Craveable was headed by chief executive Brett Houldin, who had attempted to acquire El Jannah before he jumped ship to lead the Lebanese chicken shop’s national rollout.
Estephan had in early 2020 tried, at first, to join the family business, and had explored the option of owning an El Jannah franchise, but found the cost (about $1 million) too steep for his budget. In mid-2021, he took over a chicken shop in western Sydney’s Eastern Creek called Paradise and another in St Clair that he rebranded to Char’d two years later.
As he eyes expansion, Estephan has little room for error. He is wary of falling into the same pitfalls that some former El Jannah fans – often early adopters, or of Lebanese descent – are now criticising the growing franchise for, including poorer quality control, often attributed to rapid expansion, accusations of “selling out”, and dry chicken.
“I’ve [built] the whole brand on the negatives of other places that I’ve heard,” the 30-year-old says.
“You jump on Google reviews, Facebook, Instagram, you read comments, and you see what people are lacking, and then you do the opposite.”
When this masthead visited ahead of the Char’d Belfield branch’s soft launch last Thursday, at least half a dozen curious passers-by stopped to inquire whether it was open for business.
El Jannah chief executive Brett Houldin wasn’t one of them. Houldin says he hadn’t heard of Char’d until asked about it by this masthead, but he wishes Estephan well and says that more players will raise awareness of Lebanese cuisine.
“There [are] copycats in every industry,” Houldin says.
“I think smaller brands are trying to look at how we’ve done things and why we’ve been successful, and that’s great. The imitation is flattering.”
Houldin says he is confident of the consistency and quality of El Jannah’s product and service standards.
“All roads don’t mean that everyone’s going to be the best,” he says. “We have the highest performing fast food brand in the country, and that means there will be others that want to see if they can try and get a piece of that.”
Tim Fawaz, interim chief executive of Craveable Brands, the parent company that operates Oporto, Red Rooster, Chargrill Charlie’s and Chicken Treat, says the brands are constantly innovating their menus as customers become more adventurous with flavours and range.
“Competition is healthy, it’s a sign the category is growing and Australians continue to love chicken, which after a period of uncertainty for the [quickservice restaurant] industry in the years following COVID, is a good thing,” Fawaz says. The company, which acquired Chargrill Charlie’s in May 2023, is not looking at any other acquisitions.
Estephan, for his part, is toeing a similar line. He has plenty of praise for what El Jannah has done to expand the appeal of Lebanese cuisine. “Honestly, I look up to them. What they’ve done is great,” he says. “[But] our food is 100 per cent better.”

Epstein files reveal scope of Ghislaine Maxwell’s role in Clinton circle

Epstein files reveal scope of Ghislaine Maxwell’s role in Clinton circle
New York: Jeffrey Epstein’s long-time companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, played a substantial role in supporting the creation of the Clinton Global Initiative, one of former US president Bill Clinton’s signature post-White House endeavours, new documents released by the Justice Department show.
Maxwell took part in budget discussions related to the first Clinton Global Initiative conference; talked through challenges about it with both Clinton aides and Publicis Groupe, the company that produced the inaugural event; and arranged to wire $US1 million to pay Publicis for its work on “the Clinton project”, according to emails in the massive cache of documents collected as part of the government’s investigations of Epstein.
The source of the money is unclear, including whether Epstein provided the funds. However, the emails show he was aware of the payment.
“Ask him to tell you why i million now and where will it be going,” Epstein wrote to Maxwell a few days after she received the wiring instructions from Publicis.
Maxwell’s involvement in the launch of the Clinton Global Initiative took place in 2004, before Epstein’s 2006 indictment and 2008 guilty plea for solicitation of prostitution with a minor, and long before Maxwell, a daughter of media baron Robert Maxwell, was sentenced in 2022 to two decades in prison for conspiring with Epstein to sexually exploit under-age girls.
The emails support an assertion Maxwell made last year in an interview with the Justice Department that she played a key role in helping set up the global conference.
Clinton has said he stopped speaking with Epstein sometime before his 2006 indictment. In a statement, Angel Ureña, a spokesperson for the Clintons, said the former president had “called for the full release of the Epstein files” and “has nothing to hide”.
“He knew nothing about Epstein’s crimes,” Ureña said. “When it became clear Epstein had no genuine interest in life-saving philanthropic work, there was no reason for further contact. The facts are the facts and the truth is the truth, and they’re both on our side.”
The new documents provide texture about the connections between the Clinton and Epstein circles, which have long generated a swirl of conspiracy theories and unverified allegations.
The emails reinforce previous accounts that Clinton and those around him had a more enduring relationship with Maxwell than with Epstein. In addition to her involvement with the Clinton Global Initiative, the records reveal that Maxwell had flirtatious exchanges in the early 2000s with Doug Band, who at the time was Clinton’s top aide.
She was known to have attended Chelsea Clinton’s 2010 wedding along with her then-boyfriend, Ted Waitt, a tech billionaire who was a friend of the Clintons and a prolific Clinton Foundation donor. And she remained in the Clinton orbit even after reports began surfacing accusing her of misconduct related to Epstein’s abuse of young women. Maxwell told the Justice Department last year that she last saw Bill Clinton sometime between 2016 and 2018, when she said they had dinner together in Los Angeles.
In a Justice Department interview last year, Maxwell said “president Clinton was my friend, not Epstein’s friend”. Her lawyer did not return requests for comment.
A review by The New York Times of references to the Clintons in the recently released files found very little related to former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and limited new information about the former president’s interactions with Epstein, a Democratic donor who supported Bill Clinton’s 1992 political campaign and donated $US10,000 to help refurbish the White House. He also donated $US20,000 to Hillary Clinton’s Senate campaign in 1999.
Logs that have previously been made public show that Epstein visited the White House a number of times during the Clinton administration and that Bill Clinton took four international trips on Epstein’s private jet in 2002 and 2003. Hillary Clinton has said she never flew on Epstein’s plane.
The former president has said he never visited Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, an account supported by emails between Epstein and his associates. (The Secret Service has indicated in the past that its agents have not been to the island, and said in a statement that “at this time, we have no new information to provide regarding this matter”.)
House Republicans have sought to put a spotlight on ties between the Clintons and Epstein, and threatened to hold them both in criminal contempt of Congress if they did not testify in the House oversight committee’s investigation into the convicted sex offender. Those depositions are scheduled for the end of this month.
Bill Clinton has tried to downplay his association with Epstein. In a sworn declaration submitted to the House panel last month, Clinton said while Epstein may have visited the White House while he was president, “I do not recall encountering Epstein, or any specific interactions with him, while in office”.
The former president also said that he did not recall when he first met Maxwell, “though I believe she was working for Epstein at the time”. Clinton said he did not recall his specific interactions with her or when he last saw her, “but it was many years ago”.
US President Donald Trump, who socialised extensively with Epstein and also travelled on his private plane, has expressed misgivings that the Clintons are being forced to testify, despite his repeated attacks on both of them over the years.
“I think it’s a shame, to be honest,” Trump told reporters this week. “I always liked him. Her? Yeah, she’s a very capable woman.”
For his part, Trump had warm words for Maxwell in 2020, after her arrest, saying, “I just wish her well, frankly”. Both presidents appear to have provided messages for a book put together for Epstein’s 50th birthday, though Trump’s staff has denied it.
A behind-the-scenes role
The Clinton Global Initiative was conceived in the early 2000s as Clinton’s version of the annual gathering of the global elite in Davos, Switzerland, with the goal of imbuing it with a more charity-minded mission to shape his post-presidential legacy.
Band, who has since had a bitter break with the Clintons, has long been credited with being the driving force behind the project. Maxwell’s involvement has been largely unknown.
But in her Justice Department interview last year, Maxwell said she had a “very central” role in setting up the Clinton Global Initiative, though she added that the idea was not originally hers. “I don’t try to elevate myself in any form of importance here,” she added.
Maxwell also indicated that Epstein was engaged in the effort, saying he “supported me to help them, but then I think he may have tried to use that to insert himself in some way”.
Richard Attias, a former top executive at Publicis, said in an interview this past week that Maxwell had played a key role in getting the project going.
“She was in Davos with president Clinton, and this is when they realised the amazing impact of Davos, and they came up with the idea of creating something similar, but with a different philosophy,” he said.
Attias said Maxwell sent the $US1 million to Publicis to pay for its work producing the event, which was held in New York in September 2005. He said he was not aware of who provided the funding but believed it likely came from multiple sources.
After initially saying he did not believe Epstein was involved, Attias later described Epstein as “one of the sponsors”, but in follow-up texts to the Times, he also said he didn’t really remember, noting the discussions took place more than two decades ago.
Attias, who left Publicis in 2008 – and who has since produced conferences for the Times – said in texts and the interview that he was ultimately uncertain about the extent of Epstein’s involvement in the Clinton conference.
In 2007, when Epstein’s lawyers were seeking lenient treatment for their client as he was being investigated for sex trafficking, they asserted in a letter to prosecutors that he “was part of the original group that conceived the Clinton Global Initiative”.
‘President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein’s friend.’Ghislaine Maxwell in a Justice Department interview last year
The Times identified one 2004 email to Maxwell from Attias in which he appeared to reference Epstein.
“I trust you and JE at 300 percent,” Attias wrote, while pleading for her to call off what appeared to be a lawyer for Epstein who was demanding a wide range of specific budget details early in the planning stages. (“We have no idea of what will be the programme, the venue, the hotels, the consultants, the speakers, etc. … ” Attias wrote to Maxwell.)
In a statement, the Clinton Foundation, which now runs the Clinton Global Initiative, said it accepted only one $US25,000 donation in 2006 from an Epstein-affiliated foundation, which has been previously reported. The foundation said it did not have any record of any other financial contributions to the Clinton Foundation or the Clinton Global Initiative related to Epstein or Maxwell.
“Publicis funded the development of the event which they were ultimately hired to produce,” the foundation said, adding that it “was not responsible for raising money for Publicis’ business”.
Post-presidential ties
Maxwell’s involvement in the kick-off of the Clinton Global Initiative came during a period when she and Epstein were both socialising with the former president.
In 2002, less than two years after leaving the White House, Clinton flew on Epstein’s plane on a 10-day trip to seven countries, including Ghana and Nigeria. Other passengers on the trip, which has been previously reported, included Maxwell and actors Kevin Spacey and Chris Tucker, according to flight manifests and photos that are among the documents that have been released.
At some point, Clinton appears to have handwritten a thank-you note to Epstein on stationery that Epstein kept on one of his planes. The Times obtained a photo of the undated note, which was framed and recovered from Epstein’s estate. In it, the former president thanked the financier for letting him “invade your private space” and explained that he had been “exhausted and had to get away from the crowd”. He also wrote that “as we forge ahead, i’ll finally figure out the financial stuff!”
The newly released files show numerous interactions between Maxwell and the former president’s aides.
In November 2002, Maxwell arranged to send Clinton what she described as “devil slippers” for his birthday, an email shows. The next month, Maxwell and a Clinton aide corresponded about talking points for how to respond to a Vanity Fair reporter who was writing a profile on Epstein. The same day, another Clinton aide, Ira Magaziner, sent Maxwell an email describing a Clinton project to combat AIDS.
Asked about the contact, Magaziner said in an email to the Times that he had sent the kind of information he shared with potential donors about what would become the Clinton Health Access Initiative, a group that fights disease in dozens of countries.
During this period, Maxwell and Band, then a Clinton aide, were also exchanging suggestive emails, the documents show.
“Booboo,” Maxwell wrote to him in 2002, “are you around? I am very ill and require immediate medical attention – I am suffering from boobooitis – a very serious condition. Without a booboo fix the symptoms become very pronounced.”
She referred to “cries into the night that sound like Shakespeare sonnets that sound like this – Oh Douglas – oh Douglas – wherefore art though Douglas”.
The same day, Band replied that “my boobooitis is also reaching epic poportions”, adding, “Lots going on but will be In boobooville the second you arrive”.
During their exchanges, they facilitated connections between Clinton and Epstein. In an April 2002 message, Band wrote: “the pres wanted me to tell you to tell jeffrey he says hello and he misses him.”
In a statement to the Times, Band said his communication with Maxwell occurred when he was in his late 20s and unmarried.
“There was absolutely no physical relationship that occurred between us. Ever,” he said, calling Maxwell “a monster”.
In 2011, Band sent an email to another Clinton aide, directing him to “remove” Maxwell “from all lists” giving her access to Clinton-related events as questions about her conduct grew, according to a copy of the email viewed by the Times.
Earlier that year, a Daily Mail report had dubbed her “Epstein’s ‘Girl Friday’ Fixer”.
Ureña, the Clintons’ spokesperson, said nothing was communicated broadly across the organisation at the time about banning Maxwell.
Maxwell resurfaced at a Clinton Global Initiative event in 2013, after Band left the Clintons’ employ, and was honoured for an ocean conservation project.

What’s the secret to a well-rounded life? These researchers have a theory

What’s the secret to a well-rounded life? These researchers have a theory
Whether it’s crafting or learning to play a ukelele, a hobby can boost your mental health and improve your ability to focus. Here’s why.
Everybody should have a hobby, Winston Churchill famously declared, ideally two or three. The wartime British PM daubed landscapes in oil, collected butterflies and even tried his hand at bricklaying to distract himself from the threat of Nazi invasion. Churchill, who was also a passionate advocate for the restorative properties of a power nap, preferably after a boozy lunch, believed hobbies helped stave off depression and boosted creativity.
Indeed, there is a body of evidence that suggests what might be seen as frivolous extracurricular activities – quilting, choir singing, bush dancing, boat-building, restoring motorcycles, whatever – can maintain our mental health and, in particular, improve our ability to focus for long periods. Especially if they generate the beneficial state of mind the Hungarian-American psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi called “flow”, when you are so absorbed in a task that it shuts out everything else.
“Sometimes a hobby finds you,” says Coral Ware, a former librarian who is still surprised that she now plays the ukulele in an amateur ensemble. “I had never played a musical instrument before, could not read music, still can’t, but had promised myself that one day, when I retired, I would learn to play an instrument,” she tells us. She met a ukulele teacher, gave it a go and one thing led to another. “I love performing, and when I am doing that I don’t think of anything else. That’s why I persist, even if sometimes they play some stuff that I don’t like, like Frank Sinatra.” She also dances classical ballet, gardens, knits, sews and reads “whodunits”.
Is watching TV a hobby? Are some hobbies better than others for you? Should we all have one?
What’s a hobby?
Definitions of “hobby” can vary, not least because the word itself is a little unfashionable, evoking creaky model railways and mildewed stamp collections – both of which were popular in Churchill’s day (today, we might prefer to describe our interest in vintage vinyl or Bitossi ceramics as a “pursuit” or “passion”).
That said, we still tend to recognise a hobby when we see it. Broadly, it’s an activity done for fun, outside paid work, that’s not passive relaxation (like watching TV) and that typically requires a degree of dedication.
A good hobby, it’s generally agreed by those who study these things, should be absorbing, offer opportunities to improve skills or knowledge (or scratch the completist itch) and should transport us away from our everyday cares. “You need to learn something, you need to have commitment, dedication to something, and then it becomes part of your identity after a while,” says Yazdan Mansourian, an expert on leisure behaviours at Charles Sturt University.
‘The spirit of a hobby, the essence of a hobby, is choice. If it becomes compulsory, if it becomes a kind of a to-do list, it’s not a hobby any more.’
A hobby’s purpose should be intrinsic: you don’t do it for any other reason than the enjoyment of the hobby itself. Think, fishing, sudoku-solving, Lego-building, scrapbooking, bonsai-growing, language-learning, pub-quizzing, birdwatching, pot-throwing, harpsichord-playing, colouring-in, woodworking, no-knead sourdough-baking. (Also, depending on your definition: pickleball, tai chi, scouring op shops, niche cinema, bodybuilding, wild swimming, unicycle riding.)
“There are varieties of leisure experience, and it’s useful to make even fuzzy distinctions,” suggests Joshua Rothman in his 2025 New Yorker essay Do We Need Hobbies? “To a degree, it matters how you do what you do. Certain kinds of video-gaming might be a hobby; others could be more like an escape. I listen to a lot of music, but I’d consider music an interest, or maybe just a source of happiness. Photography, on the other hand, is – for me – a traditional hobby. I read publications, acquire skills, buy and sell equipment, set goals, and mull various photographic problems and dilemmas in a not-quite-professional way that’s also not exactly amateurish.”
Tom Hanks hunts for vintage typewriters. Julia Roberts knits. Rod Stewart builds vast model railway dioramas. Angelina Jolie collects vintage daggers. The American songwriter Jimmy Webb built a collection of memorabilia from the defunct supersonic airliner Concorde, including several ultra-rare cockpit dials, a pair of passenger seats and even a flight attendant’s hat. Joshua Sapan, former CEO of the AMC television network (Breaking Bad, Walking Dead), amassed the world’s largest collection of lightning rods.
In Japan, there are not only regular trainspotters but hobbyists who choose to specialise in niche minutiae of the rail network: among them the yomi-tetsu, who collect and absorb train schedules (tetsu means train); the eki-tetsu, who admire stations; and the ekiben-tetsu, fascinated by the many and varied (and usually delicious) boxed meals sold at stations. Such a passion might be described as ikigai, meaning, broadly, something that brings value and joy to life.
Another Japanese word, otaku, commonly translated as “geek or nerd”, might be used to describe people whose hobbies verge on unhealthy obsessions. And beware the hobby that morphs into a side hustle or chore, says Mansourian. “The spirit of a hobby, the essence of a hobby, is choice. If it becomes compulsory, if it becomes a kind of a to-do list, it’s not a hobby any more. It becomes work again.”
Aren’t hobbies a bit old-fashioned?
Hobbies were once mostly the preserve of the wealthy. The British nobility of the 17th century (who had time for recreation, unlike the rural poor they lorded over, for whom turnip-pickling, pig raising and darning were work, not fun) enjoyed falconry and hunting on their vast estates during the day, cards and dancing after dark. A century later, Jane Austen, like her characters, wrote letters, played the piano and sewed. In the Victorian era, middle-class homemakers were gripped by “pteridomania”, an obsession with collecting and displaying rare ferns, some in elaborate greenhouses, others in new-fangled terrariums. “No home was complete without a fern under glass,” observed the 1877 book The New Practical Window Gardener.
… a Miss Margaret Allen modelled ‘fascinating’ clay horses and bred Dalmatians; actress Mrs Ian Gibson was a ‘ping-pong enthusiast’ ...
In the early 20th century, when working hours began to become more civilised and there was time for recreation that wasn’t necessarily drinking or watching TV (it not yet having been invented), fads emerged for coin collecting, railway modelling, macrame, flower-pressing, pigeon fancying. In 1933, a crowd of 30,000 Brits turned out to watch a model yacht race, of all things.
People’s hobbies became newsworthy, The Sydney Morning Herald in 1938 reporting the pastimes of some “well-known girls”: a Miss Margaret Allen modelled “fascinating” clay horses and bred Dalmatians; actress Mrs Ian Gibson was a “ping-pong enthusiast”; Mrs Lorimer Dods combined a talent for sculpture with her “skiing prowess”; Miss Jean Monckton, a member of the Australian hockey team, played the piano-accordion; Miss Joan Marks painted, cooked, sewed and taught “with equal skill”.
The paper ran a regular column, Hobby Corner, in which readers would share their tips and interests. The big one was stamp collecting, popularised by King George V (known as the “collector king”) in Britain and Australia and President Franklin Roosevelt (who himself sketched stamp designs for the postmaster-general) in the United States. In the US, the pastime blossomed during the 1930s and 1940s, having been promoted on the radio to the Great Depression-era unemployed as an affordable hobby. By 1949, philately was the most popular hobby in the US, according to the Hobby Federation, with some 2 million active collectors out of 19 million members of America’s 22,000 hobby clubs (10 million women, 7 million men and 2 million children).
By the time of the 1956 annual exposition of the Hobby Industry Association of America, in New York, where hundreds of booths were filled with recently popularised plastic models of planes, trains, cars and boats, there were some 6500 specialised hobby shops across the US and another 10,000 that carried hobby merchandise.
More recently, of course, it was the COVID pandemic that re-introduced many of us to the wonderful world of hobbies as we sought creative ways (sourdough bread baking, crocheting pot plant holders) to fill long days in lockdown and attempt to stay off our screens while “looking for meaning and purpose”, suggests Mansourian (who collected rocks as a child and now is a keen runner).
Public servant Lisa Reed also tried learning the ukulele, which didn’t stick; neither did knitting nor crochet. Somehow, though, she heard about metal detecting, bought an inexpensive machine and was instantly hooked. Not on the prospect of striking gold – her prized finds include largely worthless but interesting historical artefacts like old badges and tin toys – but on having a reason to get outdoors and enjoy a hobby with other people. “It makes me feel very content and happy if I do it every week,” she says.
Another COVID lock-in, web designer Jim Yencken, took up collecting vintage computer games then pivoted to building Lego sets, sometimes faithfully following the instructions, sometimes constructing his own unique creations. His current masterpiece, which he has displayed with a group of fellow enthusiasts called the Melbourne Lego Users Group, combines both his interests: an immensely detailed rendition of an imaginary landscape based on those in a popular Nintendo game called Animal Crossing, built from some 30,000 individual blocks (each drawn from 3D-printed, colour-coded containers in a neat IKEA-based drawer system so as to keep the townhouse he shares with his partner and six-year-old son as uncluttered as possible).
“I have spent far too much money on Lego,” he admits, estimating he runs to around 400 sets. It appeals, he says, as both a creative outlet and a way to zone out. “It is incredible for my mental health. I work a very, very stressful job in tech. It’s very difficult sometimes to put it to sleep, so that you can get to sleep. My mind’s always going and thinking about the next day and trying to solve problems that you know can probably wait, but my brain won’t turn off. And doing Lego sets, or sorting Lego pieces, is an incredible way to just turn off and be mindful and focus on what you’re doing.”
A fellow Lego enthusiast, Eve Sellars, is an artist with a background in financial planning. “So I have both a creative and a mathematical brain, and Lego just taps into both of those things. It’s all about problem-solving. It’s all about colour and creativity. It’s about engineering and making things fit and making things work. So it taps into both of those sides of my personality. It’s just perfect.”
IT professional Justin Baker’s hobby is not just an opportunity to relax but to gain some perspective on existence. By night, he captures images of other-worldly galaxies, using a special telescope that automatically tracks the movement of light from distant objects. Some mornings when he checks the night’s takings, there’s nothing but a washed-out blur, sometimes there’s an extraordinary vision.
“Every morning, I get a buzz out of it,” he tells us. “It’s relatively inexpensive and peaceful and gives you a bit of opportunity to reflect on the bigger picture. Last week, I took a really beautiful picture of the Orion Nebula, which is probably the easiest and brightest thing to see from the southern hemisphere. And it’s just got these incredible colours and beautiful shape. It’s really quite mesmerising.”
What does science have to say about hobbies?
Why hobbies can satisfy in ways that passive recreation doesn’t is of increasing interest to science. “The research shows that people who have hobbies tend to have better mental health and wellbeing, and they’re more satisfied with their overall life,” says Sharon Parker, a professor of management at Curtin University’s Future of Work Institute in Perth (who, in her spare time, makes beautiful creations from super-heated glass).
“Having a hobby reduces depression, anxiety and stress,” says Danielle Le Lagadec, a senior lecturer at CQUniversity who last year co-authored a scoping review of 11 studies into hobbyists. “It improves wellbeing, quality of life, which is closely linked to depression and anxiety, of course. And then there’s social connections, the interactions, the support. All of these things are closely related.”
Her paper, published in the journal Issues in Mental Health Nursing, also suggests that hobbies can provide emotional relief from work demands. “Individuals can achieve a healthier and more fulfilling balance between work and life by making time for personal interests,” it concludes, adding that maintaining this balance is “key to a sustainable career” and may mitigate fatigue and burnout.
‘The right approach to gaming, cooking, or hanging out with friends can have restorative benefits that spill over into the workplace.’
This was borne out by another recent study, of some 2400 working professionals, reported in Harvard Business Review. The authors, led by workplace researcher Alexander Hamrick, focused on what they described as “leisure crafting”, an approach to recreational pursuits that emphasises goal-setting and personal development. They found the study’s participants who had structured leisure time had improved mental health, overall life satisfaction and even enhanced work performance compared with those who engaged primarily in passive activities. Moreover, they said, “Our research suggests that it’s not about the specific hobby but rather the approach to it. The right approach to gaming, cooking, or hanging out with friends can have restorative benefits that spill over into the workplace.”
It’s about being in the moment, suggests Luke Smith, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Monash Centre for Consciousness and Contemplative Studies. “When you find an activity you’re interested in, it naturally lends itself to that quality of just paying fully immersive attention to something.” Sharon Parker agrees. “That’s partly why it’s such a good form of recovery from work, because you’re in that flow state. You’re fully absorbed in the activity or hobby, what you’re doing and that, by definition, means you’re not thinking about work and worrying about work and ruminating about what you need to do tomorrow. It’s psychologically healthy for people, it gives your brain a bit of a rest.”
Especially in a society that increasingly values paid work over everything else, says Mansourian. “If you are not busy, it means you are lazy, you know. And then we actually overestimate the value of work [as a source of wellbeing and personal identity]. And then, in the long term, it exhausts people. And we don’t have enough time just to be, just to be who we are, to do something that we really wish to rather than we have to.”
That was the experience of David Donohue, who 10 years ago found himself in a senior management role that was all-consuming. “I found I was getting to work then getting home from work, and by the time I wound down, it was time to go to bed and then get up and start all over again. After a while, that gets wearing and takes a toll on your mental health to the point where you go, I can’t do this, why am I here?”
‘The thing I love is a process – clear steps, read the process, understand the process. Glue A to B … It’s not rocket science.’
He turned, almost randomly, to a hobby he enjoyed as a 1970s schoolboy: gluing together and painting model planes. “It’s just such an absolute contrast to work. The phone doesn’t ring. There’s no email involved. The thing I love is a process – clear steps, read the process, understand the process. Glue A to B. Don’t get glue on your fingers, glue on the outside of the parts. It’s not rocket science.”
Building such skills, however esoteric, to the point that you really are very competent in your activity of choice, can be extremely valuable, Parker tells us, because it involves mastery. “Your hobby is a really powerful form of growth and development and self-esteem,” she says. “The research … actually shows that people who engage in activities that involve mastery recover better from work. It helps you to feel good about yourself and recover and replenish yourself.” (But beware the urge to perfect your hobby skills at the expense of enjoyment: it’s beneficial to dabble, too, say the experts.)
Hobbies that engage you with other people, meanwhile, bring additional benefits, says Smith (who loves swimming and collecting vinyl records). “When you look at longitudinal studies that have explored human wellbeing, things like our success in life, our happiness, longevity and health, research tells us that the quality of our relationships and connections to other people is crucial for most of these things. So you could have an individual hobby, which is wonderful, where you feel really immersed and interested, but you could also have a hobby where you get to share that passion with other people.”
‘There are embroidery groups and knitting groups and they get together and have a good old natter ...’
Absolutely, says Pauline Moncrieff, who solves cryptic crosswords with a group of like-minded puzzlers convened by the University of the Third Age. “I just love the group interaction as well. If you’ve got a hobby, it’s lovely to be able to do it with someone else. There are embroidery groups and knitting groups, and they get together and have a good old natter while they’re doing it. And I think it’s very healthy.”
David Donohue admits he’s not a “joiner” but found his hobby led him to find his own tribe, too, advertised on a little sign at the local library: The North Queensland Scale Modellers. “People talk about what they’re building, ask you what you’re doing, glue some stuff together, have a chat, a few jokes. It’s just very casual, no dramas, and it was really a comfortable place to be.”
Bottom line, says Mansourian: “Looking for meaning and purpose, that’s the main thing. We are looking for ourselves. We are looking for a sense of agency. We want to have a space to be whoever we are and do whatever we wish.”

Taylor faces formidable task rebuilding Liberals' electoral fortunes
About 48 hours before two-thirds of the Liberal party room voted to oust Sussan Ley as leader, a security guard working the X-ray machine remarked it was shaping up to be a "big week".
The man confessed there was "not a political bone" in his body, but an almost decade-long career in the building meant he knew the signs.
"It's the body language," he said, referring to the Liberals.
"The depression, the stress … they're miserable."
The clear air Ley was never granted
The Liberals' dire polling reflects a party that is under siege from the right and yet to make inroads reclaiming votes from what Ley once described as the "sensible centre".
Then there's the extraordinarily fractured relationship with the Nationals, who have consistently chased their own policy priorities no matter the impact on the Coalition.
And all this played out against a backdrop of sniping and undermining that never really granted Ley the "clear air" she has now promised to give her successor, Angus Taylor.
It's no wonder her supporters were wearing their despair so plainly on their faces as they trudged into Parliament House each day.
But the depressed mood went beyond moderates and the loosely unaligned Liberals who had backed Ley in the last leadership battle with Taylor.
Many in the party's right faction were growing tired of waiting on tenterhooks for their preferred leader, who had never planned to take on Ley so early in her tenure, to make a move.
When Taylor did walk into Ley's office to offer his resignation on Wednesday evening, the relief among Liberals was palpable.
From the populist conservatives still smarting over Andrew Hastie's pre-emptive leadership contest withdrawal, to the Ley staffers aware they may have to imminently update their resumes, there was a shared sense the limbo had ended.
What followed was a textbook spill orchestrated to maximise momentum, ultimately delivering Taylor a comfortable 34-17 win as fence-sitters in the party room realised where the numbers lay.
LoadingABC obtains talking points
In the days since Taylor defeated Ley, plenty has been said about where it all went wrong for the federal Liberals' first female leader.
Few in the party believe Ley ever really cut through to voters.
But her backers argue a dedicated group of agitators were determined to make sure she never got the chance.
As Taylor outlined his vision for the party on Friday, some in the Ley camp pointed out his focus on values, immigration, housing attainability and the economy was not so unfamiliar.
Shadow ministry "talking points" from the day before Ley was rolled, obtained by this column, begin with a section called "our values".
The document, which is updated daily with guidance on various current news topics to assist senior Liberals fronting the media, declared "aspiration is the foundation of the Australian promise".
It stated the Liberal Party wanted to "reward effort, not punish success", while several pages were dedicated to the economy and housing.
The "message of the day" was that it was "Labor's cost of living crisis. They spend, prices rise. Australians pay".
Then there was the finalised immigration policy — described as "hardline" by sources familiar with the version Ley was to hand down on Monday — as well as housing and small business policies in the works.
"We had a plan," one Liberal in the Ley camp said.
Another said Ley also knew she "had to go if she couldn't turn it around", but their internal overtures for her to be given a little more time fell on deaf ears.
The challenge ahead
Liberal MPs and senators not strongly aligned to either side of the leadership contest wondered if realistically there was any chance Ley and her team could bounce back.
Even moderates privately remarked Ley had drifted from the vision she outlined upon taking the role when she vowed to win back young Australians, women and multicultural communities who have abandoned the party in droves.
There was also an inevitability to her facing a challenge this term.
Taylor may have been forced to move on an accelerated timeline set in motion by Hastie's supporters, but his leadership ambitions were no secret.
He now picks up the formidable task of rebuilding the Liberals' electoral fortunes.
Taylor and his new deputy, Jane Hume, must beat back a resurgent One Nation and woo the city and suburban seats that have ditched the Liberals in favour of teal independents and Labor.
The new leadership team chose the backyard of a family home in the regional NSW town of Goulburn to launch an attack on Labor's economic record and pledge support for aspiration.
Noting the owners were considering downsizing to keep up with soaring costs, Senator Hume declared families were "looking for an opportunity to get ahead".
Within weeks their early strategy will be tested with what could end up being a messy four- or even five-corner contest by-election in Ley's rural NSW seat of Farrer.
If Taylor, who is a traditional Liberal in almost every sense, fails to chart a course back from the brink of electoral oblivion, his colleagues will next look for generational change.
In 12 months, a fresh leadership ballot could spark another contest involving the likes of Hastie or even moderate Victorian MP Tim Wilson.
Friday's decisive spill result will give Taylor more internal authority than Ley ever had, but the distrust and impatience in the party room that cut her tenure short still lingers.
The agenda Ley was developing shows the Liberals were already circling the policy terrain Taylor now wants to lead on.
Stabilising the right flank and restoring metropolitan credibility will require time — something not enough Liberals were inclined to give Ley.
The paralysing uncertainty that weighed on the Liberals' faces has lifted for now, but morale in politics follows results rather than reshuffles.

Are new protest laws protecting safety or limiting democracy?

Australians' right to protest may be more fragile than you think
From 418 arrests in 1977 to fresh clashes in Sydney: Debate over Australia's right to protest continues
"The day of the political street march is over," Joh Bjelke-Petersen declared. "Don't bother to apply for a permit. You won't get one. That's government policy now."
A few weeks later, thousands of people defied then-Queensland premier Bjelke-Petersen's proclamation and gathered in Brisbane for an anti-uranium march.
Ian Curr remembers an intense, unrelenting heat on that day nearly 50 years ago. It was "boiling hot", the long-time anti-nuclear activist says. So hot that when protesters sat on the road, arms-linked in passive defiance, it was "not very pleasant" because the tarmac was scorching. Other memories emerge from the haze: lines of police, three and four deep, surrounding protesters; a woman with tears streaming down her face who had just heard her partner was arrested.
Fear swirled up spines and into the air. These were the years after the Springbok tour anti-apartheid protests had been violently suppressed.
That afternoon in October 1977, 418 people were arrested and Queensland's "right to march" movement was baptised. Civil liberties demonstrations continued until the ban — originally enacted to curb a growing anti-nuclear movement — was lifted two years later.
Ross Gwyther was exhilarated seeing some 5,000 anti-nuclear marchers turn out that day. But the sensation was tempered by an "intense fear because there'd already been many cases of police brutality".
These were extraordinary times, as the Fitzgerald Inquiry would later attest. For Gwyther and many of the ratbags, activists and civil libertarians of Queensland it was a defining moment. That era in Brisbane radicalised a lot of people, Gwyther says, who embarked on a lifetime of "political activism, both through parliamentary politics or by grass roots politics".
These moments mark you, Curr says, turning to the events in Sydney this week. "The people who saw that violence in Sydney, in 40 or 50 years, they will not forget it. In the same way I do not forget police brandishing batons and punching and throwing people into paddy wagons. It's something you do not forget."
In the aftermath of last Monday's protest against Israeli President Isaac Herzog's visit in Sydney, shaky, chaotic videos began to emerge online. A man lies on tram tracks, restrained by officers, who punch him 18 times. Protesters are pushed, they struggle to their feet, crowds stumble around them. Men bowed in prayer are wrenched from their worship by police. A grandmother is in hospital with a spinal injury. She says she feared being suffocated in a stampede as she lay on the ground in agony. She alleges she was pushed over by police.
NSW Premier Chris Minns and senior police officers have defended police, calling their actions "proportionate" and saying they faced an "impossible situation". Civil liberties and human rights groups have sounded the alarm and NSW's police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, has announced it will investigate officers' conduct.
The footage and reports of protesters being punched and pushed by police officers in Sydney last Monday have sparked concerns about the fragility of Australians' right to protest and what constitutes a reasonable police response.
What many may not realise is that the right to protest in Australia is not protected by one simple law. It's implied in the constitution under freedom of political communication and exists under international human rights law, which Australia has agreed to uphold. Only Queensland, Victoria and the ACT explicitly protect the right to peaceful assembly, freedom of association and freedom of expression. And laws protecting the right to peaceful protest in Australia can be limited.
People assume that a right to protest means "you and I are free to get around the place, free to gather with people and free to express ourselves," says Simon Rice, professor emeritus of law and social justice at the University of Sydney.
Saying we have a right to protest "is too simple", he says. "A better description is that we have a right to protest subject to constraints imposed by legislation."
Australian governments have increasingly been passing laws restricting certain protest activities — the Australian Human Rights Commission says this trend is particularly evident when it comes to environmental protests.
In the past five years alone, South Australia established Australia's harshest fine — up to $50,000 — for "obstructing a public place" following climate protests in Adelaide that caused traffic chaos. NSW created tougher penalties for protesters who "shut down major economic activity" after climate activists disrupted operations around Sydney's Port Botany. Tasmania brought in harsher penalties around trespass and committing any action that obstructs a business, and Victoria established laws to protect logging sites from protesters.
Victoria has also passed laws to crack down on "dangerous and radical" protest behaviour, giving police new powers to unmask protesters and banning symbols used by terrorist organisations and attachment devices like glue, ropes or locks — the kind often used in non-violent direct action by environmental activists and famously used by feminist activists like Zelda D'Aprano who locked herself to buildings calling for better conditions for women in the workforce. A statue of Zelda, chains in hand, was unveiled in Melbourne by former PM Julia Gillard in 2023.
NSW passed hate speech laws which included a provision to restrict protests near places of worship and, after the Bondi attack, passed a law to restrict mass protests in the wake of a terrorism incident.
An analysis of anti-protest legislation introduced in parliaments across Australia by the Human Rights Law Council concluded the right to protest in Australia was being eroded. The report, published in 2024, found 49 laws have been passed in the last two decades that constrict the right to protest. "The state of greatest concern is NSW, which has enacted the highest number of anti-protest laws in the last 20 years," the report found.
Some legal scholars have been critical of such laws, arguing they're often poorly designed, rushed through parliament and even unconstitutional.
In 2020, at the height of the pandemic, law professor Simon Rice suggested to his students researching protesting laws they might like to observe a protest over student fees occurring at the University of Sydney. Tension between a right to protest and the need for public health safe-distancing restrictions would come to a head.
The restrictions to protest imposed in Sydney last week were not a one-off. Limitations on freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and freedom of association can be imposed by governments, and it's generally argued are necessary in a democratic society, for a raft of reasons, including to protect the rights and freedoms of others. Rice thought it would be interesting to observe how this tension played out one grey Sydney afternoon. Then he was arrested.
"I was grabbed from behind … My legs were kicked out from under me and I fell to my hands and knees. Trying to get up, I was pushed back down. Told I was under arrest, I was issued a fine for breaching the COVID Public Health Order," he wrote. He later successfully sued NSW Police over the arrest.
How police interpret the wide-ranging powers they have to respond to protests and maintain public order — the specifics differ from state to state — is something that concerns Rice.
The laws regarding the right to protest "are in the hands of police," he says. "Police are exercising discretion. So the manifestation of the limits on our right to protest are decisions that the police make on the ground." He believes police regulating the right to protest is a problem "because they're unaccountable in the way they do that".
Monday's protest in Sydney occurred under what the NSW government had declared a "major event" which gave police additional powers to issue move-on orders, close certain locations and search people in designated parts of the city. The government argued the declaration was aimed at ensuring public safety, something the state's supreme court ultimately agreed with when it dismissed the Palestine Action Group's legal challenge against the extra powers given to police.
Rice says the additional powers essentially created a "protest exclusion zone" but argues that does not render them "human rights-free zones".
He argues a national Human Rights Act would define standards against which protest laws could be measured. "At the moment we've just got opinion and feeling and nothing objective to point to," he says.
Rice says the stakes are high. If protest becomes too legally risky, he argues, it not only impacts how public order is kept but threatens democracy itself.
Luke McNamara, a law professor at the University of NSW who researches criminalisation as a public policy tool, was at the Sydney march last week. He attended as both a long-time supporter of Palestinian self-determination and to gather information for his academic work: who gets to march, who is moved on, who decides.
He describes "a large gathering of peaceful protesters. Lots of speeches, lots of cheering, lots of chanting".
McNamara says the size of the police presence and the strategy to restrict the movement of protesters was atypical. The incidents of violence, which he did not witness, left him "saddened and shocked".
"Using cliches, we associate that kind of environment with other parts of the world," he says.
McNamara argues new laws introduced last year which suspend the mechanism enabling a protest organiser to notify police and seek the status of an authorised protest are poor.
"That [authorisation] system relies on the idea that there is an underlying right to peaceful assembly," McNamara says. "And that includes the right to move, to march, to process."
He is concerned these limitations creep towards criminalising protest, exposing demonstrators to the risk of being charged.
With fresh challenges to these laws already before the courts, McNamara hopes for a less adversarial outcome: "Calm, unhurried consideration of what the legal landscape should be."
"Many of the things that we can celebrate today started as protests," says Adam Al Hayek, a healthcare worker who volunteers with Legal Observers NSW.
"Whether it's around women's rights and social justice, environmental rights, LGBT rights, even when it comes to things like the referendum in the 1960s to include First Nations people to be able to vote."
These protest movements weren't always popular, Al Hayek says, "but over time they did become popular and were able to elicit the change that we saw."
History's arc motivates his voluntary work with the network, which monitors police action and supports activists at protests. Its volunteers hand out "bust cards" educating protesters on their legal rights and advocate for their safety.
Legal observer networks have existed throughout the world within different struggles; in Australia their roots are in Redfern. In the late 1960s Aboriginal activists started monitoring and documenting instances of police harassment and brutality.
Of Monday's protest Al Hayek says he believes police tactics escalated what was a peaceful protest — something the government and senior police deny.
"A lot of times I've had people come up to me at a protest and ask, 'Why is there so many police?'" He says it "spooks" people. "When you ask the police, they tell you, 'We're here for your safety' but when you ask a protester they tell you they don't feel safe."
This concerns him most because he believes high visibility policing discourages people from attending protests. "I think that's problematic because it feels like police are discouraging the use of protest as an avenue [in a democracy]."
Sean Scalmer, a political historian at the University of Melbourne, says historically, the right to protest has never been definitively secured or forfeited but is "an ongoing process of contest and renegotiation".
By their nature, if protest movements are going to be effective, they are going to involve disruption, Scalmer says, "and that disruption, if it becomes significant enough, is always going to provoke anger and sometimes encourage governments to limit it".
He goes even further, arguing a degree of disruption is embedded in the very meaning of protest. If a meeting place between the right to protest and the authority of representative governments was reached, "it would only be defined by representative governments and democracy itself would lose its vitality".
Scalmer highlights the middle of the 19th century — an era of "mass enfranchisement" specifically of white men — as a bold democratic experiment in Australia. It also marked the moment restrictions were placed on citizens' right to protest, he says.
In 1860, some 3,000 demonstrators gathered outside the Victorian parliament. They threw stones at police and pushed on the doors of parliament house, demanding access to land for small-scale farming. This battle against the power of the squattocracy was a defining moment, Scalmer says. The result was legislation which limited the capacity of people to assemble near Parliament House.
Back in 1860 — at a time when representative government was gaining strength — debate around protest centred on whether white men, who were allowed to vote, should be entitled to protest at all. The thinking went that surely this right was accommodated at the ballot box and people on the streets could threaten parliamentary authority.
During World War I the federal government passed the War Precautions Act 1914, delivering sweeping powers that restricted civil liberties including controlling public gatherings, imposing censorship and restricting freedom of speech. Scalmer argues the attorney-general at the time, Billy Hughes, used the Act to suppress dissent.
In WWII, the national Security Act of 1939 did similar work.
As the 20th century progressed, social movements became more emboldened, taking to the streets to challenge governments to change their policies. Scalmer names the protest movements which occurred under Bjelke-Petersen as some of the most determined and significant for those who believe protest is vital to a healthy democracy.
Almost 50 years after the Queensland "right to march" movement, activist Ian Curr is in awe of the "ordinary men and women" who sat down on a Brisbane street in defiance of a protest ban with their arms linked.
"It was very hard to get people to even do that as a means of solidarity and self-defence," he says. "I believe ordinary people, especially in Australia, they're very averse to any sort of confrontation."

A dry windswept stretch of coast unfolds in front of the derelict Red Sea Diving Resort, a site made famous by a film of the same name. In the mid-1980s, Israeli Mossad agents used it as a secret base in the evacuation of Ethiopian Jewish refugees who were being persecuted.
Today, the wind blows through the rusted door frames. There is no glass in the windows. I am in Sudan, and I have now visited every country in the world.
Fewer than 500 people (including about 10 Australians) have had the privilege of doing this, according to NomadMania, a group that verifies people’s claims, including mine.
Visiting a country is not about ticking it off a list. It is about meeting people, sharing experiences and making friends across cultures and communities. It is a mindset as much as an activity. It is, above all, about a willingness to learn.
I have seen a lot in the years of visiting every country – things traumatic and things that made my soul soar. And I have learnt a lot. This is a small selection of what I experienced.
Working for the Red Cross in Rwanda in the 1990s, I had 3500 rotting corpses at my feet in a church outside Kigali. The smell has never left me. I saw scenes of devastation in the former Yugoslavia; the dead children remain burnt into my soul. I returned to Rwanda and Bosnia in 2016 to see a peace – if fragile – in both countries.
In 1999, I had the privilege of being part of the team that monitored the independence referendum in Timor-Leste, and later, I helped train officials to monitor their own elections. The president-designate, Xanana Gusmao, surprisingly turned up to one of my training sessions. He said to me: “Andrew, you are helping my country, so you don’t come to see me, I come to see you.” The man’s humility was inspiring.
From 2005 to 2008, I was in Pakistan, dealing with the emergency relief and recovery following the massive earthquake in Kashmir. I worked with a leader in the Pakistan army, Nadeem Ahmed, not something I would have expected when I did my own military training with the Australian army. Nadeem was the military co-ordinator for the relief effort and later head of the reconstruction. We developed a close relationship, like a “big brother, little brother”, through the shared experience of fighting a natural catastrophe. I stay in touch with him to this day.
In the Philippines, I ran a program using advanced DNA techniques to help children find their sex tourist fathers and gain the rights and support to which they are entitled.
In a central African country that shall remain nameless, I was contacted by the prime minister who asked me to “transfer some money” to his nephew in Italy. I kept giving excuses until I could get out of the country.
In Tuvalu, the country in the world perhaps most at risk of sea-level rise, I met a child whose life objective was to be “a climate warrior” to save her “mother”, Tuvalu.
In Saudi Arabia, I saw how fast and real the change is, and how genuinely excited young people, including women, are for the future there.
In North Korea, I was stunned by just how much a government can control the thinking of a population. Human beings can only have choice if they have two or more sources of competing information. In North Korea, people have only one source of information, and most believe, wrongly, that they live in a good country.
Surprisingly, though, North Korea was one of the easier countries to visit. On the other hand, two of the most difficult countries for me to visit were Nauru and Nicaragua.
In Libya, I met Hails Kennedy, a blind forty-something woman with alopecia. She is the first registered disabled female to visit every country. In many “difficult” countries, the frequent travellers I met most were female. It was they who taught me that “gender doesn’t prevent or restrict travel, mindset does”.
And then to Sudan, my last country to visit. About 20 years ago, I wrote an internal UNHCR document that recognised killing in the Sudanese region of Darfur as genocide. The killing continues today, and the number of deaths far exceed that of Gaza. In Sudan now, I think of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the massive protests supporting Palestinians, and I can’t help but wonder why it is that these black lives don’t matter enough to protest, too?
I have trauma from some of the things I have seen and experienced, particularly in the 1990s. But even though I have travelled to every corner of the world, I find an antidote to the trauma in a very Australian place. When I go to the MCG and watch up to 100,000 people enjoying a game, supporters all mixed together, I think of how lucky we are. This place helps me bury the worst of my memories.
Out of all the things I have learnt from visiting every country in the world, three things rise above all others.
Firstly, most people in the world want the same thing. They want a better future for their children. It’s just that often they have a different definition or idea of the word “better”.
Secondly, I learnt that one should never feel guilty about one’s privilege. Only feel guilty if you do nothing with it.
And thirdly, never assume the safety we have in Australia will remain. We must be constantly vigilant to protect what makes us great – both tolerance and multiculturalism. Our strength and culture is being tested now.

Sneaker moguls more than double their money on $18m Rose Bay pad
Hype DC co-founders Danny and Cindy Gilbert turned a hobby into a business 28 years ago, and that move appears to have paid off in the property world.
The couple have sold their waterfront Rose Bay apartment for a figure around the $18 million guide, local sources have revealed, more than doubling their money. Records show the pair bought the three-bedroom, three-bathroom unit off the plan for $7.85 million in 2016.
A European holiday in 1998 inspired then-26-year-old sneaker fanatics Danny and Cindy to open their first store in Sydney upon their return, which they did in Mosman.
The same year they purchased the unit, Hype DC was bought for about $105 million by RCG Corporation. The deal was 15 months after RCG Corporation acquired shoe retailer and apparel group Accent Group Ltd for around $200 million.
Accent Group also owns Platypus, Skechers, Stylerunner and Glue. The ASX-listed company has a market capitalisation of $544 million. Danny and Cindy resigned in 2017.
A sold sticker on the listing indicated a sale by private treaty on February 6, with the sale price undisclosed. Michael Pallier of Sydney Sotheby’s International Realty held the listing and declined to comment on any aspect of the sale. The exact sale price and buyer’s identity will be revealed at settlement.
The top-floor pad in a block of three occupies 254 square metres and offers 180-degree views to the Harbour Bridge, city skyline, North Sydney and Mosman.
There are oak floors, expansive glass, a marble kitchen, designer lighting and remote-control curtains. Leisure and entertainment options include an alfresco terrace, bar and butler’s pantry with icemaker and cool room.
The abode is in the same triplex as Dancing with the Stars’ Kym Johnson and her husband, Robert Herjavec, of Shark Tank fame, who are also selling their apartment with a price guide of $19 million. They paid $13.5 million in 2021 for the three-bed unit.
The Gilberts also own a four-bedroom, three-bathroom house in Palm Beach, purchased for $10.05 million in cash in 2020 from hotelier Roslyn Short, records show.
They may wish to eventually knock down and rebuild the beach house with the interiors somewhat dated. The standout feature is the location, smack-bang on the beach.
There is a terrace with uninterrupted coastal views and a boat shed.
Byron Shire acreage for sale
The widow of horse breeder Paul Makin, Lyndall, is downsizing from their acreage in Talofa after “10 wonderful years” to be closer to family. She has listed the Byron Shire property with a price guide of $18 million-plus.
Records show the Makins purchased the five-bedroom, four-bathroom house on just over 14 hectares for $4,025,000 in 2016 from Richard Korhammer.
Paul died aged 82 in 2019. He went from selling newspapers at The Doncaster Hotel opposite Royal Randwick Racecourse to being a successful horse player and breeder.
His stallion Starcraft was outstanding, winning multiple prestigious horse races including the 2004 Australian Derby.
The estate in Talofa, about 12 minutes from the heart of Byron Bay, is a lodge-style home consisting of four pods that are connected by walkways.
High ceilings, floorboards, stone walls, expansive glass, timber detail and pendant lighting adorn the interiors. There is a media room, 25-metre lap pool, spa, poolside lounge, tennis court and barn with electric sliding doors.
Prestige extras include private creek frontage and a swimming hole with a waterfall.
Will Phillips and Elisma Iesu of Sotheby’s International Realty Byron Bay are accepting expressions of interest.
Fashion whiz lists home
Selena Mazuran saw a niche in the fashion industry back in 1994, founding FBI Fashion College in Sydney, and now years on, she looks set to cash in on property.
The businesswoman has put her Dover Heights home on the market with a price guide of $14 million. She purchased the six-bedroom, five-bathroom abode for $3.2 million in 2012.
Mazuran worked her way up the managerial levels at David Jones before founding the college specialising in global fashion business and fashion design courses. She told Marie Claire Australia in 2017: “In 1994, no one was teaching fashion business subjects like styling, buying, marketing and PR.”
The property consists of a three-level residence with an attic and a separate two-bedroom residence. There is a pool, private courtyard and entertainment zones with Harbour Bridge and city skyline views.
Design details include Italian terrazzo tiling, custom woodwork in the kitchen, library and on door frames, and there’s a restaurant-grade cooker and rangehood in the kitchen.
DA approval is in place for a new freestanding two-storey property.
An auction has been scheduled for February 25, and Steven Zoellner of Laing+Simmons Double Bay is the listing agent.

Ukrainian skeleton racer Heraskevych posts photo of IOC president receiving award from Zimbabwean dictator
Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych has criticised a statement by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) regarding the political importance of the state award he was given by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy the day before.
Source: Vladyslav Heraskevych on Instagram
Details: Heraskevych posted a picture of IOC President Kirsty Coventry receiving an award from former Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe.
Quote: "The IOC directly mentions the fact that I received a state award from Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as an alleged political component of my desire to wear a helmet of remembrance.
Will Kirsty Coventry be disqualified for her political medal-winning performance as an athlete at the Olympic Games because she was rewarded for it by the dictator Mugabe?"
Details: Kirsty Coventry was a swimmer who formerly represented Zimbabwe and won 7 Olympic medals: 2 gold, 4 silver, and 1 bronze.
Background:
- Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the 2026 Olympics for wearing a helmet of remembrance during several official training sessions. The helmet features images of 20 Ukrainian athletes killed due to Russian aggression. Heraskevych was barred from taking part in the competition.
- The Ukrainian athlete appealed the suspension. On 12 February, the day before the verdict was announced, he met with IOC President Kirsty Coventry, but they were unable to reach an agreement. The IOC later restored his accreditation, but Heraskevych was still not allowed to compete.
- On 12 February, Heraskevych received the Order of Freedom from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

Russian-controlled Luhansk region claims 19 injured in Ukrainian drone strike on village
3 in serious condition after alleged attack on Tsentralny, eastern Ukraine; Kyiv has not commented
ISTANBUL
Authorities in Ukraine’s Russian-controlled Luhansk region said 19 civilians were injured in a Ukrainian drone strike on the village of Tsentralny, while Kyiv has not commented on the claim.
Regional Health Minister Natalya Pashchenko said on Telegram that drones struck the village in the Perevalsk district of eastern Ukraine over the weekend.
She said all of the injured were locals who were either near the impact site or inside their homes at the time.
Three people are in serious condition and six are in moderate condition, while the others were treated as outpatients, she added.
Earlier, regional head Leonid Pasechnik said 15 civilians had been injured in what he described as a massive Ukrainian drone strike. He also claimed that dozens of residential and social facilities were damaged.
Claims in the conflict are difficult to confirm due to the conditions of the war, which is set this month to reach the four-year mark.
There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian authorities.

Netanyahu pushes to water down terrorist death penalty bill over fear of global fallout

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to soften a proposed bill mandating the death penalty for terrorists, citing concerns over potential international fallout, officials familiar with the matter told ynet on Saturday.
Netanyahu’s aides approached Ben-Gvir, who opposes changes to the legislation, arguing that Israel cannot enact a death penalty law harsher than the standard applied in the United States. Sources said the prime minister and coalition leaders would not allow the bill to pass in its current form.
In an unusual move, the Prime Minister’s Office also contacted a lawmaker from Netanyahu’s Likud party, who in turn asked Likud lawmaker Eli Dallal to submit a reservation against the version being advanced in committee by lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech of Ben-Gvir’s Otzma Yehudit party.
The National Security Council, the Shin Bet internal security agency and the Foreign Ministry have also raised objections, officials said. About 1,000 reservations have been filed against the bill, most by opposition lawmakers. During one committee discussion, the Knesset’s legal adviser warned that the current draft may face constitutional barriers due to legal concerns.
According to the amendment submitted by Dallal at Netanyahu’s request, one key change would eliminate a mandatory death sentence for terrorists from the West Bank without judicial discretion. Under the revised language, judges would be able to choose between imposing the death penalty or life imprisonment.
Another proposed change would grant defendants the right to appeal a death sentence based on Israel’s obligations under international law. In Ben-Gvir’s draft, there is no right to appeal the sentence itself, only the conviction.
Netanyahu is also pressing to remove a clause that would make the death penalty a maximum — but not mandatory — sentence only in cases of murder committed in an act of terrorism by an Israeli citizen or resident. He is seeking its deletion to avoid distinctions based on the nationality of victims and potential discrimination in cases of Jewish terrorism against Palestinians, such as the case of Ami Popper, who was convicted of murdering seven Palestinian laborers who were not Israeli citizens or residents.
The Security Cabinet has discussed the bill, which remains in committee ahead of its second and third readings.
Before the return of all living hostages from Gaza, captives and missing persons coordinator Gal Hirsch warned the Cabinet that advancing the legislation could endanger the hostages. After their return, he said Netanyahu had changed his position and that the concern had been lifted. Still, Hirsch said the prime minister continued to seek reservations to the bill and asked that security assessments by his office and other agencies be made available to judges in exceptional cases involving the death penalty.
Opposition lawmaker Gilad Kariv of The Democrats party, who has led efforts against the bill, said: “We have argued all along that Ben-Gvir’s proposal does not align with the positions of the security agencies, the Ministerial Committee for Legislation or international law. The prime minister’s request proves that. Given Ben-Gvir’s insistence, the coalition should oppose the bill.”
Officials in Netanyahu’s circle confirmed the details. Ben-Gvir’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

Ukraine's Zelenskyy at MSC: Putin is a 'slave to war'

Ukraine's Zelenskyy at MSC: Putin is a 'slave to war'
February 14, 2026Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called on Western allies to speed up weapons deliveries to his country. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Saturday, he argued that there were cases in which missiles to ward off Russian airstrikes were delivered "just before an attack and sometimes at the last very last moment."
In January alone, he added, Russia had attacked Ukraine with an estimated 6,000 combat drones.
The Ukrainian president went on to thank the West for its support, but added that his country urgently needed more anti-aircraft missiles — particularly to protect Ukraine's power supply from Russian attacks amid an icy winter.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte backed Zelenskyy's appeal. "Keep them [Ukraine] strong in the fight," he said at an MSC panel discussion after Zelenskyy's remarks . "They will do it [the fighting], but they need our support."
Rutte added that Russia was currently not winning the war in Ukraine, and had lost some 65,000 troops in the past two months. "They make very small gains," Rutte said. "So small that it's almost not relevant."
On Thursday, Rutte announced that NATO states had pledged hundreds of millions of dollars for Ukraine's urgent military needs enumerated in the so-called Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL). Under the PURL initiative, NATO members buy military equipment from the US for Ukraine. According to Rutte, nine out of 10 anti-aircraft missiles in use in Ukraine have bee purchased through this scheme.
The PURL initiative has been NATO's attempt to appease US President Donald Trump, who is reluctant to provide US aid, but eager to sell US weapons.
Talks planned in Geneva
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, meanwhile, only mentioned Ukraine in passing during his highly anticipated speech. Instead, he spoke of peace that was difficult to achieve. "We don't know the Russians are serious about ending the war," he said.
Russian, Ukrainian and US representatives are expected to meet in Geneva next week to discuss an end to the war in Ukraine. The US had previously mediated similar talks in Abu Dhabi — without success.
Speaking in Munich, Zelenskyy said he hoped the upcoming talks in Geneva would be "serious and substantive."
"The Americans often return to the topic of concession, and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia," he said.
Zelenskyy added that he also felt US pressure when it came to the topic of elections. Trump has joined Moscow's calls for early presidential elections in Ukraine, despite Ukraine's constitution prohibiting elections when martial law is in effect.
"Give us two months of ceasefire. We will go to elections," Zelenskyy told his audience at the MSC.
Europe to increase defense capabilities
Zelenskyy also repeated his warning that Russian President Vladmir Putin might also attack other European countries. "Can you imagine Putin without war?" he asked. "Be honest."
"Right now his focus is on Ukraine […] but he will not let other European nations go either," Zelenskyy argued. "[Putin] cannot let go of the very idea of war. He may see himself as a czar but in reality he is a slave to war."
While speaking with DW in Munich, Polish Foreign Minister Radsloav Sikorski voiced similar concerns. "In Poland, we think that if Putin succeeded in conquering Ukraine, we would be next," he said.
Many speaking at this year's MSC have stressed that, in light of Russian aggression under Putin, Europe needed to beef up its defenses and decouple from US dependencies.
In his opening speech on Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz reiterated his pledge of turning German forces, the Bundeswehr, into the strongest conventional army in Europe.
Also on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said it was time to turn Europe into a "geopolitical power," while British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for more "hard power" and "a shared industrial base across our continent which could turbocharge our defense production."
The road may still be long, but at the MSC, it appears European leaders may have at least agreed upon the destination.

What the Canada school shooting suspect’s online history reveals
- Jesse Van Rootselaar, 18, killed nine people, including her mother, stepbrother, five schoolchildren and an education assistant, in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, before dying from a self-inflicted injury; 27 others were injured.
- Van Rootselaar maintained an extensive online presence, including accounts on forums like WatchPeopleDie, where she shared and consumed content glorifying mass violence and gore and created a Roblox game simulating a mall shooting.
- Her digital footprint also revealed struggles with mental health, including depression and an autism diagnosis, and discussions about suicidal thoughts and her gender transition, for which she was awaiting hormonal treatment.
- Police confirmed Van Rootselaar was transgender and used she/her pronouns, a detail that became a focus on social media, despite data showing transgender individuals are rarely perpetrators of mass shootings and are more often victims of violence.
- Experts and law enforcement are increasingly concerned about online radicalization leading to “Nihilistic Violent Extremism,” a trend that glorifies violence and its perpetrators, which Van Rootselaar's online activity appears to reflect.

Zelensky: US proposes 15-year security guarantees, but Ukraine needs more than 20
He made the remarks during a briefing in Munich on Saturday, Ukrinform reports.
"Today we met with senators. We very much want to extend the duration of security guarantees so that they are more effective for investors. We just had a meeting with investors and business representatives, and they need guarantees that last longer than five or ten years. Today, we have a proposal from the United States for 15 years. We want 20 or more years – 30, 50," Zelensky said.
He noted that the final decision regarding the duration of the security guarantees will depend on the U.S. leadership and Congress.
Zelensky met with U.S. senators in Munich earlier in the day. Among other issues, the sides discussed work on security guarantees for Ukraine.

Son of Iran's last shah urges US action as 200,000 supporters rally in Munich

The exiled son of Iran's last shah said he was ready to lead the country to a "secular democratic future" at a rally in Munich on Saturday, February 14, after US President Donald Trump said a change of power would be the "best thing." It came as Washington continued to engage diplomatically with Tehran's government, with Switzerland on Saturday confirming that mediator Oman would host a fresh round of talks in Geneva next week.
US-based Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy, told the crowd of around 200,000 people of his supporters that he could lead a transition.
"I am here to guarantee a transition to a secular democratic future," he said. "I am committed to be the leader of transition for you so we can one day have the final opportunity to decide the fate of our country through a democratic, transparent process to the ballot box."
"Javid shah (long live the shah)," the crowd chanted as they waved green-white-and-red flags with a lion and a sun – the emblem of the toppled monarchy.
Pahlavi has urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations against the authorities, calling on them to chant slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8:00 pm (1630 GMT) Saturday and Sunday, to coincide with protests in Germany and elsewhere.
Trump had said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen," as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on Tehran.
He had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
"To President Trump... The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them," Pahlavi had earlier told reporters gathered at the Munich Security Conference. "It is time to end the Islamic republic," he said.
Iranian opposition divided
When Iran began its crackdown on protests, Trump initially said the United States was "locked and loaded" to help demonstrators. But he has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear program, which US forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Representatives of Iran and the US, who have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the 1979 revolution, held talks on the nuclear program last week in Oman. On Sunday, a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP that Oman would host a new round of talks in Geneva next week, without providing further details.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans despite the ongoing crackdown, as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
According to US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 7,008 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the crackdown, though they and other rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher. More than 53,000 people have been arrested, it added.
Pahlavi had encouraged Iranians to join the wave of protests, which Iranian authorities have said were hijacked by "terrorists" fueled by their sworn enemies, the US and Israel.
Many protest chants had called for the monarchy's return, and Pahlavi, 65, has said he is ready to lead a democratic transition.
The Iranian opposition remains divided and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel, making a highly publicized visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father's autocratic rule.
Trump declined on Friday to say who he would want to take over in Iran from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."

Fresh sabotage disrupts Italy’s high-speed rail services
Deputy premier calls incidents ‘criminal acts’ as investigation begins
LONDON
Following three attempts to disrupt railways earlier this month, suspected sabotage disrupted Italy’s high-speed rail network Saturday, causing hours-long delays, with Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini condemning the incidents as “criminal acts.”
The Rome-Naples and Rome-Florence high-speed lines were affected by what authorities described as new sabotage attempts, as the Winter Olympics Games are underway in Italy.
Police confirmed that a manhole had been tampered with in Rome’s Salaria district, resulting in burnt cables, the Italian news agency ANSA reported. Authorities have opened an investigation.
In a separate incident in Capena, a technical fault was reported. Another incident occurred on Via di Salone, on the outskirts of Rome.
Salvini, who also serves as transport minister, denounced the disruptions.
“Surveillance has been increased and we have stepped up inspections to root out these criminals, hoping that no one downplays or justifies criminal acts that put people’s lives at risk,” Salvini wrote on the US-based social media platform X.
Earlier this week, an anarchist group claimed responsibility for the three attempted acts of sabotage targeting railway lines in Italy on Feb. 7, the same day the first competitions of the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics were held.

Palestinian finance minister warns of 'existential threat' as Israel withholds tax revenues
Palestinian Finance Minister Estephan Salameh warned on Saturday that 2026 will be the most financially difficult year in more than three decades, accusing Israel of seeking to “destroy” the Palestinian Authority (PA) by imposing a "financial siege".
Speaking to the official Voice of Palestine radio, Salameh said the Israeli government had taken a decision to undermine the PA by withholding key revenues.
"The Israeli government has taken its decision to destroy the Authority through a financial siege," he said, adding: "This year will, in my estimation, be the most financially difficult since the establishment of the Palestinian National Authority."
The PA was established in 1994 under the Oslo Accords signed between the Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel in 1993.
Salameh described the Israeli economic pressure as an "existential threat" aimed at weakening the Palestinian national project and preventing the realisation of a Palestinian state.
He said Israel has not transferred Palestinian clearance tax revenues for 10 months “with the aim of exhausting the PA's ability to provide basic services to citizens”.
According to the minister, the Palestinian government’s public debt has exceeded $15.4 billion, a figure he described as "very large compared to the size of the local economy".
Arabi21 reported that the government has been forced to resort to borrowing from banks as an emergency measure to manage the shortfall.
The PA has faced recurring financial crises since 2019 due to Israeli deductions from clearance revenues. The crisis intensified in 2025, which Palestinian officials described as the most difficult year, with accumulated deficits and unpaid dues reaching $4.26 billion, according to Palestinian data.
Clearance revenues are taxes collected by Israel on goods imported into Palestinian areas on behalf of the PA. However, Israel has frequently withheld or deducted portions of these funds, using them as leverage in political disputes.
Following the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on 7 October 2023, Tel Aviv began transferring only about 30 percent of clearance revenues, after deducting funds allocated by the Palestinian government to salaries and social services in Gaza.
Israeli ministers have also escalated rhetoric against the PA. Far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir has described it as "terrorist" and called for its removal.
The financial strain comes as violence in the occupied West Bank has intensified.
Since the start of the Gaza war, at least 1,112 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank, around 11,500 injured and approximately 22,000 arrested, according to official figures.
Palestinian officials warn that without the restoration of clearance revenues, the PA's ability to function and provide basic services could deteriorate further in the coming year.

Zelensky, Rubio discuss air defense for Ukraine, possibility of leader-level peace talks
Editor's Note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14, Presidential Office Spokesperson Serhii Nykyforov told the media.
The discussion focused on the situation on the battlefield, Russian attacks, and the damage caused to Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Part of the discussion included ways to support Ukraine with additional air defense missiles during the winter, according to the Presidential Office.
Rubio and Zelensky also discussed the next round of trilateral peace talks among the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia, set to take place in Geneva on Feb. 17–18.
"It's important that the planned negotiations in Geneva be productive, and I thank the United States for its constructive approach," Zelensky said after the meeting. "We also touched on the sequence of steps. It's important to make progress on issues of security guarantees and economic recovery."
The peace negotiations will eventually require a top-level meeting with the leaders of Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia, the Presidential Office said in a statement published after the talks.
"Ukraine believes that a meeting at the leadership level should ultimately be held to resolve the most problematic issues," the statement said.
Zelensky met with Rubio following his conference speech earlier in the day. Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha and Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Rustem Umerov joined him in the talks.
Following the meeting, Zelensky also held a phone call with Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys representing Washington in the ongoing negotiations. They discussed the upcoming talks, the recent rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi, and the meeting with Rubio.
"Not everything can be disclosed over the phone, and our negotiating team will present Ukraine's position next week," Zelensky said after the call on Feb. 14. He thanked the U.S. team for their "constructive attitude."
Both Zelensky and Rubio addressed the conference in separate speeches on Feb. 14. Zelensky stressed Ukraine's commitment to the ongoing peace negotiations among Kyiv, Moscow, and Washington, but said territorial concessions to Russia would not lead to peace.
Rubio also acknowledged that the question of control over Ukraine's eastern Donbas region has not been resolved in the current negotiations.
In a briefing after his speech, Zelensky told journalists that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee, but that Kyiv was looking for a longer-term pledge.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing. We want to have 20 years plus. Thirty, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
The day before Zelensky's meeting with Rubio, Trump said that Zelensky needs to "get moving" to secure a peace deal with Russia.
"Russia wants to make a deal and Zelensky is going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity," Trump claimed. "He has to move."
When asked about Trump's comments, Zelensky acknowledged on Feb. 14 that the U.S. president may be "preparing (the) atmosphere" ahead of the upcoming peace talks in Switzerland.
"Not losing our dignity, we can move," Zelensky said.

Two Palestinian Jerusalem families forced to demolish their homes amid West bank attacks
Two residents of Jerusalem have been forced to demolish their own homes following Israeli orders, amid continuing raids and settler attacks in the occupied West Bank.
Rami al-Bakri, a resident of Beit Hanina north of occupied Jerusalem, had received a demolition order for his 35 square metre-home on al-Zaytouna Street two weeks prior from Israeli authorities.
To avoid paying a hefty fine if the municipality were to carry out the demolition, al-Bakri was forced to carry out the process himself to destroy the home in which he and his wife lived for eight years.
Al-Bakri had previously paid fines estimated at about 40,000 shekels (US$13,000) to cover additional costs in addition to lawyers’ fees and payments for licensing procedures.
Another resident of the Jerusalem Governorate, Samer Alyan Arar, was likewise required to dismantle his house in Jabal al-Mukabber, southeast of Jerusalem.
On 26 January, Israeli soldiers raided his home and gave him three weeks to implement the demolition order or face a penalty for the municipality’s own work to destroy the house.
Israel claimed the building had been built without a permit despite the house existing since 2018 and housing seven people over an area of 80 square metres.
Arar already faced two penalties issued by Israeli authorities in 2014 when he had submitted planning maps for construction at the request of the municipality. He now faces an additional fine worth about 100,000 shekels (US$32,350).
Israel often claims that its demolition orders are due to a lack of building permits but human rights groups say that these are nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain.
West Bank incursions continuing
The two demolitions coincided with raids by Israeli forces across the occupied West Bank, resulting in multiple injuries, arrests, and damage to property.
At dawn on Saturday, Israeli forces stormed Balata east of Nablus and deployed multiple soldiers to several of the refugee camp’s neighbourhoods, local sources told The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed.
Multiple families were forced to evacuate their homes, according to the residents. Israeli forces also caused an explosion at the local headquarters of the Fatah movement.
Israeli forces also raided multiple locations in the Nablus and Bethlehem Governorates overnight, including the Dheisheh refugee camp, detaining dozens of Palestinians.
A young man was shot and sustained injuries in his thigh after confrontations broke out between residents and Israeli soldiers in the town of Tuqu’, southeast of Bethlehem, on Friday night.
Separately, the Palestinian Red Crescent said a 59-year-old man was hospitalized after being shot in the foot with live ammunition near the so-called separation wall in Dar Salah, east of Bethlehem.
Settler attacks also continued overnight, with a group of Israelis piercing the tires of more than 10 trucks and vehicles belonging to Palestinians in the town of Sur Baher, southeast of Jerusalem.
Multiple acres of Palestinian land were fenced off by Israeli settlers northeast of Ramallah at dawn on Saturday, under the protection of Israeli soldiers.
Settlers also destroyed olive trees in the southern area of al-Mughayyir on Friday evening.
Three residents from the Dabbabseh family in Khirbet Khallat al-Dab, in the Masafer Yatta area, had to receive medical treatment after being assaulted by settlers, according to al-Baidar Human Rights Organisation.
Following the incident, Israeli soldiers stormed homes of neighbouring Khirbet al-Halawah.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky stated at a news conference on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference that the United States insists security guarantees for Ukraine can only be provided simultaneously with the signing of the remaining settlement documents, not beforehand.
"This is absolutely true," Zelensky confirmed. "The US has openly conveyed to us that it wants to see peace concluded as swiftly as possible. They prefer all the documents to be signed together. I responded that it would be better for Ukraine to secure security guarantees first.".

LA Olympics leader Wasserman will sell talent agency in wake of Epstein emails discovery
Casey Wasserman, the chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, is selling his eponymous talent agency in the wake of the release of emails between himself and Ghislaine Maxwell
- Bookmark
Casey Wasserman, the chairman of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics organizing committee, is selling his eponymous talent agency in the wake of the release of emails between himself and Ghislaine Maxwell.
Wasserman's emails with Maxwell were revealed by his appearance in recently released government files on Jeffrey Epstein. Wasserman, whose agency represents some of the top pop music artists in the world, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
The recently released documents revealed that in 2003 he swapped flirtatious emails with Maxwell, who would years later be accused of helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse his victims. Wasserman said in a Friday evening memo to his staff that he has begun the process of selling the company, according to a company spokesperson who provided the memo to The Associated Press.
Wasserman's memo to staff said that he felt he had become a distraction to the company's work.
“During this time, Mike Watts will assume day-to-day control of the business while I devote my full attention to delivering Los Angeles an Olympic Games in 2028 that is worthy of this outstanding city,” the memo stated.
The memo arrived days after the LA28 board's executive committee met to discuss Wasserman's appearance in the Epstein files. The committee said it and an outside legal firm conducted a review of Wasserman's interactions with Epstein and Maxwell with Wasserman's full cooperation.
The committee said in a statement: “We found Mr. Wasserman’s relationship with Epstein and Maxwell did not go beyond what has already been publicly documented.” The statement also said Wasserman “should continue to lead LA28 and deliver a safe and successful games.”
Wasserman has said previously that he flew on a humanitarian mission to Africa on Epstein’s private plane at the invitation of the Clinton Foundation in 2002. Exchanges between Wasserman and Maxwell in the files include Wasserman telling Maxwell: “I think of you all the time. So, what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?”
His agency, also called Wasserman, has lost clients over the Maxwell emails. Singer Chappell Roan and retired U.S. women's soccer legend Abby Wambach are among them.
Wasserman said in his memo to staff that his interactions with Maxwell and Epstein were limited and he regrets the emails.
“It was years before their criminal conduct came to light, and, in its entirety, consisted of one humanitarian trip to Africa and a handful of emails that I deeply regret sending. And I’m heartbroken that my brief contact with them 23 years ago has caused you, this company, and its clients so much hardship over the past days and weeks,” the memo said.

- US Ambassador Whitaker stated China enables Russia's Ukraine war, providing critical parts and buying oil. He believes China could end the conflict. Beijing denies these "baseless criticisms."
- US Democratic leaders at the Munich conference reassured European allies of the US commitment to transatlantic alliances, despite President Trump's past actions.
- Democratic leaders acknowledged strained US-Europe trust but affirmed it is rebuildable. Ambassador Whitaker claimed NATO is "stronger than ever" due to US pressure on spending.

MUNICH, Germany – China is providing crucial support for Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and could end the war with a phone call, US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said.
“China could call Vladimir Putin and end this war tomorrow and cut off his dual-purpose technologies that they’re selling,” Mr Whitaker said, during a late Feb 13 panel at the Munich Security Conference.
“China could stop buying Russian oil and gas.”
“You know, this war is being completely enabled by China,” the US envoy added, during a panel on US foreign policy moderated by Bloomberg’s Francine Lacqua.
China and Russia have forged an even tighter partnership since the start of the war, and Russia relies on China for critical parts and components for drones and other war material. China is also once again the biggest buyer of Russia’s crude oil shipments even as international pressure intensifies on Moscow’s critical oil trade.
Tracking data show 1.65 million barrels a day of crude offloaded at Chinese ports in January. That is the most since March 2024 and the second-highest monthly total since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
China’s Foreign Ministry in a statement on Feb 14 dismissed allegations regarding its support for the war as an “entirely baseless criticism.”
Beijing has repeatedly said it wants to have a “constructive” role in ending the crisis. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andrii Sybiha, in Munich this week and offered humanitarian aid to the country
The Munich conference, which runs from Feb 13 to 15, attracts global policy leaders to discuss foreign relations and international security. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are among the dignitaries assembled.
Mr Whitaker was joined on the Munich Security Conference panel by two potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders: Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
Other prominent Democratic political figures, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, travelled to the conference, seeking to reassure European allies of US commitment to the transatlantic alliance as President Donald Trump threatens to uproot relationships across the globe.
“The Democratic Party is here for our allies,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez said. “The vast majority of the American people do not want to see these relationships frayed, and they are committed to our allies.”
Ms Whitmer said strains between the US and European allies, including trade tensions and Mr Trump’s pressure campaign to obtain Greenland
“It will take time to rebuild but I’m confident that we’ll do that,” the Michigan governor said.
Mr Whitaker, who Mr Trump appointed as his envoy to NATO, said the alliance is “stronger than ever” because of the US president’s pressure on allies to ramp up military spending.
“The United States of America keeps showing up, and we will keep showing up. We just expect our allies to be equally as strong,” Mr Whitaker said. BLOOMBERG

150,000 Afghans have returned from Pakistan, Iran this year: UN
Nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned from Pakistan and Iran this year, with the speed and size of the migration pushing Afghanistan deeper into crisis, the UN refugee agency said Friday.
After decades hosting Afghans fleeing crises at home, Pakistan and Iran have ramped up deportations and forced millions back across the border to a country struggling to provide for them.
"So far this year, nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned from Iran and Pakistan", Arafat Jamal, the UNHCR representative to Afghanistan, told a press briefing in Geneva.
"The high number of returns already this year is concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall", he said, speaking from Kabul.
"These arrivals come on top of already unprecedented returns - 2.9 million people in 2025, bringing the total to some 5.4 million since October 2023".
Jamal said they were returning, or being forced to return, in extremely difficult circumstances.
Whether arriving at the frontier surrounded by family or alone, Afghan returnees must establish a new life in a nation beset by poverty and environmental woes.
"The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation - particularly for women and girls - a fragile economy, and recurring natural disasters", said Jamal.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch told AFP the number of returns was up more than 50 percent on this time last year, when just under 100,000 had returned.
Jamal said that, according to a UNHCR survey of returnees, many families said that members lacked civil documentation, and more than 90 percent were living on less than $5 a day.
And he voiced deep concern over the sustainability of returns, saying some were already leaving Afghanistan again.
"These decisions are not driven by a desire to leave, but by the reality that many are unable to rebuild a viable and dignified life", he said.
UNHCR is focusing its efforts on supporting reintegration of returnees.
The agency said it needed $216 million this year to support displaced people and returnees across the country, but its appeal was currently just eight percent funded.
"This is a critical moment to act while there is an opportunity to find long-term solutions and resolve displacement for Afghan returnees in their homeland, often after years or decades in exile", said Jamal.

Israeli FM Saar to attend Trump’s first Board of Peace meeting on Thursday, officials say
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Feb 14 - Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar will attend U.S. President Donald Trump's first formal Board of Peace meeting on February 19, two Israeli officials said on Saturday.
U.S. officials told Reuters this week that Trump will announce a multi-billion dollar reconstruction plan for Gaza and detail plans for a U.N.-authorized stabilization force for the Palestinian enclave at the meeting in Washington.
Delegations from at least 20 countries, including heads of state, are expected to attend the meeting of the board whose creation was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.
While regional Middle East powers, including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious.
The U.S. officials said the meeting will focus on Gaza, where two years of war have left much of the Palestinian enclave in ruins.
Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to Trump's plan last year with a ceasefire taking effect in October. More than 590 Palestinians, many of them civilians, and four Israeli soldiers have been killed in rounds of violence that have erupted since.
Both sides have accused each other of violating the ceasefire, even as Trump's administration has pressed for progress to the next steps envisaged in the plan.
One of those is the deployment of the International Stabilization Force, as Israeli troops further withdraw and Hamas disarms.
The U.S. officials said Trump will announce that several countries plan to provide several thousand troops to the stabilization force that is expected to deploy in Gaza in the months ahead.
Hamas has so far rejected demands to lay down its weapons and Israel has said that if the group does not disarm peacefully, Israel will have to force it to do so. REUTERS

Libya's Haftar reshuffles southern forces after border clash

Libya's Haftar reshuffles southern forces after border clash
Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar has moved to reorganise his military deployment in southern Libya following an armed challenge by tribes at a key border crossing and a helicopter crash.
Last week, Haftar issued a decision forming a new unit, the “18th Infantry Brigade”, consolidating several of his main southern militias, including the 176th, 634th, 672nd and 676th battalions, under one command structure.
Haftar's forces control most of eastern and southern Libya but do not operate under the authority of the Libyan government in Tripoli.
The brigade was granted "full public force in terms of personnel, vehicles, equipment, weapons, communications devices, military supplies, headquarters and financial allocations", according to the decision.
The move comes days after a tribal armed group calling itself the "Southern Liberation Operations Force", composed of Tebu fighters, seized control of the Tumm border crossing with Niger on 31 January. The confrontation left three members of Haftar’s forces dead and ten captured.
Haftar’s forces quickly regained control of the crossing. However, they did not announce the recovery of the captives. Reinforcements were later sent to the nearby town of al-Qatrun in an apparent effort to secure the border corridor and prevent further instability.
The border incident was preceded by the crash of a military helicopter at al-Sarra base in southeastern Libya on 9 February.
Libyan sources from Kufra told The New Arab's Arabic sister outlet Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that five people were killed, including two foreigners. Kufra’s municipal council mourned three victims, two members of the military medical evacuation unit and a nurse from Kufra hospital.
Belarusian outlet Nashaniva reported that the dead included a Russian pilot, his Belarusian assistant and three Libyans.
Haftar’s command has not issued an official explanation. The lack of comment has fuelled speculation over whether the crash was a technical failure or the result of deliberate targeting.
In parallel with the military reshuffle, local sources from al-Qatrun told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that Haftar’s leadership had opened contacts with leaders of the Tebu tribes, whose presence spans the Libya-Niger border.
The aim, according to the sources, is to contain tensions and isolate the armed group responsible for the takeover of the Tumm crossing.
The discussions reportedly included the possibility of incorporating Tebu elements into Haftar-aligned forces to help secure crossings and corridors within what is known as the "Salvador Triangle" linking Algeria, Niger and Libya.
The emergence of Haftar’s son Khaled Haftar as a player in the south forms part of what sources have described as a redistribution of roles within the leadership circle. Khaled has been granted broader authority to oversee military units as chief of staff, while his brother Saddam Haftar has focused more on external relations.
The decision to base the 18th Infantry Brigade in Murzuq, rather than Um al-Aranib, previously a central hub for southern deployments, signals a shift in the centre of command closer to al-Qatrun and the contested border belt.
The consolidation of militias coincided with the appointment of a new head of the Murzuq Security Directorate. This suggests a recalibration from a purely military posture toward a security-focused approach that also seeks to manage relations with local tribes and stabilise the border region.
Southern Libya remains strategically significant due to its oil fields, gold mines and proximity to Chad, Niger and Sudan.
The al-Sarra base, where the helicopter crash occurred, has gained increased importance because of its location overlooking Chad and Sudan, as well as the reported Russian military presence there since early last year.

Russia deliberately attacks Azerbaijan's diplomatic representation in Ukraine – Aliyev
Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said during a panel at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
"There have been not only attacks on Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure in Ukraine, but also three times attacks on Azerbaijan's embassy in Ukraine. And after the first attack, we could imagine that that was accidental. And we gave our Russian colleagues all the coordinates of Azerbaijan's diplomatic representations, including the consular department, our cultural center and embassy. Despite all that, there have been two more attacks. So that was a deliberate attack on Azerbaijan's diplomatic representation," Aliyev said.
The Azerbaijani president noted that the issue of Russian attacks on Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure and diplomatic missions in Ukraine has been repeatedly raised in numerous contacts between officials at the level of foreign ministries and presidential administrations.
"And we issued special statements and also the ambassador was invited and a diplomatic note was submitted. We act only in a diplomatic way. We cannot do anything else… all the necessary diplomatic steps have been taken by the Azerbaijani government," he emphasized.
He stressed that such actions by Russia are considered unfriendly toward Azerbaijan.
As Ukrinform reported, in November last year, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Russian ambassador in Baku to deliver a protest note over a Russian strike that damaged the Republic's embassy in Kyiv. At that time, the strike damaged the embassy building, service vehicles, the administrative building, and the consular section.
Earlier, on March 10, 2022, an airstrike on the building of the Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Kharkiv caused severe damage to the administrative building, and a service vehicle was rendered unusable.

Iran, US spar as diaspora organises rallies abroad calling for action
Iranian families release footage online commemorating loved ones shot during nationwide antigovernment protests.
Tehran, Iran – Iran and the United States are presenting clashing views before expected talks as diaspora Iranians rally across the world to demand action after thousands were killed during last month’s nationwide protests.
Amid reports that a second round of mediated talks may take place over the coming days, Washington has maintained it wants to limit Iran’s missile programme and end all its nuclear enrichment.

Iran has consistently rejected both demands, saying it could dilute highly enriched uranium – all said to be buried under rubble after being bombed by the US in June – in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
US President Donald Trump said at the White House on Friday that he is sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding that “regime change” in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”.
Speaking at a conference in Tehran on Saturday aimed at attracting regional investment for railroad projects, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian thanked the leaders of Azerbaijan, Turkiye, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and others for mediating to prevent a US military attack.
“All of these countries are working so that we can resolve our own problems with peace and calm, and we are able to do this. We do not need a custodian,” Pezeshkian said, warning that a war would impact the entire Middle East.
Switzerland’s Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Iran and the US would hold the next round of talks in Geneva next week. Oman, which hosted the first round in Muscat last week, will mediate.
Major rallies in US, Europe
A large number of Iranians abroad who are opposed to the theocratic establishment governing Iran since a 1979 revolution participated in rallies across the world on Saturday to demand an end to religious rule.
Reza Pahlavi, son of Iran’s US-backed shah who was deposed in the revolution, called on Iranians living abroad to be part of a “global day of action” aimed at “taking Iran back” from the Islamic Republic. He also addressed the Munich Security Conference in Germany and met with leaders such as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and senior US Senator Lindsey Graham.
The three main cities designated for the protests were Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto. Iranians also marched in cities in Australia, including Sydney and Melbourne.
A similar rally last month in Toronto saw more than150,000 people in attendance and no adverse incidents, according to city police. About 100,000 people registered early to attend the Munich rally on Saturday.
The rallies are some of the largest ever held by the Iranian diaspora and the biggest since demonstrations in solidarity with the deadly 2022-2023 nationwide protests in Iran, triggered by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, 22, for allegedly wearing the mandatory hijab for women improperly.
The latest protests were held days after the Iranian establishment organised demonstrations and burned the flags of Israel and the US to mark the 47th anniversary of the 1979 revolution.
“They killed my innocent girl for a few strands of hair and nobody was held accountable, but now they record women with bare heads and so-called unconventional attire in their official ceremonies and nobody yells that Islam is in danger,” Amini’s father wrote in an Instagram story after state television interviewed a pro-establishment woman without a hijab.
Since the killing of thousands of protesters last month, mostly carried out on the nights of January 8-9, similar rallies have been held to raise awareness in dozens of cities across the globe, including The Hague, Zurich, Rome, Budapest and Tokyo.
The United Nations and international human rights organisations said they documented widespread use of lethal force by state forces against peaceful protesters. But the Iranian government rejected all their allegations, claiming “terrorists” and “rioters” armed and funded by the US and Israel were behind the killings across Iran.
Families united in grief, strength
From Kuhchenar county in southern Iran’s Fars province to central Arak and Mashhad in the northeast, families continue to release footage online to commemorate their loved ones killed during the demonstrations.
Behesht-e Zahra, a cemetery in Tehran, was crowded on Friday as people gathered in solidarity with multiple families holding mourning ceremonies to mark “chehelom”, or 40 days since the killing of their loved ones.
Bereaved relatives somberly clapped, played music and showed the “victory” sign in an attempt to express pride, strength and defiance despite their losses.
Among those remembered were Ayda Heydari, 21, a medical student, and Zahra “Raha” Behloulipour, who attended Tehran University. Both were shot and killed with multiple live rounds in separate incidents.
The state-run Mehr news agency reported Heydari was “a victim of Mossad agents in recent riots” and released a short clip of an interview with her family. Heydari’s mother said her daughter was not a “munafiq”, a term the Islamic Republic uses to describe dissidents.
Mohammad-Hossein Omid, head of Tehran University, last week told the semiofficial ISNA news agency that “most” of the people taking part in the nationwide demonstrations were “protesters not terrorists”.
Concerns for prisoners
The Iranian judiciary confirmed on Saturday that a number of senior reformist politicians arrested last week for criticising the establishment were released on bail while others remained behind bars to face previous charges.
Vahid Shalchi, a deputy science minister, cited judiciary officials as saying “a considerable” number of arrested students will be released soon but did not say how many are being held.
Tens of thousands of people have been arrested during and after the protests, and human rights organisations said some are in immediate danger of being executed – allegations the Iranian judiciary has rejected.
Amnesty International said 18-year-old wrestling champion Saleh Mohammadi has been sentenced to public execution in Qom after being forced to make confessions about being involved in the death of a security agent.
Mai Sato – UN special rapporteur on Iran, who previously said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed during the demonstrations – said three other people face execution and “What is happening now is not new.”
“The same patterns documented in those individual cases are being replicated on a mass scale after the nationwide protests,” she said.
A specific casualty toll from the demonstrations is unknown as information remains extremely limited because of ongoing heavy internet filtering.

Epstein’s girlfriend married a woman, showing how he gamed immigration
The late sex offender used student visas, English language courses and sham marriages to keep foreign women in the US
In early 2013, Jeffrey Epstein’s girlfriend, Karyna Shuliak, was stressed about her US visa status. Later that year, she married an American citizen and her worries were gone.
A Green Card followed, and in 2018, citizenship. Then Shuliak divorced her spouse: a woman named Jennifer who had been in a relationship with Kimbal Musk – Elon Musk’s brother – after Epstein connected them.
“now that she’s an american you should throw her a big ole party,” one of Epstein’s go-to immigration lawyers messaged on the day of Shuliak’s naturalisation interview. “with a mechanical bull, red white and blue balloons, and deep fried snickers bars on flag toothpicks”.
Shuliak’s immigration story – and the stories of several other women revealed in a cache of files released by the US Department of Justice – show how Epstein used student visas, English language courses and sham marriages to make sure the women in his orbit stayed right where he wanted them.
The convicted paedophile had arranged for Shuliak’s admission to Columbia University’s dental school, as a transfer student from Belarus who had not finished her degree, via a complicated process that began in 2011.
After she got in, communications between her and members of the Ivy League school’s international student office show her immigration case was another hurdle to clear.

GENEVA - Switzerland said on Feb 14 that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
“Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran,” a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP.
On Feb 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump’s influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Mr Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran’s nuclear programme, which US forces struck in July 2025
Mr Trump said on Feb 13 that a change of government in Iran ratcheting up military pressure
Go-between
Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the US for decades.
Renowned for its neutrality, Switzerland has been representing US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.
In its role as the so-called protecting power, Switzerland has for decades allowed the two feuding nations to maintain a minimum of diplomatic and consular relations.
The Swiss embassy in Tehran handles all consular affairs between the US and Iran, including passport requests, altering civil status and consular protection for US citizens in Iran.
Under the protecting power mandate, “Switzerland can either offer to act as a go-between on its own initiative or can fulfil this function at the request of the parties concerned, provided that all those involved agree,” the foreign ministry says on its website.
The US will be holding separate talks, also in Geneva next week, between Russia and Ukraine.
Moscow and Kyiv will hold US-brokered talks on Feb 17 and 18 in the Swiss city, both countries have said, announcing the next leg in fraught negotiations seeking to end the four-year war.
Mr Trump is pushing to halt the conflict, but two previous rounds of US-mediated talks in Abu Dhabi have not yielded signs of a breakthrough. AFP

New archbishop of Westminster urges greater understanding of struggles of ‘the vulnerable’

The new leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales has said the church has failed vulnerable people, urging more work to be done to address the struggle of refugees and learn from victims of abuse.
At a ceremony where he was officially installed in his new role as archbishop of Westminster, Richard Moth said: “Here, I am most aware of every occasion on which members of the church, or the church as a whole, have failed – most especially when the vulnerable have been abused.
“Such failure calls for listening to, and learning from, those who have suffered so grievously – and a continuing commitment to ensuring that our communities are places where all are safe in their encounter with Christ and with one another.”
Addressing the congregation of 2,000 people in Westminster Cathedral on Saturday, the new archbishop added that the church’s “vital” evangelical work is “fragile and adversely impacted by our failures in love, power and self-control”.
Moth was named as the 12th archbishop of Westminster by Pope Leo XIV in December, when he became the leader of the approximately 4 million Catholics in England and Wales.
The Westminster role was previously held by Cardinal Vincent Nichols, who retired after 16 years. Moth said Nichols is now moving “to slightly more restful pastures”.
Moth was born in Zambia but moved to Kent in his early years. His previous role was as bishop of Arundel and Brighton; before that he was bishop of the Forces.
The new leader has spoken publicly about issues surrounding migration and condemned the recent comments made by billionaire and co-owner of Manchester United, Sir Jim Ratcliffe.
In an interview with the Press Association, he said: “Speaking into a debate is fine, but the language is unfortunate, and I think that approach that he expressed is a deeply unfortunate one. I would disagree with it wholeheartedly.”
He also criticised government policies to house asylum seekers in hotels. “I think the debate I would like to see is how can we best approach this issue? Having people living in hotels for long periods of time is not ideal,” he said in the same interview.
At the ceremony in Westminster, the new archbishop of Canterbury, Dame Sarah Mullally, said Moth has a “deep concern for the dignity of every person”.
“In a world marked by division and uncertainty, the call to unity flows from the heart of the gospel itself – our traditions are not weakened by friendship, they are deepened when we walk together in charity, honesty and truth,” she said.
Moth has also spoken about the “opportunity” for the church to capture the interest of new believers.
In an interview with the Catholic Herald this month, he said: “Most dioceses report increased adult baptisms and a gradual rise in people coming to church. Numbers are picking up again after Covid, though not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. There is also growing interest from young adults exploring or entering the church. So there is a great opportunity here.”

US completes transfer of 5,700 IS detainees from Syria to Iraq

US military completes transfer of 5,700 IS detainees from Syria to Iraq
The United States Central Command said it has completed the transfer of more than 5,700 detained Islamic State group suspects from Syria to Iraq.
The detainees from some 60 countries had for years been held in Syrian prisons run by Kurdish-led forces before the recapture of surrounding territory by Damascus prompted Washington to step in.
CENTCOM said it "completed a transfer mission following a nighttime flight from northeastern Syria to Iraq on Feb 12 to help ensure ISIS detainees remain secure in detention facilities."
"The 23-day transfer mission began on Jan 21 and resulted in US forces successfully transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS fighters from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody," it added in a statement.
The US had previously announced it would transfer around 7,000 detainees.
IS swept across Syria and Iraq in 2014, committing massacres and forcing women and girls into sexual slavery.
Backed by US-led forces, Iraq proclaimed the defeat of IS in the country in 2017, and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) ultimately beat back the group in Syria two years later.
The SDF went on to jail thousands of suspected jihadists and detain tens of thousands of their relatives in camps.
61 countries
Last month, Syrian troops drove Kurdish forces from swathes of northern Syria, sparking questions over the fate of the IS prisoners.
Lingering doubts about security pushed Washington to announce it would transfer them to Iraq to prevent "a breakout" that could threaten the region.
"We appreciate Iraq's leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security," said head of CENTCOM Admiral Brad Cooper.
"Job well done to the entire Joint Force team who executed this exceptionally challenging mission on the ground and in the air," he added.
Iraq's National Centre for International Judicial Cooperation (NCIJC) said 5,704 IS detainees of 61 nationalities have arrived in Iraq.
They include 3,543 Syrians, 467 Iraqis, and another 710 detainees from other Arab countries.
There are also more than 980 foreigners including those from Europe, Asia, Australia and the United States.
The NCIJC said Iraq's judiciary will interrogate the detainees before taking legal action against them.
Many prisons in Iraq are already packed with IS suspects.
Iraqi courts have handed down hundreds of death sentences and life terms to those convicted of terrorism offences, including foreign fighters.
Under Iraqi law, terrorism and murder offences are punishable by death, and execution decrees must be signed by the president.
The detainees in Syria were transferred to Baghdad's al-Karkh prison, once a US Army detention centre known as Camp Cropper, where former ruler Saddam Hussein was held before his execution.
To make space for the newcomers, authorities moved thousands of prisoners from the Karkh prison to other facilities, a lawyer and an inmate told AFP news agency on condition of anonymity.
Repatriation
Iraq has issued calls for countries to repatriate their nationals among the IS detainees, though this appears unlikely.
For years, Syria's Kurdish forces also called on foreign governments to take back their citizens, but this was done on a small scale limited to women and children held in detention camps.
Most foreign families have left northeast Syria's Al-Hol camp, which holds relatives of IS fighters, since the departure of Kurdish forces who previously guarded it, humanitarian sources told AFP on Thursday.
Last month, the Syrian government took over the camp from Kurdish forces who ceded territory as Damascus extended its control across swathes of Syria's northeast

Rio Carnival street party dogs parade as humans protest against pet killers
Dozens of dogs dressed as alligators, fairies and superheroes have gathered at a Rio de Janeiro Carnival street party as their owners protested cruelty against pets
- Bookmark
Dozens of dogs dressed as alligators, fairies and superheroes gathered Saturday at a Rio de Janeiro Carnival street party as their owners protested cruelty against pets. The canines wagged their tails to samba music, ate a delicious breakfast from several bowls and made new friends at the so-called Blocao, a traditional event during Brazil's biggest bash.
About 300 people and their pets gathered in the neighborhood of Barra da Tijuca, on Rio’s west side. They sang and danced to old-style Carnival songs as their pets kept their paws protected in the shade as Rio's thermometers marked 30 Celsius degrees (86 Fahrenheit).
“Dogs are a part of our families. Families come to a street party for dogs because it's sweet, it is joyful and loving,” said Marco Antonio Marinho, 72, the Blocao's chief organizer. “When we are sad at home, they are by our side, they are sad too," he said. "Now that we are happy, they have to be happy too. So we take care of their paws, we keep water for them to be comfortable and safe too.”
A hydration station helped keep the dogs' energy through the two hours of the street celebration at a square, as many cariocas, as Rio residents are known, honked their cars to show support for the dogs and to owners protesting violence against pets. In previous years, the dogs would parade through the streets, but their gentle paws were often scorched by the hot pavement.
The name Blocao is a mixture of “bloco,” which means Carnival street party, and “cao,” or dog in Portuguese. The street party has taken place for more than 20 years.
Marinho and other partygoers waved white ribbons and sang a song in a tribute to Orelha, a dog that was killed in southern Brazil in January in a case that caused national rage.
Santa Catarina state police charged a 15-year-old who allegedly spanked the dog to death but authorities have recommended the teenager be tried under the juvenile corrections system. The judge in the case has yet to rule.
The teenager's lawyer denied any wrongdoing, .
Natalia Reis, 28, came to Blocao for the first time with her 11-year-old dog Theo, partly because of Orelha's killing. She had tears in her eyes when organizers took the microphone to talk about the importance of protecting pets from cruelty.
“This was so unfortunate, we need perpetrators of his death to be punished,” Reis said. “We need to raise awareness. This could have happened to me, to any of us.”

TORONTO - Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand said Canada wants a change of government in Iran but would not say whether it would support a US military strike, the Globe and Mail reported on Feb 14.
“We will not open diplomatic relationships with Iran unless there is a regime change. Period,” Ms Anand told the Globe and Mail in an interview in Germany, where she is attending the Munich Security Conference.
Canada has particularly poor relations with Iran and cut off diplomatic ties in 2012.
Ms Anand on Feb 14 announced further sanctions against seven individuals who are connected with the Iranian government and said Canada’s focus in the region is on the repression of human rights.

After the anniversary of the 1979 revolution, defiant protesters say they will return to the streets

On Tuesday night, on the eve of the fireworks marking the anniversary of the 1979 Revolution in Iran, many neighborhoods in Tehran and other major cities became scenes of confrontation between opponents and supporters of the regime.
While a limited number of pro-government residents in each neighborhood chanted the customary “Allahu Akbar,” opponents, unafraid of identification, responded with chants of “Death to Khamenei” and “Death to the dictator,” signaling that protests in Iran are far from over.
Meanwhile, the families of thousands killed in the bloody crackdown of January 8 and 9 are preparing to hold memorial ceremonies in the coming days. Two protesters in Tehran told The Media Line that they are no longer afraid and are determined to return to the streets to complete the unfinished 47-year struggle to bring down the Islamic Republic.
Arghavan, a law student in Tehran who spontaneously went onto her rooftop Tuesday night to chant against Khamenei and drown out pro-regime slogans, said: “The regime is trying to normalize the atmosphere through celebrations and festivities, even moving ahead to mark the upcoming Mid-Sha’ban holiday. But people are angry and deeply wounded. They will not back down so easily.”
Arghavan was struck by multiple pellets during clashes in western Tehran and still struggles to walk properly. She sought refuge at her boyfriend’s home, where his mother removed the pellets without anesthesia using basic medical supplies. According to Arghavan, they were fortunate that phone lines were down, as injured individuals taken to nearby hospitals had been detained. She described the scale of live ammunition and pellet fire as so intense that “almost everyone in the crowd was hit,” with many killed or wounded.
Reflecting on the 1979 Revolution, Arghavan said it had been driven by aspirations for freedom, equality, and a better life, but that people were misled by Ayatollah Khomeini’s promises. Not only were those hopes dashed, she argued, but living conditions deteriorated significantly, personal freedoms were curtailed, and the country experienced a profound regression.
Maryam Afshari, a political activist based in Sweden, offered a broader perspective: “Various contradictions, including those between modernity and tradition, fuelled the 1979 Revolution. However, the clerical establishment ultimately rode that wave and diverted it from its original demands.” This debate has continued within Iranian society for 47 years. The Islamic Republic, having suppressed its opponents in the early years of its rule, regards itself as the rightful victor of the revolution.
On Wednesday, the government staged official celebrations and marches, in which even some unveiled women participated, with state media highlighting their presence as evidence of broad societal support. Social media users, meanwhile, drew attention to the state broadcaster’s use of artificial intelligence to depict large crowds.
The volume of “Death to Khamenei” chants the night before was so overwhelming that the slogan was even mistakenly repeated by a local television presenter during a live broadcast. In response, the state broadcaster dismissed the broadcast director of the Sistan and Balochistan provincial channel and referred members of the program’s production team to a disciplinary committee.
A resident of Azadi Street in Tehran noted that despite official pressure and efforts to mobilize state employees, turnout toward Azadi Square appeared lower than in previous years.
Amid an atmosphere of fear, intimidation, and ongoing arrests, some protesters are now speaking openly on social media under their real names, saying they are no longer afraid.
Samad, a restaurant worker in southern Tehran, says he has witnessed scenes in protests unlike anything he has seen even in apocalyptic films. A former art student expelled for being unable to pay tuition, he is now worker. “Freedom has a cost,” he says. “We have paid it. And after all this killing and violence, our anger has only deepened. We have no choice but to return to the streets empty-handed. But we know the regime cannot kill 90 million Iranians.”
He describes the country’s economic and social conditions as a kind of slow death. “Dying with dignity is better than this daily, gradual death. Our history is now written in blood in the winter of 2026. We must finish this unfinished task after 47 years.”
The restaurant where Samad works has seen a sharp decline in business since the bloody crackdown of January 8 and 9, and he fears losing his job. He earns just $70 a month for ten-hour shifts. Even with free meals and living with his family rent-free, nothing remains at the end of the month to save, or even to buy a book.
“Iranian legends about resisting tyranny and Zahhak are not just stories to read,” Samad says. “Last month, we embodied them in the streets. That is why we will return.”
As authorities brace for upcoming memorials for those killed during the uprising, concerns over potential U.S. or Israeli military action have further heightened tensions. For the first time, the Islamic Republic’s leader did not attend the annual Air Force Day meeting with commanders on February 8, with domestic media citing “security reasons.”
Instead, they met with Hassan Khomeini, grandson of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. A website called Rouydad 24, which is reportedly connected to former President Hassan Rouhani, speculated that Khomeini, alongside Alireza Arafi, Mohsen Araki, Sadiq Larijani, and Rouhani himself, could be among Khamenei's potential successors.
The Islamic Republic marks its 47th year in power amid official inflation nearing 48 percent, a sharply depreciated national currency, and widespread economic stagnation following the January protests. The livelihoods of citizens who once aspired to a better future nearly half a century ago have visibly diminished.
Many domestic analysts warn that the violent suppression of protests is not the end of the story and that authorities must remain prepared for renewed unrest. Afshin Davarpanah, an anthropologist in Tehran, said, “Young people under 30 and women are the main driving forces of the protests,” adding that since their demands remain unmet, “the protests will not end here but will continue in different and potentially more complex forms.” Even Judiciary Chief Gholam-Hossein Mohseni Eje’i has cautioned security forces to anticipate protesters’ return to the streets.
Despite what many describe as de facto martial law in numerous cities and a wave of arrests, students, retirees, workers, and various groups continue to strike and protest. With nightly rooftop chants and protest graffiti persisting until the moment, many believe that soon, mass demonstrations once again fill the streets.

Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using toxin from poison dart frogs while held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, according to a Joint Statement published by the UK on Saturday.
Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed” the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.

The official statement, published by the UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, says “given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death.”
It adds that “Russia’s repeated disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention is clear” and that “only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law to carry out the attacks.”
In a follow-up tweet, UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper added that only the Russian government had the “opportunity”
Russia had previously claimed that Navalny died of natural causes.
The BBC quotes toxicology expert Jill Johnson as saying epibatidine is “200 times more potent than morphine” and that by acting on receptors in the central nervous system, it can cause “muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death.” She added that the extremely rare neurotoxin is only found in one wild frog species in tiny quantities, and only when the frog eats a specific diet.
Trump’s Trading of Ukraine
The findings underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, according to the official statement released today.
Furthermore, allies are concerned that Russia “did not destroy all of its chemical weapons” and the UK and partners “will make use of all policy levers at our disposal to continue to hold Russia to account.”
The UK has informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of Russia’s alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Meanwhile Britain’s Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said Navalny’s “determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy” and the Russia and Putin have demonstrated “murderous intent.”
Navalny – Russia’s most prominent and outspoken opposition leader – died suddenly in a Russian jail on Feb 16, 2024. He was arrested and imprisoned upon returning to Russia after being poisoned in 2020 with the Novichok nerve agent and receiving treatment in Germany.
Before Saturday’s announcement, Navalny’s wife Yulia Navalnaya had repeatedly claimed that her husband was killed by poisoning.

Details: Zelenskyy confirmed that Germany has indeed not yet decided to supply Taurus missiles to Ukraine, but said it is too early to draw a line under the issue.
"There is no decision about Taurus from Germany. The war is not over yet," he noted.
Zelenskyy stressed that Ukraine is receiving other assistance for the Armed Forces from Berlin.
"Yesterday, we opened the line of co-production. We began to build drones. And already these drones are on the frontline," he said by way of example. "We don't have a decision from the German side. I will, I'll be honest with you. But, I have to find this balance in dialogue in what to choose," he explained.

Claims of Navalny's poisoning are Western propaganda hoax — Russian MFA

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has dismissed claims that blogger Alexey Navalny, who is officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia, was poisoned with frog-derived poison as a Western propaganda hoax.
"When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly," Zakharova stated. "Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues." She criticized the timing of these allegations, noting, "Just as the investigation into the Nord Stream explosions was about to yield results, suddenly Navalny's poisoning is brought into focus. When asked for Navalny's test results, Western officials instead circulated sensational stories about the Skripals. This pattern continues unabated."
On February 14, Germany, Britain, the Netherlands, Sweden, and France issued a joint statement claiming that Navalny was allegedly poisoned with epibatidine, a toxin derived from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog. Their conclusion was reportedly based on analyses of Navalny's biological samples. These countries accused Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention in connection with the incident.

Defense forces stop Russian attempt to consolidate in Chasiv Yar – military
The 24th Separate Mechanized Brigade named after King Danylo stated this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
"Chasiv Yar. Poor visibility. Ruins and basements. Russians operate in small groups – two or three people. They try to slip between positions, consolidate, and bring in reinforcements," the report said.
In the video, one of these groups was discovered by Ukrainian soldiers in the basement of a destroyed building. They were cornered and blocked inside.
"No options left. Prisoners or death," the Ukrainian defenders captioned the video, showing how the Russians surrendered and were escorted to Ukrainian positions under drone surveillance.
As Ukrinform reported, the Russian army, taking advantage of the weather conditions, increased pressure on the city of Chasiv Yar in the Donetsk region.

Barack Obama publicly states support for anti-ICE demonstrators in Minneapolis

Barack Obama publicly gave his support to demonstrators in Minneapolis for standing up to the “unprecedented nature” of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation in Minnesota.
Speaking in an interview with progressive YouTuber Brian Tyler Cohen on Saturday, the former president discussed the power that US citizens hold when standing up for the values they believe in and his hopes for the next generation of American leaders.
“The reason I point out that I don’t think the majority of the American people approve of this is because ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people,” he said. “We just saw this in Minnesota, in Minneapolis.”
“It is important for us to recognize the unprecedented nature of what ICE was doing in Minneapolis, St Paul, the way that federal agents, ICE agents were being deployed, without any clear guidelines, training, pulling people out of their homes, using five-year-olds to try to bait their parents, all the stuff that we saw, teargassing crowds simply who were standing there, not breaking any laws,” he added.
The Twin Cities area of Minnesota has been the site of ongoing anti-immigration enforcement protests. These demonstrations have grown in scope following the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the hands of federal agents.
But this week, Tom Homan, the US border czar, said that the Trump administration would be drawing down its immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the killings after initial escalations by immigration agencies. Many have credited the decision to draw back as proof that the protests were successful in sending a message.
“Right now, we’re being tested, and the good news is, what we saw in Minneapolis and St Paul, and what we’re seeing in places across the country, including here in Los Angeles, has been the American people saying no,” Obama said. “At least a good number of the American people saying, we’re going to live up to those values that we say we believe in.”
“As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we’re going to get through this,” he added.
Obama, along with the former first lady, Michelle Obama, called the killing of Alex Pretti “a heartbreaking tragedy” and “a wake-up call to every American, regardless of party, that many of our core values as a nation are increasingly under assault”.
In a statement released last month, the Obamas said federal law enforcement and immigration agents were not operating in a lawful or accountable way in Minnesota. They said the tactics employed by ICE and other federal agents seemed “designed to intimidate, harass, provoke and endanger the residents of a major American city”.

No, Russia's attacks on energy infrastructure are not 'retaliation' for Ukraine's strikes on oil refineries

Why Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s energy grid aren’t ‘revenge’ for Kyiv’s deep strike campaign

After its largest winter mass attack on Feb. 3, Russia's Defense Ministry said the strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure were carried out "in response to terrorist attacks by Kyiv on civilian objects" in Russia. Some state media described the attack as "another act of retribution."
It's an old story — the first mass Russian strike on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure in October 2022 was framed by Russian President Vladimir Putin as retaliation for Kyiv's first successful strike against the Crimean Bridge, a key military logistics route on the occupied peninsula.
Since then, Russia has repeatedly framed repeated large-scale attacks as "responses," "revenge," or "forced measures." Just last month, a State Duma official called for the use of more powerful "weapons of retaliation."
It's a common theme from the Kremlin and its supporters. It's also completely false for several reasons.
Self-defense
The idea that any Russian strike is retaliation for Ukrainian military actions ignores one crucial factor — Russia and Russia alone started the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
"The retaliation narrative risks creating false equivalency between Russian international aggression, and Ukraine’s justifiable efforts to defend itself.," the Razom Advocacy Team wrote in an article in response to the October 2022 strike.
If that weren't enough, there are also huge differences in both the tactics and the targets of Russian and Ukrainian long-range strikes.
The targets
Russia's now years-long campaign of mass missile and drone strikes have consistently targeted civilian infrastructure, often located in densely populated cities.
Take the strike on Feb. 3 for example — 71 missiles and around 450 drones hit combined heat and power plants and thermal power stations in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Dnipro.
"This was a deliberate strike on energy infrastructure, with a record number of ballistic missiles," President Volodymyr Zelensky said.
Such strikes regularly result in the deaths and injuries of civilians. A drone strike on Kharkiv this week killed three toddlers and their father, and also injured their pregnant mother.
Ukrainian long-range strikes target a very different type of energy infrastructure — the oil refineries used to produce the oil that the Kremlin sells to fund its war machine.
And because of the toxic pollutants these facilities emit, they are usually located far from cities and other urban areas with civilian casualties vanishingly rare.
"Russian attacks on Ukraine's energy generation facilities appear designed specifically to affect civilians," Michael Clarke, a British defense expert and professor at King's College London, told the Kyiv Independent, adding that such strikes are "automatically evidence of a war crime."
The evidence for the effect of these strikes on civilians is currently visible across Ukraine right now — much of the population is struggling with blackouts, lack of heating, and sometimes even lack of water during one of the coldest winters in years.
"Ukrainian attacks, by contrast, target oil and fuel infrastructure that sustains Russia's war effort — a legitimate set of economic targets," he added.
Ukraine's strategy
Ukraine has openly acknowledged its campaign of long-range strikes, which escalated and expanded greatly over 2025.
Ukraine's General Staff, as well as the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and military intelligence (HUR) regularly report attacks on oil production and refining facilities.
"Ukraine is trying to increase the economic costs of the war for Russia and create a sense among the Russian population that this war will not be cost-free as it continues into a fourth year," Clarke said.
In official statements, the operations are framed as systematic efforts to weaken Moscow's military capacity.
"Ukraine's Defense Forces will continue to carry out measures aimed at reducing the combat potential of the Russian aggressor," the SBU said following the last operation on Feb. 10.
Though energy facilities do not produce weapons, they underpin Russia's ability to wage war. Energy exports remain a core source of state revenue, funding a war budget that now consumes about 40% of federal spending.
"Russia sells oil, takes the money, and invests it in weapons. Those weapons are used to kill Ukrainians. That is why this energy sector is a legitimate target," Zelensky said on Feb. 8.
In addition, oil products, such as diesel and aviation fuel, are essential for powering tanks and armored vehicles at the front, supplying military transport, and fueling bombers and fighter jets conducting airstrikes.
In 2025 alone, Ukraine carried out nearly 160 strikes against oil production and refining facilities across Russia, former Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) head Vasyl Maliuk said in October 2025.
According to Maliuk, the campaign contributed to a 20% domestic fuel deficit in Russia, forced 37% of refining capacity to halt operations at various points, and led to fuel shortages in 57 regions. The disruptions prompted Moscow to temporarily ban gasoline exports through the end of the year.
And the strikes have only become more precise over time — in June 2025, U.S. and CIA officials worked with Ukrainian counterparts to target a specific type of pipe in the refineries that is exceptionally difficult to repair or replace, according to The New York Times.
Russia's strategy
In Russia's own long-range strike campaign, civilians and civilian infrastructure are among the hardest hit, with particular impact now on facilities supplying heat and electricity to residential areas.
The aim, Zelensky said, is not to weaken Ukraine's armed forces, but to break society under the strain of cold, and darkness.
"When Russia cannot break the military, it strikes civilians," he said.
Clarke said Russia has always seen civilian infrastructure as a legitimate pressure point.
"The Russians have always believed in targeting civilians as they judge it to be a successful tactic in warfare," he said.
"In public, the Russians claim they always stick to international and humanitarian law in their targeting. But their military doctrine and their conduct over the last five wars in 26 years — not to mention the Soviet experience in Afghanistan and during the Second World War — indicate quite the opposite."
For Ukrainian civilians, 2025 was the deadliest year since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) reported in January.
The mission documented 2,514 civilians killed and 12,142 injured — a 31% increase compared to 2024 and a 70% increase compared to 2023. HRMMU said 97% of the civilian casualties occurred in Ukraine-controlled areas and were caused by attacks launched by Russia.
Since October 2025, Russia has damaged around 8.5 gigawatts of Ukraine's generating capacity through repeated strikes on power plants and substations.
In January, President Volodymyr Zelensky declared an emergency in Ukraine's energy sector, with particular attention on Kyiv, where 1,400 residential buildings remained without heating as of Feb. 11.

What We Learned From Marco Rubio’s Foreign Policy Speech to European Leaders

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the United States wants to “revitalize” its relationship with Europe in a key foreign policy speech to the continent’s leaders on Saturday.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Rubio said the U.S. and Europe shared a centuries-old history and “belong together,” a message that some European leaders viewed as an olive branch after an antagonistic appearance by Vice President J.D. Vance at the same forum the previous year.
“We want Europe to be strong,” Rubio said, adding that the two world wars of the 20th century serve as a reminder that “our destiny is and always will be intertwined with yours.”

His speech comes at a time when U.S.-European relations have been strained by President Donald Trump's aggressive efforts to annex Greenland, his Administration’s ongoing trade war with most European allies, and a years-long divide over the future of NATO and European security.
Rubio argued that the U.S. still cares deeply about Europe’s future and suggested disagreements stem from “profound concern” for the continent, which he described as the birthplace of a common civilization. He said the U.S. intends to work with the Europeans, not against them.
"We are connected not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually, and we are connected culturally," he added.
Here’s what we learned from the speech:
A change in tone
Rubio’s speech marked a dramatic shift in tone from the United States' contribution to last year's conference, delivered by Vice President Vance, who rebuked European leaders for marginalizing far-right parties and accused them of curbing free speech.
While his remarks were met with silence, Rubio’s speech drew bursts of applause and laughter.
The Secretary of State offered a conciliatory message, saying the U.S., under Trump, seeks to lead a global “renewal and restoration.”
Rubio said the “euphoria” that followed the West’s Cold War victory gave rise to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history,’ that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood ... and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.”
“We made these mistakes together, and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,” Rubio said.
“This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,” he said. “This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.”
Despite the softer tone, Rubio shared much of Vance's criticism of Europe over migration.
Rubio warned of the dangers of "mass migration" and “civilizational erasure,” and pointed to what he described as the weakening of post-World War II institutions such as the United Nations, which he said require sweeping reform.
“We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West‘s managed decline,” he said.
Trump has floated both Rubio and Vance as potential 2028 presidential frontrunners, so their contrasting speeches will likely be dissected by European leaders over the next few years for clues about where the U.S. will be heading if Republicans win.
U.N. needs reform
Rubio said the United Nations “still has tremendous potential,” but argued that on today’s most pressing issues, “it has no answers and has played virtually no role.” Instead, he praised American leadership for “problem-solving.”
“The U.N. could not solve the war in Gaza; it has not solved the war in Ukraine,” Rubio said.
His comments come as Trump’s Board of Peace, which some view as a potential rival to the U.N., is set to hold its first meeting on Feb. 19, in Washington, D.C.
The Board of Peace is designed to oversee Gaza’s redevelopment and resolve global conflicts. The inaugural meeting aims to raise funds for Gaza’s reconstruction and convene international leaders from the 27 countries that signed the charter.
The United Arab Emirates and the United States have already pledged $1 billion to Trump’s Board of Peace, according to two officials close to the board's funding matters.
Speaking immediately after Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi struck a contrasting tone.
“The main reason for the inadequacy of the current international system is not the United Nations itself, but the fact that some countries magnify differences, pursue national priorities ... and even revive the Cold War mentality,” he said. “All these have undermined the basis of trust, worsened the atmosphere of cooperation, and made the operation of international mechanisms difficult.”
Despite Ukraine’s fate looming over this year’s conference, Rubio made little mention of Russia’s full-scale invasion, citing it only as an example of the United Nations’ shortcomings.
“It has not solved the war in Ukraine. It took American leadership and partnership with many of the countries here today just to bring the two sides to the table in search of a still elusive peace," he said.
The war remains a major concern for Europe as the Trump administration increases pressure on Ukraine to make concessions for a peace deal with Russia. Ukrainian officials recently said American negotiators had called for Ukraine to hold elections by May 15, a deadline seen as unlikely while the war continues.
Speaking later at the conference, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine said his country would hold elections only after a cease-fire. Zelensky, who has been president since 2019, noted that elections have not been held since Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022 and stressed that Ukraine needed strong security guarantees before agreeing to any end to the war.
“We hope President Trump hears us,” he said.
European reaction
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was "very much reassured by the speech of the secretary of state,” calling him a “good friend” and a “strong ally.”
Upon taking the stage after Rubio’s speech, she started with a simple message: "Europe must become more independent – there is no other choice."
"The European way of life – our democratic foundation and the trust of our citizens – is being challenged in new ways. On everything from territories to tariffs or tech regulations," she said, appearing to reference the U.S., but also citing Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine.
This independence must be wide-ranging and cover areas including "Defence and energy. Economy and trade. Raw materials and digital tech," she said.
"Some may say the word ‘independence’ runs counter to our transatlantic bond. But the opposite is true. An independent Europe is a strong Europe. And a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance," she also said.
“We know some in the administration have a harsher tone on these topics,” she conceded, without naming Trump or Vance.
But not all Europeans were impressed by the softer approach.
“In substance, nothing changes, Europe now has to become more independent and assume more responsibility, also in the security and defense area,” Austria’s Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger told POLITICO.
Similarly, although Democratic politicians in Munich acknowledged that Rubio’s speech signaled a change in tone, they questioned whether it would alter the substance of the transatlantic relationship.
“He was clearly trying to escape the vituperative ghost of J.D. Vance in seeking to be calming and reassuring, but it was so lacking in substance and specificity that in the end, its impact will be very limited,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said.
He added, “I don't think the speech was about turning the page [after Greenland], but just getting over the moment, yeah, has given no signs that he's backing down from the antagonism and hostility.”
Sen. Thom Tillis, the top Republican on the Senate NATO Observer Group, praised Rubio’s speech, saying it reinforced efforts to reassure allied leaders that NATO will endure.
“I thought it was great,” Tillis said. “We all know that that speech would not have been delivered if the White House hadn't agreed with it. Yeah. So I think that's not only a message from Marco, but it's a message from the president.”
A dose of reality
Despite Rubio’s conciliatory message, his speech came a day after he skipped the “Berlin Format” meeting with European leaders on the war in Ukraine, a key point of contention between Europe and the Trump Administration.
At the same time, Trump continues to pressure Zelensky of Ukraine to accept a deal that could involve ceding significant portions of the country to Russia. Both European governments and Ukrainian officials have rejected such a proposal, arguing that it would not resolve the conflict but merely pause it, leaving the region’s future uncertain.
“Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,” Zelensky said in a video address from Kyiv in December. He added that any decisions made without Ukraine “are at the same time decisions against peace” and called such measures “dead decisions; they will never work.”
Praise for NATO
At the conference, Rubio praised NATO, citing instances when U.S. and NATO troops fought and died alongside one another.
"We have fought against each other, then reconciled, then fought and reconciled again. And we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar," he added. "And I'm here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity, and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends."
Rubio’s comments stood in contrast to recent comments made by Trump about America’s NATO allies. Since the turn of the year, Trump has repeatedly questioned NATO’s willingness to support the U.S.
“I DOUBT NATO WOULD BE THERE FOR US IF WE REALLY NEEDED THEM,” he blasted on Truth Social on Jan. 7. “We will always be there for NATO, even if they won’t be there for us.”
In an interview with Fox in Davos, the President also asserted that while NATO allies sent troops to Afghanistan, they "stayed a little back, a little off the front lines."

Nobel winner transferred to prison in northern Iran: husband
Iranian authorities have, without prior warning, transferred Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi to a prison in the north of the country as concern grows over her health, her husband said on Saturday.
Mohammadi, who won the peace prize in 2023 in recognition for more than two decades of campaigning, was arrested on 12 December in the eastern city of Mashhad after speaking out against the clerical authorities at a funeral ceremony.
She spent time on hunger strike earlier this month and had been hospitalised before being returned to prison.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee said this week it was "deeply appalled" by reports detailing "physical abuse and ongoing life-threatening mistreatment" of Mohammadi both during her arrest and in detention.
Since her arrest, Mohammadi had been held in Mashhad at the detention facility of the intelligence ministry and had only been allowed one phonecall with a brother inside Iran and another to her Iranian lawyer.
But she has now been transferred to prison in the city of Zanjan in the north of the country, said her husband Taghi Rahmani, who is based in Paris.
"This action was carried out without informing her family or her lawyer", he said on X, adding it was "intended to exile and displace Narges".
On 7 December, she was handed a further six years in prison on charges of harming national security and was also given a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda against Iran's Islamic system.
On 2 February she began a hunger strike to protest the conditions of her imprisonment and the inability to make phone calls to lawyers and family but then ended the action after a week.
Her foundation has described her physical condition as "deeply alarming", saying she was transferred to hospital in Mashhad but then returned to prison "before completing her treatment".
Mohammadi was arrested before protests erupted nationwide later in December. The movement peaked in January, with authorities launching a crackdown that activists say has left thousands dead.
Over the past quarter-century, Mohammadi, 53, who was born in Zanjan, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her campaigning against Iran's use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.

Epstein files: Former Trump advisor corresponding over ways to undermine pope
Unknown

02:09:01 KST

The newest Jeffrey Epstein files release includes messages dating from 2019 from former White House adviser Steve Bannon with the convicted sex offender about ways he could work to undermine Pope Francis.
CNN on Saturday reported that the correspondence, disclosed as part of a recent document dump, indicates that Bannon saw Francis -- who died in 2025 -- as a key ideological opponent to his nationalist-populist agenda and sought support from Epstein in advancing efforts against him.
In one June 2019 message, Bannon wrote: “Will take down (Pope) Francis,” adding, “The Clintons, (Chinese President) Xi, Francis, EU -- come on brother.”
CNN reported that the exchanges included discussions about French journalist Frederic Martel’s controversial book In the Closet of the Vatican, which examines secrecy and power within the Catholic Church.
Bannon suggested Epstein, who died in jail in August 2019, could serve as executive producer for a potential film adaptation, writing: “You are now exec producer of ‘ITCOTV’ (In the closet of the Vatican).” Martel told CNN he believed Bannon wanted to “instrumentalise” the book in his campaign against the pope.
Though no longer an advisor to US President Donald Trump, Bannon hosts a podcast and remains influential in circles close to the president.
‘Catholics must choose’
The files show Epstein emailing himself references to the book and sharing articles critical of Francis, while Bannon replied to one headline, “Pope Francis or Steve Bannon? Catholics must choose,” with “easy choice.”
Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of the late pope, said Bannon appeared to misunderstand both the book and Francis’ leadership, while Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Vatican official close to the pontiff, told CNN the messages suggested an attempt to merge “spiritual authority with political power for strategic ends,” and added:
“What those messages reveal is not merely hostility toward a pontiff, but a deeper attempt to instrumentalise faith as a weapon -- precisely the temptation he sought to disarm.”
The exchanges occurred years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for child sex offenses and shortly before his later arrest on sex trafficking charges.
CNN reported that Epstein’s replies also included provocative remarks, quoting John Milton’s Paradise Lost: “Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.”

Mistrial declared in case of students charged after Stanford pro-Palestinian protests
A judge declared a mistrial on Friday in a case of five current and former Stanford University students related to the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests when demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the school president's office.
Twelve protesters were initially charged last year with felony vandalism, according to prosecutors who said at least one suspect entered the building by breaking a window. Police arrested 13 people on June 5, 2024, in relation to the incident and the university said the building underwent "extensive" damage.
The case was tried in Santa Clara County Superior Court against five defendants charged with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. The rest previously accepted plea deals or diversion programs.
The jury was deadlocked. It voted nine to three to convict on the felony charge of vandalism and eight to four to convict on the felony charge to trespass. Jurors failed to reach a verdict after deliberations.
The charges were among the most serious against participants in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protest movement on U.S. colleges in which demonstrators demanded an end to Israel's war in Gaza and Washington's support for its ally along with a divestment of funds by their universities from companies supporting Israel.
Prosecutors in the case said the defendants engaged in unlawful property destruction.
"This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else's property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. That is against the law," Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement, adding he sought a new trial.
Anthony Brass, a lawyer for one of the protesters, told the New York Times his side was not defending lawlessness but "the concept of transparency and ethical investment."
"This is a win for these young people of conscience and a win for free speech," Brass said, adding "humanitarian activism has no place in a criminal courtroom."
Protesters had renamed the building "Dr. Adnan's Office" after Adnan Al-Bursh, a Palestinian doctor who died in an Israeli prison after months of detention. Over 3,000 were arrested during the 2024 U.S. pro-Palestinian protest movement, according to media tallies. Some students faced suspension, expulsion and degree revocation.

Chinese police detain woman over AI-generated video of Shanghai road collapse
State media say widely shared clip of metro site incident was false
ISTANBUL
Chinese state media said Saturday that a widely shared video purporting to show a major road collapse in Shanghai was generated by artificial intelligence and was false.
A 49-year-old woman, identified only as Luo, was placed under administrative detention for spreading the misinformation, according to a notice from a local branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau cited by the Global Times.
Luo was accused of “claiming a partial ground collapse in a metro construction site in Shanghai to attract followers, causing adverse social impact,” the notice said.
The video circulated widely on social media Thursday and Friday. It claimed that a partial ground collapse had occurred at the construction site of the Jia-Min Line metro project in Shanghai’s Jiading district. The post also alleged it was the second such collapse risk in less than four months, according to the notice.
“After verification by the public security authorities, the information was found to be fake,” the notice said.
Shanghai Metro said on its WeChat account that a localized leakage occurred Wednesday on the Jia-Min Line. No casualties were reported.
On Thursday afternoon, however, Shanghai Shentong Metro Group told reporters that a collapse had occurred at the site in the same area as the leakage the previous day.
The area was sealed off and no one was injured, the company said. The cause remains under investigation.

For Winter Olympic favorites, the pursuit of gold brings risk for their legacies, unfair or not
Olympic stars are learning that the same spotlight that elevates their sport can also potentially tarnish their legacies
- Bookmark
Mikaela Shiffrin signed up for this. So did Ilia Malinin, Scotty James and all the rest.
Nobody is forced to come to the Olympics. The athletes in Milan and Cortina dreamed about these two weeks long before the flames were lit in northern Italy. They have poured their lives into the pursuit of this moment. This chance.
For some — for most really — merely getting here is the goal. It is enough. More than enough.
For others who arrived here as the bold-faced names in their sport and heavy medal favorites, the business of the Olympics is more complicated.
Shiffrin knows there is a danger to all this. Yes, there is nothing like the platform the Olympics provide. The winningest ski racer of all time likened the opportunity for Olympians to showcase their respective sports to those who only tune in once every four years to a “beautiful gift."
Yet the price of that gift can come at a considerable cost. The spotlight can shine so intensely that it threatens to render everything else on your resume an afterthought, no matter how accomplished it might be.
Shiffrin acknowledged as much shortly after she arrived, saying she's well aware the perception of an athlete's legacy can hinge on a“sole moment" that doesn’t come close to capturing the full picture of a career.
She received an uncomfortable education four years ago after failing to medal in any of the six events she entered. Suddenly, the slalom gold she captured as an 18-year-old in Sochi in 2014 and two more medals she brought home from PyeongChang four years later didn't seem to matter as much, outwardly anyway.
And while Shiffrin stressed those forgettable days in Beijing were behind her as her fourth Olympics began, she heard the negativity after a sluggish performance in the women's combined on Tuesday dropped her and teammate Breezy Johnson from first to fourth.
“The Olympics ask us to take a real risk on the world stage,” she posted on Instagram ahead of Sunday's giant slalom, where she will be among the favorites as usual. “One that requires courage and vulnerability to erroneous judgment and narratives built on a limited understanding of what this sport truly demands.”
Shiffrin wasn't complaining. She was speaking the quiet part out loud.
A painful and public learning experience
The reality of the Olympics is that it is nothing more than a festival in which the world championships of disparate sports are being held in the same place (or at least the same country) at the same time.
The field in the women's giant slalom will largely mirror the field at the World Cup event in Czechia three weeks ago. It was much the same in men's figure skating.
The charismatic and electrifying Malinin, all of 21, came to Milan as a two-time world champion and the face of his sport. He picked up his first Olympic gold early in the Games when he helped the U.S. triumph in the team competition and held a comfortable five-point lead going into the men's free skate on Friday.
Over the course of a nightmarish 4 minutes and 30 seconds, it all came apart. The “Quad God” fell back to earth not once, but twice. The groans from a crowd that included two-time Olympic all-around champion gymnast Simone Biles were audible. The anguish on Malinin's face as he finished a program that sent him tumbling to eighth was unmistakable. So were the tears.
Malinin, who reached drinking age in the U.S. all of two months ago, thought he had a handle on the attention he commanded.
Turns out, maybe he didn't.
“I think all of this pressure, all of the media and just, you know, being the Olympic gold hopeful was just a lot,” he said. "Too much to handle.”
Sitting a few rows up inside the Milano Ice Skating Arena, Biles — who knows a thing or two about being singed by critics unable or unwilling to see things in their entirety — could empathize: “totally devastated for Ilia,” she later posted on Threads.
Malinin talked afterward about sifting through the rubble in an effort to figure out what happened. He has the benefit of youth. There's a chance by the time he takes the ice in Nice, France, for the 2030 Games, what happened on Friday night will serve as a valuable learning experience.
A ticking clock and a hole in the resume
James may not have the luxury of time.
The 33-year-old Australian snowboarding great dropped into the halfpipe for his fifth Olympics on Friday night, still in search of the one piece of hardware that has eluded the four-time world champion. The lack of an Olympic gold on his resume was, he said before the competition, “ the elephant in the room.”
Over three runs in snowy Livingo, he tried desperately to shed it. He crashed out during his first run. His brilliant second run scored a 93.50. Good, but not quite good enough to top world No. 1 Yuto Totsuka.
James went “full send” on his final trip down the pipe. Knowing something special was required, he pushed himself into uncharted territory, attempting to land a 1620-degree spin only to come up a half-revolution short. Gold was gone — again — and he knew it, raising his red gloves to his helmet as he tried to come to grips with another missed chance, and another long wait to try again.
There were tears afterward, but they weren't just for him.
“My team,” he said, sobbing. “They live this dream with me as well. They have families as well, like me, and they spend a lot of time away from their families, like me. My ‘why’ is to do my best so that it makes it worth it.”
Three Olympic medals like the ones James has — including the silver from Friday he plans to give to his toddler son, Leo — are more than enough for most lifetimes.
Yet the lack of a gold will keep (for now) James pointing toward the French Alps in four years, so long as his body holds up.
A bargain that's ultimately worth it
Inside his sport, his status as one of the GOATs has long been secure. The Olympics prop open the door for the outside world to embrace — and judge — snowboarding. For all of his remarkable success, James' inability to walk all the way through it will stick with him.
Whether that's fair is not for James to decide. It's the bargain every athlete makes with themselves when they come here.
“Heartbreak and victory live right next door," Shiffrin wrote. "Disappointment and gratitude often co-exist.”
The line between the two is incredibly thin. The challenge of landing on the right side of it is what keeps them coming back. Nowhere is that challenge greater than at the Olympics, where the pressure is unyielding and the stakes never higher. There's not another race next week to wipe the slate clean; it's years away.
Finding a way to successfully navigate that pressure is part of the challenge. Perhaps the biggest part. The one that makes an event whose motto is "Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together” so special.
It's why they keep throwing themselves into the breach, laying themselves and their sport bare for all the world to see, fairness be damned.
“May we all champion one another, tread lightly on what we don’t fully comprehend,” Shiffrin said, "and have the fortitude to keep showing up.”

FM Sa'ar to represent Israel at Trump's Washington 'Peace Council' summit

Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar will represent Israel at US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace summit in Washington on Thursday, a source familiar with the matter told The Jerusalem Post.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu initially accepted the US president’s invitation to join the Board of Peace in January. At the time, the prime minister signed a letter “on behalf of Israel” to “refer to the charter of the Board of Peace.”
“By this communication, I confirm that the said signature is definitive,” the letter signed by Netanyahu read, adding that this constituted “the consent of the State of Israel to be bound by the charter.”
Netanyahu makes Israeli membership to Board of Peace official
This past Wednesday, Netanyahu made Israel’s membership on the Board of Peace official during a meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio at Blair House in Washington.
The Board of Peace initiative was originally designed with the intent of bringing the war in Gaza to a close, but Trump later said that it would resolve conflicts globally.
Before it was confirmed that Sa’ar would represent Israel at the conference, the Prime Minister’s Office noted that Netanyahu would not be in the US this coming week.
On Thursday, the PMO said that Netanyahu would participate remotely in the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee AIPAC conference and therefore would not be traveling to the US.

From hostages to heritage: Defending Diaspora Judaism's modern world - opinion
Unknown

On October 7, Israel experienced something unprecedented. An entire nation was psychologically taken hostage.
Hamas did not merely kidnap civilians. It placed the fate of those hostages at the emotional center of Israeli life.
Every debate, military calculation, and public conversation revolved around one imperative: Bring them home.
The country functioned, the army fought, businesses stayed open, and yet emotionally, Israel was frozen. A nation known for resilience felt psychologically immobilized.
Today, yet another hostage crisis is unfolding, and while it is slower and quieter, it is potentially even more dangerous.
A generation of young Jews, in Israel and across the Diaspora, is increasingly being held hostage in a cognitive war fought not with rockets but with narratives, algorithms, identity confusion, and historical erasure.
And unlike the hostages in Gaza, many do not realize that they are captives.
When the ‘why’ disappears
Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist Viktor Frankl famously wrote: “Those who have a ‘why’ to live can bear almost any ‘how.’”
Frankl observed that survival depends less on physical strength than on meaning. Prisoners who retained purpose endured unimaginable suffering; those who lost meaning collapsed.
The lesson applies not only to individuals but also to nations.
Israel’s founding generation knew its why: survival after catastrophe, national rebirth, and a homeland after 2,000 years of exile.
Today, many young people in Israel and abroad struggle to articulate that same purpose, and when the why weakens, resilience weakens with it.
Research over the past decade suggests weakening connections between youth and both Zionist history and Jewish identity, particularly in secular frameworks.
Studies by the Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), the Pew Research Center, and the Institute for Jewish Policy Research (IJPR) show declining familiarity with Zionist history, weaker emotional attachment to Israel among younger
Diaspora Jews, and growing discomfort in publicly identifying as Jewish or Zionist in hostile environments.
The result is a generation less equipped to answer a simple but critical question: Why does Israel matter?
The long game our enemies understood
Israel’s adversaries have often played a longer game than Israelis have realized.
The conflict against Israel was never only military. It was demographic, cultural, educational, and psychological. Arab leaders like Gamal Abdel Nasser often spoke of a “long struggle” in which patience and time would ultimately decide the conflict rather than a single decisive battle.
Over decades, their influence has expanded across universities, NGOs, media narratives, and increasingly through digital ecosystems. Social media algorithms reward outrage, reduce complex conflicts into moral binaries, and amplify emotionally charged content.
Cognitive warfare has acquired weapons of mass manipulation. Repeated exposure to distorted narratives reshapes reality itself. Context disappears. Victims become villains. Complexity collapses into slogans.
Young Jews abroad increasingly face environments where Jewish or Zionist identity invites hostility. The result is quiet withdrawal: Better to stay silent, better to disengage.
Resilience erodes quietly.
Education, identity, and strategic vulnerability
Within Israel itself, structural changes also pose long-term challenges.
Debates continue over curriculum and national identity education in increasingly diverse classrooms.
Following a Channel 14 investigation, MK Avi Maoz raised concerns in the Knesset and to the education minister regarding how Arab teachers are increasingly teaching Bible studies in Jewish-sector schools, arguing that sensitive elements of Jewish history and identity may be shaped by educators who do not share the cultural or national framework the curriculum intends to convey.
Individually, none of these trends threatens Israel’s future. But combined with a cognitive war targeting identity and legitimacy, they create strategic vulnerability.
A country that is strong militarily can still weaken psychologically.
October 7 demonstrated how surprise occurs when threats are underestimated. Cognitive warfare carries a similar risk: erosion is unnoticed until consequences are already visible.
New definition of resilience
Israel’s resilience was forged through wars, terror attacks, and isolation. Society absorbed trauma and rebuilt. But cognitive warfare now targets identity itself.
If young people no longer feel connected to their history, if they fear publicly identifying as Jewish, and if Israel becomes emotionally distant rather than personally meaningful, resilience becomes harder to sustain.
The Super Bowl 2026, one of the most-watched sporting events each year, included a commercial paid for by Robert Kraft, a Jewish leader worthy of much praise and appreciation, who reportedly invested some $15 million to address the growing wave of antisemitism in the USA. The commercial quoted a horrifying statistic: “Two in three Jewish teens have experienced antisemitism.”
A Jewish high-school student walking through school hallways finds that other students have secretly affixed a yellow note reading “dirty Jew” to his backpack. A Black student approaches him, places a blue square sticker over the hateful note, and says, “Do not listen to that.”
Resilience cannot be built on ignoring reality or running away from it. Instead, it must be met with courage, not cowardice, and pride, not fear of our identity.
Resilience today must include historical literacy, identity confidence, cultural belonging, and moral clarity about both Jewish and Israel’s existence.
It must be strategically conceived, articulated, and implemented – not merely mentioned at social gatherings.
Leadership beyond governments
Governments alone cannot solve this.
Civilian leaders, educators, media professionals, community institutions, and families shape identity. Identity is built through lived experience, education, storytelling, and communal confidence.
The goal is not propaganda but coherence. Young Jews do not need slogans; they need understanding. Complexity can be taught without surrendering legitimacy. Israel’s imperfections do not erase its moral foundation or historical necessity and responsibilities.
Frankl’s lesson applies again: Meaning sustains resilience.
If young Jews know why their story matters, they can withstand hostile narratives. If they do not, cognitive captivity follows.
Bringing the hostages home –all of them
Israel and the global Jewish community remained committed to bringing home the hostages taken on October 7.
But another rescue mission must begin, that of bringing home a generation drifting away from identity and purpose.
This responsibility is not Israel’s alone. It belongs to Jewish families and communities worldwide. The cognitive war is being fought in classrooms, campuses, media feeds, and conversations at home.
Victory will not be measured by military success alone, but also by whether the next generation stands confidently in its identity and commitments.
When a people loses their “why,” even victory feels hollow, but when our “why” and purpose are clear, resilience follows. And resilience remains the Jewish people’s oldest and strongest defense.
As the saying goes, “Home is where the heart is.” The same is true of our “why.” Reinforcing our individual and collective purpose must begin at home, among family and friends.

A 20-year-old man was shot dead in Nazareth on Saturday, marking the 48th murder in the Arab sector since the start of the year.
The Magen David Adom (MDA) team that responded to the incident was forced to pronounce him dead at the scene.
MDA paramedic Amjad Nikola, who treated the victim, said, “The wounded man was in his vehicle, unconscious, without a pulse and not breathing, with severe gunshot wounds to his body. We conducted medical examinations, but unfortunately, his injuries were critical, and we had no choice but to declare him dead.”
The police later released a statement saying, “The Israel Police have opened an investigation into a shooting incident targeting a person in Nazareth. As a result of the shooting, a man whose identity is still unknown was pronounced dead.”
Police added that officers who were dispatched to the scene began searching for suspects and launched an investigation into the circumstances. The background is believed to be criminal.
Killing marks 48th Arab sector murder in 45 days
This was the 48th murder in Arab society in 45 days, after a record six people were killed in a single day last week.
On Friday, police arrested two residents on suspicion of involvement in a shooting that led to the death of a Tamra resident, Wafa Awad. A preliminary investigation indicated that the incident began as a local dispute in the morning and escalated into deadly gunfire at the victim’s home during the night.
Investigators said a minor dispute between individuals in the city escalated over the course of the day. At night, unidentified suspects arrived and opened fire on the Awad family’s home. The victim, who was standing near a window at the time, was hit in the upper body by bullets that entered the house. Medical teams were forced to pronounce her dead at the scene.
Following the incident, Northern District Commander Meir Eliyahu conducted a situational assessment at the scene and assigned the investigation to the central unit. In an operational effort, two suspects, aged 23 and 36 and residents of the city, were arrested. Police are expected to request an extension of their detention in court on Sunday.

The cybersecurity giant Palo Alto Networks announced on Wednesday that it will start a dual listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), as part of its acquisition of the Israeli cybersecurity platform CyberArk.
With this move, the company would become the most valuable company listed on the Israeli market, with a current market cap of $115 billion.
Palo Alto Networks is a US-based cybersecurity firm founded by Israeli entrepreneur Nir Zuk, which is currently traded only on the American stock market, but will now also have a listing on the TASE.
The listing will also honor CyberArk, with Palo Alto Networks using the ticker CYBR on the TASE instead of its Nasdaq ticker PANW.
"Building on CyberArk's heritage and Israel's position as a global cybersecurity powerhouse, Palo Alto Networks announces its intent to pursue a secondary listing on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE),” the company said in a statement.
“By adopting the CYBR denomination, we are providing a world-class tribute to the brand CyberArk built while ensuring its identity remains a cornerstone of the global strategy," it added.
Palo Alto Networks will surpass companies like Teva Pharmaceuticals, which has a market cap of $40 billion, and Bank Leumi and Bank Hapoalim, which have market caps of $38.4 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively, on the TASE, according to a report by Globes Israel.
“The choice by a company of this magnitude built on the foundation of groundbreaking Israeli innovation to deepen its local footprint, especially in the current climate, is a powerful testament to the robustness, maturity, and resilience of the Israeli financial ecosystem,” said the TASE in a statement welcoming Palo Alto Networks’ double listing.
Palo Alto Networks' acquisition of CyberArk
According to Globes Israel, the total deal to acquire CyberArk will be worth $21.5 billion, with Palo Alto paying $45 per share of CyberArk and 22005 shares of PANW to stockholders of the Israeli company.
CyberArk’s platform, which will remain available during the initial stage of the acquisition, provides cybersecurity solutions against AI agents and identity-related vulnerabilities. “Existing customers will not experience service disruptions and are expected to benefit from an accelerated development roadmap,” said Palo Alto Networks.
"The emerging wave of AI agents will require us to secure every identity, human, machine, and agent. For our customers, this means the end of 'identity silos.' They can now manage privileged access across their entire hybrid cloud environment from the same company they trust for Network Security and Security Operations," said Nikesh Arora, Chairman and CEO of Palo Alto Networks.
“Our partnership with Palo Alto Networks creates a stronger cybersecurity force than ever before for modern organizations. It’s a win-win: our customers gain access to the most comprehensive suite of security solutions, and our employees join a global technology company that leads the way in innovation,” added Matt Cohen, CEO of CyberArk.

Zelensky, Aliyev discuss energy projects and peace process
According to Ukrinform, the Office of the President of Ukraine stated this on its website.
It was noted that Zelensky expressed gratitude for the recent package of energy support, which included generators and transformers, among other things.
The Ukrainian President informed Aliyev about the overall situation in the energy system and the impact of Russian strikes on infrastructure facilities.
The leaders also discussed the development of bilateral relations and the implementation of energy projects in which Azerbaijan is interested and ready to deepen cooperation.
"Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Ilham Aliyev agreed that their teams will work through all the necessary issues," the Office of the President noted.
During the meeting, the presidents also focused on the negotiation process to achieve peace.
Zelensky emphasized that Ukraine always constructively supports efforts that can help achieve a just peace. "The only reason the war is still ongoing is Russia's unwillingness to end it," he added.
As Ukrinform reported, President Zelensky will participate on Saturday, February 14, in a special session of the Munich Security Conference and hold a series of bilateral meetings. Planned bilateral talks include meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and U.S. Congress senators (separately), NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, as well as leaders of 18 international investment companies.

Bahrain, Egypt reportedly mediating UAE-Saudi rift
Bahrain and Egypt are attempting to mend ties between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two sources told AFP news agency, weeks into a diplomatic rift between the Arab world's most powerful countries.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE had a public falling out in December when the kingdom accused its neighbour of threatening its national security by supporting Yemeni separatists who orchestrated a brief land grab.
A source close to the Saudi government insisted there was "no need for mediation" because direct channels are open between the two countries.
Although Riyadh and Abu Dhabi did not break ties, they have had no high-level diplomatic contact since the last week of December, AFP reported- citing several sources.
"Bahrain is leading mediation efforts between Saudi and the UAE that aim at ending the ongoing misunderstanding," said a Gulf official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
The goal, he said, was to "bridge the gap and bring viewpoints closer".
"It's a Gulf issue and it should be resolved in the Gulf," he said, adding that this was a "Bahraini effort, not a GCC effort", in reference to regional bloc the Gulf Cooperation Council.
This week, Bahraini Crown Prince and Prime Minister Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa met Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh and UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed in Abu Dhabi.
A regional source in the Gulf, who also requested anonymity to speak on sensitive matters, said Egypt was pursuing efforts to end the rift.
"Egypt is playing a sort of mediating role and conveying messages between Saudi Arabia and the UAE," he said.
On January 5, the Saudi foreign minister met his Egyptian counterpart Badr Abdelatty and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Cairo.
The next day, Abdelatty called his Emirati counterpart Abdullah bin Zayed.
Egypt conveyed Saudi messages to the UAE, the source said.
"The Saudi foreign minister discussed in Cairo the details of the crisis with his Egyptian counterpart, who then made calls to his Emirati counterpart," the source added.
The UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain did not respond to the claims.

LUGANSK, February 14. /TASS/. The number of casualties in the Ukrainian strike on the village of Tsentralny in the LPR has risen to 19, according to the republic's Health Minister, Natalya Pashchenko.
Earlier, LPR Head Leonid Pasechnik reported 15 civilian casualties.
"At 2:28 p.m. Moscow time (11:28 a.m. GMT) on the weekend, enemy drones struck the village of Tsentralny in the Perevalsk Municipal District," Pashchenko wrote on her Telegram channel.
"According to the latest data, 19 civilians have sought medical assistance. All of them are residents of the village who were near the landing site or in their homes at the time of the attack."
Among the injured there is a girl born in 2016, who was taken to the Lugansk Republican Children's Clinical Hospital. Three wounded are in serious condition, another six are in moderate condition, and the rest received outpatient care. Some of the wounded were taken to Alchevsk; after their condition stabilizes, they will be transferred to the Lugansk Republican Clinical Hospital.
Medics continue house-to-house visits to identify the injured. Two ambulance crews are on duty on site. The LPR healthcare system has been put on high alert. Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko has taken personal control of the situation.
Pasechnik previously reported a massive Ukrainian drone strike on the village of Tsentralny. An emergency response center has been deployed in the Perevalsk District to deal with the aftermath of the attack. Dozens of residential and social facilities were damaged in the village.

Top Indian diplomat says IMEC ‘progressing but not at pace initially expected’
World heading towards greater multipolarity, Subramanyam Jaishankar tells Munich Security Conference
NEW DELHI
The India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) is “progressing but not at pace initially expected," Indian External Affairs Ministry Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said on Saturday as he addressed the Munich Security Conference.
IMEC, a multinational railway and maritime project, was announced in 2023 between India, the US, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, France, Germany, Italy, and the EU, aiming to connect India to the Middle East and Europe to enhance trade, provide energy resources, and develop digital connectivity.
Speaking at the panel discussion, "Navigating Uncertainty: India and Germany in a World in Disarray," Jaishankar was asked if IMEC is progressing.
"Answer is kind of yes. But not at the pace at which people initially expected it to, which is understandable, because there was a big conflict going on in the Middle East, and everybody's attention was on that conflict,"Jaishankar said.
There is a "big European and Indian interest" in the IMEC, he said, adding that the "purpose of the IMEC is really to address connectivity, logistics issues, and improve the economy…the purpose of the IMEC is not to solve the Palestinian issue."
Noting that the world is "heading towards greater multipolarity," the Indian minister said “there will be many more independent or autonomous centers of decision-making."
The world order, he said, suffered "a series of shocks" over the past five years and it "accelerated" changes in that order.
The COVID-19 "was a shock, the conflict in Ukraine was a shock. What's happening in the Middle East was a shock ... even in Europe, some years ago, Brexit was a shock," he said.
To another question whether India's weaning off Russian oil under the recently announced India-US trade pact impacts its strategic autonomy, Jaishankar said: "We are very much wedded to strategic autonomy. Because it's very much a part of our history and our evolution."
“Where the energy issues are concerned, look, this is today a complex market," he said. "I think oil companies in India, as in Europe, as probably in other parts of the world, look at availability, look at costs, look at risks, and take the decisions that they feel is in their best interest."

US ocean regulator faces criticism over changes to right whale protection rule
The U.S.’s ocean regulator plans to make industry-friendly changes to a longstanding rule designed to protect vanishing whales
- Bookmark
The U.S.'s ocean regulator plans to make industry-friendly changes to a longstanding rule designed to protect vanishing whales, prompting criticism from environmental groups who cite the recent death of an endangered whale.
The rules protect the North Atlantic right whale, which numbers less than 400 and lives off the East Coast. The giant animals are protected by a vessel speed rule that requires large ships to slow down at certain times to avoid collisions, which is a leading cause of death for the whales.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in a Thursday statement to The Associated Press that it plans to soon announce proposed new rules designed to “modernize” the whale protections. The proposal will be a “deregulatory-focused action” that will seek to “reduce unnecessary regulatory and economic burdens while ensuring responsible conservation practices for endangered North Atlantic right whales,” the statement said.
A notice of rulemaking about the right whale rules is listed on the U.S. Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs website, but it does not include any details about the proposal. NOAA said in its statement that more information about the rules was forthcoming and that the agency was focused on “implementing new technologies, engineering approaches, and other advanced tools” to protect the whales.
Several environmental groups criticized the move away from vessel speed rules. Some cited the Feb. 10 confirmation of the death of a 3-year-old female whale off Virginia. The cause of the animal's death was not yet determined, but it died at a far younger age than typical.
“Another female right whale — the future of this species — has lost her life. We urgently need more right whale protections, not fewer. The Trump administration’s apparent determination to weaken the vessel speed rule could not come at a worse time,” said Jane Davenport, senior attorney at conservation group Defenders of Wildlife.
Right whales migrate every year from calving grounds off Florida and Georgia to feeding grounds off New England and Canada. Along the way, they are vulnerable to collisions with ships and entanglement in commercial fishing gear. They were once numerous off the East Coast but were decimated during the commercial whaling era and have been federally protected for decades.
The Biden administration planned to expand slow zones off the East Coast to protect the whales. It also planned to expand the classes of boats required to slow down. However, the federal government withdrew the proposal in the final days of the administration, with officials saying it didn't have time to finalize the regulations due to the scope and volume of public comments.
Some shipping businesses and other marine industries have long pushed back at vessel speed rules. The National Marine Manufacturers Association has described speed restrictions as “archaic” and advocated for solutions that rely on technology.

Italy says remains committed to implement Gaza peace plan, reconstruction
Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani reiterates attempts to annex Palestinian territories 'unacceptable'
LONDON
Italy's foreign minister on Saturday said Rome will continue its commitment to implement the Gaza peace plan and reconstruction of the Palestinian enclave also involving the Italian private sector.
Antonio Tajani attended a meeting together with European and regional partners on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany with the attendance of Palestinian Foreign Minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin.
"The reconstruction of #Gaza was the focus of today's meeting in #Munich," he wrote on the US social media platform X.
He said Italy is on the front line with a $60 million plan for humanitarian aid, demining activities, strengthening health and education facilities, renovating housing for displaced persons, and more broadly supporting Palestinian institutions.
"We will continue our commitment to implementing the Peace Plan and rebuilding the Strip, involving also our private sector," said Tajani.
The foreign minister noted that the key goal now is to maintain the ceasefire, which was reached in October, "whereas the endgame is to have the conditions for a Two-State solution" to the Israel-Palestine conflict.
"This is why we deem unacceptable any attempt to annex Palestinian territories," he added.
Israel killed more than 71,000 people in Gaza over a period of two years, starting in October 2023, almost leveling it to the ground.

American Jordan Stolz wins 2nd speedskating gold at Winter Olympics
Jordan Stolz won his 2nd Olympic speedskating gold medal on Saturday, becoming the first American since 1980 to win two gold medals in the sport.
He placed first in the 500-meter event. He previously earned a gold medal in the 1,000-meter event, marking the first time an American medaled in the race since 2010.
Stolz will compete in two more events in Milan: The 1,500-meter race on Thursday and the mass start next Saturday. Stolz previously told CBS News that he expects his future events to be "some of the best races I've had all year."
"That's what I'm looking for," Stolz said on Wednesday.
Stolz has set a number of speedskating records. He holds the record for fastest 1,000-meter skate and is a two-time world champion at the distance. He went 5-for-5 in the World Cup circuit this season in the same event.
He also skates professionally for the Dutch speedskating team, Albert Heijn Zaanlander. Speedskating is a popular sport in the Netherlands. Stolz told CBS News before the Milan Cortina Winter Games that he hopes to help bring speedskating to the U.S.
He previously competed at the Beijing Games in 2022 as a 17-year-old, where he came in 14th in the 1,000 and 13th in the 500.

Epstein files show former Trump advisor corresponding over ways to undermine pope
Newly released documents show Steve Bannon discussing strategies with Jeffrey Epstein in 2019 and declaring he would ‘take down’ the pontiff
ISTANBUL
The newest Jeffrey Epstein files release includes messages dating from 2019 from former White House adviser Steve Bannon with the convicted sex offender about ways he could work to undermine Pope Francis.
CNN on Saturday reported that the correspondence, disclosed as part of a recent document dump, indicates that Bannon saw Francis -- who died in 2025 -- as a key ideological opponent to his nationalist-populist agenda and sought support from Epstein in advancing efforts against him.
In one June 2019 message, Bannon wrote: “Will take down (Pope) Francis,” adding, “The Clintons, (Chinese President) Xi, Francis, EU -- come on brother.”
CNN reported that the exchanges included discussions about French journalist Frederic Martel’s controversial book In the Closet of the Vatican, which examines secrecy and power within the Catholic Church.
Bannon suggested Epstein, who died in jail in August 2019, could serve as executive producer for a potential film adaptation, writing: “You are now exec producer of ‘ITCOTV’ (In the closet of the Vatican).” Martel told CNN he believed Bannon wanted to “instrumentalize” the book in his campaign against the pope.
Though no longer an advisor to US President Donald Trump, Bannon hosts a podcast and remains influential in circles close to the president.
‘Catholics must choose’
The files show Epstein emailing himself references to the book and sharing articles critical of Francis, while Bannon replied to one headline, “Pope Francis or Steve Bannon? Catholics must choose,” with “easy choice.”
Austen Ivereigh, a biographer of the late pope, said Bannon appeared to misunderstand both the book and Francis’ leadership, while Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Vatican official close to the pontiff, told CNN the messages suggested an attempt to merge “spiritual authority with political power for strategic ends,” and added:
“What those messages reveal is not merely hostility toward a pontiff, but a deeper attempt to instrumentalize faith as a weapon -- precisely the temptation he sought to disarm.”
The exchanges occurred years after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for child sex offenses and shortly before his later arrest on sex trafficking charges.
CNN reported that Epstein’s replies also included provocative remarks, quoting John Milton’s Paradise Lost: “Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.”

India’s Suryakumar shrugs off rain threat to Pakistan T20 World Cup game
Pakistan on Monday reversed their decision to boycott their T20 World Cup match against India, but rain could intervene.
Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav said his players are not concerned about the threat of rain for Sunday’s Twenty20 World Cup clash with Pakistan, adding that the defending champions are focused on preparing for the showdown between bitter rivals.
Pakistan had initially boycotted the Group A fixture in Colombo over Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament for refusing to play in India over security concerns, but reversed their decision on Monday.

But weather forecasts have warned of heavy rain between Sunday afternoon and evening, casting new doubts over the match.
“Weather is something which is not in our control,” Suryakumar told reporters on Saturday.
No complacency from India against Pakistan
He said the clash would not be a routine game for the co-hosts.
“When you play an India vs Pakistan game it’s more about the occasion. It’s a big platform, obviously. No matter how many times you say, it’s just another game … It’s human tendency, you know which game you’re about to play,” the 35-year-old said.
“Whatever we have worked hard on and practised, we try to execute them in the game.”
India and Pakistan have both won two games each in the tournament. While Pakistan played both their games in Colombo due to an agreement that they would play each other only on neutral venues, India arrived after a win over Namibia on Thursday.
Suryakumar said India would not be disadvantaged by unfamiliarity with the ground.
“We have similar wickets back home, and we’ve played a lot of cricket here during bilaterals against Sri Lanka, so we’re also very familiar with the conditions,” he said.
India and Pakistan most recently faced off in last year’s Asia Cup, where India won all three of their meetings, including the final.
“You can’t carry history into the ground, because it can cause complacency,” Suryakumar said.
India ready for Pakistan’s ‘out of syllabus’ Tariq
India have carried out preparations to face Usman Tariq, a spinner with an unorthodox action, who took three wickets for Pakistan during Tuesday’s win over the United States.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said earlier on Saturday that Tariq was a trump card against India.
“At an exam, when there’s an out-of-syllabus question, we can’t just skip it; we have to try something to tackle it,” Suryakumar said about Tariq.
“We practise with similar bowlers, with similar actions. We’ll try to execute what we practise in the net sessions.”
Salman had also expressed hope that Indian opener Abhishek Sharma, who is the highest-ranked batter in the 20-over format, will play on Sunday after missing the previous game due to illness.
“All right, if (Salman) wants him to play, then we’ll play him tomorrow,” Suryakumar said about Sharma.

Assailants kill at least 30 in northwest Nigeria villages, residents say

MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Feb 14 - Armed assailants on motorbikes killed at least 30 people and burned houses and shops during raids on three villages in northwest Nigeria's Niger State early on Saturday, residents who escaped the violence told Reuters.
The attacks on villages in the Borgu Local Government Area, near the border with Benin Republic, are part of a surge in attacks blamed on "bandits," who have carried out deadly assaults, abductions for ransom, and displaced communities across northern Nigeria.
Insecurity is a pressing concern in Nigeria and the government is under mounting pressure to restore stability.
Wasiu Abiodun, Niger State police spokesperson, confirmed the attack in one of the villages.
"Suspected bandits invaded Tunga-Makeri village … six persons lost their lives, some houses were also set ablaze, and a yet-to-be ascertained number of persons were abducted," Abiodun said.
He added that the assailants had moved on to Konkoso village, while details of other attacks remained unclear.
Jeremiah Timothy, a resident of Konkoso who fled to a nearby locality, said the attack on his village began in the early hours with sporadic gunfire.
"At least 26 people were killed so far in the village after they set the police station ablaze," said Timothy, adding that the attackers entered Konkoso around 6 a.m. (0500 GMT), shooting indiscriminately.
He said residents heard military jets flying overhead.
Another witness who requested anonymity, said the attackers, riding more than 200 motorbikes, swept through the area targeting the villages.
Auwal Ibrahim, a resident of Tunga-Makeri, recounted the early-morning assault on his village at approximately 0200 GMT.
"The bandits stormed our town around 3:00 a.m. (local time), riding so many motorcycles while shooting sporadically, beheading six people and killing others. They set shops on fire and forced the whole village to flee," Ibrahim said.
He added that many villagers fear returning as the gunmen remain nearby. REUTERS

Nancy Guthrie kidnapping investigation draws scrutiny as case drags on
-
Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Authorities face mounting criticism for how the Pima County Sheriff’s Department has handled the abduction of Nancy Guthrie, with experts calling it “a debacle” marked by mishandled evidence.
- The Sheriff’s Department released Guthrie’s home as a crime scene a day after she was reported missing, allowing reporters and delivery workers to contaminate vital evidence.
- An initial suspect was detained and released without charges; the FBI has since doubled its reward to $100,000 and fielded more than 13,000 tips.
Nancy Guthrie had been missing less than three days when family members and reporters, and even an Amazon delivery worker, could be seen wandering onto her property, with drops of her blood still staining the front entryway.
It’s been nearly two weeks since the 84-year-old mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie was abducted. With no suspects in custody as of Saturday, scrutiny is growing over how authorities have handled the case.
Some questions have focused on Pima County (Ariz.) Sheriff Chris Nanos and his department, which was the first to respond when Guthrie was reported missing from her Tucson home Feb. 1. Since then, Nanos has been the leading law enforcement communicator on the investigation, including after reports emerged of ransom notes demanding millions of dollars in cryptocurrency for Guthrie’s return.
The global spotlight is now on him.
“I’m not used to everyone hanging on to my every word and then holding me accountable for what I say,” Nanos said at a news conference early in the probe. “This is really, for me, pretty new.”
Critics pointed out his department opened up the crime scene a day after Guthrie was reported missing and sent vital evidence across the country to be analyzed for free, and the sheriff was seen at a weekend college basketball game while a ransom deadline still hung over the family.
President Trump has even weighed in on the issue.
“It was a local case originally, and they didn’t want to let go of it, which is fine,” Trump said when asked about the case at the White House on Friday. “It’s up to them, it’s really up to the community, but ultimately where the FBI got involved, I think, you know, progress has been made.”
The case took another bizarre turn Wednesday morning when TMZ announced that the outlet received a letter demanding a payment of one bitcoin — about $67,000 — in exchange for the name of Guthrie’s kidnapper.
Guthrie was discovered missing after she didn’t show up at a friend’s house to watch a church service. She was taken from her home without any of her heart medication, and it’s unclear how long she can survive without it.
Though she initially was considered missing, the urgency to quickly find Guthrie pulsed through the first days of media coverage because of her heart condition. So it came as a surprise to some observers that just a day after she’d been reported missing, Nanos declared the crime scene clear and released the home back to the family.
Forensic workers had processed the ranch-style home for evidence, including DNA and fingerprints, but could not recover images from a Ring camera because the family did not pay for a subscription to back up the recordings, Nanos said.
Afterward, as the home stood unguarded, reporters, photographers and others wandered the property, walking to the front door and capturing video of blood drops along the porch.
The crime scene eventually was closed again so the FBI could conduct its own search, and Nanos told reporters opening the scene up the first time may have been premature.
“Monday morning quarterback. Absolutely. I probably could have held off on that,” Nanos said at a news conference, with top FBI agents flanking him.
Sheriff‘s deputies eventually were stationed outside the home, but even so, a pizza delivery driver walked food that had been ordered for someone in the neighborhood up to the door of the Guthrie home. On Friday, a company showed up to service Guthrie’s backyard pool, which was accommodated at the “request of the Guthrie family,” the Sheriff’s Department said.
Breaks in the investigation have come in fits and starts.
Investigators believe someone will recognize the intruder through their clothing, gait or appearance, giving the case crucial momentum after days with few leads.
After searching the home last week, FBI technicians have been processing evidence from in and around it. Testing revealed the blood drops outside the door belonged to Guthrie.
Then, a series of ransom notes arrived in the tip boxes of two Tucson television stations and TMZ, seeking $4 million and $6 million in bitcoin, and included details about Guthrie’s home.
The fact that law enforcement announced Guthrie disappeared and then publicly gave credence to reports she was being held for ransom put authorities at a disadvantage, said Adam Bercovici, who has worked multiple kidnappings as the former supervisor of the Los Angeles Police Department’s special investigations unit.
“It is a debacle,” he said. “This kidnapping is one of the worst cases of incompetence I have seen.”
With so much information floating around, Bercovici said, it would be difficult to verify a legitimate ransom demand. Indeed, not long after news about the ransom notes broke, officials said a man in Hawthorne sent an imposter demand to the Guthries. He has been charged with a federal crime.
Much is still unknown about the details inside the investigation and exactly what evidence detectives have collected. Because of this, it will take time to fully assess their tactics and truly understand the complexity of the case.
The first big break in the case came Tuesday, when the FBI released surveillance videos of someone approaching Guthrie’s door wearing a holstered gun, ski mask and backpack. The videos, recovered by Google engineers, provided the first look at Guthrie’s kidnapper and last less than a minute. More than 4,000 tips flooded law enforcement agencies in the 24 hours after the images were broadcast.
By the following evening, sheriff‘s investigators were detaining a 36-year-old man after a traffic stop south of Tucson. Sheriff’s officials announced they obtained a court-approved search warrant for his Rio Rico home, immediately raising expectations among those closely watching the case.
But those hopes soon were deflated.
Surrounded by the throng of cameras and reporters, investigators and FBI forensic technicians swarmed the man’s home. His mother-in-law, under the glare of camera lights, declared him innocent, saying she didn’t know who Savannah Guthrie was, and told them “you won’t find anything here, we have nothing to hide.”
By the next morning, the man was free and his house cleared of investigators. The Times is not naming him because he has not been arrested or accused of any wrongdoing.
“I hope they get the suspect because I am not it,” the man told reporters. “And they better do their job and find the suspect that did it so they can clear my name.”
On Friday night, authorities served a search warrant at a home in Tucson and swarmed a parked Range Rover. In the end, officials said no arrests were made.
Investigators are casting an even wider net to find photos, videos and any other clues. Other people in the area should expect to be detained and questioned, Nanos told local station KOLD.
On Thursday, authorities revealed a series of images of men in the dark with backpacks near cars and homes. About two miles from the Guthrie home, investigators discovered a glove on the ground, then several others farther from the home, the Sheriff’s Department announced Friday. They’ll all be analyzed for DNA in hopes it leads to the 84-year-old grandmother. The department said other DNA found at the home did not match Guthrie or anyone in close contact with her, and investigators are working to identify who it belongs to.
Meanwhile, the FBI doubled its reward for information this week to $100,000 and released a description of the person seen at her front door.
“The suspect is described as a male, approximately 5’9” - 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack,” the bureau said. More than 13,000 tips have flowed into the bureau.
On Friday, the Sheriff’s Department sought to quash rumors that there was a divide between local and federal investigators, centered on the handling of evidence and which lab it should be sent to.
“Our strong partnership is critical, and we remain fully committed to this collaborative investigation. To ensure consistency and streamline testing, evidence requiring forensic analysis is being sent to the same out-of-state lab that has been utilized since the beginning of this case,” the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement. “This decision was discussed with and agreed upon by local FBI leadership.”
But Nanos himself expressed frustration about the pace of the probe.
“It’s exhausting, these ups and downs. But we will keep moving forward,” he told the New York Times. “Maybe it’s an hour from now. Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy.”

USA and Europe are part of the same civilization; we must build new Western Century together - Secretary of State Rubio in Munich
The criticism and advice that the United States and President Donald Trump are directing toward Europe may seem too blunt and insistent, but they are driven by a desire to preserve the shared future of Western civilization, of which both Europe and the United States are a part, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, according to an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent.
He said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that the fate of Europe will never be a matter of indifference to them, adding that they are defending a great civilization that must be in charge of its own destiny. He also said that it is advisable to think about how to advance their interests together, in other words to build a new Western Century.
Rubio noted that the United States will always be a child of Europe; they are connected not only militarily, but also economically and culturally.
At the same time, the Secretary of State called for an honest approach to our shared heritage and an acknowledgement of the mistakes made in relation to free and unrestricted trade, which was abused by other countries, deindustrialization, ineffective "green" policies, and the outsourcing of nationally important functions, which resulted in Western countries becoming dependent on others and vulnerable to crises. The Secretary of State identified mass migration as one such crisis, threatening the unity of Western societies, the continuity of their cultures, and the future of their peoples.
He called for joint reindustrialization of the economy, the construction of Western supply chains for critical materials, a joint fight for market share in the Global South, and the development of commercial spaceflight and artificial intelligence.
Rubio also stated that the so-called world order cannot be placed above national interests. He argued that global institutions do not need to be dismantled, but they must be reformed and restored.
As an example, he cited the UN, which has failed to resolve the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, and Iran, while the United States has achieved success on these issues, although it has still not ended Russia’s war against Ukraine.
“We increasingly outsourced our sovereignty to international institutions while many nations invested in massive welfare states at the cost of maintaining the ability to defend themselves. This, even as other countries have invested in the most rapid military buildup in all of human history and have not hesitated to use hard power to pursue their own interests,” the State Secretary believes.
According to him, Washington wants Europe to be strong because this strengthens the United States.
“In a perfect world, all of these problems and more would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world, and we cannot continue to allow those who blatantly and openly threaten our citizens and endanger our global stability to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate,” Rubio stressed.
He added that this is the path that President Trump and the United States have embarked on, and it is the path that Europe is being asked to join.
“We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline. We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history,” the Secretary of State summed up.

Egyptian woman faces death threats for filming alleged harasser

Egyptian woman faces death threats for filming alleged harasser
A young Egyptian woman is facing death threats after posting a video showing the face of a man she says repeatedly harassed her, reviving debate over how victims are treated in the country.
Mariam Shawky, an actress in her twenties, filmed the man aboard a crowded Cairo bus earlier this week, accusing him of stalking and harassing her near her workplace on multiple occasions.
"This time, he followed me on the bus," Shawky, who has been dubbed "the bus girl" by local media, said in a clip posted on TikTok.
"He kept harassing me," added the woman, who did not respond publicly following the release of the video.
Hoping other passengers would intervene, Shawky instead found herself isolated. The video shows several men at the back of the bus staring at her coldly as she confronts her alleged harasser.
The man mocks her appearance, calls her "trash", questions her clothing and moves towards her in what appears to be a threatening manner.
No one steps in to help. One male passenger, holding prayer beads, orders her to sit down and be quiet, while another gently restrains the man but does not defend Shawky.
Death threats
As the video spread across social media, the woman received a brief flurry of support, but it was quickly overwhelmed by a torrent of abuse.
Some high-profile public figures fuelled the backlash.
Singer Hassan Shakosh suggested she had provoked the situation by wearing a piercing, saying it was "obvious what she was looking for".
Online, the comments were more extreme. "I'll be the first to kill you," one user wrote. "If you were killed, no one would mourn you," said another.
The case has revived a longstanding national debate in Egypt over harassment and violence against women.
A 2013 UN study found that 99.3 percent of Egyptian women reported experiencing harassment, with more than 80 percent saying they faced it regularly on public transport.
That same year, widespread protests against sexual violence rocked the Egyptian capital.
In 2014, a law criminalising street harassment was passed. However, progress since then has been limited. Enforcement remains inconsistent and authorities have never released figures on the number of convictions.
Public concern spiked after previous high-profile incidents, including the 2022 killing of university student Nayera Ashraf, stabbed to death by a man whose advances she had rejected.
The perpetrator was executed, yet at the time "some asked for his release," said prominent Egyptian feminist activist Nadeen Ashraf, whose social-media campaigning helped spark Egypt's MeToo movement in 2020.
Denials
In the latest case, the authorities moved to act even though the bus company denied any incident had taken place in a statement later reissued by the Ministry of Transport.
The Interior Ministry said that the man seen in the video had been "identified and arrested" the day after the clip went viral.
Confronted with the footage, he denied both the harassment and ever having met the woman before, according to the ministry.
Local media reported he was later released on bail of 1,000 Egyptian pounds (around $20), before being detained again over a pre-existing loan case.
His lawyer has called for a psychiatric evaluation of Shawky, accusing her of damaging Egypt's reputation.
These images tell "the whole world that there are harassers in Egypt and that Egyptian men encourage harassment, defend it and remain silent", said lawyer Ali Fayez on Facebook.
Ashraf told AFP news agency that the case revealed above all "a systemic and structural problem".
She said such incidents were "never taken seriously" and that blame was almost always shifted onto women's appearance.
"If the woman is veiled, they'll say her clothes are tight. And if her hair is uncovered, they'll look at her hair. And even if she wears a niqab, they'll say she's wearing makeup."
"There will always be something."

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
Epibatidine, a deadly chemical not found naturally in Russia, was detected in samples taken from the body of the late Putin critic
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said on Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis of samples taken from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine”.
It is a neurotoxin found in the skin of dart frogs in South America that is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
A joint statement said: “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.”
They five countries said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
The announcement came as Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany as the second anniversary of Navalny’s death approaches.

India Orders 288 Anti-Aircraft Missiles for S-400 Air Defense Systems from Russia

01:35:50 KST

The Indian Defense Procurement Council has approved the purchase of 288 anti-aircraft missiles for the S-400 Triumph systems, which the country previously purchased from Russia.
This was reported by the Hindustan Times.
According to the publication’s sources, the deal covers the purchase of 120 short-range missiles and 168 long-range missiles.
The total cost of purchasing this number of missiles is 10,000 crore rupees (about $1.2 billion).
After analyzing the results of Operation Sindur and considering the experience of combat clashes with Pakistani forces, the Indian government decided to significantly expand its air defense network.
The Indian Air Force plans to purchase five more S-400 Triumph anti-aircraft missile systems, which will create a dense protective dome over strategically important regions of the country.
In addition to long-range systems, India is focusing on protecting critical infrastructure and military airfields. To this end, the authorities are considering the purchase of short-range Pantsir-M anti-aircraft missile and gun systems.
It should be noted that despite these plans, as of today, the Indian government and the Ministry of Defense have faced delays in receiving S-400 anti-aircraft missile systems. This is directly related to the war in Ukraine and Russia’s urgent need for these systems.
During a bilateral meeting between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov in 2025, they discussed new deadlines for the transfer of S-400 air defense systems — 2026–2027. This is the second postponement, as the transfer of the last two batteries of the complex was to be completed by April 2023.
It should be recalled that in 2021, India began deploying the first regimental set of S-400 air defense missile systems in the Punjab sector to counter Pakistani aviation.
In total, India ordered five divisions of these systems from Russia, but their delivery has become a constant problem due to numerous delays, which, according to Indian sources, has negatively affected the country’s defense capabilities amid growing external threats.

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations

- The US military is preparing for sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran, significantly escalating potential conflict with major troop and naval deployments.
- Diplomacy is ongoing, but President Trump openly suggested regime change in Iran and stated all options remain on the table.
- Experts warn of greater risks to US forces, significant Iranian retaliation, and potential regional conflict due to Iran's missile arsenal.
AI generated
WASHINGTON - The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials - who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning - raises the stakes for the diplomacy under way between the United States and Iran.
US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Feb 17 in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned on Feb 14 that while Mr Trump’s preference was to reach a deal with Tehran, “that’s very hard to do.”
Meanwhile, Mr Trump has amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action. US officials said on Feb 13 the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier
Mr Trump, speaking to US troops on Feb 13 at a base in North Carolina, openly floated the possibility of regime change in Iran, saying it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.”
He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said “there are people.”
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Mr Trump said.
Mr Trump has long voiced scepticism about sending ground troops into Iran, saying in 2025 “the last thing you want to do is ground forces,” and the kinds of US firepower arrayed in the Middle East so far suggest options for strikes primarily by air and naval forces.
In Venezuela, Mr Trump demonstrated a willingness to rely also on special operations forces to seize that country’s president, Nicolas Maduro, in a January raid.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.”
“He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,” Ms Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The US sent two aircraft carriers to the region in 2025, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June’s “Midnight Hammer” operation
Risks increasing
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the US fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Mr Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes and crushing of internal dissent. On Feb 12, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would “be very traumatic, very traumatic.”
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.

Democratic senators launch inquiry into EPA’s repeal of key air pollution enforcement measure
Unknown

01:32:38 KST

More than three dozen Democratic senators have begun an independent inquiry into the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) following a huge change in how the agency measures the health benefits of reducing air pollution that is widely seen as a major setback to US efforts to combat the climate crisis.
In a regulatory impact analysis, the EPA said it would stop assigning a monetary value to the health benefits associated with regulations on fine particulate matter and ozone. The agency argued that the estimates contain too much uncertainty.
Previously, the EPA placed a dollar figure on the benefits of cleaner air, factoring in outcomes such as fewer premature deaths and reduced illness, including asthma attacks.
The 2009 endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare and should therefore be controlled by the EPA. By revoking it on Thursday, officials eliminated the legal foundation enabling the government to control planet-heating pollution.
The senators criticized the updated policy as “particularly troubling” and said the repeal “destroys that framework and results in a failure to faithfully execute EPA’s statutory mandate to protect human health”, according to a letter sent to the EPA on Thursday.
The effort is being led by the ranking member of the Senate committee on the environment and public works, Sheldon Whitehouse. The lawmakers have asked the EPA to provide documents and details explaining how it reached its decision by 26 February.
Senate Democrats are seeking to know the reasoning behind the EPA’s move; what factors the agency will consider when carrying out Clean Air Act rule-making; whether it has considered no longer quantifying health effects for other pollutants; and whether it consulted any outside parties, including the secretary of health and human services, the US surgeon general, or public health specialists.
“It is literally zero surprise that they knew their hand-picked climate deniers weren’t putting out real science,” Whitehouse wrote on X in response to an article suggesting the Trump administration ignored the recommendations of scientists. “Their nonsense has never been real, but part of a fraudulent propaganda campaign, designed by fossil fuel to protect its ‘free-to-pollute’ business model.”
The repeal is part of Trump’s sweeping attacks on US climate policy. On Thursday, he said the endangerment finding formed “the basis for the green new scam”. Since returning to office last January, the Trump administration has taken aggressive steps to roll back pollution regulations and promote fossil fuel production. Critics argue that this anti-environmental agenda benefits the president’s fossil fuel-industry donors.
Trump’s decision drew broad condemnation from climate scientists and advocates focused on environmental protection, public health and economic justice. Asked on Thursday to address environmental concerns about the new rule, Trump said: “Don’t worry about it.”
“This has nothing to do with public health,” he said of the endangerment finding. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”

Trump’s communications chief uses derogatory slur in rant against lawmakers over the Epstein files
Steven Cheung used the slur against lawmakers Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie

White House Communications Director Steven Cheung called two lawmakers the R-word, a slur long used to demean people with disabilities, in a social media post shared Friday evening.
Cheung called Democratic Representative Ro Khanna and Republican Representative Thomas Massie “some of the dumbest r****** ever to be in Congress.”
“They knowingly and willfully ruined the lives of innocent people who had nothing to do with [Jeffrey] Epstein,” Cheung wrote on X.
This isn’t the first time a Trump administration official — or the president himself — has used the slur in recent months.
President Donald Trump called Minnesota Governor Tim Walz “seriously r*******” in a Truth Social post on November 27. Harmeet Dhillon, the Justice Department’s assistant attorney general for civil rights, used the slur in an X post on December 28.
The Independent has contacted the White House, Khanna and Massie for comment.
Cheung’s statement came in response to a post from investigative journalist Jacqueline Sweet. She reported for The Guardian that four men Khanna named in a recent House floor speech about Epstein had no apparent ties to the dead sex offender.
“Reps Khanna and Massie pushed the DOJ to unredact a file in the Epstein files. Then Khanna read four men's names from it in a House floor speech, calling them ‘wealthy and powerful men that the DOJ hid for no apparent reason,’” Sweet wrote on X.
“The only problem is that file is a SDNY photo lineup, and the 16 people on it have no known ties to Epstein, the DOJ confirmed,” she added. “We identified 12 of the people on the list, and spoke to two of the men Khanna named, who denied any connection to Epstein and were seeking answers as to why their names were in the news.”
A spokesperson for Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche confirmed the file is a photo lineup, The Guardian reports.
“Rep Ro Khanna and Rep Thomas Massie forced the unmasking of completely random people selected years ago for an FBI lineup – men and women. These individuals have NOTHING to do with Epstein or Maxwell,” the spokesperson told the outlet.
Being mentioned in the Epstein files does not in itself imply wrongdoing.
Khanna said he appreciates Sweet’s reporting confirming the four men were “just part of a photo line up and are not connected to Epstein's crimes.”
“I wish DOJ had provided that explanation earlier instead of redacting then unredacting their names. They have failed to protect survivors, created confusion for innocent men, and have protected rich and powerful abusers. We must have full transparency and the truth,” he wrote on X.
Massie responded directly to Sweet’s post: “I told DOJ on Monday this might be a lineup, and if so, they should explain that. How long did it take DOJ to figure it out after I told them?”
The Republican lawmaker also responded to Cheung, writing, “Sorry about your Sultan bro.” He included a screenshot of a Wall Street Journal article detailing the resignation of DP World CEO Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem, who reportedly stepped down after his apparent ties to Epstein were revealed.

European allies say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by dart frog toxin; Russia rejects claims
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Five European allies blamed Russia on Feb 14 for Alexei Navalny's Feb 2024 death, citing epibatidine toxin from poison dart frogs.
- Analyses confirmed epibatidine, a foreign toxin. Allies state Russia had "means, motive, and opportunity"; Russia denies responsibility, claiming natural causes.
- Navalny's widow called for Putin's accountability. Allies demand Russia answer for violating chemical and biological weapons conventions due to this "alarming pattern."

LONDON - Five European allies on Feb 14 blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively” confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny’s death, dismissed the latest allegations as “a Western propaganda hoax”, according to the Russian state’s TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: “One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog.”
“When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly,” Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by TASS.
“Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues,” the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger “officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia”.
Britain on Feb 14 said the poisoning demonstrated “an alarming pattern of behaviour”. The country held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded in 2025 that Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.
The British government did not immediately respond to a Reuters query about how the samples from Navalny’s body were obtained or where they were assessed. Foreign minister Yvette Cooper told reporters that “UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth” on Navalny’s death.
Second anniversary
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony
His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Mrs Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference and she called for the Russian leader to be held accountable.
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof... I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth,” she said on social media while attending this year’s Munich conference on Feb 14.
The Feb 14 statement from the European allies almost exactly two years after Navalny’s death said Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the poison as Navalny died in prison.
“Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death,” the joint statement said.
His death was followed by memorial gatherings and protests across Europe, with demonstrators in cities including London, Berlin, Vilnius and Rome condemning the Kremlin and demanding accountability.
The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for “its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.” REUTERS

IMF lifts prior conditions for Ukraine loan program, Ukraine's Prime Minister says

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lifted the conditions for Ukraine's new $8.1 billion loan program, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko told reporters on Feb. 13.
The IMF has streamlined the agreements established in November by reviewing the preliminary measures and structural benchmarks, Svyrydenko said on Feb. 13. The announcement followed "numerous" discussions and consultations, including direct communication with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva.
According to Svyrydenko, the program will be considered at the next meeting of the IMF Executive Board with "no prior actions" required, while there has been "much discussion about how this will be done."
"We are working with parliamentarians and will most likely adopt these measures as part of a consolidated tax bill. It will also include issues related to digital platforms, parcels, and the preservation of the military tax after the end of martial law," Svyrydenko said.
Ukraine's debt management head, Yuriy Butsa, told Reuters on Feb. 13 that Ukraine expects its program to be formally approved in weeks. "I think February is still doable in terms of a timeline," Butsa said.
Finalizing the $8.1 billion IMF loan is required for securing a 90 billion euro ($105 billion) lifeline from the European Union, without which Ukraine's finances will run dry in a matter of months.
"The cooperation program with the IMF for Ukraine is the anchor for all international financial support, in particular for obtaining a 90-billion-euro loan from the European Union," Svyrydenko said.
Kyiv has been pushing to delay a new tax on self-employed entrepreneurs until after the war ends, as well as raise the threshold at which entrepreneurs start paying the levy, a person in the Ukrainian government familiar with the talks told the Kyiv Independent on the condition of anonymity.
The renegotiations started on Jan. 21, a week after IMF chief Kristalina Georgieva told Reuters in an interview that she expected the Washington-based lender's executive board to give the final stamp of approval in "a matter of weeks."

Olympics committee defends sale of T-shirt commemorating 1936 Nazi-era Games

The governing body for the Olympics is defending its sale of a limited-edition T-shirt commemorating the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin under Adolf Hitler’s Germany.
The $42 shirt, which was condemned by Jewish organizations, has already sold out from the official Olympics online store.
A spokesperson for the International Olympic Committee acknowledged the Games’ Nazi connections but said the 1936 design fit with its lineup of historical apparel marking “130 years of Olympic art and design.”
In its statement the IOC also invoked Jesse Owens, the Black American track-and-field athlete whose dominating performance at the 1936 Games was widely seen as a rebuke of Hitler’s “master race” ideology.
“While we of course acknowledge the historical issues of ‘Nazi propaganda’ related to the Berlin 1936 Olympic Games, we must also remember that the Games in Berlin saw 4,483 athletes from 49 countries compete in 149 medal events,” the IOC spokesperson said in a statement to media. “Many of them stunned the world with their athletic achievements, including Jesse Owens.”
The design, based on an official poster for the Games, depicts the Olympic rings and a golden statue of a muscular man crowned in laurels next to a chariot of horses atop Berlin’s Brandenburg Gates.
Another item based on an Olympics event overseen by the Nazis, a T-shirt commemorating the 1936 Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, was also being sold through the collection. That poster shows a victorious skier with an arm upraised in what could be a Nazi salute and was designed by Ludwig Hohlwein, a leading artist in Joseph Goebbels’ propaganda division.
Jewish groups voice frustration
European Jewish groups said the Berlin shirt was insensitive, given that the 1936 Games were intended to function as a propaganda tool for Hitler’s regime. Some pointed to the modern-day resurgence of antisemitism as justification for their objections.
“As the world reflects on this latest controversy, it is impossible not to recall that we are approaching 90 years since the 1936 Berlin Olympics, an event the Nazi regime used to legitimize itself on the global stage while persecution of Jews was already well underway,” Scott Saunders, CEO of International March of the Living, the educational program that organizes trips to concentration camps, told CNN.
“Sport has the power to unite, to inspire, and to elevate the very best of humanity,” Saunders added. “But history reminds us that it can also be manipulated to sanitize hatred and normalize exclusion. The lesson of Berlin is urgent. When antisemitism resurfaces in public life, whether in stadiums, streets, or online, silence is not neutrality. It is complicity.”
Christine Schmidt, the co-director of the Wiener Holocaust Library in London, also condemned the sale of the shirts.
“The Nazis used the 1936 Olympics to showcase their oppressive regime to the world, aiming to smooth over international relations while at the same time preventing almost all German-Jewish athletes from competing, rounding up the 800 Roma who lived in Berlin, and concealing signs of virulent antisemitic violence and propaganda from the world’s visitors,” Schmidt told CNN.
The screen-printed shirt is based on a poster for the actual games created by graphic artist Werner Würbel, according to an IOC catalog of posters from the Games. The aesthetic of the 1936 Games, which emphasized strongman caricatures in keeping with the Nazi ideal of a superhuman Aryan race, was memorialized in Nazi filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl’s propaganda documentary “Olympia.”
The Heritage collection also sold a T-shirt bedecked with a poster from the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, during which the entire Israeli athletic delegation was taken hostage and killed by the Palestinian terror group Black September. The Jewish Telegraphic Agency has reached out to the IOC for further comment about the shirt, which is also marked as sold out.
The Munich Games were honored in a different commemorative product that drew criticism: sneakers produced in 2024 by Adidas, which was founded by Nazi Party members and had recently taken weeks to break ties with Kanye West after he embarked on an antisemitic spree.

Zelenskyy responds to Macron's intention to speak with Putin
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is not against French President Emmanuel Macron being involved in negotiations with Russian leader Vladimir Putin, but stresses the importance of Europe working together.
Source: European Pravda citing Volodymyr Zelenskyy speaking to journalists at the Munich Security Conference
Details: The president emphasised that he is aware of the specifics of Emmanuel Macron's plan to negotiate with Putin. "This is his decision, he told me [about the intention to have this conversation]. Emmanuel was very honest with me about this," Zelenskyy said.
Zelenskyy did not offer any criticism regarding Macron's intentions and stated his trust in the support of his French counterpart for Ukraine.
However, the Ukrainian president holds the view that it is crucial that negotiations with the Russian Federation be conducted jointly with Europe.
Quote: "I think that Europe must decide how it wants to coordinate the negotiations. Because in my opinion, Putin will play games with one side, with the other, then with the third, and with the fourth, to divide Europe and give everyone candy, and just to give them the feeling that they have a decisive say."
Details: Zelenskyy expressed dissatisfaction with Europe's failure to participate in negotiations with Russia in the format that was secured by the United States.
Background:
- Macron is already involving other Europeans in resuming dialogue with Putin.
- This week, Macron is discussing demands on Putin with European leaders.
- At the same time, most Germans want direct negotiations between German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and Putin.

SDF to reorganize into four brigades under deal with Syrian government
The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are redistributing their fighters within a new military structure as part of a ceasefire deal with the Syrian government, following clashes last month which saw government forces take most of the territory once held by the SDF.
Farhad Shami, a spokesman for the SDF, told the Iraq-based Kurdistan 24 website on Friday that SDF forces will reorganise into four brigades, one to be based around the Kurdish-majority town of Kobane (also known as Ain Al-Arab) in Syria’s Aleppo province, and three to be stationed in the Jazira region of northeastern Syria.
He explained that the Hasakah Brigade will cover the areas of Darbasiyah and Sari Kani (Ras al-Ain), while the Qamishli Brigade will be responsible for the areas of Amuda, Qamishli, Tel Brak, and Tel Hamis. Meanwhile, the Derik Brigade will extend from the city of Derik (also known as Malikiya) to Tel Kocher.
On the ground, SDF military forces withdrew from positions to the south of the city of Qamishl on Friday, handing them over to Asayish security forces, which are associated with the SDF and the Kurdish-led Democratic Autonomous Administration of Northeastern Syria (DAANES).
This is part of a repositioning agreed upon with the Syrian government.
The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported that the SDF is scheduled to withdraw its fighters and vehicles from contact points with Syrian government military forces, while the latter will carry out a similar withdrawal from their side, to be followed by the deployment of government security forces.
In March 2025, the SDF agreed to integrate its forces and institutions with those of the Syrian government but this was repeatedly stalled and the agreement broke down last January, with fighting breaking out around two SDF-held areas in Aleppo and spreading to northeastern Syria.
Most of the territory once held by the SDF was Arab-majority and Syrian government forces were able to capture it relatively quickly last month, leaving the SDF in control of Qamishli, Hasakeh, Kobane, and surrounding areas.
Under the new ceasefire agreement signed on January 18, the SDF once again agreed to integrate its forces into the Syrian government, while government security forces have entered SDF-held towns.
The SDF also agreed to “expel non-Syrian leaders and members of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) from Syria” and “integrate all civil institutions in Hasakah province into state institutions and structures.”
Turkey, a key backer of the current Syrian government, has long accused the SDF of being a front for the PKK, which has fought for independence or autonomy for Turkey’s Kurdish minority since the 1980s.

European governments move to oust UN rapporteur over anti-Israel remarks

A growing number of European governments are calling on the United Nations to remove Francesca Albanese, the UN special rapporteur on the Palestinian territories, citing what they describe as extreme and inflammatory statements, some of which critics say raise concerns of antisemitism beyond opposition to Israel.
After France and Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic joined the calls in recent days to dismiss the Italian human rights expert from her post. Dozens of British lawmakers have urged the Foreign Office to seek her removal. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said this week that Albanese’s statements and conduct make calls for her resignation “inevitable.”
Italy’s ruling Brothers of Italy party has also begun collecting signatures demanding her dismissal.
The latest controversy erupted after Albanese participated by video in a conference organized by Al Jazeera in Doha, where speakers included Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and senior Hamas official Khaled Mashaal. France was the first to protest after Albanese was quoted as saying that Israel is the “common enemy of humanity.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot denounced her remarks as “antisemitic.” In her speech, Albanese referred to Israel as a “common enemy” that had, in her words, enabled what she called a “genocide” in Gaza.
She accused much of the international community of arming Israel and providing it with political cover and financial support instead of stopping it. “It’s also true that never before has the global community seen the challenges that we all face,” she said. “We who do not control large amounts of financial capitals, algorithms and weapons.”
Barrot said Albanese “presents herself as an independent UN expert, but she is neither an expert nor independent — she is a political activist who fuels hatred.” He added that her conduct harms both the Palestinian cause she claims to defend and the credibility of UN institutions.
As criticism mounted, Albanese said her comments had been taken out of context and manipulated. In an interview with France 24, she denied ever saying that Israel is the “common enemy of humanity.” She said she had been referring to “war crimes, crimes against humanity and acts that constitute genocide,” and that the “common enemy” she condemned was a system that, in her view, prevents accountability or an end to Israeli actions.
Left-wing parties in Europe have rallied to her defense, along with dozens of artists known for anti-Israel activism, including actors Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo and singer Annie Lennox, who signed a letter to the United Nations supporting her.
Over the past two years, Albanese has made a series of sharply critical statements about Israel that have made her a prominent figure among segments of Europe’s anti-Israel left. Days after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, she publicly cast doubt on allegations of sexual violence and rape by Hamas terrorists and accused Israel and the United States of spreading falsehoods to justify escalating the war.
She has argued that Israel has no right to self-defense after the Hamas incursion and said that, in her view, Israelis should be “considered suspect” and investigated when they are abroad. She has called for a pharmaceutical boycott of Israel, described it as a “genocide-supporting society” and accused it of standing against global justice.
Albanese has also said that when senior Hamas officials declare they want to “kill Jews,” they “do not really mean Jews.” She denied involvement by staff of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in crimes attributed to Hamas and promoted claims of global Israeli and Jewish control over the arms trade.
At an award ceremony in Italy, she publicly rebuked a mayor who presented her with a prize after he called on Hamas to release hostages. To applause from the audience, she warned him not to repeat such a demand, saying it was not a legitimate request.

On a February evening in 2019, Yann, then 18, wandered through the streets of downtown Bordeaux. He nervously checked his phone, the notification volume turned up all the way. Suddenly, thumbs-up emojis flooded his screen, signaling it was time for him to step in. He rushed into a bar and called out to his friend, spotting her and feigning surprise: "Lucie, I was looking for you everywhere! We have to go to that surprise birthday party for Valentine." This improvised exit line still made them laugh today.
A few days earlier, Yann and Lucie, his childhood friend, spent an evening hanging out. She confided in him that she wanted to meet new people. Slouched on a mutual friend's couch, balancing a plate of pesto pasta on their knees, they got to work. Yann created Lucie's very first Tinder profile, spending hours with her sorting through which photos to highlight. The first date was quickly set. Lucie hesitated. "She was stressed out, so I told her I'd hang out near the bar, just in case the date went sour," he recalled. "But we hadn't really thought the plan all the way through and it was pretty obvious," he said, laughing. While the exit mission was shaky, the story itself became "legendary": a case of friends acting as a safety net, as Cupid and as the creators of romantic connections. In short, the Swiss Army knives of emotional support.

Five European states blame Russia for poisoning Navalny
Finland

01:24:54 KST

Five European countries have concluded that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny died after being poisoned with epibatidine, a rare toxin found in South American dart frogs, and have held the Russian state responsible.
The United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands issued a joint statement on Saturday following laboratory analysis of biological samples taken from Navalny’s body.
Navalny died on 16 February 2024 in the IK-6 penal colony in Harp, north of the Arctic Circle, where he was serving a 19-year sentence.
The five governments said independent national laboratories identified epibatidine in samples linked to Navalny.
“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia,” the joint statement said.
“There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body.”
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, speaking at the Munich Security Conference, said only the Russian state had the capacity to deploy the substance.
“Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia,” Cooper said.
She added that the United Kingdom would inform the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons of what it described as a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
“Considering the toxicity of epibatidine and the reported symptoms, poisoning was a highly likely cause of death,” the joint statement said.
The countries expressed concern that Russia had not destroyed all of its chemical weapons stockpiles, despite declaring in 2017 that it had done so.
Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said she had been convinced from the outset that her husband was poisoned.
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof,” she wrote on X. “Putin killed Alexei with a chemical weapon.”
Navalnaya said in September that she had obtained biological samples from her husband’s body and sent them abroad for analysis. She said laboratories in two countries concluded that he had been murdered, though she did not at the time name the toxin involved.
Russian authorities have maintained that Navalny died of natural causes linked to existing health conditions. According to official accounts, he felt unwell after a walk in the prison yard and collapsed.
The Kremlin has not commented on the latest allegations.
Navalny, 47, was Russia’s most prominent opposition figure and an anti-corruption campaigner who built a nationwide network challenging President Vladimir Putin.
In 2020 he survived a poisoning attempt with the nerve agent Novichok while campaigning in Siberia. German military laboratories later confirmed the presence of the Soviet-era nerve agent after he was evacuated to Berlin for treatment.
He returned to Russia in 2021 and was arrested at the airport. Courts later handed him multiple sentences on charges his supporters described as politically motivated.
The five European governments said their findings followed a two-year inquiry and would be submitted to the OPCW in coordination with the United Nations.
“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the statement said.

Swansea man jailed for life after killing his older brother
Police said that the impact on the family had been ‘significant’ and the wider community in Swansea was shocked
- Bookmark
A man has been jailed for life after he was found guilty of killing his older brother. Darren Steel, 41, from Swansea, was told he must serve a minimum term of 20 years, after being convicted of murder and counts of grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm from his initial trial, South Wales Police said.
The body of Martin Steel, 48, was discovered at an address in the Clase area of Swansea in May 2023.
Jurors heard during a previous trial that the brothers had shared a “love-hate” relationship which could turn “volatile” when alcohol was consumed.
Detective inspector Stuart Prendiville said: “This has been a long and complex investigation into an incident which has shocked the communities of Clase, Morriston, and the wider community of Swansea. The impact on the family has been significant.”
“Darren Steel committed the ultimate betrayal against his older brother and caused further distress by pleading not guilty and putting the family through the ordeal of not one, but two trials.”
He added that police felt the life sentence was “wholly justified” and came as a relief.
“Darren Steel is a violent and dangerous individual and the life sentence and minimum tariff of 20 years is wholly justified in this case.
“We are relieved with the outcome and glad that the court proceedings have now come to an end. Our thoughts are with the family.”

Yulia Navalnaya releases statement following latest revelations on husband’s death
- Alexei Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, announced that scientists from five European countries confirmed her husband was poisoned with epibatidine.
- Epibatidine is identified as a deadly neurotoxin, naturally found on the Ecuadorian dart frog, which causes paralysis and respiratory arrest.
- Navalnaya directly accused Vladimir Putin of using a chemical weapon to kill her husband, stating she had been certain of this from the outset.
- She thanked European states for their two-year investigation, which she said uncovered the truth about the poisoning.
- While the Kremlin denies involvement, the UK and its allies maintain that only the Russian state possessed the capability and motive for such an attack.

Ukraine facing pressure from US to make concessions, not Russia: Zelenskyy

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed hope that US-brokered peace talks next week in Geneva will be serious and substantive, but he voiced concern that Ukraine was being asked "too often" to make concessions in the negotiations.
"We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things," Zelenskyy said on Saturday in a speech at the Munich Security Conference.
The Ukrainian leader said he was feeling "a little bit" of pressure from US President Donald Trump, who yesterday said Zelenskyy should not miss the "opportunity" to make peace soon.
"The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia," Zelenskyy said.
However, he added that he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations, and that there would be an opportunity for Europe, which he said was currently sidelined, to play a bigger role.
Zelenskyy has in the past expressed concern that US Congressional mid-term elections could focus the Trump administration on domestic political issues after the summer.
Ukraine and Russia have engaged in two recent rounds of talks brokered by Washington in Abu Dhabi, which were described by the sides as constructive but did not achieve any major breakthroughs.
Russia said its delegation to Geneva would be led by Putin adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a change from Abu Dhabi at which Russia's team was led by military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov.
Ukrainian sources have previously criticised Medinsky's handling of the talks, accusing him of delivering history lessons to the Ukrainian team instead of engaging in substantive negotiations.

Ukrainian defenders in southern sectors simultaneously hold off three to four Russian armies – Voloshyn
The spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces, Vladyslav Voloshyn, stated this during a live broadcast, in response to a question about what today is the main indicator of stability in the southern defense, Ukrinform reports.
"When people talk about successes in the south, I would like to note that today the Defense Forces of Ukraine in the south are fighting against three, or even four, Russian armies. The 5th, 29th, 35th, and 36th Russian armies are trying to break through toward Huliaipole and take control of some settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region," he said.
Voloshyn reported that a regrouping of the Russian forces aiming to capture Huliaipole is currently underway.
"Effectively, three sets of Russian military units have already been, as they say, worn down by the Ukrainian Defense Forces. The southern defenders are fighting heroically, and every centimeter, meter, and kilometer the enemy loses comes at a heavy cost in personnel, weapons, and military equipment," he noted.
According to his data, in the south, the enemy loses about 300–350 personnel and up to a hundred units of weapons and military equipment per day, "which is a fairly high price for every centimeter of our land."
Answering a question about how the open steppe terrain in the south affects Ukrainian defense, Voloshyn explained that the open terrain in southern Ukraine is present in two directions – Huliaipole and Orikhiv.
"Here, the enemy first tries to move personnel from assault groups to the frontlines and only then conducts assaults. In general, the Russian 5th Army operates here, and its main tactic is infiltration and small infantry group assaults," he said.
He clarified that the Russians conduct these assaults in waves, one following another.
"The main goal is to prevent us from bringing in reinforcements, to deny time to organize logistics. That's why the enemy first delivers massive strikes, destroys everything, and then assaults in waves," Voloshyn explained.
He noted that in the Oleksandrivka direction, the terrain is slightly different – there are several rivers.
"The enemy is operating there with the 29th and 36th armies. There, besides the small infantry group assault tactic, they sometimes use mechanized columns. Usually, these are mechanized platoons with several armored vehicles – tanks, combat armored vehicles, and transport vehicles – moving ahead to assault our positions and settlements," he explained.
Voloshyn noted that these armored columns try to break into Ukrainian settlements, and then, sacrificing equipment and weapons, the enemy infantry disperses.
"...After that, it's quite difficult to expel them from the settlement and conduct a clearing operation. This tactic is widely used in the Oleksandrivka direction, and the enemy does not want to abandon it, because according to our intelligence, they are bringing in more armored vehicles to continue such assaults," he said.
As Ukrinform previously reported, Voloshyn emphasized that despite reports of alleged Russian advances near Robotyne, there is no actual progress or offensive in the Orikhiv direction.

Cuba calls off cigar festival amid economic crisis

Cuba on Saturday announced the cancellation of its iconic cigar festival, amid a major energy crisis sparked by US pressure on the cash-strapped island.
In a message to participants seen by AFP, organizers said they were postponing the annual event, scheduled to take place from February 24-27, but did not give a new date.
The cigar festival typically raises millions of dollars from auction sales that are then funneled into the country's health care system. Last year, it took in about $19.5 million.
International sales of Cuban cigars, the island nation's most emblematic export, bring much needed income to its struggling economy, with Europe the main market for the luxury smokes.
The United States cut off oil deliveries to Cuba from Havana's key ally Venezuela following the abduction of longtime president Nicolas Maduro in early January.
US President Donald Trump also signed an executive order allowing his country to impose tariffs on countries selling oil to Havana.
International airlines including Air Canada have halted Cuba flights due to a lack of fuel on the island, and several governments have urged citizens to reconsider travel there, warning they could be stranded.

UK says it will deploy Carrier Strike Group to North Atlantic, High North this year
'This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies,' says British defense chief
LONDON
The British government announced Saturday that it will deploy a carrier strike group to the North Atlantic and High North this year in a bid to boost regional security.
In a statement, the Defense Ministry said the UK will send a carrier strike group in 2026 "in a major show of force across the Euro-Atlantic and High North, reinforcing NATO’s deterrence at a time of rising Russian threats in the region."
According to the plan, deployment will include major exercises alongside US, Canadian, and Northern European allies.
"Known as ‘Operation Firecrest’ and led by HMS Prince of Wales -- the largest warship in the Royal Navy -- the UK will deploy the strike group across the North Atlantic and Arctic."
The plan came as Russia’s military activity in the North Atlantic "continues to increase," as over the past two years, there has been a "30% increase in Russian navy vessels threatening UK waters," according to the statement.
"The Carrier Strike Group will sail across the Atlantic to visit a US port, with US jets also expected to operate from the flight deck of HMS Prince of Wales," it added.
In the statement, Defense Secretary John Healey said: "This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad."
The statement came following Prime Minister Keir Starmer's announcement of the plan during his address at the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

US, Syrian top diplomats meet at Munich conference
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with his Syrian counterpart Asaad al-Shaibani on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday and they discussed Damascus's recent agreement with the Kurds.
A post by the Syrian foreign ministry included pictures showing that the head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Abdi, also attended the meeting.
Syria's government and the Kurdish-led authorities signed last month an agreement to gradually integrate the Kurds' military and civilian institutions into the state.
It came after Kurdish forces ceded territory to advancing government troops following months of tensions and sporadic clashes.
Rubio and Shaibani on Friday discussed the "latest domestic and regional developments, while stressing the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic", the foreign ministry statement said.
The ministry added that Rubio expressed US support for "the recent integration agreement with the Syrian Democratic Forces".
SDF leader Abdi later announced that he attended the meeting, describing it as "positive" and telling local media that the meeting discussed the integration process.
The meeting coincided with a move by Damascus to appoint a Kurdish governor of Hasakeh province in eastern Syria, according to a decree published Friday, as part of the integration deal between the government and the SDF.
The official news agency SANA reported a presidential decree appointing Noureddine Ahmed Eissa, a Kurd from Qamishli, to govern Hasakeh, a former stronghold of the Kurdish administration.
Alongside the US-led coalition against the Islamic State group, the SDF spearheaded the battle that led to the extremist group's territorial defeat in Syria in 2019.
The United States has however drawn close to Syria's new authorities, recently saying the purpose of its alliance with the Kurdish forces was largely over.
As Damascus seeks to extend its control over all of Syria, US forces confirmed on Thursday their withdrawal from Al-Tanf base near Syria's border with Jordan and Iraq.

United Kingdom Initiates Discussions on Confiscating Russia’s Shadow Fleet Tankers

The United Kingdom and its European allies in the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force are considering confiscating ships belonging to Russia’s shadow fleet, regardless of their flag.
This was reported by Bloomberg.
The Combined Joint Expeditionary Force is a group of 10 countries (the United Kingdom, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and the Netherlands), united by common commitments to the security of the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea, took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
British Defence Minister John Healey met with his counterparts from the Baltic and Northern European countries to discuss the possible seizure of shadow fleet oil tankers as part of Europe’s efforts to tighten restrictions against Russia’s war economy.
As the publication noted, the meeting demonstrated the allies’ growing willingness to more actively restrict revenues that finance the war against Ukraine.
“The atmosphere and general understanding was that we need to be more proactive. The message is that countries that provide flags to shadow fleet vessels should know that other states may take action,” Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said after the meeting.
According to Pevkur, further discussions are needed before any decision is made. Some participants remain cautious due to “fears of escalation,” Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a separate interview.
The meeting was also attended by British Chief of Defence Staff Richard Knighton, who presented options for action, including the possibility of joint operations to seize ships.
If a decision is made to confiscate ships, the Combined Joint Expeditionary Force could draw on the experience of the United States in intercepting tankers transporting goods to and from Venezuela. Some of these ships had ties to Russia.
It is currently unclear to what extent the US will be involved in the UK-led initiative. However, according to one of the publication’s sources, some coordination is likely to take place. The interception of ships linked to Russia has caused concern in Moscow, with Russian officials privately demanding that the US stop such actions.
In January 2026, fourteen European countries issued a joint statement warning Russia that its shadow fleet tankers would no longer be able to operate freely in the Baltic Sea.
The document was signed by Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.
The statement says that from now on, tankers that change flags, turn off transponders, or do not have the necessary documents will be considered stateless vessels. Such ships can be detained without legal risk, which significantly limits the ability of Russian carriers to circumvent sanctions.

Ukraine hits Russia's BK-16 landing craft in Crimea and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, military says
Ukrainian forces successfully attacked a Russian BK-16 landing craft and other targets in Russian-occupied territories, the General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces said on Feb. 14.
The General Staff reported that Russia's BK-16 landing vessel, a high-speed landing craft for coastal operations and troop transport, was "successfully hit" on Feb. 12 in the Novoozerne area, Russian-occupied Crimea.
Some other military targets were also hit on Feb. 12, such as the RSP-10 radar station in Crimea and Russia's communications node in the occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Oblast, the General Staff said.
Additionally, on Feb. 13, Ukraine hit a Russian ammunition depot near the village of Novoeokonomichne in occupied Donetsk Oblast.
"The Ukrainian defense forces will continue to systematically carry out measures aimed at weakening the combat potential of the Russian aggressor," the General Staff said.
Crimea has been under Russian occupation since its illegal annexation in 2014.
Ukraine has stepped up strikes on military infrastructure on the peninsula and other newly occupied territories since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.

US military says struck more than 30 IS targets in Syria
The US military said Saturday that its forces had struck more than 30 Islamic State group targets in Syria this month, maintaining pressure on the jihadists after a deadly attack on US troops last year.
The strikes also came as the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) in recent weeks transferred thousands of IS detainees from Syria to Iraq, after they had been held in prisons run for years by Kurdish-led forces.
US forces "conducted 10 strikes against more than 30 ISIS targets in Syria... to sustain relentless military pressure on remnants from the terrorist network," a CENTCOM statement said, using another acronym for IS.
The air strikes, carried out between February 3 and February 12, hit IS "infrastructure and weapons storage targets", it said.
The forces additionally conducted "five strikes against an ISIS communication site, critical logistics node, and weapons storage facilities" between January 27 and February 2, the statement said.
Washington has blamed an IS fighter for ambushing and killing two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in Palmyra on December 13.
Syria's interior ministry has said the IS gunman was a member of the security forces who had been set to be fired for extremism.
The US launched Operation Hawkeye Strike in response to the attack.
"More than 50 ISIS terrorists have been killed or captured and over 100 ISIS infrastructure targets have been struck with hundreds of precision munitions during two months of targeted operations," the CENTCOM statement added.
On Friday, CENTCOM said it had completed the transfer of more than 5,700 detained IS suspects, from 61 countries, from Syria to Iraq.
The operation began last month as Damascus's capture of territory surrounding the prisons from Kurdish-led forces sparked questions over the fate of the IS prisoners, prompting Washington to step in.
Alongside the US-led anti-IS coalition, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces spearheaded the battle that led to the jihadist group's territorial defeat in Syria in 2019.
Washington has however drawn close to Syria's new authorities, recently saying the purpose of its alliance with the Kurdish forces was largely over.
As Damascus seeks to extend its control over all of Syria, US forces confirmed on Thursday their withdrawal from Al-Tanf base near Syria's border with Jordan and Iraq.

US military used Anthropic’s AI model Claude in Venezuela raid, report says

Claude, the AI model developed by Anthropic, was used by the US military during its operation to kidnap Nicolás Maduro from Venezuela, the Wall Street Journal revealed on Saturday, a high-profile example of how the US defence department is using artificial intelligence in its operations.
The US raid on Venezuela involved bombing across the capital, Caracas, and the killing of 83 people, according to Venezuela’s defence ministry. Anthropic’s terms of use prohibit the use of Claude for violent ends, for the development of weapons or for conducting surveillance.
Anthropic was the first AI developer known to be used in a classified operation by the US department of defence. It was unclear how the tool, which has capabilities ranging from processing PDFs to piloting autonomous drones, was deployed.
A spokesperson for Anthropic declined to comment on whether Claude was used in the operation, but said any use of the AI tool was required to comply with its usage policies. The US defence department did not comment on the claims.
The WSJ cited anonymous sources who said Claude was used through Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, a contractor with the US defence department and federal law enforcement agencies. Palantir refused to comment on the claims.
The US and other militaries increasingly deploy AI as part of their arsenals. Israel’s military has used drones with autonomous capabilities in Gaza and has extensively used AI to fill its targeting bank in Gaza. The US military has used AI targeting for strikes in Iraq and Syria in recent years.
Critics have warned against the use of AI in weapons technologies and the deployment of autonomous weapons systems, pointing to targeting mistakes created by computers governing who should and should not be killed.
AI companies have grappled with how their technologies should engage with the defence sector, with Anthropic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, calling for regulation to prevent harms from the deployment of AI. Amodei has also expressed wariness over the use of AI in autonomous lethal operations and surveillance in the US.
This more cautious stance has apparently rankled the US defence department, with the secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, saying in January that the department wouldn’t “employ AI models that won’t allow you to fight wars”.
The Pentagon announced in January that it would work with xAI, owned by Elon Musk. The defence department also uses a custom version of Google’s Gemini and OpenAI systems to support research.

Top entertainment figures back UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese
Over a hundred top figures from the world of entertainment signed an open letter Saturday in support of UN Palestinian human rights expert Francesca Albanese who faces calls from Israel's allies to resign over comments about the war in Gaza.
France and Germany have called for Albanese to step down over remarks last weekend in which she referred to a "common enemy of humanity" after criticising "most of the world" and the media for enabling Israel's genocide in Gaza.
Israel and its supporters have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a "common enemy", while Albanese has denounced this as a "manipulation" and "completely false".
In a letter organised by the Artists for Palestine group, over a 100 cultural figures backed her, including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories "offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people's right to exist," the letter says.
"There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word 'law' truly means," it concludes.
Published in French on the website of Artists for Palestine, it also reproduces the full remarks by Albanese who was speaking via videoconference at a forum last Saturday organised by the Al Jazeera TV network.
Other celebrities to offer support for her include actresses Rosa Salazar and Asia Argento, Oscar-nominated film directors Yorgos Lanthimos and Kaouther Ben Hania, Latin music star Residente, and photographer Nan Goldin.
A group of French MPs sent a letter to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Tuesday denouncing Albanese's remarks as "antisemitic".
Barrot called for her to step down a day later, saying that France "unreservedly condemns" what he characterised as "the outrageous and reprehensible remarks".
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Thursday said her position was "untenable".
'Shame of our time'
Albanese is one of the most outspoken critics of Israel's more-than-two-year bombardment of Gaza which has resulted in the deaths of over 70,000 people and the destruction of most of the territory's infrastructure.
She has called it the "the shame of our time" and says she always asks prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers the same question: "How do you sleep? When will you act?"
The Italian-born legal expert, who began her unpaid role in 2022, was targeted with sanctions by the Trump administration in July last year over what it called her "biased and malicious" work.
UN special rapporteurs like Albanese are independent experts who are appointed by the UN rights council, but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres distanced himself from Albanese on Thursday when his spokesman said "we don't agree with much of what she says."
"We wouldn't use the language that she's using in describing the situation," his spokesman Stephane Dujarric added.

Israel’s goal is to weaken the regime in Iran, not change it - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14

01:11:11 KST

As the drumbeat of war continues to echo, a less binary reality is becoming increasingly clear: Israel is not truly striving to topple the Iranian regime. Instead, it is pursuing a less ambitious yet more practical goal of weakening the regime and rendering it non-threatening, to the point where its ability to harm Israel nears zero.
This mirrors the strategic reality Israel has imposed on Hezbollah’s Lebanon.
Truthfully, this is an achievable goal, and it is closer than it appears. If a direct exchange occurs now, the Iranians will likely manage to retaliate; in the next round, their response will be weaker; and after one or two more phases of strikes, Israel will have almost completely neutralized their retaliatory capabilities.
This is the reality Israel is striving for: to create operational dominance in Iran similar to what has been established in Lebanon. This would allow the Jewish state to carry out strikes there, on a regular basis, to thwart any attempts at reconstruction without Iran having the ability to react, and without the world holding its breath every time Israeli jets head toward Tehran.
This reality would also bolster Iran’s opposition forces and provide relief to protesters by making them less vulnerable.
The current US administration’s tendency to think in “spectacular” terms – planning a multi-systemic, hyper-sophisticated, simultaneous mega-strike to collapse the Revolutionary Guards’ house of cards in a single hammer blow is, unfortunately, neither realistic nor attainable. It stems from an idealistic pursuit of a “magic solution” – a quick fix intended to avoid a history of getting bogged down in overseas wars. It also stems from a profound hesitancy within the Pentagon regarding the actual use of assets beyond exercises, publicized troop buildups, and displays of grandiosity involving stealth jets and aircraft carriers.
US military supposed to be a deterrent
The US wants to strike without being struck. This is an almost absurd expansion of the “no boots on the ground” approach into a “no military forces in a war zone” doctrine. The US military, with all its might, is supposed to be the force that projects deterrence, not the one being deterred.
Instead, Washington seeks hermetic protection for its forces, feeling that its warships and bases in the Middle East are so threatened by Iranian missiles that it raises a fundamental question: What is the world’s strongest military worth if it is so vulnerable, exposed, and fragile?
Furthermore, how can the US tolerate direct threats to the spearhead of its strategic power, the potential sinking of its aircraft carriers?
However, the Americans will eventually have to confront the same brutal reality that Israel has already accepted: An agreement does not intercept the missiles of jihadist entities. A diplomatic signature from a revolutionary theocracy offers little physical protection to a carrier task force in the Persian Gulf.
Sooner or later, Washington will likely reach the inevitable conclusion that the only way to safeguard its forces in the Middle East is through the systematic neutralization of Iran’s ballistic capabilities – mirroring the decimation of Hezbollah’s long-range arsenal. Until then, its strategic spearhead will remain a collection of potential, high-priced hostages.
In Israel, by contrast, the “fear barrier” was crossed long ago. The experience of war has revealed a dormant inner strength within Israelis and a readiness to confront challenges of this magnitude. They have discovered reserves of courage they hadn’t recognized in recent decades, and have become far more pragmatic regarding the use of force and its consequences.
They want to strike. They know they will be hit in return, but they do not fear it. They are willing to pay the price, and not just with military personnel. Unlike the US, whose military alone is in the region while its civilian population remains safe across the ocean, Israel and its people are within missile range. Israelis are well aware of this and do not bow before the threat.
Their confidence also stems from the fact that when they hear declarations like “The Iranian Air Force is ready; the war with Israel helped us restore combat capability,” they view them with immense skepticism. This is because, like other combat branches of the Iranian military (excluding missile units), the Iranian Air Force played no significant part in the war against Israel and demonstrated no real capability.
In other words, the Iranian military’s entire operational contribution in the 12-Day War amounted to firing missiles from underground command centers. And sooner or later, even that capability will be taken from them.

European governments say Alexei Navalny died after toxin poisoning in Russian prison
Unknown

01:11:02 KST

Five European allies on Saturday blamed Russia for killing late Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using toxin from poison dart frogs while he was held in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, a claim Moscow rejected as propaganda.
In a joint statement, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analyzes of samples from Navalny's body "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
The Russian government, which has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death, dismissed the latest allegations as "a Western propaganda hoax," according to the Russian state's TASS news agency, while the Russian embassy in London said: "One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog."
Britain on Saturday said the poisoning demonstrated "an alarming pattern of behavior." The country held a public inquiry into the poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in 2018. It concluded last year Russian President Vladimir Putin must have ordered the Novichok nerve agent attack.
"When the test results are available and the formulas for the substances are disclosed, we will comment accordingly," Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova was quoted as saying by TASS.
"Until then, all such assertions are merely propaganda aimed at diverting attention from pressing Western issues," the news agency cited her as saying. The report also said she described Navalny as a blogger "officially designated as a terrorist and extremist in Russia."
The British government declined to comment to a Reuters query about how the samples from Navalny's body were obtained or where they were assessed. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper told reporters that "UK scientists worked with our European partners to pursue the truth" on Navalny's death.
Russian opposition leader Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, after being convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied.
His death was announced minutes before the opening of the Munich Security Conference in 2024. In response, the conference made a rare schedule adjustment to allow his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, to address the conference and she called for Putin to be held accountable.
"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof... I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth," she said on social media while attending this year's Munich conference on Saturday.
Russia denies responsibility
The Russian embassy spokesperson said the European allies' move was "not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead."
"Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace - a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign," the spokesperson added.
Saturday's statement from the European allies, almost exactly two years after Navalny's death, said Moscow had the means, motive and opportunity to administer the poison as Navalny died in prison.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the joint statement said.
His death was followed by memorial gatherings and protests across Europe, with demonstrators in cities including London, Berlin, Vilnius and Rome condemning the Kremlin and demanding accountability.
The joint statement added that the latest findings underlined the need for Russia to be held accountable for "its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."

Tehran in the crosshairs: The dual US-Israel strategy pressuring Iran - opinion
Unknown

16:10:17 UTC
01:10:17 KST

Recent statements from American and Israeli officials have grown more pointed, moving beyond standard diplomacy to include explicit warnings and implied threats.
The atmosphere carries clear signals of mounting pressure on Tehran. This is not just speculation but a visible shift in strategy.
Iran now confronts more than routine political or diplomatic pressure. It faces deliberate targeting through a combination of naval deployments and targeted killings. These elements form a unified approach: using military and intelligence tools to force compliance rather than seek negotiation.
The actions exceed conventional shows of force. The rerouting of a carrier strike group – with destroyers, cruise missiles and fighter jets – signals readiness to act, if necessary, rather than providing mere reassurance to allies.
President Donald Trump has described a massive fleet and overwhelming military might while adding in the same breath that he “would rather not see anything happen.” This mix of tough rhetoric and stated preference for restraint is deliberate. It aims to demonstrate that military options remain available and that ignoring warnings will not lead to renewed talks but to a far more dangerous phase of conflict escalation.
Weakening Tehran
Targeted assassinations in the ongoing conflict with Israel have inflicted significant damage on Iran’s leadership structure. In a remarkably short period, these operations have eliminated several high-ranking figures: the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, the chief of the General Staff, the head of Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, and the commander of the Aerospace Force responsible for missiles and drones, along with key intelligence, air defense, and Basij officers, plus several nuclear scientists central to Iran’s nuclear and missile programs.
The strategy has shifted from issuing warnings to systematically weakening and gutting the command structure itself.
Assassination target lists have become a central strategic tool rather than mere operational details. The widely reported tally of roughly 30 officials killed in the latest strikes, including more than 30 senior security officials according to some Israeli statements, represents only the visible layer of a deeper penetration. There is evidence of broad compromise of the regime’s security and military apparatus, enabling adversaries to progress from surveillance to selective elimination.
Reports have also referenced the number “fifty” not merely as a body count but as an internal intelligence document or an expanded target matrix encompassing leadership figures, critical sites, and operational nodes tied to Iran’s military capabilities.
Shifting the regional balance of power
The real significance lies not in the numerical difference between thirty and fifty, but in the underlying political-security message. The scope of targeting is no longer confined to a narrow circle: It now extends across the entire power structure, from mid-level operatives to the highest echelons of the political and security leadership, with no guaranteed safe havens, no inviolable redlines, and no presumption of immunity – even for the supreme leader – should the approach shift from gradual erosion to outright decisive action.
Israel contributes extensive experience in dismantling covert networks, penetrating closed systems, and tracking sensitive leaders within the Iranian system. Its cumulative record of operations offers evidence that the talk of assassination target lists is not merely psychological warfare but part of an established targeting doctrine that treats leadership itself as a legitimate military objective rather than a deferred negotiation card.
Combining Israel’s targeted operations with American military mobilization at sea and in the air reveals an evidently dual strategy. On one hand is the systematic dismantling of the Iranian command structure through assassinations and strikes; on the other is regional encirclement with sufficient conventional firepower to neutralize Iran’s proxies and arms before they can be used.
The message is directed not only at Tehran but at its extended network from Iraq to Lebanon and Yemen: the time for operating under a margin of deniability and ambiguity is over. The target bank is no longer an assumption but a reality ready for activation.
Iran, for its part, continues to issue strong public rhetoric about crushing aggression and turning American bases into targets. However, what is called “Iranian deterrence” has become closer to a worn-out political narrative for internal consumption than to an effective deterrence equation. Successive breaches striking at the heart of the command system have revealed that the declared immunity was too weak to withstand the test of real power.
In this gray area between deterrence and execution, the true message lies not in the number of ships nor the length of lists, but in something deeper: that the regional balance of power is no longer open to gradual challenge or symbolic maneuvering. Whoever misreads this moment, or bets on a margin of maneuvering that no longer exists, will not face a new round of negotiations but a strategic reality imposed by force.
This is not a phase of posturing but one of delineating spheres of influence with the necessary harshness and severity – not in Tehran alone, but in every capital that believes geography grants it immunity or that chaos allows for rewriting the rules of the game. The regional order is being recalibrated – and whoever refuses to acknowledge this will learn it the hardest way.

Ex-Oxfam UK CEO alleges antisemitism, anti-Israel bias, premature push for 'genocide' label

Former Oxfam UK CEO Halima Begum is taking legal action against the organization for antisemitism, racism, and sexism, alleging that the charity focused disproportionately on the Israel-Hamas War, and accusing it of pushing for the conflict to be labeled a genocide without sufficient evidence.
Begum, a Bangladeshi-British Muslim, made her remarks in a Friday interview with Channel 4, where she said she was forced out of Oxfam UK in December of last year amid a “witch hunt.” She is currently taking the charity to an employment tribunal.
Pressure to call Gaza war a 'genocide'
“It always felt as though we were disproportionately working around the crisis in Gaza,” Begum told Channel 4, noting that she felt there was “strong pushback” to label the war as a “genocide” before the organization had the proper evidence and legal advice to arrive at the conclusion.
She added that, working at the organization, “it was very hard to hold on to neutrality and impartiality. And I say that as a Muslim woman.”
In response, Oxfam GB told Channel 4 that it had not received Begum’s employment tribunal claim and that it had zero tolerance for discrimination such as “racism, antisemitism, and sexism” and called the description “inaccurate and misleading.”
Additionally, a spokesperson for former Oxfam chair Charles Gurassa asserted to Channel 4 that Begum’s “allegations are completely spurious.”
Anti-Israel bias
Oxfam has been accused in the past of anti-Israel bias. It has also been accused of having been manipulated by Hamas. NGO Monitor said a 2021 document showed that the founders and officers of an Oxfam partner organization were affiliated with the terror organization.
According to the group, the document indicated that Hamas thought the company would prevent an Oxfam irrigation project from interfering with its security infrastructure.
“Revelations of vicious antisemitism and anti-Israel bias at Oxfam are as predictable as they are tragic,” NGO Monitor stated following the Channel 4 interview.
“Former Oxfam CEO Halima Begum’s assertions of overt bias – along with pressure to prematurely brand the Gaza war a genocide without evidence – echo developments at other NGOs, where activism and bigotry have replaced objectivity and universal human rights.”

Gaza’s al-Aqsa hospital at risk of collapse amid Israeli siege, aid restrictions
The Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza risks shutting down due to the breakdown of generators amid a continued Israeli siege on the territory.
The government hospital had previously been operating on two main generators that have since stopped working, forcing the medical centre, which serves more than one million people, to rely on a single, small backup generator.
The spokesperson for al-Aqsa hospital, Khalil al-Dakran, told The New Arab's sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed that the hospital risks being forced to halt operations due to the ongoing Israeli ban on bringing spare generator parts and fuel into the besieged Gaza Strip.
As a result, al-Dakran added, the medical staff at the hospital have begun rationing electricity and stop its supply to non-vital sections of the facility altogether to ensure the running of critical departments.
Al-Aqsa hospital hosts multiple intensive care, kidney and cardiac units, as well as operating rooms, emergency departments, and neonatal incubators.
It is also the only government hospital to remain functioning in central Gaza.
The single generator is not sufficient to cover the bare minimum needs of the hospital, al-Dakran told al-Araby al-Jadeed, adding that there was an ongoing crisis suffocating the operation of Gaza’s hospitals.
Under the ceasefire agreement reached in October 2025, 600 aid trucks should have entered Gaza daily to respond to the dire humanitarian conditions caused by two years of genocidal war.
Local authorities have said that only about 200 trucks carrying aid supplies enter the besieged territory daily, a third of the stipulated amount previously agreed upon by Israel.
Israel continues to impose a siege and stop the entry of fuel, despite UN officials suggesting critical operations in Gaza, including medical infrastructure, require a minimum of 1.9 million litres of fuel per week. This equates to roughly 270,000 litres per day as a minimum requirement.
Al-Dakran called Israel’s policy of allowing fuel into Gaza "drip-feeding", leaving hospitals under constant threat of closure.
The official also spoke of an acute shortage of medicines and medical supplies, adding that since the beginning of the war, Israel has allowed in less than 10% of the health system’s actual needs.
No new medical equipment has been permitted to enter Gaza, despite the large scale of destruction of medical facilities and hospitals because of Israel’s relentless bombardment during two years of war.
Despite most of Gaza’s hospitals going out of service during the war, many are unable to rebuild due to the continued ban of construction material from entering Gaza.

MEP believes Germany ‘needs peace’ with Russia, sanctions must go

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. European Parliament Member Ruth Firmenich (BSW party, formerly the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance - Reason and Justice) has voiced a compelling call for peace with Russia, urging the immediate lifting of sanctions. Speaking at a demonstration in central Munich against arms supplies to Kiev, she emphasized, "We need peace with Russia; we want peace with Russia." Firmenich criticized EU leaders, recalling that top diplomat Kaja Kallas "dreams of eliminating Russia," while the European Union continues to implement its 20th round of sanctions against Moscow. She insisted that "the sanctions must be lifted immediately."
Firmenich also pointed out that the EU has yet to propose a genuine initiative to resolve the Ukraine conflict, instead focusing on militarization and preparations for war. "The EU has not put forward a single peace initiative of its own," she argued, "but is now solely committed to prolonging the conflict." She highlighted that "every war has a prehistory, just like the war in Ukraine," and cited NATO's eastward expansion as a contributing factor to the crisis.
She further criticized recent EU actions, noting, "Just this week, the European Parliament approved 90 billion euros in loans to Ukraine, ostensibly to support its defense, but primarily to prolong the war." Firmenich called for a shift in approach, stating, "The will to negotiate is finally needed." She pointed out that the Minsk agreements have been exploited to bolster Ukraine's military capabilities, with former German Chancellor Angela Merkel admitting as much. Firmenich also referenced comments by former German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who reportedly expressed a desire to destroy Russia, describing such rhetoric as "madness" that must end.
Warning of escalating tensions, she warned, "Everything we are witnessing is preparation for war." She criticized the Munich Conference for serving as a platform to divide labor in Europe's militarization efforts. Firmenich called for an end to arms supplies to what she termed "corrupt Ukraine" and demanded the withdrawal of US troops and weapons from Germany. "Weapons must never be directed against Russia from German soil again," she declared. She reiterated her stance against nuclear armament, stating, "We do not need American nuclear weapons, nor European or German nuclear weapons. We need peace with Russia and the entire world." Her closing appeal was clear: "That country must never become a battlefield for nuclear war.".

‘Small but precious breakthrough’ for paralysed Hong Kong dancer Mo Li
Father reveals progress in rehabilitation but says ‘path to recovery is still a marathon’
“It has been over 3½ years. Throughout this long journey, Mo’s body has been like a computer that suddenly shut down – severed nerves cut off all connections. When the system finally rebooted, the old settings had completely vanished,” his father, Reverend Derek Li Shing-lam, said in a prayer letter posted on social media.
“However, we have recently witnessed a small but precious breakthrough: he has begun to slowly differentiate the sensation of his bladder and bowel movements.”
He added that the breakthrough was still far from that of a normal person; it was the result of constant neural pairing and training.
It was the 176th such prayer letter since Mo Li was crushed by a falling four-by-four-metre screen in July 2022. The 500kg (1,102lbs) LED panel fell from the ceiling of the Hong Kong Coliseum during a Mirror concert, leaving the dancer at risk of permanent paralysis.

Record 1,000 UK taxpayers under 30 earned more than £1m last year

Their generation is often derided for being work-shy, self-centred and overly sensitive. But when it comes to making money, people under 30 are proving they are something else entirely: successful.
A record 1,000 taxpayers under 30 earned more than £1m last year, an 11% increase on the year before, HMRC records show.
In total, these earners took home more than £3bn in the past year, making an average of £3m each.
Lubbock Fine, the accountancy firm which obtained the figures from HMRC, suggested that the surge could partly be driven by influencers’ income from marketing spend on social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.
The record increase may also be down to bigger pay deals for sports, music and media stars, as well as higher salaries in technology and financial services, the accountancy firm suggested.
Under 30s now account for roughly 3% of all £1m+ earners and are thought to include Erling Haaland, the 25-year-old Manchester City striker who is estimated to earn £525,000 a week (about £27.3m a year) and 26-year-old Molly-Mae Hague, a former Love Island contestant and influencer who is reported to command up to £60,000 per post.
Overall, there are now 31,000 taxpayers who earn £1m a year or more, which is only a 1% rise on the year before.
This indicates the number of very high earners under 30 is increasing at a much faster pace than the number of high earners in older age groups.
But earning so much when you are young does not necessarily mean you will be wealthy for life, warned Russell Rich, head of sports and entertainment for Lubbock Fine. “Footballers, boxers, and sports people generally tend to live beyond their means when they retire,” he told the Times. “People in the arts also do not tend to be good at saving and investing the money they make.”
The number of people under 30 who earn over £1m has risen by 54% since the pandemic, when just 650 young taxpayers were recorded by HMRC in this income bracket.
Over roughly the same period, the amount spent on influencer marketing in the UK tripled to £917m, according to Lubbock Fine, and is predicted to exceed £1bn this year.
But it is not just young people who are cashing in – older generations are now waking up to their earning potential as influencers. Research from media analysts Ampere recently found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth in YouTube traffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. TikTok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.
“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division, told the Guardian in December.
High profile older influencers include Caroline Idiens, a 53-year-old personal trainer from Berkshire who has 2.4m followers on Instagram, and Valerie Mackay, 62, who posts about her life as an older woman as @embracingfifty.
However, their reach still pales in comparison to the likes of Abby Roberts, a 24-year-old makeup influencer and music artist who has 15 million followers on TikTok and reportedly earns £14,000 per post.

US military reports a series of airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria
The U.S. military is reporting a series of strikes against Islamic State group targets in Syria
- Bookmark
The U.S. military on Saturday reported a series of strikes against Islamic State group targets in Syria in retaliation for the December ambush that killed two U.S. soldiers and one American civilian interpreter.
U.S. Central Command said in a statement that American aircraft had conducted 10 strikes against more than 30 IS targets between Feb. 3 and Thursday, hitting weapons storage facilities and other infrastructure.
At least 50 members of IS have been killed or captured, while more than 100 IS targets have been struck since the United States began its strikes after the Dec. 13 ambush, according to Central Command. That attack killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard, and Ayad Mansoor Sakat, the civilian interpreter.
Meanwhile, the Syrian Defense Ministry said Thursday that government forces took control of a base in the east of the country that was run for years by U.S. troops as part of the fight against IS. The Al-Tanf base played a major role after IS declared a caliphate in large parts of Syria and Iraq in 2014.
The U.S. military on Friday completed the transfer of thousands of IS detainees from Syria to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial. The prisoners were sent to Iraq at the request of Baghdad, in a move welcomed by the U.S.-led coalition that had for years fought against IS.

Pots, mop buckets, even babies: Anything can be a curling stone if you get creative
People are turning household items into curling gear
- Bookmark
Dig out your squidgy mop, a few pots and pans — or a robotic vacuum if you have one — and a pair of slippers.
It’s curling time!
Social media has been ablaze with people deploying common household wares to mimic what the world’s top curlers are doing at the Winter Olympics.
“Every four years, it blows up,” American curler Tara Peterson said. “Everyone’s like, ‘We want to do it,’ and then, yes, they get creative with things, so it’s awesome.”
Creative is perhaps an understatement. In one video, two jacketed adults push a baby in a car seat across the ice, chest-bumping in glee. In another, popular Swedish comedian Mans Moller dons a wig a la Isabella Wrana, the Swedish mixed doubles champion, and slides pans into other pans, screaming “CUUUURL!” (Bonus points: He's outside, like the olden days of curling.)
Then there are the Italian nonnas in the country's southern Puglia region pushing a silver pot along a stony courtyard, sweeping with broomsticks. Or the hair salon in the Swedish city of Sundsvall, where a stylist hurls hair products toward her colleague. She screams “Curl!” and looks frustrated when the colleague approaches with a — wait for it — curling iron.
Despite such valiant attempts by the public, curlers say you really do need some specialized equipment to do the sport properly (along with a sheet of pebbled ice).
Put on your curling shoes
You can't use your normal sneakers to go curling. You'll just slip a lot on the ice. Instead, you'll need specialist curling shoes that have grips either built into the soles or those that can be strapped on.
Costs vary but Swedish curler Johanna Heldin said you can pay up to around $700 for them.
Styles vary, too. While most curlers at the Olympics are wearing plain black curling shoes, some have a more casual look — like Taylor Anderson-Heide of the United States, who has donned white, sneaker-style shoes in Cortina.
Sweeping left, sweeping right
Despite sharing the same name, curling brooms and cleaning brooms are very different.
Curling brooms swap carbon fiber for the wooden or plastic rods typical of household brooms. Nylon pads replace straw bristles. Olympic-level models will set you back around $200-$250, Peterson said.
Broom lightness directly correlates to a curler's control over a stone's speed and trajectory. The lighter the broom, the quicker the sweep and the faster the melting of ice pebbles that make up a curling sheet.
In fact, sweeping technology has actually grown so advanced that certain models have been banned from competition. That's what led to the “Broomgate” scandal, which rocked the curling world beginning in 2015.
Curlers began debuting high-tech brooms that gave sweepers so much control over the stone that the skill of the thrower failed to matter. Those kinds of brooms were then barred from competition by World Curling, which now maintains strict parameters on what kinds of brooms are allowed.
Rock ‘n’ roll
The homegrown curling seen on social media makes one thing clear: To the public, anything can be a curling stone.
Even if pots, pans, hair products — and even babies — can do the trick in a pinch, they're nothing like the curling stones on the ice in Cortina.
If you want Olympic-level material, you'll have to look to the uninhabited isle of Ailsa Cragi, located 10 miles (16 kilometers) off the coast of Scotland.
All the stones at these Games are made of the super-dense granite from that isle, manufactured by Kays Curling.
The company has a history with the Olympics dating back to the first winter edition in 1924 in Chamonix, France. The curling competition then was long thought to have been an exhibition event but eventually was confirmed as official. The company has continued to make stones for the Games since curling returned as a medal sport in Nagano 1998.

Drone pilot who flew over firefighters battling huge blaze given four-figure fine in ‘first conviction of its kind’
An amateur drone pilot who piloted the aircraft over a large factory fire as emergency services responded has been sentenced in what police say is the first conviction of its kind.
Christopher McEwen, 46, of Crome Road, Norwich, pleaded guilty to 17 offences including flying a drone close to where an emergency response is ongoing, Norfolk Police said.
A court heard McEwen flew his drone over an industrial fire at a disused factory in Norwich in January last year three times as firefighters, police and ambulance crews were at work, with police releasing footage recorded by the device.
McEwen was ordered to pay a £2,000 fine sentenced at Norwich Magistrates’ Court on Friday (13 February) and to hand over his £3,000 DJI Mavic 3 Pro Cine drone for destruction.

Zelenskyy, NATO chief Rutte discuss PURL initiative, air defense funding
'We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems,' says Ukrainian leader
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in Munich to discuss the funding and expansion of the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, which facilitates the purchase of missiles for air defense systems, his office said.
"Ukraine deeply values every country’s contribution. We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," Zelenskyy said during the meeting held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
He said the discussion touched upon strengthening Ukraine's defense capabilities through joint ventures in Europe and expressed gratitude for the "highly productive" meeting in the Ramstein format, where partners confirmed the allocation of €38 billion in military aid for the war-torn country.
At the annual forum, Zelenskyy termed European "unity" as the "best interceptor" against threats. He also insisted that elections in Ukraine can only take place two months after a ceasefire with Russia is declared.

'Extermination' of Palestinians must stop: African Union chair
The "extermination" of the Palestinian people must end, the chairman of the African Union Commission Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said on Saturday as he launched the organisation's 39th summit.
"In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop," said Youssouf, who was elected to head the institution a year ago.
The Gaza Strip, a small territory surrounded by Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea, has been under a very strict Israeli siege since the start of the war triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on October 7, 2023.
That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.
Since then, at least 71,667 Palestinians have been killed in the small coastal territory by Israel's military campaign, according to Gaza's health ministry.
He also touched on the multiple conflicts raging in Africa.
"From Sudan to the Sahel, to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in Somalia and elsewhere, our people continue to pay the heavy price of instability," Youssouf said.
The summit brings together heads of state from the 55 member states of the African Union over two days.
This year's theme is water sanitation.

'They ignored him like air': military prison conditions under scrutiny after officer’s death on camera

Footage broadcast by Kan 11 last week showing Capt. Tomer Eiges convulsing before his death at Military Prison 10 has renewed scrutiny of conditions at the facility and the treatment of soldiers held there.
Since the video aired, ynet spoke with former and current inmates who served sentences at the military prison, most for relatively minor offenses. Several described instances of humiliation, threats or dismissive treatment by guards, who are themselves soldiers.
Day-to-day supervision of inmates is carried out by young soldiers ages 18 to 21, overseen by officers, some in mandatory service and others career personnel. Military prison guards undergo training at Bahad 13, the Military Police training base, but often arrive at the prison just months after enlistment and, according to former inmates, may lack the mental preparedness required for the responsibility.
Some former prisoners described certain guards as confused, unmotivated or unaware of the gravity of their role.
The prison includes a separate wing for officers and military police, where conditions are somewhat better, as well as other wings that house soldiers according to the severity of their offenses, including an isolation unit. Still, former inmates said soldiers convicted of serious offenses are at times held in the same cell as those jailed for far lesser violations, some of them noncriminal.
The role of a military guard is meant to resemble that of a soldier-commander to the inmates, many of whom are otherwise normative soldiers sentenced for disciplinary or operational violations. Unlike in civilian life, some soldiers are jailed for offenses that might result in a warning or minor disciplinary action outside the military, including cannabis use, absence without leave, insubordination or minor altercations.
According to testimonies, conditions in certain prison companies resemble those of a harsh civilian jail.
Many guards act appropriately and humanely, and no one expects prison to be a pleasant experience. But in such a system, a single failure can have grave consequences.
That was the case on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot, when Eiges — until recently an intelligence officer identified publicly only as “Capt. T. from Military Intelligence” — collapsed and convulsed in his cell. According to the footage aired by Kan 11, no one reviewed security camera feeds or responded promptly to shouts from his cellmates as he struggled.
Even after guards arrived, the video appears to show confusion about how to respond. For an extended period, they did not touch Eiges or evacuate him on a stretcher. The call to the Magen David Adom emergency medical service was reportedly delayed, and he received initial medical treatment only after it was too late.
‘His eyes were screaming’
One of the soldiers interviewed, identified as T., said he spent a total of six months in military prison in 2020 and 2021 — during periods when Eiges was held in Prison 6 and Prison 10. T. described what he called “inappropriate treatment, to put it mildly,” by prison guards.
“They treat you like you’re an animal,” he said. “The tone of voice, the facial expressions, the commands, the humiliations. These aren’t people who committed rape, pedophilia or murder. In most cases, it’s some kid who was absent without leave for 20 days. I lost 10 kilograms in one month there. The food was awful. Inedible.”
T. said he also witnessed the guards’ treatment of Eiges. “In Prison 6, I remember they told us he had AIDS. He was in isolation and you couldn’t see him,” he said.
“Later, in Prison 10, I saw him a few times in the dining hall or during roll calls and heard them call his name. He wasn’t that isolated. Everyone had access to him. Anyone could go sit next to him on a bench. In Prison 6, they spoke to him like he was an animal. I was in prison when he started fainting. They ignored him, like he was air. No one cared.”
During one encounter, T. and Eiges briefly spoke. “After roll call, we went into the dining hall with him. He sat with everyone, but at the end, closest to the commanders. He didn’t talk much,” T. recalled.
“I sat at his table and asked him for something and he asked me for something too. I knew who he was, that he was Prisoner X and that he was special. I asked him a question and he looked at me. His eyes were a little scary, unhealthy. He had a look of death. Like he’d been torn apart inside. His eyes were screaming. He suffered a lot and you could see it.”
T. said he was shocked when he saw the footage of Eiges dying in the military prison. “How can something like this happen?” he asked. “I would steal a lighter and light a cigarette — and the guards would show up within two minutes. They would arrive quickly. They ignored him on a level worse than a boycott.”
In another incident, T. said he was speaking with his mother on the phone when a guard entered and ordered him to end the call. “I wanted to finish the call calmly so I wouldn’t worry my mom — and he screamed at me,” T. recalled.
“So I slammed the phone down and he got angry and threw me into solitary, and there they humiliated me badly. For two hours they made me stand at attention and at ease, and for two hours say ‘Yes, commander,’ while three guards watched me. They put me in a cell with walls smeared with feces and blood. It was unbearably hot and I was drenched in sweat.”
He described “constant yelling,” saying, “They treat you like a rag.” If someone did not listen or obey, he said, “they would line him up in front of the company, shout at him to take his things and throw him into solitary. In Prison 4 and Prison 6, solitary is a cell with a stone bed. In Prison 10, it’s a room about one meter by one and a half meters. You can barely move.”
According to T., “The light is on 24/7 and you’re not allowed to sleep during the day, only from 10 p.m. It’s real abuse of human beings. If you fall asleep, they wake you by screaming and punish you.”
The IDF said in a statement: “Abuse of inmates during their stay in military prison is contrary to the law and IDF regulations and is strictly prohibited. The detention facility is continuously monitored and under commanders’ supervision. Concrete complaints regarding inappropriate conduct by prison staff or inadequate conditions are reviewed by the relevant authorities and addressed accordingly. In cases where suspicion arises of irregular conduct or a criminal offense, investigations are opened by the appropriate investigative unit.”

Ukrainian Engineers Localized Production of Spare Parts for Western Armored Vehicles

Ukrainian engineers are restoring armored vehicles that Western partners had sent for dismantling for spare parts.
This was reported in an interview with Militarnyi by Major Ihor Simutin of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, one of the best specialists in vehicle repair in the Logistics Forces.
According to him, at a certain stage of the war, the US began to saturate the Ukrainian fleet with fourth-category equipment in order to use it for spare parts for the existing fleet. This applies in general to M-ATVs and HMMWVs.
“At the first stage, HMMWVs were taken from US military units in storage, most of which were serviceable. But in order to saturate us more, they began to supply fourth-category vehicles,” Simutin said.
The fourth category of serviceability means that the equipment is formally considered unfit for use. The only category worse than this is the fifth category, which is essentially scrap metal.
However, the repairmen refused to dismantle them and returned such vehicles to service.
“We repaired one of two or three, and then we even got those and continued working on them,” the officer added.
Some of the armored vehicles arrived in Ukraine directly from their previous service locations in arid regions of the world. During technical inspection and flushing of the systems, Ukrainian engineers found specific ‘Iraqi clay’ and fine sand in the tanks and filters.
In addition to sand, some units of equipment had clear signs of having been in water.
In parallel with the repairs, the Armed Forces of Ukraine launched a large-scale program to localize the production of spare parts.
“All types of rubber products, all silent blocks, bushings, dust covers, armored windshields of any class, plastic elements, plastic hoods, metal roofs, metal doors, radiator cores, radiators of any type, repair of all types of engines and automatic transmissions — all of this is localized in the Armed Forces,” Simutin listed.
This was a necessary step to reduce dependence on long delivery times for original components from abroad.

Territorial concessions by Ukraine won't bring peace, Zelensky says in Munich
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

15:49:42 UTC
00:49:42 KST

President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Feb. 14 that territorial concessions by Ukraine would not bring peace, just as the 1938 Munich Agreement did not prevent World War II.
"It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine — just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a greater war," Zelensky said at the Munich Security Conference.
The Munich Agreement was a compromise reached by Nazi Germany, the U.K., France, and Italy in 1938, allowing German dictator Adolf Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland region. The agreement was touted as an effort to prevent a war but did not achieve its goal, with Germany invading Poland the following year.
It has since become the primary historical example of the failures of appeasement — the policy of granting concessions to an aggressor in hopes of achieving peace.
In his speech, Zelensky compared Russian President Vladimir Putin to the "previous Putin, who began dividing Europe" — a reference to Hitler.
As part of the ongoing peace talks between Moscow, Kyiv and Washington, Russia is demanding Ukraine's withdrawal from the parts of Donetsk Oblast that it still controls.
Zelensky has repeatedly stated that territorial concessions are unacceptable to Ukraine. He reiterated on Feb. 14 that concessions are often discussed during peace talks only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia.
Regarding elections, Zelensky said that Ukraine can make changes to its constitution and hold elections if there is a ceasefire. He added that Ukraine could also agree to a truce if Russia holds an election.
He also stressed that Ukraine will do "truly everything" to make these negotiations successful.
"Ukraine wants the result of all these efforts to be real security and real peace. Real peace. Not what came out of Geneva in 2021. Not what the Russians hope for, from this so-called spirit of Anchorage."
Zelensky's comments are a reference to Russian-U.S. talks held in Geneva in 2021 and in Anchorage, Alaska, in 2025.
Zelensky also argued that the absence of Europe at the negotiation table is a "big mistake."
"And it is we — Ukrainians — who are trying to bring Europe fully into the process, so that Europe's interests and voice are taken into account," he added.
In later remarks to journalists, Zelensky said that the U.S. had offered Ukraine a 15-year security guarantee as part of a peace deal, but that Kyiv is looking for guarantees that last at least 20 years.
"Today we have a proposal from the American side for 15 years," he said at a briefing.
We want to have 20 years plus. 30, 50 ... We'll see what the administration and Congress will do."
Following the briefing, Zelensky held private talks with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told the Kyiv Independent that Zelensky's message was "very clear".
"The first thing is that the Ukrainian people are fighting and not giving in. This is most important. And second, that Putin is not changing the goal," Tsahkna said.
Tsahkna added that the Ukrainian people are willing to stop the war, but not under any conditions, as "Putin is actually not willing to change the goals."
"Putin will continue the aggressive behavior, and Ukraine is protecting Europe," he said. "And the other way around, Ukraine is an opportunity for Europe."
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said at the conference that Russia does not seek a peace agreement, as indicated by the appointment of Vladimir Madinsky, a controversial Putin aide and historian, to the Russian negotiating team.
The return of Medinsky signals a potential hardening of Moscow's stance during the negotiations, given his history of uncompromising rhetoric in previous rounds of talks.
During the conference, Zelensky also met Rutte to discuss the funding of the PURL initiative and its further development.
Signed by the U.S. and NATO in July 2025, the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) agreement lays out a mechanism for NATO member states and partners to purchase high-priority equipment for Ukraine.
"We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," Zelenky wrote on X.
Zelensky also thanked for a "highly productive meeting" in the Ramstein format. After the meeting, the allocation of €38 billion in military aid for Ukraine was confirmed, Zelensky said.

Austrian minister deletes post accusing UN rapporteur of hate speech

Austrian minister deletes post accusing UN rapporteur of hate speech
European lawmakers back Francesca Albanese amid disinformation dispute
PARIS
Austrian Foreign Minister Beate Meinl-Reisinger deleted a social media post accusing UN Special Rapporteur on the occupied Palestinian territories Francesca Albanese of spreading hate speech after the claim was based on disinformation that distorted her remarks.
Meinl-Reisinger had posted on the US-based platform X that Albanese “brands Israel wholesale as an ‘enemy of humanity.’” She added: “Criticism of Israel's actions is legitimate, and Austria has always demanded compliance with international law.”
The Austrian minister shared the post following claims by senior politicians in France that Albanese had described “Israel as the common enemy of humanity,” a statement widely criticized as disinformation.
In the same deleted post, Meinl-Reisinger wrote: “Albanese, however, is spreading hate speech. Such language undermines the impartiality and highest standards required of a UN representative. Unfortunately, Ms. Albanese has repeatedly failed to meet these standards.”
Shoura Hashemi, a director of Amnesty International Austria, said on social media that Meinl-Reisinger had deleted the post containing false information about Albanese. Tagging the minister, Hashemi asked, “Where is the apology?” and questioned whether she would take responsibility for what she called a serious mistake.
Czech Republic echoes disinformation
In a statement on social media, the Czech Foreign Ministry said: “Patience has its limits. UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese should resign from her position. Her latest statements, in which she described Israel as a ‘common enemy of humanity,’ are unacceptable and indefensible.”
Over 100 European lawmakers voice support for Albanese
French member of the European Parliament Manon Aubry said on X that “With more than 100 MEPs across Europe, we stand in support of Francesca Albanese, who is the target of a smear campaign by the French government over statements she never made. Rather than attacking the UN Special Rapporteur, France should take action to bring an end to the genocide in Gaza.”
Aubry shared a joint statement signed by more than 100 lawmakers from several countries, including France, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Italy, Sweden and Spain.
The statement backed Albanese and condemned the French government’s call for her resignation, saying it was based on distorted remarks and manipulated content, and reaffirmed support for international law.
French lawmaker presses FM Barrot
Among the signatories, Mathilde Panot, deputy head of the French National Assembly, tagged French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on social media and questioned him over the claims.
Panot said Barrot had made what she described as a serious false statement in the National Assembly about remarks Albanese never made. “Your silence is deafening … When do you intend to offer your apologies?” she wrote.
Disinformation initiated by French lawmaker
The controversy began after French lawmaker Caroline Yadan addressed Barrot in parliament on Feb. 11, claiming that during a forum organized by Al Jazeera in Qatar on Feb. 7, Albanese had described Israel as “the common enemy of humanity.”
“Mr. Minister, will you confirm that France will make its voice heard for Albanese’s immediate removal from any UN post?” Yadan asked.
In response, Barrot told parliament that France “unequivocally condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks” of Albanese, which he said targeted “not the Israeli government … but Israel as a people and as a nation.”
Germany, Austria and Italy also reacted to the claims and criticized Albanese.
In France, two separate criminal complaints were filed against senior politicians for allegedly spreading disinformation by distorting Albanese’s statements.

Russia's behavior 'crazy at every level' – Rutte on war grinder

Russia's behavior 'crazy at every level' – Rutte on war grinder
This is according to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte who spoke during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
"One, we have to realize the Russians are not winning this war," Rutte said, adding that Russia lost 65,000 soldiers in the past two months alone as they made only fairly small gains.
"If there is a dictator in Moscow willing to do that, to get so many officers killed in that war, we have to take that seriously, because this is crazy behavior at every level," believes Rutte.
In this context, Rutte called on Ukraine's partners to make sure Ukraine has all it needs to defend itself, including capabilities to shoot down incoming missiles and also hit targets in Russia's rear.
Commenting on military aid initiatives, including PURL where European nations procure critical US weapons for Ukraine, Rutte also noted bilateral contributions on the part of Europeans and Canada.
At the same time, he urged partners to provide aid in line with Ukraine's real priorities.
"Please use what the Supreme Allied Commander Europe has drawn up together with the Ukrainians, the list of stuff they need, don't give bilateral stuff outside," Rutte said, admitting that such assistance might still look nice and "gives you nice pictures and photographs in the newspapers."
"We know exactly what they need," Rutte noted, recalling that NSATU, the NATO structure set up in Wiesbaden, is doing a good job coordinating such assistance.
As Ukrinform reported, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte rejected any history-related arguments put forward by Russia in an attempt to justify its military aggression against Ukraine.

Russia poisoned Navalny, according to five European countries' scientific findings

00:46:51 KST

The heads of French, British, German, Dutch and Swedish diplomacy said that 'only the Russian state had the means, the motive and the contempt for international law' to carry out this attack.
Five European countries, including the UK, France and Germany, accused Russia on Saturday of poisoning opposition politician Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a rare toxin, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"We know that the Russian state used this deadly toxin to target Navalny, fearing his opposition," the UK Foreign Office said in a joint statement with Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Germany on the eve of the second anniversary of the death of the fierce critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The UK also said it had referred Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday that the analysis of samples taken from Navalny, who died two years ago, "conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine," which is a toxin found in South American dendrobatid frogs.
These countries claimed that "only the Russian state had the means, the motive and the contempt for international law to carry out this attack."
Navalny, who waged a fierce battle against corruption and organised large-scale anti-Kremlin protests as a fierce opponent of President Vladimir Putin, died in the Arctic prison colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that was believed to be politically motivated.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said last year that two independent laboratories had concluded that he had been poisoned shortly before his death. She has repeatedly accused Putin of being responsible for Navalny's death, which the Russian authorities have categorically denied.
Navalny's murder now a scientifically proven fact, says widow
"The assassination of Russian opponent Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison in 2024 is now a scientifically proven fact," his widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said on Saturday, after five European countries claimed that Moscow had used a lethal toxic agent against the Kremlin opponent.
"Two years ago, I came here and said that Vladimir Putin had killed my husband," she said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Of course, I was certain that it was murder... but at the time, they were just words. Today, those words have become scientifically proven facts," she added.
The findings are based on independent laboratory analysis of biological samples that were secretly smuggled out of Russia. A public summary of the full technical report submitted to the OPCW is likely to be released on the OPCW official website.

Protests, poisoning and prison: The life of Alexei Navalny and his opposition to Vladimir Putin
Alexei Navalny was a fierce critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin
- Bookmark
Alexei Navalny, a thorn in the side of the Kremlin and Russia’s most prominent political dissident, died in prison after being poisoned by the Kremlin, the UK and its European allies have said.
Navalny, a fierce critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, died while serving a 19-year jail term in a penal colony around 40 miles of the Arctic Circle in charges widely thought to be politically motivated.
He died in February 2024 after going for a walk at the jail and losing consciousness.
The political agitator has been behind bars since January 2021, when he returned to Moscow after recuperating in Germany from nerve agent poisoning that he blamed on the Kremlin.
Before his arrest, he campaigned against official corruption, organized major anti-Kremlin protests and ran for public office.
Now, Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands have said that he died after being poisoned with a lethal dart frog toxin - a development which has prompted his widow to call for Vladimir Putin to be held “accountable”.
Here's a look at Navalny’s life, political activism and the charges he has faced through the years:
1976
4 June 4 — Navalny is born in a western part of the Moscow region.
1997
Graduates from Russia’s RUDN university, where he majored in law; earns a degree in economics in 2001 while working as a lawyer.
2004
Forms a movement against rampant overdevelopment in Moscow, according to his campaign website.
2008
Gains notoriety for alleging corruption in state-run corporations, such as gas giant Gazprom and oil behemoth Rosneft, through his blogs and other posts.
2010
Founds RosPil, an anti-corruption project run by a team of lawyers that analyzes spending of state agencies and companies, exposing violations and contesting them in court.
2011
December- Participates in mass protests sparked by reports of widespread rigging of Russia’s parliamentary election, and is arrested and jailed for 15 days for “defying a government official.”
2012
March - Following Mr Putin’s reelection and inauguration, mass protests break out in Moscow and elsewhere. Navalny accuses key figures, including then-Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and Chechnya’s strongman leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, of corruption.
July - Russia’s Investigative Committee charges Navalny with embezzlement involving Kirovles, a state-owned timber company in the Kirov region, while acting as an adviser to the local governor. Navalny rejects the allegations as politically motivated.
December — The Investigative Committee launches another probe into alleged embezzlement at a Navalny-linked Russian subsidiary of Yves Rocher, a French cosmetics company. Navalny again says the allegations are politically motivated.
2013
Navalny runs for mayor in Moscow — a move the authorities not only allow but encourage in an attempt to put a veneer of democracy on the race that is designed to boost the profile of the incumbent, Sergei Sobyanin.
July - A court in Kirov convicts Navalny of embezzlement in the Kirovles case, sentencing him to five years in prison. The prosecution petitions to release Navalny from custody pending his appeal, and he resumes his campaign.
September — Official results show Navalny finishes second in the mayor’s race behind Sobyanin, with 27% of the vote, after a successful electoral and fundraising campaign collecting an unprecedented 97.3 million rubles ($2.9 million) from individual supporters.
October — A court hands Navalny a suspended sentence in the Kirovles case. February 2014 — Navalny is placed under house arrest in connection with the Yves Rocher case and banned from using the internet. His blog continues to be updated regularly, presumably by his team, detailing alleged corruption by various Russian officials.
December — Navalny and his brother, Oleg, are found guilty of fraud in the Yves Rocher case. Navalny receives a 3 ½-year suspended sentence, while his brother is handed a prison term. Both appeal to the European Court of Human Rights.
2015
December — Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption releases its first long-form video — a YouTube documentary called “Chaika,” which means “seagull” in Russian but is also the last name of then-Prosecutor General Yury Chaika.
The 44-minute video accuses him of corruption and alleged ties to a notorious criminal group and has piled up 26 million views on YouTube. Chaika and other Russian officials deny the accusations.
2016
February — The European Court of Human Rights rules that Russia violated Navalny’s right to a fair trial in the Kirovles case, ordering the government to pay his legal costs and damages.
November — Russia’s Supreme Court overturns Navalny’s sentence and sends the case back to the original court in the city of Kirov for review.
December — Navalny announces he will run in Russia’s 2018 presidential election.
2017
February — The Kirov court retries Navalny and upholds his five-year suspended sentence from 2013.
March — Navalny releases a YouTube documentary accusing then-Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev of corruption, getting over 7 million views in its first week. A series of anti-graft protests across Russia draw tens of thousands and there are mass arrests. Navalny tours the country to open campaign offices, holds big rallies and is jailed repeatedly for unauthorized demonstrations.
27 April — Unidentified assailants throw a green disinfectant in his face, damaging his right eye. He blames the attack on the Kremlin.
October — The European Court of Human Rights finds Navalny’s fraud conviction in the Yves Rocher case to be “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”
December — Russia’s Central Electoral Commission bars him from running for president over his conviction in the Kirovles case, a move condemned by the EU as casting “serious doubt” on the election.
2019
July — Members of Navalny’s team, along with other opposition activists, are barred from running for Moscow city council, sparking protests that are violently dispersed, with thousands arrested. Navalny’s team responds by promoting the “Smart Voting” strategy, encouraging the election of any candidate except those from the Kremlin’s United Russia party. The strategy works, with the party losing its majority.
2020
Navalny seeks to deploy the Smart Voting strategy during regional elections in September and tours Siberia as part of the effort.
20 August — On a flight from the city of Tomsk, where he was working with local activists, Navalny falls ill and the plane makes an emergency landing in nearby Omsk. Hospitalized in a coma, Navalny’s team suspects he was poisoned.
22 August — A comatose Navalny is flown to a hospital in Berlin.
24 August — German authorities confirm Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-era nerve agent. After he recovers, he blames the Kremlin, an accusation denied by Russian officials.
2021
17 January — After five months in Germany, Navalny is arrested upon his return to Russia, with authorities alleging his recuperation abroad violated the terms of his suspended sentence in the Yves Rocher case. His arrest triggers some of the biggest protests in Russia in years. Thousands are arrested.
2 February — A Moscow court orders Navalny to serve 2 ½ years in prison for his parole violation. While in prison, Navalny stages a three-week hunger strike to protest a lack of medical treatment and sleep deprivation.
June — A Moscow court outlaws Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption and about 40 regional offices as extremist, shutting down his political network. Close associates and team members face prosecution and leave Russia under pressure. Navalny maintains contact with his lawyers and team from prison, and they update his social media accounts.
2022
24 February — Russia invades Ukraine. Navalny condemns the war in social media posts from prison and during his court appearances.
22 March — Navalny is sentenced to an additional nine-year term for embezzlement and contempt of court in a case his supporters rejected as fabricated. He is transferred to a maximum-security prison in Russia’s western Vladimir region.
July — Navalny’s team announces the relaunch of the Anti-Corruption Foundation as an international organization with an advisory board including Francis Fukuyama, Anne Applebaum, and the European Parliament member and former Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt.
Navalny continues to file lawsuits in prison and tries to form a labor union in the facility. In response, penitentiary officials start regularly placing him in solitary confinement over purported disciplinary violations such as failing to properly button his garment or to wash his face at a specified time.
2023
Over 400 Russian doctors sign an open letter to Mr Putin, urging an end to what it calls abuse of Navalny, following reports that he was denied basic medication after getting the flu. His team expresses concern about his health, saying in April he had acute stomach pain and suspected he was being slowly poisoned.
12 March — “Navalny,” a film about the attempt on the opposition leader’s life, wins the Oscar for best documentary feature.
26 April — Appearing on a videolink from prison during a hearing, Navalny says he was facing new extremism and terrorism charges that could keep him behind bars for the rest of his life. He adds sardonically that the charges imply that “I’m conducting terror attacks while sitting in prison.”
19 June — The trial begins in a make-shift courtroom in the Penal Colony No. 6 where Navalny is being held. Soon after it starts, the judge closes the trial for the public and the media despite Navalny’s demand to keep it open.
20 July — The prosecution in its closing arguments asks the court to sentence Navalny to 20 years in prison, the politician's team reports. Navalny says in a subsequent statement that he expects his sentence to be “huge … a Stalinist term,” referring to the Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.
4 August - Navalny is sentenced to 19 years in prison for “extremism”. He was accused by the Russian authorities of creating an extremist community, financing extremist activities and a number of other crimes. According to a message on Telegram, he said: “I am serving a life sentence. Where life is measured by the duration of my life or the life of this regime. The number from verdict is not for me. It is for you.”
December - Navalny was transferred this month to a penal colony north of the Arctic Circle. His lawyer said Russian authorities wanted to isolate Navalny ahead of Russia’s March presidential election.
2024
9 January - Navalny sarcastically heaped praise on the polar conditions at the prison north of the Arctic Circle where he was moved to shortly before Christmas. In a post on the Telegram messaging app Navalny said he had been put in a punishment cell for his attitude as soon as he left quarantine at the so-called “Polar Wolf” prison colony. He said that walking for half an hour in those temperatures you “manage to grow a new nose, new ears and new fingers.”
11 January - Navalny appeared before a Supreme Court judge by video link on Thursday to argue for the right to longer meal breaks and access to more books in prison. Wearing a black prison uniform and standing behind bars in a small, bare room, Navalny, 47, appeared gaunt but spoke animatedly, at length and without notes.
17 January - From his penal camp Navalny, said that Putin’s state would one day crumble along with the post-Soviet elite which he cast as venal, power-hungry and duplicitous. “Lies, lies and nothing but lies. It will collapse and crumble. Putin’s state is not viable. One day we will look at his place and he won’t be there.”
23 January - Navalny was placed in solitary confinement for 10 days for “incorrectly introducing himself” to a guard, his spokesperson said.
16 February - Russia’s prison agency has said that imprisoned opposition leader Navalny has died. He was 47.

Gaza administration committee demands full powers to begin transition
The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza on Saturday called for full administrative, civil and policing powers to enable it to carry out its duties in the besieged enclave "efficiently and independently", as it seeks to assume control during a fragile transitional phase.
In a statement, the committee said recent declarations from within Gaza, including from the Hamas-led government, expressing readiness to hand over management of all public institutions and facilities were "a step in the interest" of the people of Gaza.
The committee said this would pave the way for it to assume full responsibility for overseeing the transitional period.
It described the "declaration of readiness for an orderly transition" as a “pivotal milestone to begin exercising its duties as a transitional administration of the Strip, and a real opportunity to halt humanitarian deterioration and preserve the resilience of citizens who have suffered immense pain throughout the past period".
Various government sectors in Gaza have previously issued statements affirming their readiness to transfer powers. However, the committee faces significant obstacles, including differing interpretations of its mandate and what Palestinian sources describe as Israel’s disregard for the body.
Israel has so far not allowed the committee to enter Gaza and it is operating from Cairo.
"The priority at this stage is to ensure the flow of aid without obstacles, launch the reconstruction process, and create the necessary conditions to strengthen the unity of our people," the committee said.
It stressed that this path must be based on "clear and specific understandings characterised by transparency, enforceability and follow-up", in line with the 20-point plan presented by US President Donald Trump and UN Security Council Resolution 2803.
The committee warned that it cannot effectively fulfil its responsibilities unless it is granted "the full administrative and civil powers necessary to perform its tasks in addition to policing duties".
"Responsibility requires genuine empowerment that enables [the committee] to work efficiently and independently" the statement said, adding that such steps would open the door to serious international support for reconstruction, pave the way for a full Israeli withdrawal, and help restore normal daily life.
The committee called on mediators and all concerned parties to accelerate the resolution of outstanding issues "without delay", saying: "Our people cannot endure further postponement, and the stage requires immediate action to ensure an orderly and reliable transition."
Separately, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for the removal of "all obstacles" imposed by Israel on implementing the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire agreement.
In a speech delivered on his behalf by Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa at the 39th African Union summit in Addis Ababa, Abbas said:
"We stress the necessity of removing all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation to the implementation of arrangements related to the second phase of the agreement, including the work of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which will temporarily manage the Strip."
The committee was formed under a plan proposed by US President Donald Trump aimed at restructuring governance in Gaza and replacing the Hamas-led administration that has overseen the enclave for years.
Its formation was announced in mid-January in Cairo and it is led by Ali Shaath, a former minister in the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority.
Palestinian factional sources say Israel has not provided the financial support required for the committee to assume its responsibilities, as well as denying it entry into Gaza.
A conference planned by Trump later this month is expected to address outstanding issues and could pave the way for the committee’s arrival in Gaza and the commencement of its duties, according to the same sources.

Ukraine capable of producing faster and more efficiently than Europe — Danish PM
Europe has problems with its industrial base, as the speed does not match the production lines, Ukraine is able to produce faster and better, despite being in a state of war, said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.
"We have a transatlantic problem with our industrial base. I mean, some of the capabilities that we have decided to invest in when it comes to the Arctic region cannot be provided to the USA because the speed simply does not match the production lines. We have exactly the same problem in Europe," Frederiksen said during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference.
"In Ukraine, it [the problem] does not exist. So, in Ukraine, they are able to produce faster and better than the rest of us, even despite the fact that they are at war. This is not only because they are really smart people, by the way, they are, and not only because they received money from us and other partners, but also because we work too slowly," she noted.
Frederiksen also noted that Putin does not want peace and will continue the war in Ukraine or "try to continue it somewhere else."

STOCKHOLM, February 14. /TASS/. Finland would be making another biggest mistake after joining NATO if it allowed nuclear weapons to be stationed on its territory, believes Armando Mema, a member of the Finnish national-conservative party Freedom League.
"Normalizing speculations about nuclear issues in Finland is becoming the new norm. The biggest mistake was joining NATO, the second biggest mistake would be letting nuclear weapons into Finland," the politician wrote on his social media page. The statement followed a report by Yle that Finland, according to sources, is participating in the European debate on nuclear deterrence.
"We reject this idea as dangerous and counterproductive for the country's future," Mema concluded.

US senator defends NATO, urges tougher pressure on Russia
'The American people know that our security and our future lies with NATO and lies with this community of shared principles,' says Democrat Chris Coons
WASHINGTON
US Sen. Chris Coons said Saturday that strong American support for NATO and collective defense remains intact, pushing back against suggestions that the US is reconsidering its commitment to European allies.
Speaking at a panel discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference alongside Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Coons addressed concerns about US rhetoric on Greenland – a Danish territory – and transatlantic relations.
"You asked me to defend the American position. I will tell you only 17% of Americans want to, in any way, be involved in threatening Greenland. The vast majority of Americans saw this as a foolish gambit," said Coons, a Democrat, referring to President Donald Trump’s controversial push for the US to acquire Greenland.
Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stressed that NATO remains “overwhelmingly popular” with the American public.
He noted that Congress has approved significant funding for NATO, collective defense initiatives, and support for Ukraine.
"We should do more, and we will, because it remains popular with the American people," he said.
"The American people know that our security and our future lies with NATO and lies with this community of shared principles."
Asked is there a chance that NATO will emerge stronger from the end of Trump's second term than it was before, Coons said he hopes so, "and will work for it to be so."
Trump has been broadly dismissive of the NATO alliance, a position that has alarmed the US foreign policy establishment, Democrats, and the public at large.
'Europe should be seeking energy options where it can, but not from Russia'
Turning to energy policy and the war in Ukraine, Coons urged European nations to diversify energy supplies away from Russia.
"I think Europe should be seeking energy options where it can, but not from Russia. What is continuing to fund and fuel literally (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's murderous war machine is those countries that continue to buy Russian oil and gas, the single largest buyer being China," he said.
Coons welcomed recent sanctions imposed by Trump on two of Russia’s largest oil companies and efforts to expand economic pressure, saying such measures are broadly supported in the US Congress.
“It’s the pressure on Putin that is needed to move the war of aggression against Ukraine towards a just and sustainable resolution,” Coons said.
The senator also accused Trump of dedicating "as much time" to pushing Ukraine to make concessions to end the war.
"I am very grateful that our European partners have stepped up to provide the resources, the weaponry, much of which bought from the United States. But we have to balance this equation and push Putin to raise the costs of this war for him, or he will not conclude (it). And we have to achieve (this) through negotiations," he said.

Hariri signals Future Movement's return to Lebanon elections
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, one of the country's best-known politicians, indicated on Saturday that his party would contest upcoming elections, four years after he stepped back from public office.
In a speech marking the 21st anniversary of the assassination of his father Rafik, who was also prime minister, Saad told supporters in Beirut that others would “hear our voice, and count our votes” when elections take place.
It was unclear whether Hariri plans to run himself, although his popularity amongst Lebanon's Sunni Muslims remains strong. Huge masses gathered in Beirut’s Martyrs Square waving his party's flag and chanting his name. “You're not a few, and you never were,” Hariri told his supporters.
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri said on Friday that elections will be held as scheduled on May 10, despite calls from some politicians to postpone the vote, due in part to security concerns in southern Lebanon, where Israel has carried out air strikes targeting group Hezbollah.
Hariri, a three-time former premier, stepped back from politics in 2022 and blocked his Future Movement from running in a parliamentary vote that year, citing reasons including Iran's influence in the country - an indirect reference to Hezbollah.
The Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah had played a growing role in Lebanon's internal politics, but was severely weakened after a 2024 conflict with Israel. It is now under U.S.-backed pressure to disarm since a ceasefire in late 2024.
Before stepping back from politics, Hariri led one of parliament's biggest factions after inheriting his father's mantle.
His Future Movement's absence from Lebanon's 2022 parliamentary election resulted in fractured Sunni Muslim representation in parliament, where seats are divided according to a sectarian quota system.

'Hansa Arrangement': Norway, Germany sign defense pact to deepen military cooperation
Deal covers five key areas: space-based surveillance, maritime security, land operations, rapid reinforcement capabilities and defense industry cooperation
ISTANBUL
Norway and Germany signed a wide-ranging defense agreement on Saturday aimed at strengthening European security cooperation within NATO.
The accord, dubbed the “Hansa Arrangement,” was signed by Norwegian Defense Minister Tore O. Sandvik and his German counterpart Boris Pistorius on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Strong European cooperation is essential to fulfilling NATO’s burden-sharing commitments, where Europe must assume a greater share of responsibility for its own security," said Sandik.
Germany, he added, "is one of Norway’s most important allies in Europe and our key partner in the EU. Now, we are taking our close and robust cooperation a step further."
The deal covers five key areas: space-based surveillance, maritime security, land warfare, rapid reinforcement capabilities and defense industry cooperation.
European leaders have increasingly emphasized defense autonomy in recent months amid signals from Washington urging allies to shoulder more of the security burden.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a speech at the conference that Washington seeks “to revive old friendships,” while European officials stress stronger regional capabilities.
Norway’s parliament, Stortinget, recently approved the acquisition of two additional submarines, bringing the total to six. Once delivered, Norway and Germany will each operate six identical 212CD submarines. The countries are also collaborating on the development of next-generation long-range maritime missiles (3SM).
Meanwhile, Germany’s forces regularly train and exercise in Norway, including during the upcoming winter exercise Cold Response 26.
Separately, Oslo has ordered 54 German-made Leopard 2 tanks, some of which will be produced in Norway, while Berlin has purchased Norwegian-developed JSM missiles worth about 6.5 billion kroner (over $683 million) for its F-35 fighter jets.
The partnership also extends into space cooperation. Norway’s Andoya Spaceport and German aerospace technology are expected to play a central role in plans to develop Europe’s first commercial satellite launch base.

Workers halt production at Belgian arms factory over Israeli officer visit

Some workers at Belgium’s major weapons manufacturer FN Herstal staged a spontaneous strike to protest the presence of an Israeli army officer who was part of a visiting delegation of defense attaches.
The walkout took place on Friday afternoon at the factory in Herstal and was initiated by members linked to the socialist trade union FGTB, the company confirmed, according to Belgian outlet L-Post cited by regional media.
Dyab Abou Jahjah, general director of the Brussels-based Hind Rajab Foundation, said on US social media company X that employees “stopped the machines and walked out after learning that an Israeli military officer had been received at the factory,” calling the action “a clear message” against arms-industry complicity during the Gaza war.
"If it is confirmed that the officer present was the Israeli military attaché in Belgium, then we are speaking about Moshe Tetro — implicated in attacks on hospitals and in managing the policy of hunger imposed on Gaza," he said.
Separately, Flemish public broadcaster VRT NWS reported that the Hind Rajab Foundation filed a complaint with prosecutors at the International Criminal Court in The Hague against the Israeli military attache in Brussels.
Abou Jahjah also urged Belgian authorities to expel the attache, saying the organization had already submitted documentation to the ICC in December 2024 concerning his alleged role.

2 Washington Post writers at the Olympics despite being laid off, say it was important to be there
A pair of Washington Post sports writers are reporting for the newspaper for the final time from the Winter Olympics
- Bookmark
Washington Post columnist Barry Svrluga was reporting from his first Winter Olympics when Lindsey Vonn left her hospital bed after a crash and returned to compete days later at the 2006 Turin Games.
He is back in Italy two decades later at the Milan Cortina Games and was there again to write about it when Vonn ended up back in the hospital following another crash. Even though he’s losing his job.
The Post announced two days before the Olympics opened last week that it was eliminating its sports section while laying off a third of its staff. Svrluga said the newspaper originally planned to send 14 staff members to these Games.
With air tickets and accommodation already paid for, Svrluga is one of four of the paper’s journalists who decided to still come: He is in Cortina, Rick Maese is in Bormio, and Les Carpenter and national staffer Robert Samuels are in Milan.
“They can take away our section,” Svrluga said, “but in a way, they can’t take away our spirit.”
Of the four, Svrluga and Carpenter are being laid off. They came to their final assignment anyway.
“I wanted to be occupied,” said Svrluga, who is at his 12th Games. “I love covering the Olympics. … I had Lindsey injured in Sestriere and then had her gold (Vancouver, 2010) and I’ve had every one of her Olympic races, whether they were successes or not. Same with (Mikaela) Shiffrin.”
The first Olympics that Svrluga worked at was the 2004 Athens Summer Games and he was immediately struck by the way colleagues at the paper collaborated at such a big event.
“It felt like a team sport for us and that benefited the section and the paper,” Svrluga said. “What we’re trying to do here is remind people — readers and decision makers — that these are a lot of committed people who were doing things for the right reasons."
Carpenter, the Post’s Olympics writer, is at his eighth Games. He's been covering figure skating, speedskating and hockey.
“The Post sports department always had such a great connection with its readers. I felt I had to stay to tell the story of this Olympics for them,” Carpenter said. “It’s what I’d want as a reader. If this is the end for Post sports, let’s give our most loyal readers our best.”
Shiffrin trusted Svrluga with some personal news
Svrluga gave his readers — and the wider skiing community — reason for pause even before he got to Cortina.
An extensive pre-Games interview with Shiffrin and her mother and coach, Eileen, turned into much more than an Olympic preview story when they revealed to Svrluga why Eileen was absent at the start of this World Cup season: She had been diagnosed with cancer and faced six weeks of treatments.
“This was a very personal situation,” Svrluga said. “I’m thankful for them that they trusted me with the information. It’s their story to tell.”
Staff reductions are ‘tragic for readers’
Changes across the industry have resulted in fewer American reporters attending events like the Olympics.
“That’s tragic for readers,” Svrluga said, noting how the extra space in the reporters’ interview areas at the finish lines are “great for logistics and sad for the business.”
Some of the people who Svrluga has reported on at the Olympics have reached out to him after word spread about the cuts at the Post. It's happened back in Washington, too, he said.
“People who have won World Series, people who own teams. I’ve been there 22 years, so you build relationships over time, even with people you battle with a little bit or you write something they don’t like. It’s still a human element to it," Svrluga said. "So I’ve heard from more people than I can count.”
But, Svrluga added, “You don’t want to be the story. You want to cover the story.”
The Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the layoffs painful but necessary.
“You could argue maybe we’re in this position because we didn’t adapt or see what is coming next,” Svrluga said. “It’s obvious people get their news in different ways now. I’m ‘old school’ in one regard. … I hope that the people who are in their 20s and early 30s, like when I first went to the Olympics, are figuring out whatever’s next. I would love for it to include written storytelling, because that’s what I like to do.”
A final story and ‘the red wine will flow’
Eliminating the Post sports section was a sharp blow since the department has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, including the likes of John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser.
Svrluga’s final column from these Games will mark his final story for the Post. In the meantime, he’s going to try and enjoy the Olympics — and being in Italy — more than he usually does while on assignment.
“The red wine,” he said, “will flow.”

Rutte praises resilience of Ukrainian civilians amid Russian attacks
Rutte spoke during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference, an Ukrinform correspondent reports.
Telling the audience of his latest visit to Ukraine, he said Russia's brutal strikes on critical infrastructure seem to be making Ukrainians "almost stronger" despite all difficulties they are facing in the winter cold.
Recalling his meeting with the Ukrainians whom the Russians had kept for weeks in the basement of a village in Chernihiv region at the time of the occupation in 2022, he said the face of the Russians is "the lack of decency and humanity."
The Ukrainians "told me they are resilient, we'll never give in, but tell this story to other people, what the Russians did here."
He also recalled the time he was shown Patron, a dog helping a Ukrainian bomb squad sniff out explosives in the rubble.
"The untold story of this war is the heroes - from the firefighters, ambulance services and all these people, and of course, soldiers, who are amazing, but sometimes we forget about the police and the firefighters and all the other civilian people who are helping," said the NATO secretary general.
As Ukrinform reported, President Volodymyr Zelensky stated that the longer the war continues, the more dangerous the evolution of Russian leader Vladimir Putin becomes.

Spain calls nuclear rearmament 'historic error,' says powers forgetting past lessons
'Nuclear powers have forgotten the lessons of the past, and they are expanding their nuclear arsenals once again,' Pedro Sanchez says at Munich Security Conference
LONDON
By expanding their arsenals once again, the nuclear powers are forgetting "lessons of the past," Spain’s prime minister warned Saturday, calling this a "historical error."
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Pedro Sanchez expressed concern over nuclear rearmament and called on nuclear powers to sign a new START treaty after the last one expired on Feb. 5, leaving the US and Russia’s strategic arsenals with no binding restraints.
"The world is becoming more unstable, and we Europeans must strengthen our defense capabilities," said Sanchez.
He argued, however, that nuclear rearmament is not the right way to ensure sovereignty, territorial integrity, or security.
"Treaties were signed and nuclear arsenals were dramatically reduced, but now the tide is turning," he warned.
Sanchez added: "Nuclear powers have forgotten the lessons of the past, and they are expanding their nuclear arsenals once again."
Saying that together, the nuclear powers are spending more than $11 million every single hour on their arsenals, he cited experts suggesting that the US alone will invest $946 billion in nukes over the next decade, a sum big "enough to eradicate extreme global poverty."
"In my view, this is a mistake, a historical error that we cannot commit again, particularly not today, with artificial intelligence casting a shadow of uncertainty over the entire world."
Sanchez called on nuclear nations to "stop nuclear rearmament, sit down, negotiate and sign a new START treaty" to ensure continuity of the one that just expired.
"We need to stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, we need to strengthen our deterrence capabilities, but let us do it in a coordinated and targeted way that we can control," he added.

US carried out strikes in Syria against ISIS targets: CENTCOM
Central Command forces targeted ISIS infrastructure and weapons storage facilities on Feb. 3-12, says US Central Command
WASHINGTON
The US Central Command (CENTCOM) said that on Feb. 3-12 its forces carried out 10 strikes against more than 30 ISIS (Daesh) targets in Syria.
The strikes targeted ISIS infrastructure and weapons storage facilities with precision munitions delivered by fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and unmanned aircraft, CENTCOM said in a Saturday statement.
The latest round of strikes follows five earlier operations conducted by CENTCOM forces from Jan. 27 through Feb. 2.
The campaign is part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, launched in response to a Dec. 13 ISIS ambush in the historic city of Palmyra, Syria. The attack targeted US and Syrian partner forces and resulted in the deaths of two US service members and an American interpreter.

Quote: "There were three attacks on Azerbaijan's energy infrastructure in Ukraine and there were also three attacks on Azerbaijan's embassy in Ukraine. After the first attack we could assume it was accidental and we passed all the coordinates of Azerbaijan's diplomatic missions to our Russian colleagues, including the consular section, our cultural centres and everything else. Despite this, two more attacks took place. So this was a deliberate attack on Azerbaijan's diplomatic mission."
Details: Aliyev said his government had taken "all necessary diplomatic steps". He said "special" statements were issued, the ambassador was informed and a diplomatic note was submitted.
Quote: "We're acting exclusively through diplomatic channels. We cannot do anything else."
More details: Aliyev said that Russia's actions "are of course regarded as an unfriendly step towards Azerbaijan".

Olympic curling committee issues warning after cheating accusations

Olympic curling committee issues warning after Sweden accuses Canada of cheating in curse-filled fight
The Olympic curling committee issued a warning after a heated fight filled with cheating allegations and audible curse words overshadowed a feisty match between Sweden and Canada.
Canada's Marc Kennedy got offended Friday evening when he was accused by Swedish rival Oskar Eriksson of "double touching" — essentially, touching the rock again after initially releasing it down the sheet of ice — during Canada's 8-6 win in round-robin play late Friday.
Kennedy repeatedly used expletives to deny he broke any rules. The match came to a brief standstill as fingers were pointed and Kennedy argued with members of the Swedish team across the ice.
The World Curling Committee said in a Saturday statement that they spoke with the Canadian officials to issue a verbal warning regarding the language used by a Canadian men's player during the game. During the meeting, officials said they made it clear that inappropriate language would be met with additional sanctions.
The governing body added that starting from Saturday's afternoon session - which sees both Canada and Sweden in action - two officials will move to observing deliveries across the four matches.
The 44-year-old Kennedy said after the altercation, "I don't like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games."
"So," he added, "I told him where to stick it. Because we're the wrong team to do that to."
Eriksson said he simply wanted everyone to "play by the same rules."
"We want a game that is as sportsmanlike, honest and clean as possible," he said, "so we call it out as soon as I see that the Canadian No. 2 is, in my eyes, there poking the stone."
The rules state that a stone must be delivered using the handle that sits on top of the rock and that it must be released from the hand before it reaches the hog line. At the Olympics, that is the thick green line at each end.
Replays appeared to show Kennedy releasing the stone using the handle, then touching it again — this time on the granite, not the handle — with an outstretched finger as it approached the hog line, which isn't allowed in the rules.
In the early ends of the match, Sweden notified the officials of their complaints. An official then remained at the hog line for three ends to monitor Canada's curlers and no violations were recorded, World Curling confirmed in its statement on Saturday.
Curling does not use video replays to review game decisions.
"Decisions made during a game are final," World Curling said.

European nations say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with dart frog toxin

Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
Russia poisoned Alexei Navalny with dart frog toxin, European nations say
LONDON (AP) — Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the U.K., France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis in European labs of samples taken from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” The neurotoxin secreted by dart frogs in South America is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
A joint statement said: “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.”
The five countries said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. There was no immediate comment from the organization.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. “By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X that the poisoning of Navalny shows “that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people in order to remain in power.”
The European nations’ assessment came as Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany, and just before the second anniversary of Navalny’s death.
She said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died. She has repeatedly blamed Putin for her husband’s death. Russian officials have vehemently denied the accusation.
Navalnaya said Saturday that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof.”
“Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,” she wrote on She said Putin was “a murderer” who “must be held accountable.”
Russian authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.
European officials said they had a high degree of confidence in the assessment that Navalny died from epibatidine poisoning. Asked why the results had taken so long, German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said that it had been “a complicated process.”
Wadephul said “no one but Putin’s henchmen will be able to say in detail what happened on Feb. 16, 2024, in the Russian penal colony. But it is clear that Russian authorities had the possibility, the motive and the means to administer the poison to Navalny.”
Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020, with a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.
The U.K. has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It accuses the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. Skripal and his daughter became seriously ill, and a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, died after she came across a discarded bottle with traces of the nerve agent.
A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin.”
The Kremlin has denied involvement. Russia also denied poisoning Alexander Litvinenko, a former Russian agent turned Kremlin critic who died in London in 2006, after ingesting the radioactive isotope polonium-210. A British inquiry concluded that two Russian agents killed Litvinenko, and Putin had “probably approved” the operation.

MSF suspends some work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital due to presence of armed men

MSF suspends some work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital due to presence of armed men
MSF suspends some work at Gaza’s Nasser Hospital due to presence of armed men
TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — Doctors Without Borders has announced the suspension of some operations at one of Gaza ‘s largest functioning hospitals after patients and staff reported seeing armed, masked men roaming parts of the building.
Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis is one of the territory’s few functioning hospitals. Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated there daily, and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners released by Israel in exchange for Israeli hostages as part of the current ceasefire deal.
It was a rare announcement by an international organization about the presence of armed men in a medical facility in Gaza since the war began over two years ago.
The aid group also known by its acronym MSF said in a statement all its noncritical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to security breaches that posed “serious” threats to its teams and patients. MSF said there had been an increase in patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the compound since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire was reached.
“MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” it said.
While the suspension occurred in January, it was first disclosed in MSF’s “frequently asked questions” section on its website. It’s unclear when the post was made, but the site said it was updated Feb. 11.
Attacks on health facilities
MSF said it wasn’t able to indicate the armed men’s affiliation. It said it had expressed concern to the “relevant” authorities, without elaborating, stressing that hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces. It said its concerns were heightened by previous, deliberate Israeli attacks on health facilities.
Throughout the war, which began with the Hamas-led attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has repeatedly struck hospitals, including Nasser, accusing the militant group of operating in or around them. Hamas security men often have been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas.
Some hostages released from Gaza have said they spent time during captivity in a hospital.
While Hamas remains the dominant force in areas not under Israeli control, including Nasser Hospital, other armed groups have mushroomed across Gaza as a result of the war, including groups backed by Israel’s army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip.
Nasser Hospital staff say that in recent months it has been repeatedly attacked by masked, armed men and militias, despite police presence there.
Police to be deployed
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry, which oversees police in Gaza, said officers would be deployed to secure hospitals and rid them of armed presence. It said it was implementing stricter measures to ensure patients’ safety.
While international law gives hospitals special protections during war, they can lose this immunity if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Still, there must be plenty of warning to allow the evacuation of staff and patients before any operations take place. If harm to civilians from an attack is disproportionate to the military objective, it is illegal under international law.
Aid groups and rights organizations say Israel has decimated Gaza’s health system, forcing most hospitals to shut down while heavily damaging others. During the war, Israeli forces raided a number of hospitals, detaining hundreds of staff.
Israel also has targeted the police in Gaza.
A weakened medical system
MSF said it will continue supporting critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical departments for patients with traumatic or burn injuries. However, it is ending support to the pediatrics and maternity wards, including the neonatal intensive care unit. It has also indefinitely suspended its outpatient consultations for 3D burn screening and mental health, as well as other services.
Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at Gaza’s Health Ministry, said MSF’s suspension would have a significant impact as hundreds of patients are admitted to the maternity and burn wards daily. He said the ministry would take over maternity patient care, but said burn victims won’t have many options.
Israel has been cracking down on aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including MSF. The group is one of more than three dozen that Israel has banned from operating in the strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.
MSF says Israel’s decision will have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals and operates two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers, helping children with severe malnutrition.
The toll of war
While the heaviest fighting has subsided, the fragile ceasefire has been seen almost daily Israeli fire. Israeli forces have carried out repeated airstrikes and frequently fire on Palestinians near military-held zones, killing 591 Palestinians since the ceasefire took effect, according to Gaza health officials.
Israel’s military on Saturday said its troops “eliminated” a person in northern Gaza who crossed the line dividing the territory and approached them. Later in the day, the military said its troops “eliminated” two armed people in northern Gaza who had taken cover under debris on the Israeli-controlled side of the line near soldiers.
Gaza’s Health Ministry said the overall Palestinian death toll from the war is at least 72,051.
The ministry, part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by U.N. agencies and independent experts. It does not give a breakdown of civilians and militants. Militants have carried out shooting attacks on troops, and Israel says its strikes are in response to that and other violations. Four Israeli soldiers have been killed.

Son of Iran's last shah urges US military intervention in Iran
Unknown

00:21:54 KST

Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Saturday said U.S. military intervention in Iran could save lives and urged President Donald Trump's administration not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran's clerical rulers on a nuclear deal.
The exiled son of Iran's toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian government was on the brink of collapse and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall. Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
"It's a matter of time. We are hoping that this attack will expedite the process and the people can be finally back in the streets and take it all the way to the ultimate regime's downfall," said Pahlavi, who is based in the United States and has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A campaign of mass arrests and intimidation has led to the arrests of thousands as Iranian authorities seek to deter further protests after last month's crackdown on the bloodiest unrest since 1979. The protests began on December 28 as a modest demonstration in Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.
Trump has questioned level of support for Pahlavi
Iran's opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions - including the monarchists who back Pahlavi - and appears to have little organized presence inside the Islamic Republic. In an interview with Reuters last month, Trump sounded skeptical about the level of Pahlavi's support inside Iran.
The Trump administration has engaged with Iran to see if a nuclear deal can be struck as Washington amassed military forces in the region. U.S. and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week and further talks in the coming week are expected.
"People are hoping that at some point the decision will be made that there's no use, there's no point, we're not going to get anywhere with negotiations. Therefore, that's time for the United States to intervene and do what President Trump promised he will do, to have the people's back," Pahlavi said.
"Intervention is a way to save lives," he added. On Friday, in a speech to U.S. troops in North Carolina, Trump said Iran has been difficult in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully.
Two U.S. officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told Reuters on Friday that the U.S. military was preparing for the possibility of a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran if Trump ordered an attack.

‘I was sacrificed on the altar of vice’: Gisele Pelicot describes impact of abuse in first televised interview
French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot has described the impact of the horrific abuse suffered at the hands of her former husband and the men he invited to sexually assault her, in her first televised interview.
In December 2024, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping Ms Pelicot, and for allowing other men to assault her while she was unconscious.
In an interview with Newsnight to be broadcast tomorrow night (15 Feb), Gisele Pelicot described the case as “a descent into hell”, telling presenter Victoria Derbyshire: “I was truly sacrificed on the altar of vice. I was a martyred woman thrown as prey to all these individuals.”
Explaining one of the men who assaulted her was HIV-positive, she added: “It was sheer luck that I didn’t contract the virus. Because of that too, I feel someone up there protected me, because I really am a survivor.”

World artists back Palestine rapporteur Francesca Albanese despite criticism
Albanese faces calls from France and Germany to step down over remarks in which she criticised ‘most of the world’ for enabling Israel’s ‘genocide’ in Gaza.
Over a hundred top figures from the world of entertainment signed an open letter on Saturday in support of UN Palestinian human rights expert Francesca Albanese, who faces calls to resign over comments about the war in Gaza.
France and Germany have called for Albanese to step down over remarks last weekend in which she referred to a “common enemy of humanity” after criticising “most of the world” and the media for enabling Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza.
Critics and Israel have accused the UN Special Rapporteur of referring to Israel as a “common enemy”, while Albanese has denounced this as a “manipulation” and “completely false”.
In a letter organised by the Artists for Palestine group and shared with journalists, over 100 cultural figures backed Albanese, including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories “offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist,” the letter says.
“There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means,” it concludes.
Published on the website of Artists for Palestine, it also reproduces the full remarks by Albanese, who was speaking via videoconference at a forum in Doha last Saturday organised by the Al Jazeera TV network.

US launches airstrikes on dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria

The US military conducted 10 strikes on more than 30 Islamic State targets in Syria between 3 and 12 February as part of a campaign against the extremist group in Iraq and Syria.
US Central Command (Centcom) said in a statement on Saturday that the US had struck IS infrastructure and weapons storage targets.
The attacks formed part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, in which the US killed or captured what it said were IS fighters and hit more than 100 IS targets. The campaign began after a member of Syria’s general security forces affiliated with IS ambushed US and Syrian forces in the city of Palmyra, killing two US soldiers and an interpreter, and wounding three members of the Syrian government forces.
The US has led the international coalition to defeat IS in Syria and Iraq since 2014, partnering with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to defeat the radical group. In November, Syria officially joined the coalition and Washington has since turned towards Damascus as its principal anti-IS ally.
Analysts warn that the group has been trying to reconstitute itself since the fall of Assad in December 2024, exploiting the security vacuum and weapons that flooded the country when Assad’s soldiers abandoned their posts.
On Saturday, the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, praised Damascus for its participation in the anti-IS coalition, welcoming the Syrian government’s commitment to fully cooperate with the US and the global coalition.
The US has steadily been evacuating male detainees accused of being IS fighters out of north-east Syria over the past month, announcing on Friday it had successfully transported 5,700 detainees to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial. The US military is reducing its troop presence in Syria, evacuating its base in al-Tanf this week after nearly a decade there.
Damascus took control of key IS prisons and camps last month as part of its offensive against the SDF, in which the SDF lost 80% of its territory. Among the camps Damascus now controls is al-Hawl camp, which previously held about 25,000 family members of suspected IS fighters.
Humanitarians said on Friday that almost the entire foreigners’ annexe of the camp, which had held about 6,000 women and children from 42 different countries, had been emptied over the past month. It is unclear where the foreign residents went or who removed them from the camp.

European reaction to Rubio's speech on transatlantic ties at Munich Security Conference
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BERLIN, Feb 14 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cast the United States as the "child of Europe" in a message of unity on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference, offering some reassurance as well as more criticism to allies after a year of strained ties.
This is the European reaction to his keynote speech at the annual gathering of political and military leaders:
EU COMMISSION CHIEF URSULA VON DER LEYEN
"I was very much reassured by the speech of the Secretary of State. We know him. He's a good friend, a strong ally ... and this was, for me, very reassuring to listen to him. We know that in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics. But the Secretary of State was very clear. He said 'We want strong Europe in the Alliance', and this is what we are working for intensively in the European Union."
FRENCH FOREIGN MINISTER JEAN-NOEL BARROT
"Referring to (our) common legacy can only be welcomed with applause in Europe. The second thing that Secretary Rubio mentioned that I think is also very important and that is very consistent with the view of European countries is that some challenges cannot be addressed by a single nation, as powerful and as rich as it may be ...
"Is it going to change our strategy? Of course not. Because, you know, what we're hearing today, we heard already in the past, and we heard this from Democratic administrations, Republican administrations. Build a strong and independent Europe. We will deliver a strong and independent Europe. Independent, of course, irrespective of the speeches that we hear at the Munich Security Conference, however right they may be."
GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER JOHANN WADEPHUL
"This was the speech I expected from Secretary Rubio. We know that he is a true partner ... I would say (it was) a very clear message from Secretary Rubio that we have...to stay and stick to our international rules-based order, which is, of course, in first line the United Nations. This is our Board of Peace. And we want to keep it like that. We have, of course, to reform it. We have to make it more effective, as Rubio said this morning.
"And the most important sentence for me was 'let's do it again'. So he was looking forward. This is good."
FINNISH FOREIGN MINISTER ELINA VALTONEN
"I am very satisfied with the tone and I also think that the content was largely what we here in Europe expected. He said so many times, that we must stand together and be strong for our values. We are, of course, very strongly committed to the international community and to international law." REUTERS

Russia poisoned opposition politician Alexei Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday.
The five governments made the announcement at the Munich Security Conference, two years after news broke during the same event of the pro-democracy campaigner’s death in a Russian prison.
Analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed” the presence of a toxin called epibatidine, which is found in poison dart frogs in South America and could only have been deployed by Russia, the countries said in a joint statement.

Zelenskyy says ‘unity’ in Europe, Euro-Atlantic community ‘best interceptor’ against Russia
In speech at Munich Security Conference, Ukraine’s president reaffirms need for ‘real, strong’ security guarantees for his country, Europe
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday termed “unity” in Europe and in the Euro-Atlantic community as the “best interceptor” against Russia.
In a speech at a panel discussion on day two of the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskyy argued there is “no country in Europe that could rely only on its own technology and money to defend itself,” and that “no one would stand alone” in a full-scale conflict.
Expressing that this is why Ukraine invests in “interceptors and protection,” Zelenskyy claimed Russia is seeking to break unity in Europe and in the Euro-Atlantic community.
“They want to break it. Why? Because our unity is the best interceptor against Russia’s aggressive plans, the best one, and we still have it,” Zelenskyy said. “Our unity is what protects us.”
He reaffirmed the need for “real” and “strong” security guarantees for Ukraine, as well as for Europe, and that agreements in this regard are ready to be signed with the US.
“And with Europe, we think that the agreement on security guarantees should come before any agreement to end the war,” he said, adding those guarantees answer the main question of “how long there will be no war again.”
He hoped US President Donald Trump, Congress, and the American people hear them, expressing gratitude for “all the real help.”
Speaking about peace negotiations to end the war with Russia, which will enter its fifth year later this month, Zelenskyy said a “lot of time” is now being spent on these talks and hoped the next round will be “serious, substantive, helpful for all of us.”
Following two round of negotiations in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi in January and earlier this month, trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the US are due in Geneva, Switzerland on Feb. 17-18.
“But honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,” Zelenskyy said, noting that the Russian side often refers back to agreements reached during the summit in Alaska between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin last August.
Zelenskyy said the US often refers back to the topic of concessions and that “too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia.”
He called the absence of Europe in the negotiations as a “big mistake."
He said the Ukrainian side will do “truly everything” to make these negotiations successful, and that Ukraine is ready for a deal that brings "real peace" not only for his country, but for Europe as well.
"And I'm confident that this war can be ended, and ended with dignity,” he added.

Expert calls meeting on interception Russia-related tankers piracy conspiracy

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. NATO countries are intensifying their efforts to disrupt maritime trade routes and undermine Russian civilian and military fleets - an activity that could be characterized as a form of piracy, according to Alexander Stepanov, a military expert at the Institute of Law and National Security at the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration (RANEPA).
As Bloomberg previously reported, citing sources, British Defense Secretary John Healey engaged in discussions with counterparts from Scandinavia and the Baltic states regarding the interception of tankers believed to be connected to Russia. The meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force - a coalition of ten nations - took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Stepanov commented, "It appears that Britain is now de facto leading this initiative, and in Munich, we observed a kind of piratical collusion from above. I am convinced that NATO naval departments, particularly those in Northern Europe, are actively working alongside Britain to enhance efforts to block maritime trade routes, conduct sabotage against Russian civilian and military fleets, rehearse scenarios for closing the Danish straits, and develop measures aimed at obstructing maritime navigation."
He further explained that conditions have already been established for the routine deployment of maritime and aerial patrols, which facilitate the coordination and implementation of new strategies to impair Russian capabilities in the Baltic-Arctic region. "These joint expeditionary forces are currently being reinforced with surface naval assets. Britain, Germany, and other regional allies are supporting the construction and commissioning of new surface ships, including frigates and destroyers. Additionally, surface and underwater strike reconnaissance drones are being actively developed," Stepanov noted.
He emphasized Norway's significant role, highlighting the involvement of Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, as well as Sweden's military-industrial complex, which is focusing on developing and deploying advanced stealth submarines designed for operations in the Baltic Sea.

Palmerston, a rescue cat who became the chief mouser of the Foreign Office, has died in Bermuda.
The cat, adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, retired in 2020 after four years of service in Whitehall.
In February 2025, a post on a popular social media account in Palmerston’s name said he had come out of retirement in order to start work “as feline relations consultant (semi-retired) to the new governor of Bermuda”.
Announcing his death, a post on Palmerston’s X account read: “Palmerston, Diplocat extraordinaire, passed away peacefully on 12 February. “Palmy” was a special member of the government house team in Bermuda, and a much-loved family member, it added.
On his retirement in 2020, a letter to Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, read that the cat would like to spend more time “away from the limelight” after enjoying “working from home” during the coronavirus pandemic.
“I have found life away from the frontline relaxed, quieter, and easier,” the letter signed in Palmerston’s name read. “My 105,000 Twitter followers show that even those with four legs and fur have an important part to play in the UK’s global effort,” Palmerston’s letter said.
“I have championed our work, built our relationships, and celebrated the diversity of our staff.”
Cats have been a celebrated feature of British political life for decades. Winston Churchill had a cat named Nelson, and Humphrey was chief mouser to the Cabinet Office under Margaret Thatcher, John Major and briefly Tony Blair.
Downing Street’s current chief mouser, Larry, is celebrating 15 years in the job this weekend. Also adopted from Battersea Dogs & Cats Home, he has served six prime ministers, and been claimed as a symbol of continuity in a roiling political era.
An unofficial X account paid tribute to Larry’s “old friend” Palmerston despite a 2019 video showing what appeared to be a hostile relationship.

Soldiers of the 19th Army Corps and the 44th Separate Mechanized Brigade of the Ukrainian Ground Forces published a video showing that they are freely moving around Kostiantynivka in Donetsk region and stated that reports about the alleged capture of the city by Russian troops are fake.
According to Ukrinform, the 19th Army Corps of the Armed Forces of Ukraine released the video on Facebook.
"Kostiantynivka is Ukraine. The city is under the control of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, and no fakes about the 'presence' of the occupiers here have anything to do with reality," the military said.
They urged people to trust only official sources, emphasizing that "verified facts are our strength."
As Ukrinform reported, information about the alleged capture of the settlement of Zaliznychne in Zaporizhzhia region by Russian forces is not true. The locality remains under the control of Ukrainian defenders despite daily airstrikes.

Rubio says UN has ‘no role’ in solving wars, like Gaza; seeks to reassure Europe on Trump

Rubio says UN has ‘no role’ in solving wars, like Gaza; seeks to reassure Europe on Trump
Using a softer tone than the US president and VP, top diplomat tells Munich conference that Washington looking to ‘revitalize’ ties, says Trump wants ‘Europe to be strong’
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the US on its mission of global “renewal,” while criticizing the United Nations for having “virtually no role” in resolving conflicts, including Gaza.
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump’s vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about US allies, Washington’s top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
“We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history,” Rubio said, calling for “a reinvigorated alliance.”
“We want Europe to be strong,” Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US “belong together.”
He echoed the Trump administration’s oft-stated assertion that immigration posed a threat, saying that “mass migration” was “a crisis which is transforming and destabilizing societies all across the West.”
He said that Europe and the US were “heirs to the same great and noble civilization” and that he hoped Europe, together with us are willing and able to defend it.”
Rubio argued that the “euphoria” of the Western victory in the Cold War led to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history,’ that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood … and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.”
“We made these mistakes together and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,” Rubio said.
“This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,” he said. “This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.”
Rubio: UN plays ‘no role’ in ending wars, including Gaza
Shifting focus to the United Nations, Rubio sharply criticized the global forum for having “virtually no role” in resolving conflicts, and called for global institutions to be reformed.
“The United Nations still has tremendous potential to be a tool for good in the world,” he told the Munich conference.
“But we cannot ignore that, today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role,” he said.
“It could not solve the war in Gaza,” he said. Trump’s newly formed Board of Peace was given a UN mandate to govern the war-ravaged Palestinian territory for two years, but many countries have expressed concerns that the board looks to usurp some of the UN’s power and become the main forum for solving global issues.
Change in tone
Aside from immigration and the UN, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a “rift” between US and Europe.
Rubio said that an end of the trans-Atlantic era “is neither our goal nor our wish,” adding that “our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
He acknowledged that “we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar,” a contrast with disparaging remarks by Trump about NATO allies’ troops in Afghanistan that drew an outcry. “And I’m here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity. and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.”
Rubio’s speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues, including free speech, shocking European allies.
The Trump administration has also charged that Europe faced a “civilizational decline” and has courted far-right parties on the continent.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
European security, Ukraine war
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering on Saturday that “Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility” for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying “We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age,” calling for the building of “a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defense production.”
Also speaking at the conference was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, as Kyiv is set to mark five years of grueling war since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.
Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked: “Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them,” he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine’s Western-supplied air defense systems.
He said that “there is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes” after Russia stepped up its attacks on infrastructure over the past few months, as the coldest snap since the war started in February 2022 hit the country.
“No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war,” Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kyiv to “get moving” to end the war. “Russia wants to make a deal… He has to move,” the US leader said.
But Rubio said on Saturday that “We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war.”
EU says speech ‘very reassuring,’ some leaders unconvinced
EU top diplomat von der Leyen said Rubio’s speech was “very reassuring” but noted that “in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics.”
In her speech to the conference, she stressed that “Europe must become more independent,” including on defense. She insisted on Europe’s “digital sovereignty” — its approach to hate speech on social media.
UK leader Starmer said that “we shouldn’t get in the warm bath of complacency,” saying the UK must re-forge closer ties with Europe to help the continent “stand on our own two feet” in its own defense, and said there needs to be investment that “moves us from overdependence to interdependence.”
Hanno Pevkur, the defense minister of EU and NATO member Estonia, said it was “quite a bold statement to say that America is ‘a child of Europe’.”
“It was a good speech, needed here today, but that doesn’t mean that we can rest on pillows now,” he told The Associated Press. “So still a lot of work has to be done.”

French foreign minister says 'too often' UN fails to act on atrocities
Jean-Noel Barrot calls for urgent Security Council reform, warns legitimacy and efficiency gaps undermine global response to crises
ISTANBUL
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot warned on Saturday that the UN is increasingly unable to respond effectively to global crises, saying the Security Council too often fails to act when mass atrocities occur.
“Too often now we're seeing situations of mass atrocities where the UN Security Council is not able to project force or to take action, or sanctions,” Barrot told a press briefing at the Munich Security Conference.
He said discussions among G7 members and partners such as India show broad agreement that reform of the UN system is urgent, citing what he described as a growing global perception that the organization “cannot provide full-fledged solutions."
Barrot stressed that the problem is not the UN’s relevance but its structure.
He said reform must address both legitimacy and efficiency, arguing the Security Council should be expanded to better reflect current geopolitical realities.
France supports adding new permanent members, including Japan, India, Germany, Brazil, and two African countries, he added. Currently, the permanent members are the US, UK, Russia, China, and France.
On decision-making, he pointed to a France-Mexico initiative urging permanent members to voluntarily refrain from using veto power in cases involving mass atrocities.
According to Barrot, 107 countries have endorsed the proposal so far, and Paris hopes to push for further commitments or even a resolution before the end of the year if conditions allow.
“It’s not about abolishing veto,” he said. “It’s about maintaining a reasonable use of veto ... when the world witnesses the unbearable reality of human humanitarian catastrophes.”
Despite criticism of the Security Council’s performance, Barrot emphasized the UN’s operational importance, particularly in humanitarian crises. Recalling visits to refugee camps near Sudan, he said that without UN logistics networks “the situation would be untenable. It would be inhuman, it would be dire.”
Barrot also said Paris plans to use upcoming diplomatic platforms, including an Africa-focused summit it will co-chair with Kenya in May, to build support for reform proposals and improvements to peacekeeping and humanitarian delivery.
Beyond UN reform, Barrot addressed broader security issues discussed in Munich, including Europe’s defense posture and the war in Ukraine.
He said Europe has “clearly stood up” militarily over the past decade and must continue strengthening its industrial and defense capabilities, while also preparing for future discussions on continental security architecture that could eventually include dialogue with Russia.
He added that Europe should not interpret possible adjustments in US military commitments as negative, describing them instead as an incentive to build a stronger European pillar within NATO.
On China, Barrot reiterated the EU’s position that Beijing is simultaneously “a partner, a competitor, and a systemic rival,” stressing the need for economic rebalancing while avoiding broad protectionism.
He warned that if cooperation fails, Europe may ultimately have to take steps to protect its economic interests.

Finland claim relay bronze at Milan–Cortina
Finland

Finland secured bronze in the women’s 4x7.5km cross-country relay at the Milan–Cortina Winter Olympics, ending a 12-year wait for an Olympic medal in the event.
The quartet of Johanna Matintalo, Kerttu Niskanen, Vilma Ryytty and Jasmi Joensuu finished third in heavy, wet snow as Norway took gold and Sweden silver.
Norway won in 1:15:44.8. Sweden followed 50.9 seconds behind. Finland crossed the line 1 minute 14.7 seconds after the winners and 21.3 seconds ahead of Germany in fourth.
Matintalo opened the relay in testing conditions on the classic leg. She handed over in sixth place, 12.2 seconds behind Sweden’s Linn Svahn.
“Quite okay. Not super good, but the conditions and the course were challenging,” Matintalo said. “A few main rivals struggled more than I did.”
The opening leg saw several falls on the first downhill. Matintalo later said she had not been able to ski the course in advance and described the track as difficult.
“Conditions are the same for everyone. We won’t hide behind them,” she said.
On the second classic leg, Niskanen moved Finland into contention. She lifted the team to second at the exchange, 23.4 seconds behind Norway.
Her leg included drama as Sweden’s Ebba Andersson fell twice and broke a binding, losing more than a minute.
“It was eventful,” Niskanen said. “I started too hard. My mind wanted to go with Slind, but my legs were further back.”
Niskanen, competing in her fourth Olympics, claimed her fifth Olympic medal and her third in a relay across different Games. She later embraced coach Teemu Pasanen in the service area.
“I said earlier that on Valentine’s Day we have to succeed,” Niskanen said with a smile.
Ryytty, racing her first major championship relay, skied the first freestyle leg. Norway extended their lead to 48.3 seconds, but Ryytty held second place and broke clear of Switzerland’s Marina Kälin.
“I got into a flow state and did not think about the situation,” Ryytty said. “I knew I could ski faster than the ones around me. I just pushed hard uphill and hoped others would drop.”
Head coach Reijo Jylhä praised her performance in an interview with Yle.
“On freestyle, Vilma solved it with her effort. She exceeded herself,” Jylhä said. “We are not so good that without winning skis we can succeed.”
He added that the medal was significant for the entire team. “This has been a journey since summer. Everyone did their part. Also the service team was very good,” he said.
Joensuu started the anchor leg 18 seconds ahead of Sweden’s Jonna Sundling. Sundling closed the gap on the descents and overtook on the final lap to secure silver for Sweden.
Joensuu maintained her pace and ensured bronze, with the chasing group more than 40 seconds behind at one stage. The United States finished fifth, 1:52.2 behind Norway.
“In a way I felt relief at the finish,” Joensuu said. “We have been fourth so many times. I did not want it to come down to a sprint. I skied my own race.”
Finland had finished fourth in the women’s relay at the previous two Olympics. The last Olympic relay medal came in Sochi in 2014, when Niskanen also featured in the line-up.
For Matintalo, Ryytty and Joensuu, the bronze marked their first Olympic medal.
The result brought Finland’s total Olympic medals in cross-country skiing to 87 and their tenth in the women’s relay.

Russian Microchip Production for Data Encryption for Ministry of Defense Delayed by Six Years
Unknown

The Ministry of Industry and Trade of Russia fined the Avtomatika concern, part of Rostec, RUB 62.7 million ($812,300). The company was supposed to master serial microchip production for cryptographic protection of information for the Ministry of Defense.
The reason was a delay in fulfilling obligations under a state contract for more than six years, according to CNews.
The development contract was signed back in 2017, and its total cost was RUB 220 million ($2.85 million).
According to the documentation on the state procurement portal, the deadline for the third stage of work, which includes the manufacture of prototypes, was set for November 2019. However, as of the end of January 2026, the obligations remain unfulfilled, and the total delay is 2,262 days.
Several co-contractors are involved in the project: NIIMA Progress and the radio engineering concern Vega. At the current stage, Progress was supposed to supply electronic components, Avtomatika was supposed to manufacture and test the first samples, and Vega was supposed to release a trial batch of products.
The technical requirements for the microchip include a combination of two types of computing cores (for simple and complex commands). The device must also contain RAM with an automatic error correction function. The project planned to create a digital model of the microchip for its design on a computer.
Hardware-level cryptographic information protection tools ensure data confidentiality and integrity more effectively than software solutions. Such modules are in demand not only in the military, but also at critical information infrastructure facilities to protect technological networks. Abroad, similar systems are mass-produced by NXP, STMicroelectronics, and Texas Instruments.

Disgraced Peter Mandelson breaks cover for first time since fresh Epstein revelations
The former UK ambassador to the US was seen leaving his London home on Saturday

The disgraced former Labour peer Peter Mandelson has been seen in public for the first time since fresh claims emerged of his links to Jeffrey Epstein.
The former UK ambassador to the United States was seen leaving his London home and getting into a car on Saturday.
It is the first time Lord Mandelson has been spotted in public since the latest tranche of Epstein files revealed the depths of his alleged links to Epstein.
The claims sent the government into meltdown and forced Lord Mandelson to step down from the House of Lords. It also prompted calls for Sir Keir Starmer to be replaced as prime minister.
It comes days after Lord Mandelson was asked to give evidence to the US Congress over his relationship with the paedophile financier.
A letter to Lord Mandelson, signed by representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, said it was clear he had “extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein” and holds “critical information” relevant to Congress’s investigations into Epstein’s operations.
The letter also said: “Numerous pieces of evidence have come to light demonstrating your close ties to Jeffrey Epstein over the span of multiple years.”
Among the evidence, it listed Lord Mandelson’s “handwritten note” in a 50th birthday book for Epstein in which he described the late financier as his “best pal”.
It also pointed to the peer’s stay at the financier’s New York apartment in 2009, while Epstein was serving an 18-month sentence for soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor, as well as photographs of Lord Mandelson in his underwear in the latest US Department of Justice release.
Lord Mandelson was given a deadline of February 27 to respond to the two US politicians’ letter “due to the urgency and gravity of this matter”.
The former cabinet minister has resigned from the Labour Party and quit the House of Lords since the latest tranche of Epstein files was released in the US.
Among the revelations to emerge were documents from 2009 that appeared to show Lord Mandelson, when he was business secretary, sharing sensitive information with Epstein on at least four occasions.
In the wake of the criticism over Lord Mandelson’s appointment, the government has seen several advisors to the PM quit, including chief of staff Morgan McSweeney, communications director Tim Allan and cabinet secretary Sir Chris Wormald.

‘Nothing says love like chemicals’: Valentine’s roses often covered in pesticides, testing finds

Stay away from roses this Valentine’s Day, environmental campaigners have warned after testing revealed them to be heavily contaminated with pesticides.
Laboratory testing on bouquets in the Netherlands, Europe’s flower import hub, found roses had the highest residues of neurological and reproductive toxins compared with other flowers.
Red roses were found to be the worst, with one bunch containing traces of 26 different pesticides, half of which are banned for use in the EU.
“Nothing says love like roses coated in a fine chemical cocktail,” said Roisin Taylor, of Verde Flower Co in Northumberland, whose business focuses on sustainable flowers and who has been campaigning to raise awareness of pesticides in the industry.
“Things like clofentazine, a chemical found to disrupt the working of your thyroid, or even carbendazim, which is believed to be a human cancer-causing chemical, or maybe chlorfenapyr, which has been found to, ironically, lead to cardiac arrest when exposed in high dose.
“All of these chemicals are also currently banned for use in the EU. We couldn’t, as flower farmers, legally use these toxic chemicals here in the UK.”
Valentine’s Day is the flower industry’s busiest time of the year. According to analysts, about 200m roses are produced to meet the demand for lovers’ gifts on 14 February in Europe alone.
More than half on sale in the UK have been sourced from the Netherlands. But for most stems, that is just the last leg of a much longer journey from farms in countries such as Colombia, Kenya and Ethiopia, where the climate allows for year-round production and laxer regulatory regimes allow for more powerful pesticides.
To determine the levels of pesticide residues on flowers likely to be on sale this Valentine’s Day, Pesticide Action Network Netherlands (Pan-NL) randomly tested 17 bouquets – five bunches of roses, eight mixed bouquets, and four bunches of tulips.
The highest concentration of pesticide residues was found on a bouquet of red roses bought from a Dutch garden centre, with 65.8 mg/kg. Of 26 pesticides detected on the sample, 13 were banned for use in the EU.
None of the bouquets tested were pesticide-free, but the roses and mixed bouquets contained the most residues. Among those, the analysis found 87 different pesticides, including eight metabolites, roughly equally split between insecticides and fungicides.
Of the 79 active substances found, almost a third were banned for use as “plant protection products” in the EU and the Netherlands, while 78% “pose[d] a significant risk to human health and/or the environment”, said Pan-NL. Among the pesticides Pan-NL found on the flowers were known neuro- and reproductive toxins, as well as carcinogens and endocrine disruptors.
The findings come amid growing concerns in the floristry sector around the chemicals to which workers are exposed and their health effects. But in producer countries, such as Kenya, the problems are even more acute.
David Bek, a professor at the University of Coventry who researches the flower industry, described how the farms around Lake Naivasha, Kenya’s major flower-producing region, doused crops repeatedly in chemicals to keep pests at bay.
“They are basically flower factories,” he said, with flowers grown in vast quantities in sealed polytunnels, then sorted, trimmed, bunched and packed by hundreds of workers in processing areas.
Bek said spraying happened at almost every stage of the production process, but particularly as they prepared to ship. “That’s what they have to do to make sure they don’t end up with problems that mean the consignment will get rejected when it gets to the border.”
So where does that leave those of us looking for a Valentine’s gift? Pan-NL recommended “organically grown seasonal flowers or organically grown ornamental plants”.
And for those of us who do receive a “poison bouquet”? The advice is clear: “Don’t throw the remains on the compost heap or in the organic waste bin, but with residual waste. This prevents the toxins from being recycled in nature.”

Rubio, Wang Yi manage US-China great power rivalry in Munich even as core tensions linger
Back-to-back speeches appear to continue relative thaw in run-up to Trump’s expected China trip but sharp swipes are also traded
In back-to-back speeches at the Munich Security Conference, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke of the need to carefully manage the superpowers’ differences, continuing a relative thaw that is expected to see US President Donald Trump travel to Beijing in April.
Wang said he was encouraged that Trump had shown respect for China’s President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people.
“He has stressed that the US and China working together can get a lot of great things done, and the two presidents can make the fantastic relationship between the United States and China even better,” Wang said.
At the same time, he questioned “whether all people in the United States share this view”, pointing to some whom he accused of “cobbling together all these small, exclusive circles”. He said they were “trying to split Taiwan from China and stepping on China’s red lines, which would very much likely push China and the United States towards conflict”.
Rubio, who spoke right before Wang, told the conference it would be “geopolitical malpractice” not to talk to China, as he pledged that Washington would carefully manage its differences with Beijing.

Five countries say Navalny was killed with poison from South American frog
The UK, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden have said that laboratory tests show Kremlin opposition leader Alexei Navalny died after exposure to a toxin found in a tree frog native to Ecuador.
Source: European Pravda citing a joint statement released on 14 February, the second anniversary of Navalny's death in a Russian penal colony
Details: The statement, agreed by the five countries' foreign ministers, effectively accused Russian authorities of poisoning Navalny in prison.
Quote: "The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin. This is the conclusion of our Governments based on analyses of samples from Alexei Navalny. These analyses have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine."
More details: The statement noted that the neurotoxin is found in poison of dart frogs in South America and is not found naturally anywhere in Russia.
Quote: "Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."
More details: The five countries said that Russia had repeatedly shown disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention, noting that in August 2020 they condemned the use of Novichok to poison Navalny. They also referred to the use of the substance in Salisbury in the UK which had led to the death of a British woman.
Quote: "These latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. Our Permanent Representatives to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have written today to the Director General to inform him of this Russian breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons."
More details: The countries said they will use all available tools to hold Russia to account for such actions.
Background:
- Two years ago, on the afternoon of 16 February, Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service reported the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny at Correctional Facility No 3. in the town of Kharp in Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, northwestern Siberia.
- After his death, the EU adopted new sanctions against about 20 people it said were responsible for human rights violations in Russia, including in connection with Navalny's death.
- A case brought by Ukraine against Russia is continuing at the European Court of Human Rights. It concerns a series of high-profile assassination attempts and contract killings organised by Russia in Ukraine and in other countries.

Kennedy is banning junk food from SNAP. Can you guess what counts?

Is Gatorade unhealthy? Granola bars? Take this quiz to understand Kennedy's new SNAP bans.
Warning: It's complicated.
Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s most significant effort to overhaul what Americans eat seeks to block low-income people from buying junk food with their food stamps. It’s not so easy.
Since Jan. 1, five states – Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia – have banned soda or other unhealthy foods from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the nation’s largest anti-hunger initiative which serves more than 40 million people. The idea has a long history, with supporters on both sides of the aisle.
But the rollout of those food restrictions has been bumpy and confusing, leaving buyers and grocers trying to figure out what even qualifies as “junk food.” Is Gatorade? What about granola bars? And the five states certainly don’t agree on what counts as candy.
It’s not even clear the policy will accomplish Kennedy’s stated goals. There’s limited evidence they will improve Americans’ health, given that people can use other money to buy whatever they’d like, each state limits different items and the restrictions are not directly tied to nutritional value. Some banned items, for example, are actually lower in sugar or fat than foods that are allowed.
Indiana and Iowa’s state governments have declined to provide a list of banned items, with Iowa going so far as to say it would be “too tedious.” States are instead putting the burden on retailers and consumers to figure things out.
Here’s our quiz to help you understand how it all works — and reveal the inconsistencies in Kennedy’s big push to overhaul SNAP.

TEHRAN, February 14. /TASS/. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has committed to removing all obstacles hindering the development of the North-South Transport Corridor project by the end of March. Currently, Tehran and Moscow are collaborating on the construction of the Rasht-Astara railway segment, which will facilitate direct transit to Persian Gulf ports.
"Relations between Iran and Russia are robust, with numerous agreements being signed and actively implemented," Pezeshkian stated. "We aim to eliminate remaining barriers by the end of the year (according to the Iranian calendar, March 20, 2026 - TASS) so that the railway route can be completed and become operational," he added, as reported by Tasnim News Agency.
In 2023, Iran and Russia signed a bilateral agreement to jointly develop a 160-kilometer section of the Rasht-Astara highway, a key component of the North-South Transport Corridor designed to provide efficient access to Persian Gulf ports. The entire project is valued at approximately 1.6 billion euros, with both nations sharing responsibilities for financing design, construction, and procurement of goods and services.
During a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on December 12, 2025, Pezeshkian announced plans to acquire 100 kilometers of the Rasht-Astara highway for construction, with the goal of completing the process by March 2026.

The only way to bring peace closer in 2026 is to increase pressure on Russia, but there’re no clear signs yet – Latvian President
The conclusion of a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia currently appears more like a miracle, and the reason for such pessimism is the lack of any signs from Russia regarding the acceptance of any possible peace agreements, according to Latvian President Edgars Rinkēvičs, an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent reported.
"I fully agree with (Czech) President Pavel that the only way to do everything possible to achieve peace in 2026 is to increase pressure on Russia, both politically and economically, through sanctions, the fight against the shadow fleet, etc., and, of course, through support for Ukraine," he said at a Ukrainian lunch on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation.
"So far, we haven’t seen any particular signs of pressure," Rinkēvičs stated.
He believes that certain diplomatic maneuvers and negotiations are currently underway, but it would be desirable for the US efforts, along with those of European leaders who are involved in increasing pressure on Russia, to be productive.
"Russia rejects all possible ideas and is unwilling to commit to peace, so we will have to rely not only on diplomacy but also on pressure," the Latvian president concluded.

UK court blocks terror label for Palestine Action

The High Court in London on Friday upheld an appeal against the British government’s decision to ban the pro-Palestinian group Palestine Action and designate it a terrorist organization, ruling that the move was disproportionate and infringed on freedom of expression.
However, the ban will remain in effect for now pending a government appeal scheduled to be heard on Feb. 20.
The government prohibition, which took effect last year, added Palestine Action to a list of banned organizations that includes Hamas and Hezbollah. The designation followed break-ins and acts of vandalism carried out by the group’s activists. Under the ban, membership in or public support for the organization could carry a prison sentence of up to 14 years.
The decision sparked protests by pro-Palestinian demonstrators.
In their ruling Friday, judges said the ban on the group’s activities was “disproportionate” and constituted a significant interference with the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly. Justice Victoria Sharp said only “a very small portion” of Palestine Action’s activities amounted to terrorism.
Britain’s home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, said she was “disappointed” by the decision and would appeal. Jewish organizations in Britain also criticized the ruling, saying they were “deeply troubled” by the High Court’s decision.
Until the appeal is heard, the organization will not be able to resume operations. London’s Metropolitan Police said it would stop arresting the group’s activists. Since the organization was added to the terrorism list, nearly 3,000 arrests have been made, mostly of demonstrators holding signs in support of the group. Hundreds have been charged, though none have yet been convicted.
Outside the courthouse, members of the organization and their supporters celebrated the ruling. “WE WON,” Huda Ammori, one of the group’s leaders, wrote on X. In a recent interview with Britain’s Channel 4, she said the group’s aim “is to save lives in Palestine” and insisted it was “the complete opposite of a terrorist organization.”
On its website, the group, founded in 2020, says its mission is to “end international complicity in Israel’s genocide and apartheid regime.”
Palestine Action has gone beyond protests to target defense companies linked to Israel, at times blocking entrances to their facilities. A primary focus has been the Israeli defense firm Elbit Systems. In 2024, activists broke into an Elbit factory armed with hammers and axes. Footage released by British prosecutors showed violent clashes between activists and police.
Last year, members of the group broke into RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire and sprayed two aircraft with red paint, describing it as a protest against military cooperation with Israel. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the incident “disgraceful,” and his government subsequently moved forward with the ban.
Jewish organizations in Britain have argued that Palestine Action’s activities targeting Jewish businesses and institutions are “disruptive and intimidating” and extend beyond areas where anti-Israel protests are typically held. They have called on police and the government to clarify how they intend to ensure the safety of the Jewish community following the High Court ruling.
Mahmood said the ban “does not prevent nonviolent protest on the Palestinian issue” and noted that the court agreed on that point. She added that she intends to challenge the ruling in the Court of Appeal.

Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al Shaibani met International Criminal Court President Tomoko Akane to discuss the issue of holding ousted leader Bashar al Assad and figures of his erstwhile regime accountable, in the “first meeting of its kind” between the two sides.
AlIkhbaria Syria TV, quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry source as saying that al Shaibani held a meeting with the ICC president on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
The source said the meeting discussed “files related to transitional justice and ways to hold those responsible for crimes to account, foremost among them the criminal Bashar al Assad and a number of figures of the defunct regime.”
The source added that the meeting “is the first of its kind,” without providing further details.
In late September, Damascus investigative judge Tawfiq al Ali announced the issuance of an in-absentia arrest warrant against Assad, as a prelude to pursuing the case internationally through Interpol.
Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in late 2024, ending the Baath Party’s decades-long grip on power that began in 1963. A new transitional administration led by President Ahmed al Sharaa was formed in January 2025.

Abbas accuses Israel of putting up ‘obstacles’ blocking phase 2 of Gaza ceasefire
Palestinian Authority leader hits out at Jerusalem for ‘continuing to violate’ truce with Hamas, which is refusing to disarm as stipulated by US-backed ceasefire deal
Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas called on Saturday for the removal of “all obstacles” he said Israel has imposed on the implementation of phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.
“We emphasize the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement,” Abbas said, in a speech read by his Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the daily governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to “ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery,” the PA president said.
Abbas accused Israel of “continuing to violate” the ceasefire agreement with Palestinian terrorist group Hamas that took effect in October and was backed by the United States.
“From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed [in Gaza], which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase,” he added.
Even though the US-brokered truce entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the coastal territory, with Israel and Hamas trading blame.
The deal is aimed at permanently ending the Gaza war, which was sparked by the Hamas-led October 2023 invasion of southern Israel, and was endorsed in November by the United Nations.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said, however, that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
‘A number of conditions’
The Israel Defense Forces still controls more than half of the Gaza Strip, while Hamas and Israel accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Fifteen Palestinian experts on the technocratic committee, which is being overseen by a “Board of Peace” set up by US President Donald Trump, are currently based in Egypt, despite a partial reopening on February 2 of the Rafah Border Crossing, Gaza’s only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian diplomat whom Trump named high representative for Gaza, said on Friday that “a number of conditions need to be met” before technocratic committee members can enter the Palestinian territory.
“One, Hamas needs to transfer the civilian control of the institutions in Gaza,” he told a discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
“This is not a government coming in after an election. This is far much more complicated,” he said.
“Because Hamas has been governing Gaza for 20 years and… implementing policies that are not in line with Palestinian legislation,” he added.
Other conditions he mentioned included ending Gaza ceasefire violations and “a radical increase in the assistance to people, aid going into Gaza.”
“And finally, we need to make sure that we have the framework agreed in place on the decommissioning of weapons in Gaza,” Mladenov said, emphasizing the importance of the future role of a Palestinian security force.
He said the International Stabilization Force (ISF) for the territory — set out under the Trump plan to end the war — “is extremely important.”
“But far more important than the ISF is the new Palestinian security force that should be deployed in Gaza, that should be able to secure the ground with the assistance of the ISF,” he added.

About 200,000 join Iran demonstration in Munich

MUNICH, Germany - About 200,000 people joined a demonstration against the Iranian government in Munich on Feb 14, police said, as world leaders gathered nearby for a security conference.
The protesters rallied on Munich’s Theresienwiese fairgrounds, denouncing the leadership of Iran’s Islamic Republic following the deadly repression of nationwide protests in January.
Some waved flags with a lion and a sun against horizontal green, white and red stripes, the emblem of the monarchy overthrown in 1979.
Human rights groups have reported that thousands of protesters have been killed in Iran.
Rallies calling for international action against Tehran are also planned in Toronto and Los Angeles on Feb 14.
The exiled son of the former shah of Iran, Mr Reza Pahlavi, spoke at the Munich Security Conference on Feb 14 and called on US President Donald Trump to “help” the Iranian people.
Mr Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since his father was overthrown in the 1979 revolution, urged an outside “humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed” in Iran.
The Theresienwiese, which hosts the huge annual Oktoberfest folk gathering, is located less than 3km from the security conference venue.
Last week, an estimated 10,000 people gathered in Berlin in response to a call from the MEK, an exiled opposition group considered “terrorist” by Tehran. AFP

Russia 'poisoned' Navalny in prison with 'rare toxin': European states
Unknown

Five European countries including Britain, France and Germany accused Russia of "poisoning" opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a "rare toxin", on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said in a joint statement, following "analyses of samples" from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and "highly likely resulted in his death", the European states said.
"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death," the UK foreign office added in a statement.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
"Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
"I was of course certain that it was a murder... but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning.
"Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence his voice," UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
The countries said they had reported Russia to the world's chemical weapons watchdog -- the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons -- over the finding.
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin's inner circle.

US, Iran set for 2rd round of nuclear talks in Geneva amid tensions: Report
Officials say talks seek deal to prevent conflict while Trump demands zero uranium enrichment and signals readiness for tougher measures
ISTANBUL
The US and Iran are expected to hold a second round of nuclear negotiations in Geneva next Tuesday, according to US officials and sources, amid rising military tensions in the Gulf.
Officials cited by US website Axios said on Friday that the talks, aimed at reaching an agreement that could avert escalation, are expected to include Donald Trump’s son-in-law and unofficial advisor Jared Kushner and White House Envoy Steve Witkoff on the US side, while Iran’s delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
Oman’s Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has been mediating between Washington and Tehran, is also set to participate.
Behind the scenes, a US official said Witkoff relayed messages to Tehran through Oman earlier this week.
According to Iranian state TV, Ali Larijani, the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, confirmed that he had received a document containing US proposals after meeting Omani officials.
Trump has signaled openness to diplomacy while maintaining pressure through a significant military buildup in the region.
“Either we will make a deal or we will have to do something very tough like last time,” Trump told Axios on Tuesday, evidently referring to the US airstrikes on Iran last June.
Speaking to reporters Friday, he said any agreement must require zero uranium enrichment inside Iran, adding that Tehran has yet to demonstrate meaningful action on its nuclear program. Asked about regime change, Trump said it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.”

50,000 foreign soldiers fought for Israel during Gaza genocide

Over 50,000 foreign soldiers fought for Israeli army during Gaza genocide
More than 50,000 foreign nationals have served in the Israeli army as of March 2025, including at least 2,069 British nationals.
A report by investigative outlet Declassified UK has found that 50,632 soldiers serving in the Israeli army hold foreign nationalities in addition to their Israeli citizenship.
An additional 4,440 soldiers have been found to hold two foreign nationalities on top of their Israeli one, alongside 162 other members having three foreign citizenships.
The disclosure comes following a Freedom of Information (FOI) request issued in March last year to the Israeli army by the NGO Hatzlacha, an organisation seeking to promote transparency in Israel.
The country found to have the most nationals serving in the Israeli army was the United States, which has 12,135 dual US-Israeli nationals and 1,207 other soldiers who hold American, Israeli and a third citizenship serving for Israel’s military in Gaza.
France was found to have the second greatest number of nationals serving in the Israeli army, totalling 6,464 individuals. Russian nationals in the Israeli military amounted to 5,169.
The list also included soldiers with nationalities from Germany, Ukraine, Romania, Poland, Ethiopia, Canada, Hungary and Italy among other countries.
Dozens of Israeli soldiers also have Arab nationalities.
These include 14 soldiers with Yemeni nationality, 15 others with Tunisian citizenship, six Jordanian nationals, five Iraqi citizens, four with Lebanese citizenship, three holding Syrian nationalities, and one Algerian citizen.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which is currently reviewing a genocide case against Israel, has warned states not to assist Israel in war crimes.
Lawyers have called for governments to investigate the actions of their nationals in Gaza and prosecute them under international law.
British participation in Israel’s war on Gaza
The findings show 1,686 British-Israeli nationals and a further 383 people with British, Israeli, and a third nationality have served in the Israeli military during the war on Gaza that began in October 2023.
The UK Foreign Office said it does not collect information on the number of its nationals within Israeli army ranks, according to Declassified UK.
The British government, however, has faced scrutiny as identities of UK nationals emerged over the course of the genocidal war in which they were seen committing acts that legal experts have argued could amount to war crimes.
Levi Simon, a dual British Israeli national, was identified after posting videos on his social media account rifling through drawers of Palestinian women’s underwear in Gaza homes that had been abandoned.
Londoner Sam Sank was another dual national who filmed himself fighting for the Israeli military in Gaza between December 2023 and January 2024. In an interview with The Times, Sank said he believed there were "hundreds, if not thousands, more Britons fighting in Israel".
"There must be no impunity where credible evidence links British nationals to grave breaches of international law", Paul Heron, a lawyer at the Public Interest Law Centre, told Declassified UK.
"Where dual nationals have served in units implicated in atrocities, the authorities must investigate promptly and, where the evidence meets the threshold, pursue arrest and prosecution like any other serious crime," he added.
Prior data released by the Israeli Knesset showed how 54 British nationals were among the approximately 3,000 so-called ‘lone soldiers’ serving in the Israeli army without holding Israeli citizenship.
An investigation by The New Arab’s sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed previously found that young people in the West had been recruited to serve in the Israeli military.
The UK’s Metropolitan Police previously received a complaint against ten British nationals serving in the ranks of the Israeli army, accusing them of "targeted killing of civilians and aid workers, including by sniper fire, and indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas".

Putin has not once negotiated in good faith on ending war, Wicker says
This was stated by Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Roger Wicker, during the panel "Coalition of the Able? Securing Long-Term Support for Ukraine" at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform correspondent reports.
"Vladimir Putin has not yet negotiated in good faith. Never once. Vladimir Putin started this war. He's a war criminal. And as you've pointed out, he started committing more war crimes this year by attacking civilians," Wicker said.
According to the senator, Putin will begin negotiating in good faith only when he feels a sufficient level of pressure and losses.
"And that's what these oil sanctions may do. That's what more serious, more decisive and skillful weaponry may do," Senator Wicker emphasized.
In his view, Russia has so far demonstrated no effective step toward a lasting end to the war.
"But he will not negotiate in good faith and has not yet said one word about actually ending this war in a meaningful way that will be lasting," he said.
The panel was attended by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, and President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola.
As Ukrinform reported, Zelensky stated during his speech at the Munich Security Conference that in the negotiation process the United States often refers to the need for concessions from Ukraine rather than from Russia.

Reza Pahlavi urges US military action in Iran, says signs regime is on brink of collapse

Exiled crown prince and Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi said on Saturday American military intervention in Iran could save lives, urging US President Donald Trump not to spend too long negotiating with Tehran’s clerical rulers on a nuclear deal.
The exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian regime was on the brink of collapse and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall.
Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
“It’s a matter of time. We are hoping that this attack will expedite the process, and the people can be finally back in the streets and take it all the way to the ultimate regime’s downfall,” said Pahlavi.
The prince is based in the United States and has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A campaign of mass arrests and intimidation has led to the arrests of thousands as Iranian authorities seek to deter further protests after last month’s crackdown on the bloodiest unrest since 1979. The protests began on December 28 as a modest demonstration in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.
Trump has questioned level of support for Pahlavi
Iran’s opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions, including monarchists who back Pahlavi, and appears to have little organized presence within the Islamic Republic. In an interview with Reuters last month, Trump sounded skeptical about the level of Pahlavi’s support inside Iran.
The Trump administration has engaged with Iran to see if a nuclear deal can be struck as Washington amasses military forces in the region. US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week, and further talks are expected this coming week.
“People are hoping that at some point the decision will be made that there’s no use, there’s no point... We’re not going to get anywhere with negotiations... therefore, that it is time for the United States to intervene and do what President Trump promised he will do – to have the people’s back,” Pahlavi said. “Intervention is a way to save lives.”
On Friday, in a speech to US troops in North Carolina, Trump said Iran has been difficult in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully.
Two US officials speaking on the condition of anonymity told Reuters on Friday that the US military was preparing for the possibility of a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran if Trump ordered an attack.
Pahlavi calls for 'Global Day of Action' anti-regime protests
In addition to his call for US action, on Thursday, Pahlavi raised a call for a “Global Day of Action” directed at the protestors inside Iran.
As part of the action scheduled for 8:00 p.m. in Iran, Pahlavi urged demonstrators to "take to the streets to make the voice of the great and united Iranian nation heard around the world and to secure broader international support."

Czech President: I don't want to create overly optimistic expectations for peace in 2026, knowing the enemy
Russia is not yet ready to end the war against Ukraine; Kyiv needs greater and faster military support for a peaceful resolution, according to Czech President Petr Pavel, an Interfax-Ukraine correspondent reported.
"As a former military man, I don’t want to be overly optimistic about this year, knowing what kind of enemy we have against us," he said at the Ukrainian Lunch on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation.
Pavel recalled how three years ago he also warned against exaggerated optimism regarding the planned Ukrainian counteroffensive.
"My colleagues viewed me with a certain suspicion that I was undermining Ukrainian military morale, but all I did was warning against creating expectations that, if unfulfilled, would lead to disappointment on all sides," the Czech President noted.
He emphasized that he would like Ukraine to live in peace as soon as possible, but this requires a number of very specific steps from its partners.
"First, we will have to expedite the delivery of all necessary military equipment and support to Ukraine to avoid losing more territory and create a favorable situation on the ground," Pavel said.
He added that Russia was insisting on its strategic initiative, but the price for every square kilometre of Ukrainian territory was extremely high, and last month it exceeded the capacity to recruit new soldiers.
According to him, if partners can maintain this support or even increase it, and at the same time be very decisive in strengthening sanctions, especially against the Russian shadow fleet, then the conditions can be created for Russia to understand that it cannot achieve greater success on the front, and the only way is negotiations.
"I’m not sure that Russia is mentally prepared for this, and it is up to all of us, including, first and foremost, the United States, to increase even political pressure on Russia, not Ukraine, because that won’t bring Putin to the negotiating table," the Czech president concluded.

Mikhail Shaidorov wins historic figure skating Olympic gold for Kazakhstan at Milano Cortina games

Mikhail Shaidorov became Kazakhstan’s first Olympic gold medallist in men’s figure skating after triumphing at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026.
Kazakhstan has crowned its first-ever Olympic champion in figure skating after Mikhail Shaidorov produced a stunning free skate to win gold at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympic games on Friday.
Shaidorov, skating second in the final group, made a bold decision shortly before taking the ice, altering elements of his programme in a calculated gamble. He executed five clean quadruple jumps for the first time in his career.
"I can’t believe it. The whole season I fought with myself. This season was extremely hard. I tried several times in competitions to land five quadruple jumps, but it never worked. Today, everything came together," said Shaidorov.
"I’ve been preparing for this Olympics for a long time. My goal all season was simply to do my work. Now I’ve achieved it. I want to dedicate this medal to all of Kazakhstan."
Shaidorov’s free skate was performed to the music of Kazakh singer Dimash Kudaibergen.
The final standings of the men’s event (24 participants) were:
1st: Mikhail Shaidorov (Kazakhstan) - 291.58 points
2nd: Yuma Kagiyama (Japan) - 280.06 points
3rd: Shun Sato (Japan) - 274.90 points
Pre-event favourite, US figure skater Ilia Malinin, known for his technical ability and dubbed the ‘Quad God,’ struggled throughout his performance. Malinin fell twice in the free skate, finishing 15th in that segment and eighth overall.
A gold medal to inspire a nation
The victory carries particular importance for Kazakhstan’s figure skating programme. The late Denis Ten won the country’s first Olympic medal in the sport, a bronze, at the 2014 Sochi Games.
Shaidorov’s triumph means Kazakhstan has now earned two Olympic figure skating medals from two different athletes.
"I believe this medal would mean a lot to Denis Ten. He opened the way for us. The road was difficult for him and for me. I want to thank Denis for everything he did for our sport," said Mikhail Shaidorov.
Erbol Myrzabossynov, Kazakhstan’s Minister of Tourism and Sports, congratulated Mikhail Shaidorov on his historic achievement:
"This is the result of years of hard work, persistence, and faith in his goal. Today Mikhail gave the country immense joy and proved that Kazakhstan’s figure skating can achieve the highest results on the world stage."
"This victory will become a powerful impetus for the development of winter sports and will inspire a new generation of athletes," he added.
Shaidorov's rise to Olympic glory
Mikhail Shaidorov began skating at a young age in Kazakhstan and quickly progressed through the national junior ranks. Before this victory, Shaidorov had built a steady career in international figure skating.
He won medals at ISU Challenger Series events, competed on the Grand Prix circuit, and achieved success in junior competitions, but had not been considered a strong favourite for Olympic gold.
Shaidorov trains with Russia's Aleksei Urmanov, a legend in men’s figure skating and 1994 Winter Olympics champion.
Shaidorov’s victory not only cements his place in Kazakh sports history but also raises expectations for the future of winter sports in the country.

Russia killed opposition leader Alexey Navalny using a rare dart frog toxin, five European countries say
Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was killed in prison using a rare dart frog toxin, five European countries said in a joint statement on February 14.
According to reporting by The Insider, samples taken from the late opposition politician following his death in 2024 were smuggled abroad and found to contain the lethal toxin epibatidine. The outlet reports that experts from several laboratories, working independently, reached the same conclusion after analyzing the samples.
Representatives of five countries — the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands — whose laboratories examined Navalny’s samples have issued a joint statement accusing Russia of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The statement, coordinated by the five countries’ foreign ministers and published on the British government’s website, stresses that natural exposure to epibatidine in Russia is impossible.
“Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him,” the statement reads. “We and our partners will make use of all policy levers at our disposal to continue to hold Russia to account.”
The statement adds that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has been notified of Russia’s violation of the CWC.

Epibatidine was first identified in 1974. It was extracted from the skin of a South American poison dart frog, Epipedobates tricolor, and later synthesized in laboratories. It is a powerful neurotoxin that acts on key receptors in the transmission of pain signals, as well as movement and other bodily functions. The toxin causes numbness throughout the body, which can rapidly progress to complete paralysis. Doses become fatal if the paralysis leads to respiratory arrest, according to The Insider.
“The publicly available information about Alexey Navalny’s symptoms corresponds to what is known about the effects of epibatidine,” Alexander Polupan, the intensive care physician who treated Navalny after his Novichok poisoning in 2020, told The Insider.
Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, announced in September 2025 that laboratory tests in two Western countries had confirmed independently that her husband was fatally poisoned in prison. At the time, she said that the laboratories had refused to release the toxicology results due to unspecified “political concerns.”
“I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexey with a chemical weapon,” Navalnaya wrote on X on February 14. “I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”

Iranian Opposition Holds Largest Ever Protest In Europe, With 250,000 People In Munich

MUNICH -- Some 250,000 people have joined a demonstration in the Bavarian capital, German police told RFE/RL, in the largest ever protest in Europe by opponents of the authorities in Iran.
The Munich protest was part of a global day of action called by Reza Pahlavi, the last son of the shah of Iran who was deposed during the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution.
One of numerous figures in Iran’s fractious exiled opposition, he was greeted by loud cheers as he arrived.
“Today you see the horizon of victory closer than ever,” he told the crowd, which he said was one of the largest gatherings of Iranians anywhere. Other mass rallies were expected in Los Angeles and Toronto.
People came to Munich from across Europe, angered by a bloody crackdown against demonstrators in Iran in January in which security forces killed thousands of people.
'I'm So Happy They Are Waking Up'
“It’s very sad to say they are, we are, paying a price, of course, these youth that are dying every day. This blood, it’s so sad,” a woman called Atena told RFE/RL. Like other protesters, Atena, who traveled here from Milan, Italy, declined to give her full name.
Noting that she has cousins and friends in Tehran and other cities, Atena said the January protests in Iran gave her hope despite the response of security forces.
“I’m so happy they are waking up and they are asking for change…. This time, [change] is going to happen,” she said.
Another demonstrator, Rasool, told RFE/RL he had traveled from the Netherlands to join the protest in Munich.
“I’ve become angry, I’ve become upset, because my brothers and sisters, our parents, are in a dangerous situation. They [left] their life on the street for freedom,” Rasool said.
“This regime at this point is the weakest [it’s] ever been. So, if the US and Europe help us with a war action, the people can finish the job they have started,” he added.
Calls For US Military Action
Rasool’s echoed slogans on many banners calling for US military action against Iran.
US naval forces in the Persian Gulf remain poised within striking distance of Iran in one of the biggest US military buildups in the region in years. US President Donald Trump has voiced support and encouragement for Iranian protesters and signaled that US forces might intervene to protect them.
However, talks between US and Iranian negotiators appear to be more focused on other issues, such as Iran’s nuclear and missile programs, and its network of proxy forces in Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen.
Speaking at a news conference earlier on February 14, Pahlavi urged Trump to take action.
“The Iranian people heard you say ‘help is on the way’ and they have faith in you. Help them, and history will record you alongside not just the Iranian nation’s but the world’s greatest heroes,” he said.
The previous day, he met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, an extremely rare meeting at such a level for the former crown prince.
Video shot by Ukrainian public TV showed the two men shaking hands in a wood-paneled room and then sitting at a table. Pahlavi thanked Zelenskyy for voicing support for Iranian protesters during his speech at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
But while the United States has supported Iranian protesters, it has not endorsed Pahlavi or any other leaders in exile -- although Pahlavi has repeatedly called for intervention in Iran by US President Donald Trump.
Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator for South Carolina, spoke at the Munich protest. "I have chosen the Iranian people over the ayatollah. I believe they could be good allies of the United States and would march the region toward the light," he said.
Other exiled Iranian opposition groups also announced they would be holding rival demonstrations in Munich over February 13-14 -- as world leaders gathered in the city for the annual security conference.
A much smaller protest was held on February 13 by the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which denounced both the current Iranian authorities and the idea of monarchist rule.

Militarization to entail Japan’s crushing defeat, Chinese foreign minister warns

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. Attempts to return to the path of militarization will result in a crushing defeat for Japan, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has warned.
"Japan once invaded China and attacked Pearl Harbor under the pretext of a so-called crisis of survival. If Japan gets back to its previous methods, it will doom itself. If it takes risks again, it will lose even faster and suffer an even more crushing defeat," he said, speaking at the Munich Security Conference. The top Chinese diplomat noted that the erroneous statements by Japanese leaders on Taiwan expose "Japan's undying ambitions to invade and colonize the island, as well as the lingering specter of a militaristic resurgence." Wang noted that it is essential to heed the lessons of history, otherwise "the mistakes of the past will be repeated."
"People of good will must be vigilant. Above all, the Japanese people should be on guard not to be deceived and subjugated by far-right forces and extremist ideologies again," Wang added. "All peace-loving countries should also warn Japan of this."
Furthermore, Wang dismissed the assertion that the situation in the Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly tense. The way he sees it, Asia continues to maintain peace, and even the recent conflict on the border between Cambodia and Thailand was quickly resolved thanks to the efforts of all parties involved.
"China has become a pillar of peace in Asia. As an important force contributing to the maintenance of peace in modern times, China will continue to play a constructive role in ensuring regional peace and stability," he added.

Zelenskyy says Europe’s absence from peace talks is a 'big mistake' as he calls for more sanctions

The Ukrainian leader also called for stronger measures to crack down on Russia's shadow fleet of oil tankers which he described as "floating wallets" for Moscow. Zelenskyy said he's open to an election, but needs ceasefire.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said it is a "big mistake" that European leaders are “practically not present at the table” in ongoing US-brokered negotiations to end the war with Russia.
In a keynote speech at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Zelenskyy said Kyiv is working to ensure that Europe’s “interests and voice are taken into account,” arguing that any sustainable peace must reflect the security concerns of the entire continent, not just Ukraine and the United States.
His remarks echoed comments by French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday who suggested Europe will have to redesign the continent's security architecture independently facing an aggressive Russia on a "sugar high" from war.
Ukraine will hold another round of trilateral talks with the US and Russia next week. The process started in February last year after Washington renewed contact with Moscow, still little progress has been achieved in ending hostilities with no ceasefire in place.
Zelenskyy told the conference he hopes that the upcoming round of negotiations will be “serious, substantive, helpful for all of us” but voiced frustration over how the different parties appear to often be "talking about completely different things."
Russian officials, he said, invoke what they call the “spirit of Anchorage", referring to the bilateral meeting Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump held in the Alaskan city last summer, in which the Russia leader said the "historical origins" of the war would have to be addressed in any peace deal. Ukraine, Zelenskyy said, can only guess at its meaning.
The Ukrainian leader also expressed concern that discussions of “concessions” frequently focus on Ukraine alone, without asking for equal compromises from Russia.
“Too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia,” he added, suggesting that it risks rewarding aggression rather than deterring it. Europe’s absence from key conversations, he added, compounds that imbalance.
Central to Kyiv’s position is a demand for binding security guarantees before any agreement to end the war is signed. European countries, under the Coalition of the Willing format, are expected to shoulder most of the burden on security guarantees, but an American backstop is seen as essential by both Ukraine and the Europeans.
“Peace can only be built on clear, clear security guarantees,” Zelenskyy said. “Where there is no clear security system, war always returns.”
Ukraine, he said, has prepared detailed proposals and is ready to sign agreements on security guarantees with both the United States and European partners, and that he remains "in constant contact" with US envoys, including Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.
Zelenskyy also said he expects to see a precise date for Ukraine's accession to join the EU as part of a peace deal. Earlier, he suggested that date could "technically" be 2027.
Ukraine to hold elections only if it can get a ceasefire
Addressing calls for elections in Ukraine, a demand pushed by Trump, Zelenskyy said he would be open to holding elections if a genuine ceasefire is put in place. Under the threat of bombs, he insisted, Ukraine cannot hold a fair election.
“Give us two months of ceasefire, we will go to elections,” he said, noting the logistical challenge of enabling soldiers on the front lines to cast ballots.
In a jibe at Moscow, Zelenskyy said he would be happy to hold a ceasefire in order for free elections to be held in Russia, where Putin has been in office for two decades.
The Ukrainian leader called on partners to step up measures to ensure the Kremlin's energy revenues run dry. Oil and gas provide the bulk of the financing for Russia's war effort, despite numerous sanctions as a result of circumvention and third countries.
"Russian oil tankers still move freely - freely along Europe’s shores, in the Baltic Sea, in the North Sea,” he said. “In total, Russia still uses more than 1,000 tankers. Each of them is, in fact, a floating wallet for the Kremlin.”
Zelenskyy said he had recently discussed sanctions with French President Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, pushing for Russian tankers at sea to not only be detained but fully blocked and confiscated. The EU is preparing a new sanctions packaged to be unveiled this month as the war enters another year.
"Without oil money, Putin would not have money for this war," Zelenskyy said.

The Simpsons showrunner makes bold prediction on show’s future
- The Simpsons showrunner, Matt Selman, has revealed that if the long-running animated series were to conclude, it would not feature a traditional finale but rather appear as a regular episode.
- Selman stated that the show's characters are designed to reset each week, likening it to Groundhog Day and that a previous episode already parodied typical series finale concepts.
- Currently in its 37th season and having aired 800 episodes, there is speculation that a forthcoming sequel to The Simpsons Movie could serve as the show's ultimate conclusion.
- Despite Selman's comments about characters not dying, the series has recently killed off several figures, including Alice Glick, the church organist, in November.
- Larry the Barfly, a character since season 10, was also killed off the previous year, prompting an explanation from executive producer Tim Long about highlighting the dignity of peripheral characters.

Brazilian skier Lucas Pinheiro Braathen wins South America's first-ever Winter Olympics medal
Brazilian ski racer Lucas Pinheiro Braathen swiped away the competition with a powerful final run in the Olympic giant slalom on Saturday, winning gold and earning South America's first-ever medal at a Winter Games.
With snow falling and fog settling in, the 25-year-old Pinheiro Braathen remained cool and relaxed as he navigated his way through the technical Stelvio course. After seeing his place — No. 1 — he fell to the snow before starting to scream.
He finished in a two-run combined time of 2 minutes, 25 seconds. He beat Swiss racer Marco Odermatt, the defending Olympic champion, by 0.58 seconds. Odermatt's teammate, Loic Meillard, earned the bronze medal.
The Norwegian-born Pinheiro Braathen is the fun-loving, samba-dancing skier who's ready to get this party started. On the back of his helmet, he has in big letters "Vamos Dancar" — "Let's Dance." He represented Norway until October 2023, when he abruptly retired from the sport.
In March 2024, he announced he would return to the alpine skiing circuit, representing Brazil — his mother's native country and where he spent much of his youth.
He's already accomplished plenty of "firsts" with his new country: First Brazilian Alpine racer to finish on a World Cup podium last year and first-ever World Cup win for the country this season. Now, the first Brazilian gold medalist.
Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva celebrated his country's first-ever Winter Olympics medal on his social media channels.
"This unprecedented result shows Brazilian sport has no limits. It is the reflection of talent, dedication and continuous work to strengthen sport in every dimension," Lula said. "Congratulations to Lucas Pinheiro and all the team involved in this historic achievement, which inspires new generations and widens the horizon for Brazilian sport."

Deadly drone strikes cloud US-brokered Russia-Ukraine talks in Geneva
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio hint at difficulties in next week’s talks.
A deadly exchange of drone strikes has killed one person in Ukraine and one in Russia and cast doubts on the prospects of a ceasefire before another round of negotiations to end the war next week.
News of the deaths comes as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio signalled hurdles to reaching an agreement in Geneva as the conflict is about to enter its fifth year.

Zelenskyy told world leaders at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday while he hopes “substantive” progress will be reached during the trilateral meeting next week, it often feels like the two sides “are talking about different things” in negotiations.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” Zelenskyy said.
Rubio said it’s unclear if Moscow truly wants to make a peace deal.
“We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war,” he said before the same Munich event. “We’re going to continue to test it.”
Among the most contentious issues in the negotiations is Russia’s demand for a full withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from the remaining parts of Ukraine’s eastern region of Donetsk that it still controls.
Ukraine has rejected a unilateral pullback and wants Western security guarantees to deter Russia from relaunching its invasion if a ceasefire is reached.
Rubio did not attend a Ukraine-focused meeting with European and NATO leaders held on the sidelines of the first day of the Munich conference on Friday, citing scheduling issues.
In Munich on Saturday, Zelenskyy insisted Russia should not get away with its attack on Ukraine. He said he hoped the United States would stay involved in the peace negotiations and European countries would deepen their involvement.
Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel told Al Jazeera while US President Donald Trump should be credited with moving talks forward, he should put more pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin instead of Zelenskyy.
“Putin has shown no goodwill to come to the table and make a serious deal. The Ukrainians are ready,” van Weel said.
Last week, Zelenskyy said the US had given the warring parties a June deadline to reach a deal, although Trump’s previous ultimatums have not resulted in a breakthrough.
Two previous rounds of trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi, led by US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, reportedly focused on military issues such as a possible buffer zone and ceasefire monitoring.
Zelenskyy later said he spoke with Witkoff and Kushner.
Hundreds of thousands of soldiers and tens of thousands of civilians have been killed since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, according to many estimates, making the war Europe’s deadliest since World War II.
Russia is suffering “crazy losses” in Ukraine with about 65,000 soldiers killed on the battlefield over the last two months, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte told the conference.
Separately, Rutte told a media roundtable the NATO alliance is strong enough that Russia would not currently try to attack it. “We will win every fight with Russia if they attack us now, and we have to make sure in two, four, six years that same is still the case.”
Among the latest casualties was an elderly woman killed on Saturday when a Russian drone hit a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.
On Wednesday, Russian strikes also killed three children, including two-year-old twins and their father in the northeastern region of Kharkiv.
In January alone, Russia launched more than 6,000 drone attacks against Ukraine, according to Zelenskyy. But he added Ukraine will soon produce enough interceptors to make Russia’s Iran-made Shahed drones “meaningless”.
He also told the Munich conference that every power plant in Ukraine has been damaged in Russian attacks.
In Russia, a civilian was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a car in the border region of Bryansk, Governor Alexander Bogomaz said.
The attacks came a day after a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian city of Belgorod near the border with Ukraine killed two people and wounded five, according to Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Gladkov earlier said the attack also caused serious damage to energy facilities and electricity, heating and water supplies were cut off. Three apartment buildings in the city sustained damage, he said.
Ukrainian member of parliament Oleksiy Goncharenko, meanwhile, accused Moscow of launching “energy terror” with attacks on electricity facilities in the heart of winter.
“I can’t call it any other way because when it is minus 20 Celsius in Kyiv and you don’t have heating, you don’t have electricity in your apartment, you’re just freezing and that is awful,” Goncharenko told Al Jazeera in Munich.
“I think it’s time for the United States to put real pressure on Russia. Yes, they are at the table, but it’s time to put real pressure to make them have real negotiations, because what we have today is not real negotiations.”

The wave of misfortune at the Louvre shows no sign of stopping. On Tuesday, February 10, two museum employees were taken into police custody. Both long-time staff members, Le Monde has learned, including one nearing retirement, they were suspected of involvement in a large-scale ticketing fraud, reported by their colleagues and prompting a formal complaint from management in December 2024. Then, during the night of February 12, new misfortune struck: Flooding damaged the ceiling painted by Charles Meynier in 1819, titled The Triumph of French Painting, in a room of the Denon Wing that houses masterpieces by Fra Angelico and Bernardino Luini.
Firefighters arrived immediately on the scene and stopped the leak shortly after midnight, management told Le Monde. On the morning of February 13, a restorer was able to make an initial assessment: The artwork had two tears and areas where the paint layer was lifting. The team of the chief architect for historic monuments, who promptly examined the ceiling's condition, determined there was no structural problem. The space was closed until early afternoon.

Love at 85, 93: Rosh Hashanah romance that began at shul
Unknown

23:33:35 KST

Margie and Hayyim agree on two things: You’re never too old to fall in love, and there’s more than one reason to go to shul.
Rabbi Hayyim Halpern was born in 1930. Margie Tutnauer was born in 1938. When they connected in the fall of 2023, Hayyim was a widower; his wife, Sara Reinharth, had died in 2021.
Margie was also widowed; her husband, Rabbi Moshe Tutnauer, died in 2010. Hayyim and Sara had been married for 69 years; Margie and Moshe for 53.
Hayyim and Moshe had been rabbinical colleagues, and over the years, Hayyim and Margie encountered each other at various rabbinical events. As Margie wryly describes her role at the time: “I was then ‘the wife of.”’
On Rosh Hashanah 2023, Hayyim and Margie were seated in the same section of the Ramot Zion Synagogue in Jerusalem’s French Hill neighborhood.
“I was upset with some young people who were making noise during the service,” recalls Hayyim. Margie came to their defense: “I’m just happy that they’re here with us in the synagogue today.”
That brief exchange sparked a new relationship between Hayyim and Margie, and they began connecting as widow and widower.
Margie lives in French Hill and has been an active member of Ramot Zion for over 40 years, attending Shabbat services regularly. Hayyim began attending Ramot Zion in 2023 after moving into Golden Hill, the assisted living facility in French Hill.
“It was a logical choice,” Hayyim explains. “I’m a Conservative rabbi, and Ramot Zion is a Masorti [Conservative] congregation within walking distance of Golden Hill.”
Soon after Rosh Hashanah, Margie began dropping off reading materials for Hayyim.
“I wanted to call her to thank her,” Hayyim says. “And she made it easy. She left her name, address, and phone number with the front desk. I began to get the impression that this woman was interested in me, and I was very flattered.”
Margie smiles as she recalls her approach.
“After I became a widow in 2010, my friend Benita gave me some good advice. She encouraged me to be proactive and to start dating. Over the years, I met many interesting men. But Hayyim is the best man I’ve met in the past 15 years.”
Hayyim is vocal in his praise of Margie: “Margie has a wonderful smile. She loves to be with people.”
Their relationship soon settled into a comfortable rhythm. They began sitting together at kiddush after Shabbat services, and Hayyim would walk Margie home.
“At one point,” Margie recalls, “after Hayyim had walked me home, I asked him if he’d like to have lunch with me. He did, and of course, I had already thought it through and had lunch ready.”
That became their regular routine: kiddush at Ramot Zion, followed by a walk to Margie’s home for Shabbat lunch. It’s a straight walk that takes them about 30 minutes, including the time they rest on benches along the way.
Spending time with eachother during the week
During the week, they also keep a steady rhythm. While they enjoy life together and spend time with each other’s families, they maintain some independent connections.
Hayyim gives an example: “Most Tuesdays, Margie joins the morning minyan at Ramot Zion, has coffee with friends from the shul, and then comes to my apartment, where we watch movies. We both love old films like Dr. Zhivago and Gone with the Wind.”
He has advice for other couples. “If you don’t agree politically, just don’t talk politics. That’s what works for Margie and me.”
Margie adds, “If we have medical problems, we don’t turn to each other. We turn to our family. And in general, our family comes first.”
Margie is blessed with two sons living in Israel, six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. Hayyim has three daughters, eight grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.
One of his daughters, Alita, lives in Jerusalem and is a member of Ramot Zion.
Margie was born in Detroit to the Weingarden family, who had lived there for four generations. She met Moshe Tutnauer when they were working at Camp Ramah in Wisconsin.
Moshe made aliyah in 1972 from Phoenix, Arizona.
Hayyim and Sara made aliyah in 1992. Before moving to Israel, Hayyim served for more than 25 years as rabbi of the Beth Tikvah Synagogue in New Milford, New Jersey.
He is a graduate of the Jewish Theological Seminary and author of Torah Dialogues, a book based on discussions with his congregants.
Hayyim and Margie are “ringed” to each other – connected by rings that symbolize their comOver the years, many of their Ramah friends made aliyah and settled in French Hill. Margie and commitment to each other. Margie wears Hayyim’s college ring; Hayyim wears a ring that once belonged to Margie’s grandfather.
What advice do Margie and Hayyim have for singles of all ages?
Go to shul.

Tel Aviv nightlife to a rooftop proposal: A modern love story

Love stories have undoubtedly changed since the advent of dating apps, resulting in the darling meet-cute stories becoming at risk of extinction.
Still, romance seems to persevere in the Jewish state, as one couple explained to the Magazine how a game of backgammon in a dingy bar is leading them to make a lifetime commitment.
Tzvi-Bar proposed to Lexi in August, following eight long years of snatching brief moments together across the globe.
The self-proclaimed “nerd” knew from the moment he met Lexi that she would be his wife, and like everything else in the medical student’s life, he approached that certainty with total commitment, doing whatever it took to turn it into reality.
“If you want to do something, you can achieve anything. You just have to work hard for it,” Tzvi-Bar explained.
Lexi made aliyah from New York after spending some additional time in Israel following the completion of her Birthright-Taglit trip.
Enjoying the vibrant nightlife Tel Aviv has to offer on White Night, she tagged along to a bar with a group of friends, accompanied by the soldier who had joined her on the program.
Among the group was Tzvi-Bar, ready and waiting to teach the then-18-year-old how to play backgammon – whether she wanted to learn or not.
“It wasn’t like love at first sight... I mean, he was… super nerdy. He was trying to teach me backgammon. I was, like, drunk at 4 a.m.,” Lexi admitted, while describing how Tzvi-Bar “manifested” their inevitable love story.
With only a month left of her trip, she received a text from Tzvi-Bar, who had gotten her number from a mutual friend.
Couple discovers adventurous side
While their first date was normal – a trip to the shuk, a nice dinner, and some karaoke – the pair quickly discovered they each had an adventurous side.
Within a few dates, Lexi found herself skydiving near Haifa with a man she barely knew, and it was then she realized, “We were on the same page with adventure and trying new things.”
Early into the relationship, Tzvi-Bar told Lexi, “You’re my future wife,” despite knowing she would soon return to the US to start her degree studies at Ithaca College.
Still young, Lexi thought his confidence was “super weird and crazy,” but he proved his dedication with more than just words.
Only a month after Lexi returned to the US, Tzvi-Bar followed. He made the 12-hour journey under the guise of helping his friend move to start studying at Yale but spent most of his days enjoying Lexi’s company.
“I think he was really persistent and determined and saw something in me in the beginning. And now, of course, it’s been eight years, and I really love him,” Lexi said.
Taking turns visiting each other, the pair agreed that whoever finished their studies first would move to be with the other. Tzvi-Bar’s army service meant that Lexi was the one to move, and she happily relocated to Beersheba.
While Tzvi-Bar was the pull she needed to move to Israel, Lexi had dreamed of making aliyah for many years. At only 15, during a brief Gadna course (simulated IDF basic training), she was voted “most likely to make aliyah.”
After years apart, the pair thought they would finally settle together in the heart of southern Israel, but then Tzvi-Bar was accepted to medical school in Poland.
Goal-oriented, Tzvi-Bar knew that in order to provide a good life for his future family and fulfill his dream, he had to accept the spot, but Lexi had already moved across oceans and wasn’t eager to uproot herself again.
The pair were separated once more, though switching places, with Tzvi-Bar residing in the Diaspora. “We really struggled. That was a rough patch in the relationship,” Lexi admitted.
“It was a hard thing because as you get into medical school, that’s a big, exciting thing that’s happening, but there was a duality of ‘I’m happy for you, and I want you to live your dreams. But on the other hand, I just got here, I’m trying really hard to learn a new language, to immerse [myself] in a new culture, and I don’t want to start again,’” he said.
Lexi spent her days working as a pole dancing instructor, acting in English commercials, and performing with the Light Opera Group of the Negev (LOGON), integrating into the country and building a strong group of friends.
For two years, the pair would fly to see each other every chance they got, and now, finally, Tzvi-Bar can finish up his clinical rotation at a hospital in Israel.
Knowing he didn’t want to part from her again, he popped the question in August, planning an elaborate engagement to show his love.
The epitome of “If he wanted to, he would,” Tzvi-Bar told Lexi to get dressed up and get her nails done for a family photo before his sister enlisted in the army and for an anniversary party for his mother and her now ex-wife.
Dolled up and ready for a festive event, Lexi was confused to find herself ushered off the bus to Jaffe early by Tzvi-Bar’s sister. With a sunset making Lexi’s red dress look even brighter, his sister insisted on a photo shoot.
When they arrived at the rooftop of The Arab-Jewish Community Center, Lexi was met with a red carpet extending from the elevator to the center of the room, where Tzvi-Bar was waiting on one knee with a ring.
“He was on his knees with the ring, smiling, and there was a sign, ‘Lexi, marry me,’ with no question mark, just ‘Lexi, marry me,’” she recounted. “It was really cute. He didn’t walk up to me or take me, I had to get to him while crying…he never moved. He was like a statue.
“He invited two friends each. So there were four people and his sister. It was really, really cute… and during sunset.”
Asked how she knew Tzvi-Bar was a person worth making the move for and then waiting for in a new country, Lexi described how he made her feel and how he demonstrated his commitment through action.
“I would describe him as super normal,” Lexi said, despite her early impression of him.
“I found someone very grounded, who knows what he wants to do with his life. He’s going to be a doctor, and he’s very passionate about it… He’s on a week and a half break in Israel, and he already spent one day in Jerusalem doing a Magen David Adom ambulance shift.”
Lexi explained that it was his genuine acts of kindness she had witnessed – like how he helped fix her elderly neighbor’s outlets to make them safe – that showed her he had the soul of someone she could trust.
Asked how she knew Tzvi-Bar was the real deal and not just another charming Israeli man, known colloquially as a “Tomer,” Lexi said she might have felt differently had he been one of the soldiers on her Taglit trip, noting the reputation of such men.
Tzvi-Bar also “never had a party phase,” indicating to her that he had more genuine intentions.
“I think everyone has to make their own judgment,” she asserted.
“Like, is this person serious? Is this like a lifelong commitment type of thing, or is it a fling? I wouldn’t move whole countries for something that’s not for sure. Like, is this the father of my children, you know?
“I feel that I found a gem. People in our day and age, people like him, are either friendzoned or not appreciated because they’re [in] the nerd community…
“I think the lesson is: We need to appreciate the nerds more. You have to find them because they’re really hard to find, and they’re really, really special,” Lexi advised.

Ukraine’s path to the European Union is a challenging negotiation on laws, regulations, and democratic principles. But it also involves inclusion in the European economic system, where logistics connections will play a strategic role for trade and security.
We discussed this with Mario Mauro, member of the European parliament and former Italian defense minister, who was appointed European Coordinator for the Baltic, Black Sea, and Aegean Sea Transport Corridors by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. His tasks include extending European corridors to Ukraine, which entails huge investments in transport and infrastructure.

Ugo Poletti: How was the TEN-T policy reshaped by the EU’s understanding of Ukraine’s needs of safe transports, security, and resilience towards economic shocks?
Mario Mauro: For decades, we as Europeans built our peace and thrived around an idea that was once unimaginable between countries that had sat on opposite sides of the trenches during WWII: freedom of circulation of goods and people. To achieve this, we started opening our borders and began thinking in ways that, years later, led us to establish the TEN‑T (Trans-European Transport Network) policy.
Europe Deserves Seat at Ukraine Peace Talks, Says Polish FM
An interconnected Europe is a continent that can face unprecedented challenges; it is ready to deliver for its citizens when climate change threatens forests in Greece or Portugal. An interconnected Europe can be resilient and ensure that all our critical infrastructures are safe from hybrid threats. An interconnected Europe shows that the future of Ukraine, Moldova, and the Western Balkans lies within the EU, against those ghosts of the past that we are once again called to dismantle – showing that together we can endure challenges as one united continent.
Do you believe that transport infrastructure has now become a component of Europe’s defence architecture? If so, is this new role reflected in TEN-T planning and priorities?
Strategic infrastructure such as railways has always been dual-use throughout the history of modern transportation. Russian aggression has brought back into focus the crucial role played by Ukrainian railways, which – thanks to their expertise and unbreakable spirit – allowed thousands of civilians to evacuate safely from the frontline, while also protecting military supply chains at the front.
All of this – and this may sound shocking to some – was achieved while keeping ordinary public transport intact along the lines, for however “ordinary” a state of war can be, I would add.
What we are working toward is a capillary, durable, and modern infrastructure that can deliver quickly under the greatest pressure on member states. Defense, by its very essence, is a key pillar of a strategically interconnected transport grid.
Among my duties as Coordinator, a key priority is the unification of gauge systems in Finland and Eastern Europe, improving readiness and reducing response times to the bare minimum for member states in case of need. This is one of my priorities for the coming months, together with all our partners along the corridor.
Ukraine and Moldova became a front line of strategic competition. How does this affect the EU’s long-term vision for connectivity in Eastern Europe and the Black Sea basin?
I will be very direct on this point: we need to deliver at all levels of cooperation within member states and with our partners in the region – Ukraine and Moldova in the first place. Connectivity is the backbone of competitiveness, and this must be our compass for action.
We have gone far in enhancing our transport capacity along the Corridor, but we need to go the extra mile – enhancing not only capability and interoperability, but also strengthening our critical and energy infrastructure, avoiding bottlenecks, and guaranteeing access to affordable, sustainable, and abundant energy. This energy should circulate freely within the system, providing relief during peak periods and redistributing supply to regions where it is most needed.
As TEN-T Coordinator also for the Black Sea, what are the main challenges in synchronizing national priorities within a single European corridor?
As TEN‑T Coordinator, my task is to build consensus and promote corridor thinking and mindset. I believe we must keep the focus on functional continuity and long‑term European connectivity, rather than reasoning solely in terms of individual national projects.
This becomes crucial in regions such as the Black Sea and Baltic corridors, where scaling up resources and bringing together good practices and diverse ideas on how to reach shared targets has proven, without any doubt, to be the winning strategy.
The key to the success of the TEN‑T project is to start moving together, giving regions the opportunity to generate European added value. As at the start of Europe’s political journey, solidarity and step‑by‑step cooperation – solving problems and improving citizens’ lives – will allow us to complete the Union by embracing all regions and like‑minded partners.
In practical terms, how does the coordination between European funding instruments and national budgets work? What mechanisms ensure that investments are coherent rather than fragmented?
Instruments such as the TEN‑T Regulation and the Core Network Corridors, together with national work plans, provide a shared reference framework guiding both EU funding (e.g. CEF) and national investment decisions.
What is important is that EU funds are designed to act as catalysts, not substitutes, for national budgets. Grants are combined with national co‑financing. Another powerful instrument is EIB loans; the EIB is a crucial partner in this journey, with whom I am fully aligned, and as coordinators we will have a key meeting next month.
Finally, funding is increasingly linked to project maturity, taking into account cross‑border impact and contribution to corridor objectives, thereby reducing the risk of fragmented or overlapping investments.
How do you define “energy efficiency of transport” within the TEN-T framework, and why has it become a strategic priority for the EU?
Energy efficiency goes hand in hand with energy security. The TEN‑T framework is also closely linked to the interconnection of energy facilities. A memorable achievement was last year, when the Baltic states officially disconnected from the Russian power grid.
Recent developments and intelligence gathered in the field show us that hybrid threats and energy disruptions are real, and that they can target our hospitals, ports, and power grids.
How does improving the energy efficiency of transport corridors contribute to Europe’s energy security and resilience, especially in times of crisis or conflict?
To answer this, I think the only thing I should point to when discussing energy security is the brutality Russia has repeatedly shown by targeting power plants and energy supplies in Ukraine – leaving families, children, and hospitals without power in the depths of winter, with temperatures reaching -27°C. This is what we must bear in mind when we speak about energy security.
Why are measures like electrification of railways and ports energy independence particularly critical for the Black Sea and Eastern European connectivity today?
Rail and maritime transport are essential for providing high-capacity, energy-efficient, and resilient connectivity for long‑distance freight. In the Black Sea region, they are crucial for linking ports, the Danube, and hinterland markets – especially where road capacity and border crossings are constrained.
Key measures include a modal shift from road to rail and inland waterways, rail electrification, and shore‑side electricity and renewable energy in ports. Digital traffic management and interoperability systems will further reduce congestion, fuel use, and energy waste.
What are the main bottlenecks in rail connections between Ukrainian ports and the EU, and how can they be addressed in the short and medium term?
The main bottlenecks are, first and foremost, gauge differences, as well as limited border capacity, infrastructure in need of upgrading and strengthening, and a shortage of intermodal terminals.
TEN-T provides a technical, regulatory, and investment roadmap that allows Ukraine to align its infrastructure standards with those of the EU well before full accession. This enables early integration, accelerating processes through compatible networks, shared priorities, and coordinated, ambitious funding.
Nevertheless, it is impossible to ignore the elephant in the room: the unlawful and brutal aggression by Moscow must come to an end, and Putin must be brought to negotiations that are accepted and agreed upon by our allies and partners in Kyiv.
Describe what the success of the Black Sea TEN-T Corridor could look like in 10 years, from an economic, strategic and political perspective.
Success would mean a fully connected, interoperable, and resilient corridor supporting trade, reconstruction, and energy security. Strategically, it would strengthen Europe’s eastern connectivity; politically, it would anchor the Black Sea region more firmly within the EU’s future.
And a small – perhaps naïve – aspect in such a complex world would be imagining the corridor as a hub for people carrying their wishes and aspirations, not only as an aseptic system for the economic mobility of goods.

European nations say Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with dart frog toxin
Five European countries say tests confirm Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin found in poison frogs, and they blame the Russian state
- Bookmark
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a rare and lethal toxin found in the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the U.K., France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis of samples taken from Navalny's body “conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” It is a neurotoxin found in the skin of dart frogs in South America that is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
The countries said in a joint statement that “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.” They said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
They made the announcement as Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya attended the Munich Security Conference in Germany as the second anniversary of Navalny's death approaches.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest foe, died in an Arctic penal colony on Feb. 16, 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat," British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said. "By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
Navalny’s widow, said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before he died. Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny’s death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.
Navalnaya said Saturday that she had been “certain from the first day” that her husband had been poisoned, “but now there is proof.”
“Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon,” she wrote on social network X, calling Putin “a murderer” who “must be held accountable.”
Russian authorities said that the politician became ill after a walk and died from natural causes.
Epibatidine is found naturally in dart frogs in the wild, and can also be manufactured in a lab, which European scientists suspect was the case with the substance used on Navalny. It works on the body in a similar way to nerve agents, causing shortness of breath, convulsions, seizures, a slowed heart rate and ultimately death.
Navalny was the target of an earlier poisoning in 2020, with a nerve agent in an attack he blamed on the Kremlin, which always denied involvement. His family and allies fought to have him flown to Germany for treatment and recovery. Five months later, he returned to Russia, where he was immediately arrested and imprisoned for the last three years of his life.
The U.K. has accused Russia of repeatedly flouting international bans on chemical and biological weapons. It has accused the Kremlin of carrying out a 2018 attack in the English city of Salisbury that targeted a former Russian intelligence officer, Sergei Skripal, with the nerve agent Novichok. A British inquiry concluded that the attack “must have been authorized at the highest level, by President Putin.”
The Kremlin has denied involvement.

In Munich, Zelenskyyy, US Congress senators discuss sanctions against Russia, security guarantees for Ukraine
In Munich, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting with a bipartisan delegation of U.S. senators: Lindsey Graham, Richard Blumenthal, Chris Murphy, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Sheldon Whitehouse, Peter Welch, Mark Kelly, Lisa Murkowski, Jacky Rosen, Elissa Slotkin, Andy Kim, Roger Wicker, and Ruben Gallego.
“The Head of State thanked the senators for their unwavering bipartisan support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people and expressed special gratitude to the United States of America for the air defense systems that have saved thousands of lives, as well as for the PURL initiative. Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal the Order of Yaroslav the Wise, I class,” the presidential press service reported.
The senators expressed their support for Ukraine and noted the courage of Ukrainian warriors.
Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine needs additional generators and transformers to enhance energy resilience and additional air defense missiles to protect infrastructure from Russian shelling.
“We are facing too many attacks every day – two major large-scale attacks in one week. Throughout the winter, there were massive attacks involving 300–500 Iranian drones, as well as 25–45 missiles, mostly ballistic,” the Head of State said.
Special attention was given to the negotiation process and the meetings of the negotiating teams. The President emphasized that increasing pressure on Russia through stronger sanctions could significantly intensify diplomatic efforts. The senators support the position that pressure on the Russian leader should be increased and stated their firm determination to pass a sanctions bill against Russia in the near future.
“I believe that Putin is not ready for serious negotiations. I think we have made progress, but he believes that over time he will be able to seize Donbas. And he will not stop until the pressure increases,” Graham said.
The meeting also addressed work on security guarantees for Ukraine. Zelenskyy noted that clarity and precise understanding of each point are crucial for the Ukrainian society’s trust in the security guarantees document. No one wants a repeat of the Budapest Memorandum. That is why it is extremely important for all Ukrainians that the security guarantees be ratified by the United States Congress.
In their comments, the senators emphasized their support for strong and reliable security guarantees that will provide the necessary protection and prevent a recurrence of aggression.
In addition, the President provided a detailed update on the situation on the frontline and the level of Russian losses.

EU membership for Ukraine by 2027 is not ruled out, enlargement commissioner says
European Enlargement Commissioner Marta Kos has said the current EU enlargement methodology was designed for peacetime and is in need of radical change.
Source: Kos speaking at the 9th Ukrainian Lunch organised by Victor Pinchuk Foundation on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Kos said Ukraine has already "contributed positively to Europe" by forcing the EU to rethink its priorities and putting enlargement back on the agenda.
Quote: "Second, we know again how important security in Europe is. Perhaps we have forgotten."
More details: Kos acknowledged that under the EU's current legal framework, it is not possible to complete the tasks Ukraine has set for itself.
Quote: "The methodology we are using now is made for peace. It's made for times when we have really enough time that the country can do all the necessary reforms. Sweden, just as an example, was the most developed country applying for the EU membership, but even Sweden needed three years.
So, based on the present methodology, it's not possible by 1 January 2027. But we have to find the solution, how to bridge the gap between the merit-based principle and methodology which we use plus-minus for the last forty years, and the geopolitical challenges on the other side. We cannot wait anymore."
More details: Kos said discussions on this have already begun, but she did not go into detail.
She emphasised that Ukraine's EU accession should be seen not only as enlargement, but as a geopolitical necessity.
Quote: "It is unifying Europe, and it is for the first time ever we have the possibility, if we do it right, to do unification of Europe. And this is what is much, much bigger than just enlargement."

Background:
- Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said earlier in Munich that a fast-track agreement on EU accession is realistic. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has also said that agreeing on a specific date for Ukraine's EU accession is possible.
- A recent opinion poll showed that support among Ukrainians for joining the EU has risen sharply.

Palestinian leader Abbas urges removal of all Israeli 'obstacles' on Gaza ceasefire
Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas called on Saturday for the removal of "all obstacles" he said Israel has imposed on implementing phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.
"We emphasise the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement," Abbas said, in a speech read by his prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the daily governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to "ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery", the president said.
Abbas accused Israel of "continuing to violate" the ceasefire agreement with Palestinian group Hamas that took effect in October and was backed by the United States.
"From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed (in Gaza), which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase," he added.
Even though the US-brokered truce entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas trading blame.
The deal is aimed at permanently ending the Gaza war and was endorsed in November by the United Nations.
The second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilisation force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
'A number of conditions'
The Israeli army still controls more than half of the Gaza Strip, while Hamas and Israel accuse each other daily of ceasefire violations.
Fifteen Palestinian experts on the technocratic committee, which is being overseen by a "Board of Peace" set up by US President Donald Trump, are currently based in Egypt, despite a partial reopening on February 2 of the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel.
Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian diplomat whom Trump named high representative for Gaza, said on Friday that "a number of conditions need to be met" before technocratic committee members can enter the Palestinian territory.
"One, Hamas needs to transfer the civilian control of the institutions in Gaza," he told a discussion on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"This is not a government coming in after an election. This is far much more complicated," he said.
"Because Hamas has been governing Gaza for 20 years and... implementing policies that are not in line with Palestinian legislation," he added.
Other conditions he mentioned included ending Gaza ceasefire violations and "a radical increase in the assistance to people, aid going into Gaza".
"And finally, we need to make sure that we have the framework agreed in place on the decommissioning of weapons in Gaza," Mladenov said, emphasising the importance of the future role of a Palestinian security force.
He said the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for the territory -- set out under the Trump plan to end the war -- "is extremely important".
"But far more important than the ISF is the new Palestinian security force that should be deployed in Gaza, that should be able to secure the ground with the assistance of the ISF," he added.

Qatar emir, UAE president discuss regional, international developments in Abu Dhabi
Leaders stress coordination, diplomacy and regional de-escalation efforts
ISTANBUL
Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani met on Saturday UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Abu Dhabi to discuss regional and international developments, with a focus on the Middle East.
The Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported that the two leaders exchanged views on current global and regional challenges, including the Middle East, and efforts aimed at advancing de-escalation.
Both sides emphasized the importance of continued coordination and underscored the need to prioritize dialogue and diplomatic solutions to reinforce security and stability and support development across the region.
The leaders also reviewed the close fraternal ties between Qatar and the UAE and explored ways to strengthen cooperation for the benefit of both peoples.
Sheikh arrived in Abu Dhabi earlier Saturday on what Emirati and Qatari media described as a “fraternal” visit.
The visit comes amid steadily improving relations between Doha and Abu Dhabi following the January 2021 Al-Ula agreement, which ended a diplomatic rift lasting more than three years between Doha and several Gulf states.
Sheikh Mohamed also received visits described as “fraternal” from Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Monday and Bahrain’s Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa on Friday.

Zelensky's calls for harassing Russian athletes highlight his Nazi essence — MFA

ST. PETERSBURG, February 14. /TASS/. Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has condemned Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky's recent calls for harassment of Russian athletes, suggesting that his rhetoric exposes a neo-Nazi inclination. Zakharova recalled Zelensky's expressed horror at the presence of numerous Russian athletes at the Winter Olympics in Italy, along with his demands for similar actions from other nations.
"If that's not neo-Nazism, then what is?" she asked. Zakharova emphasized that such calls to target athletes based on their nationality and to incite hostility reflect the very essence of neo-Nazism. "This is precisely what neo-Nazism looks like - calls for discrimination and harassment based on ethnicity or nationality," she remarked.
Zakharova noted that Zelensky is calling for the persecution of those who "came solely to showcase their talents and abilities, as well as the work they've put into developing them."
"If they're not simply perceived on the basis of their nationality, because their national character and national cultural values can be noted, but are instead persecuted - it’s the limit," she emphasized.
"Various peoples in Europe were similarly persecuted in the 1930s, including Jews. Slavs were also persecuted, and then physically exterminated. Roma were also persecuted, along with other peoples who were declared unworthy of either existence or participation in certain events," Zakharova recalled. "You understand, this is monstrous.".

Russia poisoned Putin critic Navalny in prison with ‘rare toxin’: European states
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – Five European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, accused Russia of poisoning opposition leader Alexei Navalny
“The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” the countries said in a joint statement, following “analyses of samples” from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
The epibatidine toxin, found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America, was found in samples and “highly likely resulted in his death”, the European states said.
“Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death,” the British Foreign Office added in a statement.
Mr Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya said it was now “science-proven” that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
“Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband,” Ms Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
“I was, of course, certain that it was a murder... but back then, it was just words. But today, these words have become science-proven facts.”
In September, she said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found that Mr Navalny was killed by poisoning
“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice,” British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Ms Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
The countries said they had reported Russia to the world’s chemical weapons watchdog – the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons – over the finding.
“We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons,” the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Mr Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Mr Putin’s inner circle. AFP

Zelensky, Rutte discuss funding and further development of PURL program
According to Ukrinform, Zelensky stated this on Facebook.
According to Zelensky, Ukraine highly appreciates the contribution of every state.
"We are counting on continued funding for this initiative, which enables us to purchase missiles for air defense systems," he noted.
Zelensky said he also discussed with Rutte cooperation with partners to strengthen Ukraine's ability to protect lives and the opening of joint defense enterprises in Europe.
"I thank Mark for the meeting and for his consistent support. I am also grateful for the highly productive meeting in the Ramstein format – partners confirmed the allocation of EUR 38 billion in military aid for Ukraine. And that is truly significant," Zelensky emphasized.
As reported by Ukrinform, Rutte believes that Ukraine will continue to receive military equipment through the PURL initiative and that sufficient funds will be raised for this purpose.

The Turkish landing ship TCG Sancaktar delivered about a dozen M60 and M48 tanks to the port of Mogadishu in Somalia.
Immediately after unloading, eyewitnesses recorded the transport of combat vehicles through the streets of the capital on video, according to OSINT analyst Rich Tedd.
The delivery of the tanks coincided with the start of operations by the Turkish Navy in the country’s territorial waters.
The M48 Patton tank appeared in the United States in the early 1950s as a replacement for the M47 tank.
The first versions were equipped with a 90 mm gun, but were later upgraded to the standard 105 mm gun. The tank has a hemispherical turret and a distinctive hull shape for better shell deflection.
The M60 was developed based on the M48 model. It was equipped with a 105 mm M68 rifled gun. The hull and turret armor were made of cast steel.
This vehicle became the main battle tank of many NATO countries in the second half of the 20th century.

Spectacular finds in Germany: What bog bodies tell us about the time of the Germanic tribes
Unknown

Was it murder, a burial, an accident or even a religious sacrifice? Around 60 bog bodies in Germany tell stories from long ago. Some of the details are astonishing and science was not always entirely correct.
The child from Windeby, the man from Dahmendorf, the skull from Osterby - all have one thing in common: they have been dead for around 2,000 years, and we only know that they exist because they died or were buried in the bog.
The wet, peaty environment has led to some of these Iron Age people being mummified. As so-called bog mummies, they now lie in museums in northern Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands and tell stories from long ago.
According to the Federal Agency for Nature Conservation, more than 90 per cent of Germany's moors have been drained and are now bearing the consequences of climate change while accelerating it. This is because the dry areas release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
However, most of the finds come from earlier times when peat was still being mined. Around 60 bog bodies have been found under this special soil in Germany. They are well preserved by the bog - and leave behind untold stories.
Bog body found: A cold case for science
There are many reasons why a corpse ends up in a bog: It could be an attempt to conceal a murder, a burial, an accident, a punishment or a religious sacrifice. Each individual finding must therefore be interpreted on a case-by-case basis. The cause of death, possible injuries and the position of the body help archaeologists with the interpretation, but the answer is not always clear.
In 1871, peat workers discovered a body in Heidmoor. More than bones, even parts of clothing were still recognisable. Investigations then revealed that it must have been a man aged 40 to 50. The researchers later named him the Man of Rendswühren, after the place where he was found.
On his foot was a bandage made of cowhide. The body was forensically examined immediately after it was recovered. A triangular wound in the skull could still be recognised above the right eye. The back of the head and parietal bone were shattered.
The fact that the skull was missing was revealed only by a computed tomography scan of the bog body, carried out in 2005. It is assumed to have been removed during the initial examination in 1871. The scalp was probably stiffened by other substances at the time.
According to the clothing and after finalising the investigations, the scientists dated the find to the second or third century AD. Nothing more is known about its origin, and its cause of death is also not definitively known.
In other cases, the investigations revealed more details, but the first assumption is not always the result of science.
How the 'girl from Windeby' became the 'Windeboy'
When peat workers were digging peat in the Domslandmoor on 19 May 1952, they came across human bones. They surmised that it was a thigh bone and stopped their work. The police later consulted the archaeologists at Gottorf Castle. Eventually, the body is recovered intact, and the find ends up in the museum.
It is probably the most famous bog body in Germany. Partly because her gender had initially been wrongly determined. She was accused of being an adulteress, and the corpse was labelled the "Windeboy".
Moor preserves the human being, so the dead person was well preserved, an incredibly interesting project for researchers. Several investigations revealed that it must have been a person from the Iron Age, and the radiocarbon method dated the time of death to between 41 BC and 118 AD.
Because the bones appear so graceful, she is henceforth known as the "Girl of Windeby". Because of her posture and possible gestures, as well as a cloth over her eyes and the shaved left side of her head, scientists are puzzling over whether she could be a convicted adulteress from Germanic times.
A second body found a few weeks later seems to support this theory. The remains of a less well-preserved man could indicate that he had been strangled.
Years later, researchers began to doubt the story. And found out that the two bog bodies had probably not lived at the same time. The body that was found later must have been around 150 to 300 years older.
In 2006, further investigations also revealed that the "girl from Windeby" could have been a 16-year-old boy. "I'm calling him Windeboy," jokes anthropologist and forensic scientist Heather Gill-Robinson after her discovery. The child apparently acquired his stature because he is said to have often suffered from hunger and malnutrition.
Bog bodies currently in Denmark
For modernisation work at Schloss Gottorf Schleswig, the mummies travelled to a location 200 kilometres away and even crossed a national border.
"These are unique treasures, and the fact that we have been entrusted with these irreplaceable treasures is an expression of the great trust and goodwill between our museums and countries," emphasises Ole Nielsen, Director of the Danish Silkeborg Museum.
Since October 2025, the exhibition in Silkeborg has included the world's largest collection of well-preserved bog bodies. It also includes examples of bog bodies that exist only as skeletons because they were laid down in a type of bog other than a raised bog, where soft tissue can be preserved.

BUDAPEST, February 14. /TASS/. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban calmly responded to Vladimir Zelensky's latest insult, but warned him that Ukraine will not become a member of the European Union.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Zelensky said Orban was "growing a belly" instead of building up his army. "Dear Vladimir Zelensky, thank you for your latest campaign speech in support of Ukraine's accession to the European Union. It will significantly help Hungarians see the situation more clearly. However, you're misunderstanding something: this discussion isn't about me or you. It's about the future of Hungary, Ukraine, and Europe. That's precisely why you can't become a member of the European Union," Orban wrote on his social media page.
The Hungarian government has repeatedly stated that it will not allow Ukraine's hasty accession to the EU, as it would create a threat of a direct military confrontation with Russia and cause significant harm to the European economy.

Trump administration seeking tech firm data on Americans critical of immigration agents: Reports
Homeland Security issued hundreds of administrative subpoenas to tech firms for information on anonymous accounts critical of ICE agents
ISTANBUL
Amid its controversial immigrant crackdown, the Trump administration is reportedly broadening its effort to track Americans critical of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), requesting user data from tech firms on people who have voiced opposition to the agency.
Hundreds of administrative subpoenas from the Department of Homeland Security in recent months have been served on Google, Reddit, Discord, and Meta -- which owns US-based social media platforms Facebook and Instagram -- four government officials and tech employees with direct knowledge of the matter told The New York Times, according to a report published Friday.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to comment publicly.
Google, Meta, and Reddit complied with some government legal demands seeking identifying details of anonymous accounts critical of ICE, officials said. The New York Times reviewed two subpoenas sent to Meta in recent months.
The companies said they evaluate such requests before complying and, in some cases, notify users, giving them time to challenge the order in court.
“The government is taking more liberties than they used to,” said Steve Loney, a supervising attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania. “It’s a whole other level of frequency and lack of accountability.”
The ACLU also argued at a Jan. 14 court hearing in California that the government is using such administrative subpoenas to target people whose speech it does not agree with.
The department said it has “broad administrative subpoena authority” but did not directly respond to questions about the requests. In court filings, its lawyers argued the information is being sought to help protect ICE agents operating in the field.
The Trump administration has defended such controversial tactics as ICE officers wearing masks and no identifying information, and refusing to give their names, saying the officers have been targeted by ICE critics, but provided little evidence of this.
The report comes amid a large-scale ICE crackdown on immigrants across many states, sweeping up longtime residents of the US, as well as some asylum seekers, with the death of at least two US citizens who voiced opposition. Opinion polls have also shown widespread public opposition to ICE and its tactics.
The NYT said Meta, Reddit, and Discord declined to provide comment on its story.

Russia poisoned opposition politician Alexei Navalny with a toxin from a poison dart frog, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom said on Saturday.
The five governments made the announcement at the Munich Security Conference, two years after news broke during the same event of the pro-democracy campaigner’s death in a Russian prison.
Analyses of samples from Navalny’s body “conclusively confirmed” the presence of a toxin called epibatidine, which is found in poison dart frogs in South America and could only have been deployed by Russia, the countries said in a joint statement.

UK, allies say they're convinced Kremlin critic Navalny was poisoned

LONDON, Feb 14 - Britain, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands are convinced that late Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with a lethal toxin in an Arctic penal colony two years ago, they said in a joint statement on Saturday.
The five governments said their findings were based on analyses of samples from Navalny's body, which they said "conclusively" confirmed the presence of epibatidine, a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America and not found naturally in Russia.
Russia has also been reported to the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons over the breach, the statement issued in London said. The Russian government has repeatedly denied any responsibility for Navalny's death.
Navalny died in an Arctic prison colony in February 2024, and was convicted of extremism and other charges, all of which he denied. His team and his widow Yulia Navalnaya have since accused Putin of ordering his murder.
He died "while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him," the joint statement said, adding that the findings showed Russia needed to be held accountable for "its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons."
In a separate statement, British foreign minister Yvette Cooper, who met Navalny's widow at the Munich Security Conference, said that the findings were "shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice." REUTERS

The original Epstein? FBI is holding thousands of files on Detroit millionaire and his sinister island

The original Epstein? FBI is holding thousands of files on Detroit millionaire and his sinister island
Before Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes shocked the world, another wealthy bachelor built his own secret operation on a remote, private island in Lake Michigan. One podcaster tells Andrea Cavallier how he has picked up the cold case - and is trying to expose what authorities failed to do
- Bookmark
North Fox Island looks idyllic from the air – shaped like a teardrop, dense with forest and edged with sandy shores. It’s surrounded by the cold blue waters of Lake Michigan and located 19 miles off the coast of the Leelanau Peninsula.
In the 1970s, the uninhabited island belonged to Francis “Frank” Shelden, a Detroit millionaire with a Yale degree, a prestigious family name, and a reputation as a philanthropist.
Shelden bought the island from a widow for $20,000 and carved out an airstrip, dug miles of dirt trails, and built cabins deep into the woods. Transportation to and from the island was, and still is to this day, limited. The island - just two miles wide and one mile long - could have been considered paradise.
But investigators later uncovered the island’s disturbing purpose – an elaborate child sexual abuse ring operating behind the front of a summer camp for disadvantaged boys.
The only arrest was of Shelden’s co-conspirator, Gerald Richards. Richards was a gym teacher who moonlighted as a magician. The operation on the island was exposed when one of his students told their mother about inappropriate conduct by Richards in gym class.
Richards pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. But Shelden, who reportedly got word from another co-conspirator that the police were investigating, fled the country. He was never caught.
The secret operation, disguised as Brother Paul’s Children’s Mission, was promoted as a retreat or summer camp for boys. But an investigation later uncovered evidence that these boys were transported to the island by private plane for depraved sex acts. The number of victims is unknown, but authorities believe there are at least dozens, if not hundreds.
The case has haunting similarities to the Jeffrey Epstein saga, which has come under renewed public scrutiny this year. The Trump administration has released millions of files on the late financier’s sex trafficking operations of underage girls and women, entangling dozens of rich and powerful people.
Like Shelden, Epstein had an island of his own - Little St. James, which locals nicknamed “Pedophile Island,” is a private paradise in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
And similar to Shelden’s case, only Epstein’s accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been convicted of a crime. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison on sex trafficking charges. Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial.
The similarities are not lost on Colin Browen, a documentary filmmaker and podcast host who is working on an investigative docuseries with author and investigative journalist J Ruben Appleman about Shelden’s operation. It’s set to be released later this year.
“Essentially, Frank Shelden was the Jeffrey Epstein of the 1970s,” Browen told The Independent. “It’s as simple as that.”
Browen, who launched The Paranormal Files and Murder in America, began to look into the North Fox Island saga when he noticed there was a lack of coverage on organized pedophilia.
“Somewhere along the way, when we were doing these stories, I started noticing that there was a certain type of crime that wasn’t being covered – and that was organized pedophilia,” Browen said.
“I found the story one day,” he said about Shelden’s case. “And I couldn’t believe what I was reading, and I just went on TikTok, made a video... and two years later, I found myself on North Fox Island actually investigating the crimes for myself.”
Browen’s investigation has taken him outside of Michigan, as far as the Netherlands, Amsterdam, Germany and India, places where it’s believed Shelden continued to commit pedophilia crimes. He claims to have spoken to new victims of Shelden, along with alleged perpetrators.
The project “challenges how wealth, power, and institutional protection have historically shielded perpetrators from accountability and why these patterns continue today,” he said.
But Browen believes there is more information about Shelden’s case that officials have not released. After multiple requests with the FBI and other agencies, he is now suing the FBI for access to more than 1,047 unreleased files in the Shelden case, after the bureau claimed that it would take more than six years to redact the documents.
Brother Paul’s Nature Camp: A Front for Abuse
When Browen visited North Fox Island in 2024, he was reminded how eerily silent it was.
Some of the cabins that were built for Shelden’s camp were still standing, the same structures described by the boys in the files he had been examining for months.
“They described CSAM being recorded, torturous sexual abuse, horrific things happening on the Island,” Browen said about what he had read in the files.
CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is a term now used by Law enforcement and child protection organizations to accurately reflect crimes against children.
Shelden was born into Michigan royalty – a descendant of Russell Alger, a lumber baron and the state’s 20th governor who later served as President William McKinley’s secretary of war.
A 1975 Detroit Free Press profile described Shelden as a wealthy bachelor who had graduated from Yale University with a master’s degree in geology from Wayne State University. He also served in the Michigan Air Guard and volunteered with the Big Brothers club. Shelden never married.
In 1975, Shelden opened Brother Paul’s Nature Camp, a tax-exempt charitable trust and a mission that promised tutoring, counseling, and outdoor experiences for troubled boys.
His partner, Gerald Richards, was a Catholic school gym teacher and traveling magician who recruited children to the camp – often his own students. Shelden was the “figurehead in this operation,” but he also had co-conspirators, Browen explained. And one of those was Richards.
“He was actually caught for this. He's kind of like Ghislaine Maxwell in this story in a way,” Browen said. “He would help get children.”
Mike Dunsmore, a fire chief in Greenwood Township, Michigan, was a former student of Richards. He told During a Click On Detroit interview in 2019, Dunsmore recalled a number of horrific stories from his time at the camp. Including a time in which Richards ordered other boys to bury him in the sand while he was naked.
Escape from justice
Shelden and Richards were not the only ones linked to the horrific crimes. Dyer Grossman and Adam Starchild were also named in both Detroit police reports and case files with the FBI.
But when the investigation into the camp began in 1976, and Richards was arrested, both Shelden and Grossman evaded capture by fleeing the United States.
“Somehow, he was given enough time to go through all of his properties and destroy all the evidence, every file, everything, and that’s officially where the trail ends on Sheldon,” Browen claims about Shelden.
Starchild was questioned about his alleged involvement in Shelden’s operation, but there was not sufficient evidence to charge him.
The US Attorney’s Office in Detroit issued an arrest warrant charging Shelden with criminal sexual conduct, a felony in Michigan, involving the procurement and sexual activities involving young boys ages 8-14 in the Port Huron and Traverse City areas.
Both Shelden and Grossman were declared fugitives of justice. Shelden fled to the Netherlands, eventually married a French woman to obtain citizenship, and reportedly continued abusing boys across Europe, according to Browen, who plans to chronicle the new findings in his docuseries.
There are reports that Shelden died in Amsterdam in 1996, but details are limited.
“There’s a marriage certificate for him,” Browen said. “And he’s got a death certificate in Amsterdam, and that's it.”
Richards pleaded guilty to charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct. On September 13, 1976, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, according to a Michigan State Police report.
He testified about his role in the pedophile ring at a congressional hearing on child abuse in 1977, stating that Brother Paul Nature Camp was designed to victimize children and evade taxes. Richards is reported to have died in 1998 by suicide.
There is little information about Grossman and Starchild in the years after the ring was busted. It’s unclear if either man is still alive.
Is there a possible link to unsolved child murders?
The abuse at North Fox Island was taking place at the same time as another notorious Michigan crime - the Oakland County child murders.
Between February 1976 and March 1977, four children were abducted and murdered in Oakland County. Their killer, or killers, have never been arrested for their murders.
The victims were Mark Stebbins, 12; Jill Robinson, 12; Kristine Mihelich, 10; and Timothy King, 11. Police believe only the boys had been sexually assaulted. The cause of death in three of the cases is listed as suffocation, but Jill Robinson was murdered with a shotgun.
But there has been persistent speculation that the killings were linked to the child pornography ring on North Fox Island, which was investigated by police in 1977.
Investigators do not believe Shelden or Richards could have been the Oakland County Child Killer, but one theory suggests the killer could be someone they victimized on the island, Click on Detroit reported.
“We were the first to look at pornography and pornography rings and pedophilia as being a motive in this (Oakland County Child Killer) case,” former Wayne County Detective Cory Williams told The Shattered podcast as reported by Click on Detroit. “We put quite a bit of time and effort into that. Were these kids filmed? Pictures taken? Were they passed around? We don’t know at this point, but we did put a lot of time and effort into that.”
Over the years, investigators had persons of interest in the case, many of whom were linked to or had been charged with crimes involving pedophilia.
One of those individuals was Christopher Busch. He was a convicted pedophile who lived in Bloomfield Hills and came onto police radar in 1977. But in 2012, police said there was no evidence suggesting Busch was the killer. His DNA does not match the physical evidence investigators have. He died in 1978 in what was ruled a suicide.
A suspect is not currently named in the Oakland County Child Killer case.
New findings
When Browen began investigating Shelden, it was an interview with Appelman that would shed new light on the case and bring Browen face-to-face with some of the victims.
Appelman’s book, The Kill Jar, chronicles both the North Fox Island sex trafficking ring and the Oakland County child murders after years of studying thousands of pages of local, state, and FBI case documents, including previously private witness statements, autopsy reports, catalogs of evidence, crime scene photos, interrogation transcription, polygraph results, and personal correspondences and interviews highlighted within piles of bankers boxers obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request, according to his bio.
He wrote that the North Fox Island operation “functioned essentially as a subscription service centered on the production of child pornography and the sexual abuse of boys ages 7 to 16. In exchange for their contributions, the camp’s ‘sponsors’ could receive pornography that police said was produced on the island, or even visit the island themselves.”
But it’s what happened after the book’s release that inspired Browen to team up with Appelman for further investigation.
Appelman told Browen that hundreds, if not thousands, of messages had been sent to him from people who claimed they were molested by Shelden after he fled to Europe.
“We have spoken with victims of his over there, and we also tracked him all the way to India… We have photographs of him with children in an orphanage in the 1990s.” Browen said.
“Like, this guy is single-handedly responsible for all these children who were molested or used for the production of the CSAM material, and what's shocking to me is, you know, in doing a series like this, not only do we want to track the crimes of Shelden and figure out who he victimized and where he was, because it's never been done,” he added.
The upcoming docuseries will also take a closer look at the crimes that Shelden reportedly committed in Europe and Asia.
“From the underbelly of the Netherlands, to orphanages in India, to the glitzy hills of Hollywood, and back to the place where it all started in North Fox Island,” Browen said.
Browen pointed out that this investigation feels particularly timely amid the ongoing release of the Epstein files. He added that he’s hoping to raise awareness of the Shelden case and show what happens when “the pressure is not applied.”
Shelden “had a network of pedophiles he was sending that material to,” Browen explained. “Thousands of pedophiles on his mailing lists, thousands of pedophiles that were receiving CSAM materials through the mail, none of them ever arrested, none of the people that were producing the materials, none of them investigated or anything, and it all just went away.”
“We're seeing the same thing with Epstein,” he added.
Coming forward
Browen says his focus is on the survivors.
“If you actually look at these stories, and you read the facts and you go beyond the headlines and you watch interviews with survivors, and for me, you sit in a room with them, and you cry with them, and you hear stories that they've never been comfortable enough to share before," he said.
“It becomes so real that it consumes you, and for me, there's nothing else that I can even think about at this point other than trying to raise the alarm surrounding these historic rings because this is what happened.”
He recalled meeting a man in Amsterdam who said he had been sex trafficked to Shelden by his own grandfather.
“He had some absolutely horrific stories, and I mean, everybody's crying,” Browen said. “Like, there's a lot of crying and tears from our all-male production team, you know, it's really powerful stuff.”
Browen warned that without accountability, history repeats itself.
“If we don’t do something about Epstein and find some sort of justice for all of the survivors and victims, the story is just going to die and go away.”
A pattern that never ended
Like Epstein, Shelden was a bachelor who used his wealth, philanthropy and society connections to shield his crimes in plain sight. Thousands of men on Shelden’s mailing lists were never charged. Names remain unknown.
Browen has filed multiple Freedom of Information Act requests with the FBI with the aim of obtaining thousands of unreleased files on the case.
But the FBI has told him it could take more than six years to redact and release the documents, he said.
“With my requests to the FBI… they’ve told me it’s going to take six plus years to send over a thousand,” he said. “Which makes no sense.”
The FBI did not respond to The Independent’s questions about the Shelden files.
North Fox Island was bought by the state of Michigan in 2000. It sits quietly abandoned. But Browen refuses to let the horrific crimes that happened there fade into the past.
His team has since returned to the island with cadaver dogs - and what they found was shocking, he said. Browen wouldn’t reveal details, but said they are planning to go back and that they will continue to push for answers.
“You can see what happens when everything fails,” he said. “When people aren't brought to justice, and either someone escapes, someone dies ... well, the stories just fade away. We can’t let that happen.”

EU leaders welcome US tone shift in Rubio's Munich speech
February 14, 2026Marco Rubio's speech at the Munich Security Conference didn't deviate from the themes of Donald Trump's second term in office.
Europe, he said Saturday, had to speed up its defense spending and army building.
The US secretary of state warned, as the Trump administration has done before, that Europe risked "civilizational erasure." And he espoused a general view that in a new world order, it was nations — not institutions — that would get an imperfect world on track.
But his tone was far softer than a year ago when US Vice President JD Vance shook the gathering of world political and defense leaders by lambasting Europe's approach to free speech, immigration and security.
DW Chief International Correspondent Richard Walker said it appeared Rubio was trying to create "a Trumpian narrative of what the West actually is."
"Rubio's message was much warmer in its tone, it was really trying to pull on European heartstrings to try and create a sense of common purpose, to create, almost, a unified theory that links security to a different idea of ... the West.
"A lot of people here do seem to be relieved that it wasn't guns blazing like JD Vance, but when you listen closely to what Rubio was saying there was an awful lot of the kind of Trumpian view of nation that was going right through [the speech]."
The last year has seen fears mount that the US wants out of Europe, with Trump eyeing the Danish territory of Greenland and speaking more openly about a sphere of influence focused more intently on the Americas. But Rubio's speech sought to keep an arm around Europe.
While still asserting a Trumpian view dismissing climate policy and immigration, Rubio cast the US as a "child of Europe."
He bridged a year of divide by evoking a shared Christian heritage across the Atlantic, and of the European connections that built the US. Rubio also praised partners in Europe for helping broker peace opportunities for Ukraine, while remaining critical of the UN as a forum for effective diplomacy.
Rubio casts 'civilization' at heart of US alliance with Europe
But Rubio also maintained a consistent theme of the second Trump administration — echoed by other world leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, on the first day of the MSC on Friday — that the global order had changed, and positioned the US as a muscular guardian of Western values and culture.
"We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline," said Rubio. "We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history."
Civilization was an inescapable theme on Saturday morning in Munich, evoked by Rubio a dozen times in his speech and later touched on by his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi, who used the label to describe both China and Europe as partner — not rival — civilizations.
While Wang struck a different chord in his address to delegates, calling for improved global governance with the United Nations, Rubio reiterated Trump's nations-first view on foreign policy and dismissed the UN as an effective arbiter of international relations.
"Rubio thinks very much about the competition between the United States and China," said Walker, adding that despite the softer tone, Rubio echoed Vance's message that a show of national strength was "the way to get things done," and not the "liberal, international" approach promoted by the EU.
"For the European Union, the underlying ideas and the rhetoric Rubio was using here is actually quite troubling because the whole point of the European Union is almost to move beyond the idea of nation, and not to try to express ideas such as that the West is, as Rubio said, the greatest civilization in human history."
For his part, Rubio sought to keep Europe on the US side of the civilizational theme, describing a shared Western culture that was "unique, distinctive and irreplaceable." He said it wasn't "our goal nor our wish" to see the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance.
Cautious welcome of Rubio's speech
Though a warmer narrative compared to remarks from other US officials, including Trump, since February 2025, Rubio was clearly singing from the administration's hymn sheet.
He rebuked what he called a "climate cult" amid a US pivot away from the green transition and back toward fossil fuel interests, and said Europe should not fear technology at a time when the EU has sought to assert guardrails against American tech companies.
Those differences were acknowledged by European figures, as they welcomed the US tonal shift.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told DW in Munich that Rubio's pitch was "a different category to the speech we heard last year [from Vance]."
But Wadephul also stressed the importance of German and European independence on defense, climate policy and trade.
"Climate change is there, and of course we have to give answers, we have, not to deny that climate change is existing, but I understood his speech in a way that we have to give flexible answers, not to be dogmatic," he said.
"I wouldn't say that we have 100% overlapping between our priorities and the priorities from the US side, but I would say this is really a common ground for a bright future between the United States and Europe."
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen directly referenced Rubio's remarks in her speech later Saturday morning, saying that "an independent Europe is a strong Europe. And a stronger Europe makes for a stronger trans-Atlantic alliance."
"I was very much reassured by [Rubio]. We know him, he's a good friend, a strong ally," said von der Leyen.
Both she and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer avoided addressing Rubio's speech in great depth, instead devoting time to talking up a stronger Europe. Starmer said Rubio's remarks were "consistent" with theirs that "Europe hasn't done enough in its own defense and security for many years."
Little focus on Ukraine: Sikorski
Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told DW that while "return of American politeness" was welcome, he was disappointed to see that Ukraine didn't figure prominently in Rubio's speech.
"What was somewhat disappointing was the absence of what we Europeans regard as the most urgent security threat to our continent which is the Russian aggression against Ukraine," said Sikorski.
He added that the "real threat to Europe is Russia's state ideology — and ideology of autocracy and of expansion, of rebuilding the [Russian] empire. And that would necessarily happen at our [Europe's] expense, and we must not permit that."
Sikorski acknowledged that Trump had been right on some issues, and said the EU was now preparing for "a new era in which Europeans will take responsibility for territorial defense in Europe."
"Western Europe was consuming the peace dividend for too long and credit where credit is due: President Trump — in his inimitable style — told us that we need to get our act together. And we, as Europeans, are now spending double [on defense] of what we were spending before he became president."

EU leaders welcome US tone shift in Rubio's Munich speech
February 14, 2026Marco Rubio's speech at the Munich Security Conference didn't deviate from the themes of Donald Trump's second term in office.
Europe, he said Saturday, had to speed up its defense spending and army building.
The US secretary of state warned, as the Trump administration has done before, that Europe risked "civilizational erasure." And he espoused a general view that in a new world order, it was nations — not institutions — that would get an imperfect world on track.
But his tone was far softer than a year ago when US Vice President JD Vance shook the gathering of world political and defense leaders by lambasting Europe's approach to free speech, immigration and security.
DW Chief International Correspondent Richard Walker said it appeared Rubio was trying to create "a Trumpian narrative of what the West actually is."
"Rubio's message was much warmer in its tone, it was really trying to pull on European heartstrings to try and create a sense of common purpose, to create, almost, a unified theory that links security to a different idea of ... the West.
"A lot of people here do seem to be relieved that it wasn't guns blazing like JD Vance, but when you listen closely to what Rubio was saying there was an awful lot of the kind of Trumpian view of nation that was going right through [the speech]."

‘I Just Felt Like I Had No Control’: How Nerves Overwhelmed Ilia Malinin in Olympic Shocker
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
14:08:02 UTC
23:08:02 KST

It’s been a bit of a whirlwind week for Ilia Malinin, who arrived at his first Olympics as the no-brainer winner of the men’s figure-skating event. The four-time U.S. champion has outscored his competitors by as much as 10, 30, or 40 points in the past. So essentially, he was untouchable, and the battle was for silver and bronze.
But in his first appearances on Olympic ice, Malinin showed some fallibility and faltered in the short program of the team event, finishing behind Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama. He won the free program segment in the team event, but wasn’t his usual dominant self. He seemed to have shaken off the nerves for the individual men’s event a couple of days later and finished in first, nearly six points ahead of Kagiyama. The gold was his to lose. All he had to do was skate the free program that had made history, with seven quad jumps, and he would be the indisputable champion.
After erupting in applause when he was introduced, the Milano Ice Skating Arena fell silent as Malinin took his starting position and his music —actually Malinin’s own voice in an opening spoken word section—began. He landed a clean quad flip to start the program and seemed to be on track to repeat his seven-quad performance from December. But it soon became clear that his victory was hardly a sure thing. The next jump was supposed to be the quad axel that only he has landed in competition, but he popped it in the air and only received points for a single axel. He seemed to brush off that mistake and landed a solid quad lutz, but then faltered on the planned quad loop and opened up again in the air, completing only two rotations.

The mistakes began taking a toll. His next jump was a combination, starting with the quad lutz, but he fell on that jump and wasn’t able to complete the next two in the series, and received deductions for repeating the quad lutz (skaters can only perform solo jumps once but can repeat them if they combine them with other jumps). He attempted to make up points with another jump combination beginning with a quad, but fell again on the first jump after doubling it, for which the judges gave him under one point—likely a first for Malinin. In all, he fell on two jumps, which resulted in an automatic two-point deduction, and had lost too many points to get on the podium.
Instead, the surprise Olympic men’s champion is Mikhail Shaidorov from Kazakhstan, who landed five quad jumps to earn the gold—his country’s first in the event. “I just did my work,” he said after the event, adding that Malinin’s performance was “very surprising. He’s very important to figure skating; he’s the best skater in history.” After coming off the ice, Malinin, who ended up in 8th place, congratulated Shaidorov and told him, “You deserve it.” Japan’s Kagiyama earned silver, and his teammate, Shun Sato, whom Malinin had beaten in the free program of the team event, skated another powerful program for bronze. Malinin’s U.S. teammates, Andrew Torgashev and Maxim Naumov, whose parents were killed in a plane crash last January, both struggled with some of their jumps and finished 12th and 20th, respectively.
Stunned and at a loss to explain what had happened, Malinin said he “blew it” and acknowledged the impact of the pressure of competing at his first Olympics. “Especially going into that starting pose, I just felt like all the traumatic moments of my life really just started flooding my head, and there were just so many negative thoughts that flooded in there, and I just did not handle it,” he said. Normally, he tells himself during competitions that he has prepared for the event and that he should trust his body and his training. But it was hard to play those mind tricks in Milan, he said. “This whole day was going really solid, and I just thought that all I needed to do was go out there and trust the process that I’ve always been doing with every competition. But of course, it’s not like any other competition; it’s the Olympics, and I think people only realize the pressure and the nerves that actually happen from [experience]. So it was really just something that overwhelmed me and I just felt like I had no control.”
In addition to all the attention focused on him as a gold-medal favorite, Malinin skated the equivalent of two full competitions, with short and free programs, over six days. Team USA selected him to skate both portions of the men’s program in that event, and his clutch performance in the free pulled the U.S. ahead of Japan by one point, earning Malinin, and his teammates, gold.
He was expected to add a second gold to that tally, but will leave Milan without any hardware from the men’s event.
“It’s really difficult, there is this pressure from people who assumed that [Malinin] would probably get gold,” said Kagiyama, who repeated as Olympic silver medalist. “His performance, if I may comment, was a little bit unusual. But it really proves that this is really the Olympics; things like that happen.”
The experience is reminiscent of the 2018 Olympics in PyeongChang, when another heavy favorite for gold, Nathan Chen, faltered in the short program of the men’s event and finished 17th. He said he felt enormous pressure from being the favorite and that the tension continued to build until his competition. Chen was able to recover in the free program, completing five quad jumps, which was enough to bring him to fifth place overall.
In Malinin’s case, the nerves hit at the worst possible time. “I still haven’t been able to process what just happened,” he said. As he began skating, the only audible sound was the quiet push of his blades against the ice as he built momentum for his first jump. “That first quad and some of the [other] quads they felt really ideal,” he said. “So I definitely knew that I was prepared well enough. But it’s a lot to handle, a lot to process, so I honestly don’t know what actually happened in the moment. All I know is that it wasn’t my best skate and that it was definitely something I wasn’t expecting, and it’s done so I can’t go back and change it, even though I would love to do [that].”
Among the capacity crowd at the Milano Ice Skating Arena to watch what they assumed would be the crowning of another U.S. Olympic champion were Nathan Chen and summer Olympians Simone Biles and Frederick Richard. “Come on, Ilia, you’re still in it,” Richard said after Malinin popped his first jump. Richard and Malinin have bonded over their passion for backflips—Malinin managed to complete one toward the end of his program, although he received no points for it since it’s not a recognized element by the judges, and Richard has adopted the moniker “Frederick Flips” and owns the Guinness World Record for the most standing backflips over 24 hours. Together, they co-created National Backflip Day, on December 21 (12-21, which can be flipped numerically to reflect the same date), to celebrate sports and encourage safe, creative ways to flip.
Malinin met Richard at a gym over the summer and they shared tips. “We’re almost the same age, and he’s dominating his sport, and I’m working on dominating my sport, so we just relate to each other a lot—we’re both flipping and doing a lot of air sense in our sports,” Richard says. Malinin’s gymnastics background may also be helping his skating. “I don’t know skating enough, but the thing about gymnastics is that it gets you the balance, the air awareness, and the flexibility that you can transfer to any sport,” Richard says. “He’s honestly what we call a phenom. He twists faster than anybody else can twist; that’s why he’s the ‘Quad God.’”
Chen, who is also in Milan for the Games, had the opportunity to skate with Malinin when Malinin was younger and came with his father and coach, Olympian Roman Skorniakov, to Chen’s rink to work with Chen’s coach, Rafael Arutyunyan. (Arutyunyan is also in Milan supporting Malinin). “Obviously, his physique matches skating very well; he’s naturally very talented and he’s very twitchy and also his rotation is fantastic,” Chen says, referring to the twitch muscles needed to pull in quickly and complete four revolutions in the air. “So even if his takeoffs aren’t perfect, he’s still able to sneak out the landing, with the way that he’s able to snap his jumps.”
Chen also sees another useful characteristic in Malinin, which only another skater like him, who landed five quadruple jumps in winning his Olympic gold, can appreciate. “He’s also very fearless, and I think that’s a big component of being able to do quads,” he says. There’s no standard technique for mastering quad jumps, since every athlete’s body is different. “It’s really optimizing his leverage and torque to get the rotation based off of his own personal body as well,” says Chen. “Technique is not a one-size-fits-all kind of thing, so you have to optimize based off of what you’re able to do and how you’re able to get into the air.”
Malinin’s technique is generally the key to his consistency, says Paul Wylie, who won silver at the 1992 Olympics. “Coming from someone who only did a triple axel, it’s the air position and it’s the snap,” Wylie says. “That combination, with the timing, makes it so that you’re standing over your rotational axis, because if you fall out of that axis even a little bit, you’re going to lose the jump and it’s going to slow down and you don’t get around.”
While the full spectrum of what Malinin is capable of on the ice wasn’t on display in Milan, he’s already thinking ahead and ready to put this experience behind him. “From here it’s just regrouping and figure out what to do next and going from there,” he said. At 21 years old, it likely won’t be the last we see of Malinin at the Olympics, and one competition won’t diminish the impact he is having in evolving the sport of men’s figure skating. “He will be the greatest of all time,” says Richard.

Europe calls for US reset at security talks
Sweden

23:07:36 KST

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged "a new transatlantic partnership" and French President Emmanuel Macron called for "a strong Europe" as more than 60 leaders gathered for the annual Munich Security Conference.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meanwhile tell the conference Saturday that Europe is "a sleeping giant" and must rely less on the United States for its defence, his office said in a preview of his remarks.
This year's conference comes at a time of strained ties between Europe and the United States, after Trump threatened to take over Greenland and criticised "decaying" and "weak" European nations.
Russia's war against Ukraine, set to enter its fifth year this month, is high on the agenda, alongside efforts by European NATO members to raise their defence budgets, in line with Trump's demands, out of concern that Moscow could seek to expand into their territory.
European leaders at the gathering defended their security commitments and the NATO alliance, which Trump's rhetoric has rattled.
"Being a part of NATO is not only Europe's competitive advantage. It's also the United States' competitive advantage. So let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together," Merz said.
"In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone."
'Greater European autonomy'
The gathering comes a year after US Vice President JD Vance used the conference's stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking allies on the continent.
Macron emphatically defended Europe in his speech, saying "everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us".
Starmer's office said his speech would call for "a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well".
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived on Friday, is also due to speak at the gathering on Saturday, as is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, organisers said.
A German government source said Merz and Rubio had met at the conference and discussed "Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid".
They also discussed Iran and NATO, and "Rubio praised Germany's steps to strengthen the alliance," the source added.
Rubio also met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
They agreed to strengthen cooperation, and Wang told Rubio that "dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and win-win outcomes are better than zero-sum games", according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Rubio held a 15-minute meeting with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland about the future sovereignty of the Arctic island. Denmark's Mette Frederiksen called the talks "constructive".
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Ukraine discussions
Merz, Macron and the leaders of the European Union, Canada and NATO met with Zelensky on Friday for talks on Ukraine.
A US official said Rubio did not attend those talks due to a packed schedule, but was "engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings" in Munich.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said he discussed ending the Russian invasion with Wang, whose country is a close partner of Moscow.
Wang told Sybiga that Beijing was "willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid", according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Macron, meanwhile, said a new framework was needed to deal with "an aggressive Russia" once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
"If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," said Merz. "But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously."
Zelensky, urged by Trump to "get moving" on a deal to end the war, visited a drone factory near Munich with German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius before meeting with European leaders.
"It's good to have strong partnership with Americans... but I think that Europe... needs (an) independent defence industry, very strong," he said.
NATO's Secretary General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the conference that Europe was "stepping up... taking more of a leadership role within NATO" and "taking more care of its own defence".
"A strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever," Rutte said.

ANKARA
Relations between Türkiye and Panama are in a “very good moment,” Panama’s vice minister of foreign affairs for multilateral affairs and cooperation, Carlos Guevara Mann, said Friday, describing the ties as sincere and grounded in mutual respect.
“The state of relations between our two countries is very good. We are in a very good moment in our relationship,” Mann told Anadolu during an official visit to the capital Ankara. “We have a very cordial, very respectfully-based relationship, and this is a source of great satisfaction for us, as I am sure it is for our Turkish counterparts.”
Mann said the two countries cooperate across a wide range of areas and maintain comprehensive collaboration. He said opportunities are being explored in education, science and technology, and culture, adding that Türkiye and Panama “have a very solid commercial relationship.”
He described bilateral trade as significant and said it has increased in recent years.
Mann also pointed to Turkish Airlines’ 10 weekly flights to Panama as a major advantage.
“Istanbul is really the port of entry for Panamanians and Latin Americans to the east, the same way that Panama is the port of entry for Turkish people and people from Eastern Europe and Central Asia to Latin America,” he said.
He said the two countries maintain extensive cooperation within international organizations and see broad potential to expand collaboration on multilateral platforms. Mann added that Panama is highly satisfied with the current state of relations and appreciates the warm reception it receives during official visits to Türkiye.
Visit highlights cultural exchanges and strategic talks
Mann said the main purpose of his visit was to promote cultural and academic exchanges between the two countries.
He underscored the importance of commemorating the 200th anniversary of the historic Amphictyonic Congress convened by Simon Bolivar in Panama in 1826, which sought to unite Latin American nations.
During the visit, Mann followed up on cooperation initiatives in science and technology, culture and archaeology. He also held consultations with Turkish officials on current strategic issues, saying such exchanges are always beneficial.
On his first visit to Ankara, Mann described the capital as “a charming city” and said he felt at home. He thanked the Turkish government, the people of Ankara and his country’s diplomatic mission in Ankara for their hospitality.

After opening the ceremony with a few old hits, including "Relax, Take It Easy" (2006), the honorary president of this edition, Mika, praised these "multiple voices that tell the story of today's France in all its richness." This year, that musical richness was above all female. In total, 21 of the 34 nominations went to female artists. Women won six of the nine categories.
Theodora, the pop phenomenon of 2025, took home four awards: Female Newcomer, Live Newcomer, Album of the Year and also Best Audiovisual Creation for the outstanding video for "Fashion Designa." With her album Mega BBL, an expanded reissue of her mixtape Bad Boy Lovestory (2024), the French-Congolese artist has shaken up the French music scene. Bouyon, amapiano, dancehall, rap, chanson française: Her influences are varied and interweave. During her four appearances at the podium, she emphasized the collective nature of her project, thanking her team as well as those who paved the way, such as Aya Nakamura and Tiakola. "If my Afro-Caribbean sounds can be understood, it's because those people came before me," she acknowledged.

Russia Poisoned Putin Critic Navalny in Prison With Rare Toxin – European States

Five European countries accused Russia of poisoning opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Saturday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"The U.K., Sweden, France, Germany and the Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said in a joint statement following "analyses of samples" from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence.
According to the European states, a toxin found in the skin of South American dart frogs, known as epibatidine, was found in laboratory analyses of samples from his body.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," said the statement.
"Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him," the countries said.
Britain's Foreign Office said separately that "only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin." It added: "We hold [Russia] responsible for his death."
Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnya said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
"Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
"I was, of course, certain that it was a murder...Back then, it was just words, but today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya said last September that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found that her husband was killed by poisoning.
"Today, beside his widow, the U.K. is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence [Navalny's] voice," U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot paid "tribute" to Navalny after the findings.
"We now know that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people to remain in power," Barrot said in a post on X.
The Kremlin denies the charges.
Moscow has never fully explained Navalny's death, saying only that he fell ill and collapsed during a walk in his prison colony. Navalny and his foundation were labeled "extremist" by the Russian authorities.
The European countries said they had reported Russia to the world's chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, over the finding.
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the countries said, accusing Moscow of breaching the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
Jailed upon his return to Russia in January 2021, he was convicted on a series of charges, including "extremism," but continued to campaign against Putin and Russia's invasion of Ukraine from behind bars.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin's inner circle.
A Message from The Moscow Times:
Dear readers,
We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."
These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.
We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, we need your help.
Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.
By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.
Remind me later.

Soaring coffee prices rewrite some Americans' daily routines

Rising coffee prices are forcing Americans to rethink their morning ritual
Coffee prices in the U.S. were up 18.3 percent in January from a year ago
- Bookmark
Soaring coffee prices are forcing even dedicated drinkers to abandon their cherished morning ritual. Chandra Donelson, 35, from Washington, D.C., has made the unthinkable decision to give up her lifelong caffeine fix.
Her daily routine once involved a McDonald’s coffee (10 sugars, five creams), later transitioning to Starbucks caramel macchiatos with almond milk and two pumps of syrup.
"I did that daily for years. I loved it. That was just my routine," she says. "And now it’s not."
This personal sacrifice reflects a wider trend, as years of climbing coffee costs compel consumers across the nation to forgo café visits, opt for cheaper alternatives,or quit altogether.
Coffee prices in the U.S. were up 18.3 percent in January from a year ago, according to the latest Consumer Price Index released on Friday. Over five years, the government reported, coffee prices rose 47 percent.
That extraordinary rise has brought some to take extraordinary measures.
“Before, I thought, ‘There’s no way I could make it through my day without coffee,’” says Liz Sweeney, 50, of Boise, Idaho, a former “coffee addict” who has cut her consumption. “Now my car’s not on automatic pilot.”
Sweeney used to have three cups of coffee at home each day and stop at a café whenever she left the house. As prices climbed last year, though, she nixed coffee shop visits and cut her intake to a cup a day at home. To make up for the caffeine, she pops open a can of Diet Coke at home or rolls through McDonald’s for one.
Dan DeBaun, 34, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, has likewise trimmed back on coffee shop visits, conscious of the increasing expense as he and his wife save up for a house.
“What used to be a $2 coffee, it’s now $5, $6,” says DeBaun, who now buys ground coffee at Trader Joe’s and fills up a travel mug to bring to the office.
Data from Toast, a payment platform used by more than 150,000 restaurants, found the median price of a regular hot coffee in the U.S. had climbed to $3.61 in December, with wide variation by location. The median price of cold brews was $5.55.
Virtually all coffee consumed in the U.S. is imported. Though tariffs affected some imports of coffee in 2025, they ultimately were removed. Climate issues — drought in Vietnam, heavy rain in Indonesia, and hot, dry weather in Brazil — are blamed for reducing yields of coffee crops and driving up global prices.
Two-thirds of Americans drink coffee daily, according to the National Coffee Association. For many, it is such an indispensable part of their routine, the soaring price has led to nothing more than grumbling.
The coffee association says its surveys show coffee consumption is broadly holding steady despite price hikes. But, squeezed by the cost of everything from rent to beef, others are shaking up their habit.
Sharon Cooksey, 55, of Greensboro, North Carolina, was visiting her local Starbucks most weekday mornings for a caramel latte until scaling back last year. First, she switched to brewing Starbucks at home. Then, she discovered Lavazza coffee was about 40 percent cheaper and switched to it.
“I can buy a bag of coffee for $6?” she said to herself. “It was like I had just discovered another world. The multiverse opened up to me in the coffee aisle of Publix.”
She has noticed her home-brewed costs tick upward, too, but it’s nothing compared to her café habit. A bag of beans that lasts weeks costs her about the same as one latte.
Cooksey misses the social aspect of visiting the café, where baristas greeted her by name. But she’s been surprised to find she actually prefers the way her homemade coffees taste.
“I’ll be damned if it didn’t taste so good,” she says.
Growing up, Donelson watched enviously as her mother made a daily coffee jaunt (also to McDonald’s, also 10 sugars and five creams), and she duplicated the habit. She went from college to the Air Force to a government job as a data and artificial intelligence strategist, but through it all, coffee was there.
She noticed the growing expense of her routine, but kept it up until a government shutdown halted her paychecks last fall and she needed to trim her spending. Looking for a morning substitute, she landed on a Republic of Tea blend with a healthy squeeze of honey.
“Twenty cents a cup compared to $7 or $8 a cup,” she says. “The math just makes sense.”

White Castle transforms restaurants for Valentine's Day themed dinners that create memories
White Castle has invited lovers, loved ones and the soon-to-be in love to an intimate meal at its restaurants every Valentine's Day for the past 35 years
- Bookmark
Valentine's Day dinner at White Castle with candles, attentive wait staff and white tablecloths was a treasured experience for Krystal Gray and her mother, Cornelia Murphy.
This year, Gray will bring along a photo of her mother, who died last spring at age 80, and place it on the table she has still reserved at one of the fast-food chain restaurants in the Detroit suburb of Ferndale.
“It wouldn't be the same without her,” Gray said. “I wanted something to make me feel better about her not physically being able to come.”
For 35 years, White Castle has invited lovers, loved ones and the soon-to-be in love to have an intimate meal at its restaurants. This year the 325 White Castles with a dining room in the U.S. are taking part in the promotion, according to Jamie Richardson, chief marketing officer of the Columbus, Ohio-based restaurant chain.
“That one day White Castle becomes love castle,” Richardson said. “It’s something our customers look forward to. Many are repeat visitors on Valentine’s Day.”
“Quirky” promotion finds fans
The promotion started in 1991 and was only offered at White Castles in St. Louis and Minneapolis. Richardson said the goal was to offer “something kind of fun and quirky and see if anyone wants to come out have a fancy Valentine’s Day dinner at White Castle.”
Each participating eatery is given a budget for decorations which can include red balloons, garland and flowers. Reservations are required and opened in early January. About 32,000 people celebrated Valentine’s Day dinner at a White Castle in 2025. Richardson says they are on target for more than 35,000 this year.
“Some people show up in limousines,” he said. “We’ll have people dress like it’s their wedding. We had over 200 White Castle weddings over the years.”
Sliders and memorable moments
There's just something about the thin slice of steam-grilled beef, slathered in mustard and ketchup with diced onions, cheese and a pickle slice on a dinner roll that many can't resist. Crinkle-cut French fries and a soft drink typically fill out orders. The onion chips and chicken rings also are popular.
“It’s all the ambiance, all the love and all the great memories for a fraction of the price,” Richardson said. “For a couple, if they are really splurging, it’s right around $20, or $25 if you’re getting dessert on a stick.”
Ann Tubbs, district supervisor of nine “Castles” in the Detroit and mid-Michigan areas, said customers tell her that the affordable cost helps but people keep coming because of the tradition and memories.
“I've had a couple who announced their pregnancy,” Tubbs said. “We've had people come in with their children just to make those moments, and others who have gotten engaged.”
Amy Richardson, 41, of Lincoln Park near Detroit, makes sure that she, her three children and her significant other also dress the part, wearing something pink or red and at times matching each other.
She said she has spent Valentine's Day at a White Castle every year since 2012.
“I had just gotten into a new relationship and I had a 3-year-old daughter,” she said of the first time. “We wanted to make it somewhere kid-friendly. All three of us packed up and went out on our date.”
The couple has since added two younger children and spend about $30 on their Valentine's Day meals for a family of five.
“We usually get the sliders and the chicken rings and the mozzarella cheese sticks,” Amy Richardson added. “It's more of a nostalgia thing. It may be fancied up, but it's not a fancy restaurant where people frown on you bringing a young child or children.”
Waffle House, another national restaurant chain, also will mark its 18th year of offering a special themed dinner on Valentine's Day. This was the first year online reservations were taken and many of the 218 Waffle House locations taking part were booked by the end of last week, according to spokesperson Kelly Bruner.
Carrying on a family tradition
Gray has made Valentine's Day at White Castle sort of a tradition, having done it about 10 times. Gray will be among 14 fans inducted in May into the White Castle “Craver’s Hall of Fame.” They were selected after submitting their White Castle stories.
This year, she also will share the day with her two young daughters as a tribute to her mother's memory.
“I just like the simplicity of it all — sit there and spend time with each other,” she said. “Sometimes, we can do too much and it goes overboard to the point where you can't really enjoy it — spending so much money.”

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky poked fun at Hungarian leader Victor Orban’s “belly” in his address to the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, saying Ukraine’s fight against Russia allowed Europe to live freely.
Zelensky, a 48-year-old former comedian, was describing how Europe gains from having Ukrainian forces battling Russian troops in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s relations with neighbouring Hungary have been strained by Orban’s support for Russia and have deteriorated further in recent weeks as the veteran leader has ramped up attacks on Ukraine ahead of a closely fought parliamentary election in April.
“There can be a sovereign Moldova and a Romania without dictatorship and even one Victor can think about how to grow his belly, not how to grow his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to the streets of Budapest,” Zelensky said.
“But look at the price. Look at the price, look at the pain Ukraine has gone through, look at the suffering Ukraine has faced. It’s Ukrainians who are holding the European front,” he said.
Although Ukraine applied to join the European Union days after Russia invaded, it has been unable to advance accession talks because of Orban’s vetoes.
Unlike other European countries, Hungary has not diversified its imports from Russia since Moscow’s assault on Ukraine.

Trump-style diplomacy could win friends for China but harm US ties with Beijing
Observers say even Washington’s close allies need to hedge against a more assertive foreign policy, with some already courting Beijing

Last week, US ambassador to Poland Tom Rose cut off contact with his host country’s parliamentary speaker over what he described as “outrageous and unprovoked insults” against President Donald Trump.
Washington would “not permit anyone to harm US-Polish relations nor disrespect” the president, Rose warned, without specifying the insults.
However, lower house speaker Wlodzimierz Czarzasty, a left-wing Polish politician, had earlier criticised Trump’s policies and said he would not support an initiative to nominate the US leader for the Nobel Peace Prize.

While Rose later told Polish media that Washington was Warsaw’s “biggest ally and greatest friend”, his sharp response has reinforced global perceptions that the US is moving away from traditional diplomatic norms, according to observers.
This more assertive brand of American foreign policy could push Washington’s allies to look to other partners, including Beijing, and risked damaging the US-China relationship, they warned.
Sun Chenghao, a fellow at Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, said the incident showed the second Trump administration’s diplomatic approach was skewed towards a “more high-handed and assertive style”.

Five European countries say Russia 'poisoned' Putin critic Alexei Navalny in prison

Five European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, accused Russia of "poisoning" opposition leader Alexei Navalny in prison in 2024 using a "rare toxin," on Saturday, February 14, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. "The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said in a joint statement, following "analyses of samples" from his body.
The staunch critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin died in an Arctic prison in February 2024, while serving a 19-year prison sentence. The epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs native to South America was found in samples and "highly likely resulted in his death," the European states said.
"Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death," the UK foreign office added in a statement.
"We now know that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use biological weapons against his own people to remain in power," French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot wrote on X, adding that Navalny had died in prison in 2024 "as a result of poisoning with one of the deadliest nerve agents."
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hailed Navalny's "huge courage in the face of tyranny." "His determination to expose the truth has left an enduring legacy, and my thoughts are with his family today," Starmer said on social media from the Munich Security Conference. "I am doing whatever it takes to defend our people, our values and our way of life from the threat of Russia and Putin's murderous intent."
Chemical weapons
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered. "Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference. "I was of course certain that it was a murder... but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning. "Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence his voice," UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.

Russia Poisoned Navalny With Exotic Frog Toxin, European Countries Say

The governments of five European countries on February 14 released a statement saying they are confident that the Russian opposition politician Aleksei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin not found naturally in Russia -- a poisoning that led to his death in a Russian prison two years ago.
The UK, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands made their conclusion based on analyses of samples from Navalny that confirm the presence of epibatidine -- a toxin derived from poison dart frogs in South America -- that is known to cause paralysis and respiratory arrest.
Speaking to RFE/RL on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said that "there is a high possibility that Russia killed Navalny by poison."
"I think it’s a serious offense," he added, "and I hope that it will [show] the world that Russia is playing a dirty game."
In the joint statement, the five capitals note that “Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive, and opportunity to administer this poison to him.”
It also adds that “these latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.”
Aleksandr Polupan, an anesthesiologist-resuscitator, told Current Time that it was clear before the verdict of the five European countries that "Navalny had been murdered and that he did not die a natural death."
"All that we know about [Navalny’s] abdominal pain, vomiting, and seizures, I don’t see any contradictions in [how the poison works]," Polupan said. "Given that independent laboratories confirmed [the presence] of the same molecule, I’d say there’s no need to guess much further."
For other experts, however, doubts remain. Ismail Efendiev, a member of the European Association of Poison Control Centers and Clinical Toxicologists, told Current Time that the use of an exotic toxin could not be ruled out "because the symptoms are similar with the effects of Novichok, but we need to identify these cases in a laboratory."
Navalny's Widow Responds
In response to the statement, Navalny’s widow, Yulia Navalnaya, tweeted that “I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: [Russian President Vladimir] Putin killed Aleksei with a chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out [for] over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes."
RFE/RL reached out to Navalnaya’s press team for further comment but the request was declined.
Navalnaya has always rejected the official Russian autopsy report that stated that hypertension and other diseases caused a heartbeat disorder that led to Navalny's demise and was instrumental in getting biological samples smuggled out from Russia to other European countries.
Roman Dobrokhotov, founder and editor in chief of The Insider, an independent Russian media outlet specializing in investigative journalism, said that he believes the Kremlin was "confident that no bio samples will ever be smuggled abroad to be examined. And should samples get abroad, [the Kremlin's] hope was that there will not be a laboratory competent enough to identify this poison."
"We were lucky indeed to find laboratories and experienced scientists so the substance can be found," Dobrokhotov, said.
Navalny was a longtime anti-corruption fighter and Russia's most prominent opposition politician for over a decade. At the time of his death in a prison north of the Arctic Circle, Navalny was serving a 19-year sentence on an extremism conviction that he and his supporters say was politically motivated and revenge for his anti-Kremlin activism.
He had been behind bars since January 2021, when he was arrested upon returning to Russia after recovering in Germany from a poisoning with a form of the nerve-agent Novichok that he said was a state-sponsored assassination attempt carried out by Russian security agents and approved by Putin.
RFE/RL's Russian Service unearthed a Russian scientific paper from 2013 that describes a method for creating synthesized epibatidine. Three of the paper's five authors worked at the State Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology, which was involved in developing Novichok in the 1970s.
The United States and European Union imposed sanctions on the institute in the wake of Navalny's poisoning in 2020. Ukraine and Canada followed suit in 2023, citing the institute supplies of technology to the Russian military.
Asked to comment on the finding about Navalny's death, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he "cannot think about Vladimir Putin and his toxic ambitions.... I have no time for this."
"[Russia attacks] us with 100 drones and missiles. What is the difference between poison and missiles? I don’t see the difference," Zelenskyy said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.

Couples are flocking to White Castle and Waffle House for Valentine’s Day: ‘A beacon of love’
Every February 14, these two beloved — but also widely mocked — budget fast food chains lay out the tablecloths and take reservations. Io Dodds meets the married parents, wild young lovers and small-town retirees who take the leap

Nine in 10 Americans believe we’re in a cost of living crisis. Then there’s the specter of mass layoffs or an AI financial crash.
So this Valentine's Day, why not take your squeeze out to a fast food restaurant?
You may be surprised to find you’re in good company. For years, White Castle and Waffle House have served sit-down Valentine's Day meals at many locations — and are even taking reservations.
Tablecloths are laid, festive decorations such as balloons and paper hearts are hung, and staff bring meals to your table. Guests often dress up fancy, and sometimes there’s a special menu.
Many dining chains do Valentine’s Day specials, like McDonalds’s new offer of caviar with your McNuggets. But White Castle and Waffle House — long known, and often the butt of jokes, as ultra-budget options — appear unique in offering the full sit-down experience.
"I have zero complaints," says Dan C., a 41-year-old grocery store manager in Minnesota's Twin Cities, who took his girlfriend to White Castle on Feb. 14 in 2024 (he declined to give his last name due to privacy concerns).
He’d proposed the idea every year for a decade, and finally ... she said yes. "We had a fun time and even thought about going back this year,” he told The Independent.
Waffle House, a 24-hour chain focused on hearty breakfasts and comfort food, has more than 2,000 restaurants spread mostly through the Midwest and the South. Its Valentine’s Day tradition started in 2008 after a restaurant manager in Johns Creek, Georgia noticed customers often dined there that day.
This year 218 locations will participate; you can see them all and book a table here.
For White Castle, the century-old joint — known for its tiny, square-patty “slider” burgers —that was made internationally famous by 2004 stoner movie Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, it goes back even further.
In 1991, according to a retrospective by Eater, two female operations leaders in Minneapolis and St. Louis hatched a plan to “share the love” by making V-Day “a little special.” The resulting media attention convinced HQ to embrace their idea.
Now 325 out of 334 White Castles are participating, with 35,000 customers expected to attend (vs 32,000 in 2025). To book, search for your local branch on OpenTable.
On social media, you’ll find rave reviews going back years. "I went [to Waffle House] last year. That night my wife got pregnant. Go at your own risk," wrote one Reddit user in 2015.
'I don't have to dress up so much'
When exactly did Dave Chegash first go to White Castle for Valentine's Day?
"I don't know, let me ask my wife," he told The Independent via phone from his home in Richmond, Michigan, just north of Detroit. Then he raised his voice. "Vick! Do you remember the first time we went?”
Dave and Vicky Ann Chegash sometimes remember things differently. Both agree that in 1969, when they were teenagers at school, Vicky stole Dave's clarinet and ran away. But Dave thinks they were strangers, whereas Vicky recalls they’d already met at band camp.
So it is with Valentine's Day at White Castle. Did they hear about it by phone from a friend who saw a newspaper ad, or did that same friend forward them an email, "kind of as a joke"?
Either way, that was "at least 10” years ago, and the retirees have spent Feb, 14 at White Castle every year since (except during Covid in 2020). This one will be the couple’s 50th wedding anniversary.
Dave, 73, worked as an engineer in every industry from cars to ladies' underwear, while Vicky was an occupational therapist and lymphedema therapist. "And you're 21, right?" says Dave. "I wish!" exclaims Vicky. (She's 71.)
The couple have always liked White Castle: "It's an addiction!" Vicky said. "An acquired taste.”
Both of them appreciate the laid-back vibe. "It's relaxed, and I don't have to dress up so much,” Vicky noted.
Dave chimed in. "We don't normally dress up to go out to any restaurants anymore... now that we're older and retired, we just like to take it easy."
Still, they enjoy how the workers "really make a big deal out of it". They usually ask staff to take their picture, but these days they're such regulars that the owners want a photo with them.
'Like a scene from Twin Peaks'
Erin Crowley and Augustine Isbell knew nothing about the Valentine's Day tradition when they entered a Waffle House in Charleston, South Carolina after midnight on Feb. 15, 2025.
It had already been a weird night. Crowley, a 25-year-old transgender woman, said she felt increasingly unsafe in the Republican-led state and was moving cross-country to join Isbell in Portland, Oregon. Isbell, who is also trans, flew in to help her pack. By chance, Valentine's was their last day in town.
They’d met online in September 2024, when Crowley sent Isbell a photo of one of her knives (she dollects “pretty ones”), and immediately fell head over heels in love. Their first phone call lasted 20 hours.
Soon they were falling asleep and waking up together, keeping the line open all night. Isbell, a 29-year-old handyperson who uses it/its pronouns, would have Erin on its headphones while it pulled weeds or assembled furniture.
On Valentine's Day they finished packing with time to kill, and decided to wander in search of adventure. Hopping a cemetery fence after dark, they found an open grave, climbed in, and performed "nefarious activities" (which they decline to specify). "You only get so many opportunities in life to be so degenerate," says Erin, coyly.
Then, naturally, they went to Waffle House.
"It was like a beacon of love," recalled Isbell, who comes from Texas and had been "grieving" the chain’s absence out west. "I was like: 'Oh my God, this is better than I could have planned.' Like, I'm meant to do this."
The fluorescent lights had been wrapped in pink paper, lending everything a gentle glow. There were pink streamers, strings of paper hearts, and a kissing booth. The mood was tender yet unreal, like a scene from Twin Peaks (one of the pair’s favorite shows).
"It was perfect," said Isbell.
Today the couple are happy in Portland — but sadly, their nearest Waffle House is in Colorado. "We've looked," admits Isbell. "We've definitely looked."
'We enjoy silly things more than fancy things'
For White Castle diners Alex Remnique and their wife Caila, it's all about the comedy value.
"We love a bit. The two of us love a bit," says Remnique, a 35-year-old musician and non-profit worker in Brooklyn. "We enjoy doing the silly thing rather than the fancy thing. If a date idea is amusing, that's generally way more appealing than spending money for the sake of prestige or status or whatever."
Remnique had heard about Valentine's Day at White Castle years ago from an ex, and it had stuck in their head ever since. In 2023, they mentioned it to Caila — who loved the notion.
"The idea of getting a little bit fancy to go to a fast food restaurant is very enjoyable for us," says Remnique, who wore a nice fluffy coat and dangly sparkly earrings (which, they confess, may have come from Claire's Accessories).
There turned out to be many other queer couples there, and the staff "seemed very excited" by the occasion.
"It was just very cute and a lot of fun," says Remnique. "I would recommend it to a very specific type of couple. If you're not sure, I wouldn't surprise your date... but if they're like 'hell yeah', then I see no reason why not!"
The couple returned once, but haven’t made it a habit. They've moved on to other activities — like a trip to the New Jersey beach resort of Asbury Park — or, indeed, new “bits.”
"I think we're maybe looking at Olive Garden this year," Remnique muses.
'If they don't like Waffle House, get a new sweetheart'
In Georgia, it was 14 years ago when Cenate Pruitt and his wife first seated their tiny son in a high chair at a Waffle House for a Valentine's Day dinner.
Pruitt, a 46-year-old sociology professor in Decatur, outside Atlanta, points out how ubiquitous Waffle House is in southern states.
"It’s open 24/7/365, and they’re up and down all the interstates here. It’s genuinely part of the culture of the region."
Waffle House had been the couple's "go-to comfort food" for years. Before they met, they'd often dined there on road trips, late at night after concerts, or as children with their families.
Still, when they visited for Valentine’s Day in 2012, the tradition was young enough that staff had been getting calls from confused customers asking if they were really serious. There were some teenagers on group dates, and a few older couples.
“It was exceptionally charming,” says Pruitt. "Everyone was really leaning into the kind of silly idea of Waffle House as a romantic spot, but it’s also a legitimately special place for some people. There’ve been a couple of actual weddings at Waffle Houses over the years...
"It was nice to be able to do Valentines Day on a weeknight, on a budget, and without having to hire a babysitter."
The couple are still going strong, and now their son is old enough to drive. They stopped doing Valentine's Day at Waffle House long ago, though, because it got so popular that they struggled to get a reservation.
Still, Pruitt recommends it unreservedly. "If you are in the kind of relationship where your sweetheart is down to do Valentines at Waffle House, do so!" he says. "If your sweetheart isn’t down — get a new sweetheart."

Russia likely killed opposition leader Navalny with dart frog poison, 5 European states say
Editor's note: This story is being updated.
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a dart frog toxin called epibatidine before he died in 2024, five European governments said in a joint statement on Feb. 14.
Navalny died on Feb. 16, 2024 in an Arctic penal colony in the town of Kharp, in Russia's Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District. The activist, who was Russian President Vladimir Putin's main opponent, was sentenced in several fabricated criminal cases, and some of his allies have also been imprisoned.
Laboratories in the U.K., Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands received Navalny's biological samples after his death and unanimously concluded that he was poisoned with epibatidine, the Insider, an independent Russian media outlet, reported on Feb. 14.
Intensive-care physician Alexander Polupan told the Insider that "the publicly available information about Alexei Navalny’s symptoms matches what is known about the effects of epibatidine."
"The U.K., Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries' governments said in a joint statement. "This is the conclusion of our governments based on analyses of samples from Alexei Navalny. These analyses have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine."
According to the statement, "Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes."
"But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the governments said. "Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."
The Kremlin has denied the accusations.

U.K. Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 that "Russia saw Navalny as a threat."
"By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition," she added.
Navalny's widow Yulia Navalnaya also commented on the announcement.
"Scientists from five European countries have determined that my husband, Alexei Navalny, was poisoned with epibatidine — a neurotoxin and one of the deadliest poisons on earth," Navalnaya wrote on X. "In nature, this poison can be found on the skin of an Ecuadorian tree frog. It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death."
She said that she was "certain from the very first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapons."
"I am grateful to the European states for the painstaking work they carried out over two years, and for bringing the truth to light," Navalnaya said. "Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes."
This was not the first poisoning of Navalny. In 2020, he was poisoned in Russia and flown for treatment to Germany while in a coma.
German doctors, as well as several independent labs in Europe, said in 2020 that he had been poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent – a chemical weapon produced by the Russian government.
A joint investigation by The Insider, Bellingcat, CNN, and Der Spiegel revealed that Navalny had been poisoned by agents of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) in 2020. The media outlets also identified the agents' names.
The journalists obtained data on the alleged murderers’ travel and mobile phone data. A special chemical substances unit of Russia’s Federal Security Service had been following Navalny for years, including during his trip to Siberia when the assassination attempt took place.
Navalny impersonated a Russian state official to speak to one of the members of the alleged poisoning team, Konstantin Kudryavtsev, in 2020. In the phone call with Navalny, Kudryavtsev admitted that he had taken part in the poisoning operation and said that the poison had been put in Navalny’s underwear.
Putin has admitted that the FSB squad had been conducting surveillance on Navalny but denied that they were tasked to kill him.
Despite the poisoning, Navalny decided to return to Russia after his treatment in 2021 and was jailed by the authorities.
The same FSB squad that allegedly tried to kill Navalny had also trailed three other people before they were found dead with signs of poisoning, including syringe pricks, from 2014 to 2019, according to an investigation by Bellingcat, The Insider, CNN, and Der Spiegel.
Meanwhile, the FSB poisoning team also followed liberal politician Vladimir Kara-Murza when he was poisoned in 2015 and then again in 2017, although he survived, Bellingcat, the Insider and Der Spiegel reported.
In a separate incident, former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived after being poisoned in the U.K. with the Novichok nerve agent in the city of Salisbury, England, in 2018. Dawn Sturgess, a British citizen, accidentally came into contact with the poison and died as a result.
The British authorities identified Russian military intelligence agents using the passports of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Bashirov as suspects in the murder case.
"In both cases (Navalny's 2020 poisoning and the Skripal case), only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law to carry out the attacks," the U.K., Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands said on Feb. 14. "These latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention."
Meanwhile, the Russian government's Organic Chemistry and Technology Institute has been developing both Novichok and epibatidine, the Insider reported.
"(The Feb. 14 announcement on Navalny's poisoning) proves that we have an authoritarian regime in Russia that does not respect the rule of law," Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told the Kyiv Independent.
He added that Russia has experienced "a steady move towards a more authoritarian system bordering on a totalitarian one."
"Navalny was poisoned by Putin," Russian exiled opposition politician Mikhail Khodorkovsky told the Kyiv Independent. "For us it wasn't (even) a question. We know that and our investigations (confirmed) it directly. We didn't know what type of poison was used but for us it doesn't matter."
He added that "if Putin decides to kill somebody, it's 90% that this person will be killed, and if you think about that every day, you can go crazy."
President Volodymyr Zelensky was asked by reporters at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14 if he feared that Putin would target him with assassination by poison.
"I'm not thinking about myself," he said. "So, I'm one of all the people in Ukraine who are in Ukraine. ... They attack us with, you see, hundreds and hundreds of drones and missiles. What is the difference between poison and missile? I don't see the difference."
Kyiv Independent reporter Martin Fornusek contributed to this report.

Police seal off road near Arizona home of Today show host Samantha Guthrie’s missing mother

Law enforcement investigating the disappearance of Today show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother, Nancy, sealed off a road near her home in Arizona late Friday night.
A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock that was set up about 2 miles (3.2km) from the house.
The two agencies also tagged and towed a Range Rover SUV from a Culver’s restaurant parking lot. The restaurant is just over 2 miles from Nancy Guthrie’s home. This activity took place at the same time the sheriff’s office closed a road just north of the Guthrie home.
The Pima county sheriff’s department said the activity was part of the Guthrie case, but also said the FBI requested that it not release further information.
On Saturday morning, the department confirmed that a federal court-ordered search warrant was carried out at a residence in connection with the ongoing investigation into Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance. But it added that no arrests were made during the search. The roads were later reopened.
Guthrie, 84, was reported missing on 1 February. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch of her Tucson-area home. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
Authorities have expressed concerns about Guthrie’s health because she needs daily medication. She is said to have a pacemaker and has dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Investigators have studied surveillance video, sorted through thousands of tips, and submitted DNA and other evidence for laboratory analysis.
Pima county sheriff Chris Nanos indicated to the New York Times that he shared public frustration at the pace of the investigation.
“It’s exhausting, these ups and downs. But we will keep moving forward,” he told the newspaper “Maybe it’s an hour from now. Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy.”
Critics of the handling of the investigation point to an initial misstep when Guthrie’s home was cleared as a crime scene a day after she went missing.
The home stood unguarded as reporters and others wandered the property before it was then closed off again for the FBI to conduct its own search. Nanos acknowledged at an earlier news conference that the decision was like playing “Monday morning quarterback” but: “Absolutely. I probably could have held off on that.”
The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
On Tuesday, authorities released footage showing an armed and masked person at Guthrie’s doorstep on the night she was abducted. The videos – less than a combined minute in length – gave investigators and the public their first glimpse of who was outside Guthrie’s home in the foothills outside Tucson.
Experts say the video could contain a mountain of clues.

African Union summit clouded by Saudi-UAE rivalry in Horn of Africa
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON/NAIROBI, Feb 14 - A feud between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates across the Horn of Africa is overshadowing this weekend’s African Union summit, though most of the continent’s leaders will try to avoid taking sides, nine diplomats and experts said.
What began as a rivalry in Yemen has spread across the Red Sea into a region riven with conflicts - from war in Somalia and Sudan to rivalry between Ethiopia and Eritrea and a divided Libya.
In recent years, the UAE has become an influential player in the Horn - encompassing primarily Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Djibouti - through multi-billion-dollar investments, robust diplomacy and discreet military support.
Saudi Arabia has been more low-profile but diplomats say Riyadh is building an alliance that includes Egypt, Turkey and Qatar.
“Saudi has woken up and realised that they might lose the Red Sea,” a senior African diplomat told Reuters. “They have been sleeping all along while UAE was doing its thing in the Horn.”
Initially focused on the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - both crucial shipping routes, the rivalry is now reaching further inland.
“Today it is in Somalia, but it is also playing out in Sudan, Sahel and elsewhere,” the diplomat said.
COMPELLED TO CHOOSE A SIDE
While these conflicts have strong local drivers, Gulf involvement is forcing countries, regions and even warlords to choose a side, diplomats said.
Michael Woldemariam, a Horn of Africa expert at the University of Maryland, said regional actors, including Eritrea, Djibouti, Somalia and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), have grown uneasy with the UAE’s “muscular” foreign policy.
“Saudis may seek to limit or curtail UAE in the Horn but, it remains to see how that will play out,” he said. “UAE has a lot of leverage across the region – it has this expeditionary military presence and dense financial linkages.”
Saudi officials say UAE activities in Yemen and the Horn threaten their national security.
Senior Emirati officials say their strategy strengthens states against extremists, while U.N. experts and Western officials argue it has sometimes fuelled conflict and empowered authoritarian leaders, charges the UAE denies.
The officials and diplomats interviewed in this story declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.
AVOIDING A BRAWL BETWEEN GULF POWERS
Israel’s recognition of Somaliland’s independence bid is the starkest example so far of tensions being stoked.
Somalia has cut all ties with Abu Dhabi, accusing it of influencing Israel's recognition of Somaliland. Mogadishu has since signed a defence agreement with Qatar, while Turkey sent fighter jets to the capital in a show of force.
Tensions are also rising between African Union host Ethiopia and neighbouring Eritrea, which have been on the verge of war for months. Eritrea’s leader recently visited Saudi Arabia, a trip that analysts perceived as signalling Saudi backing.
UAE and Saudi Arabia back opposing sides in Sudan’s war, all the sources and experts interviewed said. The UAE is accused of providing logistical support to the RSF paramilitary, while states in line with Saudi Arabia largely back the SAF.
Egypt, a Saudi ally, has deployed Turkish-made drones along its border with SAF and used them to strike RSF in Sudan, security officials said.
Analysts said Ethiopia benefits from UAE support, and Reuters found this week that Ethiopia is hosting a base in western Ethiopia where RSF fighters are recruited and trained.
Ethiopia has not publicly commented on the story.
'ACTING THROUGH ALLIES AND PROXIES'
Across the region, Saudi Arabia often acts through allies and proxies rather than directly, experts said.
Woldemariam said African countries were likely to tread carefully.
“Even those actors in the Horn who were alarmed by UAE influence may be cautious about how much they want to be caught up in a brawl between these two Gulf powers,” he said.
The Horn is not the only crisis on the AU summit's agenda.
War continues in Democratic Republic of Congo, and al Qaeda- and Islamic State-linked insurgencies are spreading across the Sahel region.
But those conflicts are still likely to take a back seat to the Horn.
Alex Rondos, the EU’s former special representative for the region, said the Horn had become a subsidiary arena for Middle East rivalries.
“Do the Saudis and UAE ... fully grasp the implications?” he said. “Will the Horn of Africa allow itself to be broken into pieces by these foreign rivalries and their African accomplices?” REUTERS

5 European nations say Russian opposition figure Navalny poisoned with dart frog toxin in prison
'Russia’s repeated disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention is clear,' says joint statement
Greater London
LONDON
Five European countries said on Saturday that Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny died in prison in 2024 after being poisoned with dart frog toxin.
In a joint statement, the UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands said they are "confident" that Navalny was poisoned with a "lethal toxin" following "analyses of samples" from his body.
"This is the conclusion of our Governments based on analyses of samples from Alexei Navalny. These analyses have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine," the statement said.
According to the European states, the epibatidine toxin found in the skin of dart frogs is native to South America and not naturally found in Russia.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death."
"Russia’s repeated disregard for international law and the Chemical Weapons Convention is clear," the statement added.
In August 2020, the UK, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and partners had condemned "Russia’s use of Novichok to poison Alexei Navalny."
This followed the use of Novichok in Salisbury in 2018, which led to the death of a British national, Dawn Sturgess. The Russian government has always denied involvement in the Salisbury poisonings.
"These latest findings once again underline the need to hold Russia accountable for its repeated violations of the Chemical Weapons Convention and, in this instance, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention," the European nations said.
The statement noted that permanent representatives of the five countries to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons wrote to the director general to inform him of this "Russian breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention."
The countries said they were "further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons."
Moscow announced Navalny’s death in a Siberia prison in February 2024 while he was serving a 19-year sentence on charges of extremism.
Russia's Federal Prison Service said the 47-year-old "felt bad" after a walk and lost consciousness "almost immediately."

BrewDog owners say craft beer company could be sold off
The brand, which produces Elvis Juice and Punk IPA, is looking for new investors

Craft beer brand BrewDog could be sold off after the company started the process to find new investors.
The Scottish beer brand recently announced plans to close all of its distilling brands, meaning it would no longer produce any of its spirits, including Duo Rum, Abstrakt Vodka, and Lonewolf Gin, at its distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
The company, which was founded in 2007, said it made the decision to focus on its beer brands, including the highly-popular Punk IPA, Elvis Juice, and Hazy Jane.
Now, in a statement, a spokesperson for BrewDog said the company had appointed Alix Partners to “support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.”
The statement said: “As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company.
“Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business. This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.”
Although no decisions have been made, a sale is under consideration.
In a statment BrewDog added: “BrewDog remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No.1 independent brewer in the UK, and with a highly engaged global community. We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.”
According to reports by Sky News, AlixPartners had begun sounding out prospective buyers in the last few days.
The company, which has 72 bars worldwide and four breweries in Scotland, the US, Australia, and Germany, said its breweries, bars, and venues will continue to operate as normal. It employs 1400 people across the organisation.
BrewDog’s founders James Watt and Martin Dickie are the company's major shareholders alongside private equity company TSG, which invested £213 million in 2017, making it a 21 per cent shareholder.
In 2024, the beer brand grossed £357 million in sales, and it is a major independent brewer with 4 per cent market share in the UK grocery market.

Hariri signals Future Movement's return to Lebanon elections
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BEIRUT, Feb 14 - Former Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, one of the country's best-known politicians, indicated on Saturday that his party would contest upcoming elections, four years after he stepped back from public office.
In a speech marking the 21st anniversary of the assassination of his father Rafik, who was also prime minister, Saad told supporters in Beirut that others would “hear our voice, and count our votes” when elections take place.
It was unclear whether Hariri plans to run himself, although his popularity amongst Lebanon's Sunni Muslims remains strong. Huge masses gathered in Beirut’s Martyrs Square waving his party's flag and chanting his name. “You're not a few, and you never were,” Hariri told his supporters.
Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri said on Friday that elections will be held as scheduled on May 10, despite calls from some politicians to postpone the vote, due in part to security concerns in southern Lebanon, where Israel has carried out air strikes targeting militant group Hezbollah.
Hariri, a three-time former premier, stepped back from politics in 2022 and blocked his Future Movement from running in a parliamentary vote that year, citing reasons including Iran's influence in the country - an indirect reference to Hezbollah.
The Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah had played a growing role in Lebanon's internal politics, but was severely weakened after a 2024 conflict with Israel. It is now under U.S.-backed pressure to disarm since a ceasefire in late 2024.
Before stepping back from politics, Hariri led one of parliament's biggest factions after inheriting his father's mantle.
His Future Movement's absence from Lebanon's 2022 parliamentary election resulted in fractured Sunni Muslim representation in parliament, where seats are divided according to a sectarian quota system. REUTERS

Turkish top diplomat meets head of National Committee for Administration of Gaza

Türkiye's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan met Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), Turkish diplomatic sources said.
The NCAG, formed after the October ceasefire in Gaza, is a Palestinian governance body under recent peace efforts to oversee Gaza’s civil administration and reconstruction, with Türkiye offering diplomatic backing and humanitarian support to help stabilise and rebuild the besieged enclave.
The NCAG said on Saturday that statements by the Gaza administration regarding readiness to hand over all public institutions pave the way for enabling the body to fully assume its responsibilities in managing the transitional phase.
In a statement, the committee, said it “views the recent expression of readiness for an orderly transition as a pivotal step in fulfilling its mandate as the transitional administration of Gaza.”
Gaza's media office on Thursday renewed its call for the national committee to begin carrying out its duties. Hamas has also repeatedly announced readiness to facilitate the committee’s work.
The entry of committee members into Gaza requires field and security coordination through crossings controlled by Israel. No official position has yet been issued by the body, explaining the delay in its entry, and Israel has not commented on the matter.
Seeking operational independence
The committee said that enabling it to operate efficiently and independently in Gaza would “unlock international support for recovery, reconstruction, secure a complete Israeli withdrawal, and restore normal daily life.”
The committee also called on mediators and all parties concerned to “to intensify efforts to resolve outstanding issues without delay,” stressing that the Palestinian people “cannot afford more time lost; we must move now to ensure a smooth and credible transition.”
The October 10 ceasefire halted Israel’s two-year war on Gaza, though violations continue despite a drop in attacks and limited aid entering the besieged enclave.
Palestinian officials say more than 72,000 people were killed and 171,000 injured, with 90 percent of civilian infrastructure destroyed, while the UN estimates reconstruction costs at around $70 billion.
Gaza’s Health Ministry says at least 591 Palestinians have been killed and 1,578 injured since the truce took effect.

How serious is Venezuela about its amnesty law?

How serious is Venezuela about its amnesty law?
February 14, 2026It is not uncommon to hear glowing words about Venezuelan unity at the National Assembly in the capital Caracas. Acting President Delcy Rodriguez did not hold back when she presented her draft amnesty law for political prisoners last month. After it was approved in a first reading, Rodriguez said it was a major step "towards peace and reconciliation."
Venezuela's parliament is dominated by toppled former President Nicolas Maduro's United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). A second reading is scheduled for Tuesday.
Conflicting numbers about prisoner releases
The Venezuelan government claims to have released 900 political prisoners since December 2025. According to the opposition and human rights organizations, prisoners have indeed been released but not as many as the government says.
Foro Penal, a Venezuelan human rights organization, reported that as of February 9, there were 687 political prisoners in Venezuela, down from 887 in November 2025.
If these figures are correct, only 200 have been released, though Foro Penal's definition of politically motivated imprisonment is regarded as narrow. The opposition alliance Plataforma Unitaria Democratica claims 391 people have been released so far.
Little hope for end to political repression
Venezuela's interim leader Rodriguez has not acknowledged that the prisoner release was at least partly due to huge international pressure, especially from the United States.
Venezuelan political scientist Benigno Alarcon Deza says "the state's capacity for repression remains intact." He adds the mooted closure of El Helicoide, a notorious detention center in Caracas for political prisoners, will not change this.
As if to confirm such fears, a close ally of Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate Maria Corina Machado, Juan Pablo Guanipa, was re-arrested on Monday after taking part in a demonstration calling for the release of all political prisoners. He had been freed the day before.
The amnesty law itself has also been criticized. For Gonzalo Himiob, the vice president of Foro Penal, the first "legal error" is in the introduction, which describes the law as an "act of mercy." Himiob argues the amnesty should be understood as a decision by the state not to punish people for political reasons rather than as an act of moral forgiveness.
He, and other critics of the law in its current form, argue the text reflects a sense of supposed kindness and mercy rather than justice. They say it lacks formulations that clearly identify guilt and responsibility, and excludes crimes such as human rights violations, drug trafficking and murder.
Political scientist Benigno Alarcon Deza says: "We should not be surprised if there is even talk of providing amnesty to people from the government itself."
Call for legal reforms to accompany amnesty
Last week, human rights organizations presented their concerns and proposed amendments to the parliamentary committee responsible for the amnesty law. They pointed out certain formulations that might be used as loopholes to rearrest political opponents after their release or even to prevent them from being set free at all.
On the online portal Venezuela Politica, Maibort Petit, a Venezuelan journalist who lives in the US, warned that "a general amnesty could be perceived as a political knee-jerk reaction rather than a genuine process of reconciliation process."
He said that structural reforms of the justice system and the state security apparatus were missing.
Himiob of Foro Penal also argues that if state repression is to be prevented in future, existing legislation and regulations that allow for political persecution need to be changed.

ITV boss admits X-Factor only existed so channel could keep Simon Cowell
Claudia Rosencrantz claims that ‘Pop Idol is the most beautiful format’ despite Cowell’s success with ‘Pop Idol’

Claudia Rosencrantz, the influential former ITV entertainment controller, has made a surprising revelation: she commissioned The X Factor primarily to secure Simon Cowell's continued presence at the broadcaster, despite her personal disdain for the show's format.
The 66-year-old admitted her strong preference for its predecessor, Pop Idol, during a new Magic Radio documentary, Popstars At 25: The Story Of A Talent Show Revolution.
Rosencrantz was unequivocal in her critique of the two programmes, stating: "X Factor is not as good a format as Pop Idol, it just isn’t, Pop Idol is the most beautiful format."
She went on to laud Pop Idol as "perfect, pure format, and it works, and it’s worked in every single territory in the world that it’s hit, The X Factor hasn’t, and the reason it hasn’t is it’s not as pure."
Furthermore, she criticised The X Factor's mentoring system, suggesting judges had "too much skin in the game," ultimately deeming Pop Idol a "much, much better show."
Reflecting on the difficult choice, Rosencrantz stated: "I think at the time, with my ITV hat on, Simon was, he was an absolutely huge star, and as a network, did we need to stick with Simon, or did we need to stick with the better show?"
She called it "the worst and most painful decision I’ve ever had to make, but if I had to make it again, I would make the same one, because Simon was absolutely amazing at that time, and he was going to go off to America." Her priority was to "keep a hold of him here on on ITV as his home network," which she felt was "quite an important thing."
The X Factor concluded in 2018, following Pop Idol's run from 2001 to 2003. During its time on the air, the show discovered acts like One Direction, Little Mix, Olly Murs, JLS and Leona Lewis.
Simon Cowell has remained with ITV, judging Britain’s Got Talent since 2007 and currently stars alongside the likes of Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, and new judge KSI.
Rosencrantz's full interview features in episode one of Popstars At 25: The Story Of A Talent Show Revolution, launching on Magic Radio at 7pm on Sunday, February 15, and available via the Rayo app.

Zelensky in Munich demonstrates visualization of Russia's massive strike on Ukraine
He presented this visualization during his speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform’s correspondent reports.
"Right now you can see a visualization of one of Russias attacks. Many of you were already here in Munich when this strike took place. Russia launched 24 ballistic missiles, one air launched guided missile, and 219 attack drones against our cities: Kyiv, Dnipro, Odesa," Zelensky said while commenting on the footage.
He noted that to repel this attack, Ukraine’s air defense used missiles that had arrived from partners on Sunday, February 8.
"And on Thursday night, the missiles were already protecting our skies. And this is just one night, but Russian attacks happen almost every night in Ukraine, and at least once a week massive strikes," he emphasized.
He called on partners to continue supporting Ukraine’s air defense, especially the PURL program, through which Ukraine purchases weapons, primarily air defense missiles, from the United States.
"Sometimes we manage to deliver new missiles to our Patriots or NASAMS right before an attack, sometimes literally at the last moment. And I want to especially thank Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands for their strong leadership in Europe when it comes to providing us with air defense systems. Thank you very much. These systems protect our lives," Zelensky said.
As reported, on the night of February 12, Russia launched 219 attack drones at Ukraine, a significant number of them Shahed-type drones, as well as 25 missiles, 24 of them ballistic.

MUNICH, Germany — Kyiv is ready to make peace, but European leaders need to be ready for Russian aggression because Russia’s Vladimir Putin is “a slave to war,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
“The longer the war continues, the more resources the aggressor receives, the more dangerous the consequences become, the more dangerous the evolution of weapons and of war itself is, and the evolution of Putin,” Zelenskyy said in a keynote speech.
Putin “is no longer interested in anything else” than war, as “he cannot imagine life without power or after power,” Zelenskyy added.

China’s Wang Yi blasts Japan over Taiwan remarks at Munich conference
Japanese defense chief says Tokyo remains open to dialogue with Beijing
ISTANBUL
China’s foreign minister on Saturday criticized Japan over remarks by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Taiwan, saying the comments undermine China’s territorial sovereignty.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Wang Yi said Takaichi’s statements last year violated Japan’s commitments to China and provoked Beijing, as tensions persist in China-Japan relations.
The dispute follows Takaichi’s comments in November that a potential Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan, potentially allowing Tokyo to exercise collective self-defense.
Responding to a question about possible renewed tensions in the Asia-Pacific region and China’s role in preventing escalation, Wang downplayed concerns about rising regional instability.
“I don’t think the situation in Asia-Pacific is becoming increasingly tense. In this world, Asia is probably the only region that maintains overall peace,” he said.
Wang then criticized Takaichi’s remarks and Japan’s position on Taiwan.
“This is the first time in eight years that a Japanese Prime Minister has uttered such words. It directly violates China’s territorial sovereignty, and it directly challenges the fact that Taiwan has been returned to China,” he said.
“It can completely violate Japan’s commitment to China. Could China possibly accept this provocation? No way,” he added.
Wang also compared Japan’s handling of its wartime past with Germany’s response after the Nazi era, saying Berlin “conducted a thorough reckoning with Nazi crimes and passed laws to ban all speech and actions promoting Nazi ideology.” He said Japan, however, still “pays homage to Class-A war criminals, who are enshrined as so-called heroic spirits.”
“This means that Japan has lingering ambitions for invasion and colonialism of Taiwan and the ghost of militarism are still haunting the country,” he said.
Wang urged the Japanese people not to “let the right far right extremists fall and track them along,” and called on countries that care about peace to “shout” to Japan that “if you go back down that old road, it will be a dead end. If you try gambling again, loss will be faster and more devastating.”
A day earlier, Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi told the Munich Security Conference that Tokyo seeks dialogue with Beijing despite differences.
He said he met his Chinese counterpart, Dong Jun, in Malaysia last year.
“Even though we have differences and we have disagreements, Japan's stance is very clear. We are always open to the dialogue,” Koizumi said.
“We are not going to shut down any channels. Regardless of differences … I (would) like to send this message to the Chinese side, that we always welcome dialogue,” he added.
Koizumi also said countries around Japan “continue opaque military build-up,” and that the regional military balance has been “greatly and rapidly evolving in the East and the South China Seas.”

England beat Scotland to get T20 World Cup bid back on track
England beat Scotland by five wickets in India to recover position in group at 2026 T20 World Cup.
Tom Banton’s unbeaten 63 led England to a five-wicket T20 World Cup victory over Scotland in Kolkata on Saturday that kept Harry Brook’s side on course for the Super Eights.
Victory in their final Group C match against Italy on Monday at the same Eden Gardens stadium will see England safely into the next round.

After bowling Scotland out for 152, England racked up 155-5 in 18.2 overs, with Jacob Bethell scoring 32, Sam Curran 28 and Will Jacks (16 off 10 balls) hitting a six and a four to finish the job.
England wobbled at the start of their chase as the new white ball swung under the floodlights with the sun going down.
Phil Salt fell third ball to Brandon McMullen for just two and when Jos Buttler picked out McMullen off Brad Currie, they were 13-2.
Scotland bowled tightly until Bethell broke the shackles by hitting McMullen for a six and two fours in the fifth over.
Spinner Mark Watt also came in for some punishment, conceding 22 off his first over as Banton took him for three huge sixes.
A 66-run partnership ended when the left-handed Bethell, on 32, helped a leg-side delivery from Oliver Davidson into the grateful hands of Brad Wheal at short fine leg.
Captain Brook did not last long, scooping Michael Leask over his shoulder to Wheal to make it 86-4, but England were always in control and got home with 10 balls to spare.

He and Tom Bruce put on 71 for the fourth wicket, but it was their only notable partnership.
Spinner Liam Dawson ended it in the 13th over when Bruce was caught for 24, Curran providing the safe hands at deep square leg.
When Adil Rashid trapped Berrington lbw in the next over, Scotland collapsed, losing their last seven wickets for 39 runs from 113-3.
Jofra Archer had been expensive in the two previous outings but made the early breakthroughs before finishing with a brilliant 2-24 off his four overs.
In his second over, he hurried George Munsey into top-edging to Banton and two balls later had McMullen caught by Salt in the deep.
Michael Jones (33) holed out to Bethell off Curran, and Scotland were 42-3 at the end of the six-over power play and never threatened a competitive total.
Rashid was the best of the England bowlers with 3-36 from his four overs, while Dawson took 2-34.

Trusting Trump is hard but NATO’s newest member won’t ditch the US yet

BRUSSELS — Sometimes it is the answers politicians decline to give that are the most revealing — like whether it’s still possible, after clashing bitterly over the fate of Greenland, for a European leader to trust Donald Trump.
“I don’t do that kind of judgment,” Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in an interview with POLITICO, when asked directly if he can trust the U.S. president. “The discussion we had on Greenland and Denmark was a bad one.”
But European leaders, he believes, took the decision to “stand up” for their values and for European integrity in the face of Trump’s aggression — and it worked. “We protected European interests, Danish interests, broader European interests as well. And we did that very clearly.”

In an exclusive interview with FRANCE 24, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte discussed the evolving role of Europe in global security, emphasising that the alliance is stronger today than it was a year ago. Reflecting on NATO's transformation, Rutte highlighted how the leadership of U.S. President Donald Trump, particularly his push for higher defence spending, played a crucial role in reshaping the alliance's priorities.
Rutte also noted Europe's growing responsibility within NATO, stressing that nations are increasingly taking charge of their own defence. However, he reiterated that the U.S. remains deeply anchored in NATO, which continues to be vital for the security of Europe and the Atlantic. On the war in Ukraine, Rutte stressed the urgency of providing more support, acknowledging that the current pace of aid remains insufficient.
As NATO faces new challenges, Rutte’s remarks underscored the strategic shift that has strengthened the alliance in the face of Russian aggression and growing global tensions.

USA Used Claude AI Model to Capture Nicolás Maduro

The US military used artificial intelligence tools from Anthropic during a secret operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
This was reported by The Wall Street Journal, citing its own sources.
The mission, which took place last month in Caracas, was the first confirmed case of Anthropic models being used in secret operations by the US Department of Defense.
The use of the Claude model was made possible by Anthropic’s partnership with Palantir Technologies, whose software is the basis for analytics at the Pentagon and federal law enforcement agencies.
Although the exact list of AI tasks in this operation has not been disclosed, the military typically uses such tools for rapid document analysis, processing of intercepted data, and control of autonomous drones.
This incident sparked a sharp conflict between the developer and the US government. Anthropic’s rules officially prohibit the use of Claude to promote violence, develop weapons, or conduct surveillance.
Due to these ethical restrictions, the Trump administration is already considering canceling a $200 million contract with Anthropic. Defense Secretary Pete Hagseth previously stated that the department would not work with models that ‘prohibit warfare,’ hinting specifically at Claude’s strict security filters.
Operation Absolute Resolve began at dawn on January 3, 2026. US Delta Force special forces, supported by aviation, raided targets in Caracas, having first suppressed Venezuela’s air defense system.
More than 150 aircraft took part in the mission, and technology to disable communications and electricity was used during the assault itself. According to the fighters, just before the assault on the government quarter, all radars in the air defense units suddenly failed.
After American drones and helicopters appeared in the sky, the soldiers felt the effect of a powerful energy wave that effectively suppressed any possibility of resistance.
One Venezuelan soldier described unbearable internal pain, disorientation, and a feeling of “his head splitting open from the inside.” Many soldiers began to experience massive nosebleeds and internal bleeding, which literally prevented them from getting up off the ground.
Maduro and his wife were detained at their residence and immediately taken to the United States.

US open to discuss security guarantees – Zhovkva
The Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Ihor Zhovkva in an interview with TSN, Ukrinform reports.
"It is very important that today the United States is not afraid to discuss security guarantees," he said.
Zhovkva recalled that the 20th package of EU sanctions is expected closer to February 24.
"There are many important measures there, in particular regarding the termination of so-called maritime services. This concerns the Russian 'shadow fleet' that transports the same types of export raw materials. Every time we tell EU representatives: yes, it is very important that more and more vessels are being added to the 'shadow fleet' register, but is this enough? Or perhaps it is already worth creating obstacles so that this shadow fleet does not operate, even despite the sanctions?" he noted.
He stated that we can now see examples of some countries beginning to respond by detaining these vessels, as France and Estonia recently did.
"They detain these tankers, inspect them, and for a certain period even bring them into their ports. But then they are forced to release them. Why? Because there is no appropriate legislative framework for fully stopping these vessels and terminating their voyages," Zhovkva explained.
As Ukrinform reported, on January 6 German Federal Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated that Germany fundamentally does not rule out anything regarding its contribution to security guarantees for Ukraine after a ceasefire, including deploying forces in neighboring NATO countries and participating in monitoring.

Zelenskyy suggests ceasefire so that Russia can hold elections
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that Ukraine is ready to hold elections provided that a two-month ceasefire is in place, and has offered to guarantee a ceasefire for Russia so that they can hold elections too.
Source: Zelenskyy speaking at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by Suspilne, Ukraine's national public broadcaster
Quote: "I'm very honest. Give us two months of ceasefire, [and] we will go to elections. That's it.
Give us ceasefire, give us security, infrastructure. Maybe not two months, but we need a lot of days to prepare. Then give us the possibility [for] our soldiers to vote… I mean, how they can defend our lives, our country, and at the same moment vote? This is something difficult."
Details: Zelenskyy said comparisons with elections in other countries during wartime are irrelevant because of the scale of the threats.
Quote: "So give us ceasefire. President Trump can do this. Push Putin, make ceasefire, then our parliament will change the law and we will go to elections – if they need them. If Americans need elections in Ukraine and if Russians need elections in Ukraine, we are open for this."
More details: Zelenskyy added that Ukraine could also "give ceasefire for Russians if they will do elections in Russia".

From dogfight to brink of war: when Britain planned to bomb Tel Aviv and Truman said 'Don't'
Unknown

22:30:11 KST

Less than a year after its founding, the young State of Israel faced what could have become one of the gravest crises of its early existence: a planned British airstrike on Tel Aviv.
The dramatic episode unfolded in early 1949, during Israel’s War of Independence. In a single day, Israeli Air Force pilots shot down five British aircraft over the Negev amid fighting with Egyptian forces. Britain, whose Royal Air Force units were stationed in Egypt, prepared what Israeli newspapers later described as a large-scale retaliatory bombing of Tel Aviv.
The strike was called off just hours before takeoff — after direct intervention by U.S. President Harry Truman.
A mistaken dogfight
In late 1948, the Israel Defense Forces launched Operation Horev, aimed at driving Egyptian forces out of the Negev. British aircraft based near the Suez Canal routinely conducted reconnaissance flights over battle zones, at times crossing into Israeli territory. Their more advanced planes could operate beyond the range of Israeli anti-aircraft fire.
On a cold morning in January 1949, two aircraft crossed the border and spotted smoke rising from the ground. They dove lower and saw an Israeli convoy in flames. Israeli troops, who had been attacked by Egyptian planes roughly 30 minutes earlier, assumed the aircraft were Egyptian returning to strike again and opened fire. One plane was shot down. Its British pilot parachuted and was captured by Israeli forces.
At the same time, Israeli Air Force aircraft on patrol identified additional British planes that had crossed the border. They engaged them, shooting down two. Furious, the British dispatched more aircraft, triggering a large-scale aerial battle.
By the end of the day, Britain had lost five planes. Israel lost none, though several Israeli aircraft — including one flown by Ezer Weizman, who would later become Air Force commander and president of Israel — were damaged but managed to land safely.
Only after landing did Israeli pilots realize the planes they had downed were British, not Egyptian.
That evening, the Israeli pilots, many of whom were veterans of Britain’s Royal Air Force during World War II, reportedly sent a message to their former counterparts: “Sorry about yesterday, but you were on the wrong side of the fence. Come over for a drink sometime — you’ll see many familiar faces.”
A planned strike on Tel Aviv
Behind the scenes, however, Britain was preparing retaliation.
According to a front-page report in Yedioth Ahronoth at the time, RAF headquarters in London ordered squadrons in Suez to prepare a dawn bombing mission targeting Tel Aviv.
The American envoy in Cairo learned of the plan and alerted the White House. Truman, recognizing the potential for a catastrophic escalation in the Middle East, intervened directly. Bypassing diplomatic channels, he reportedly called British Prime Minister Clement Attlee and demanded that the operation be halted.
At 3 a.m., roughly three hours before the armed aircraft were scheduled to take off, the order came down to cancel the attack.
More than 70 years before President Joe Biden would use similar language in a different regional crisis, Truman delivered a blunt message: “Don’t.”
The episode is revisited in the podcast “Hofert Journalism” from BePo, which explores the little-known incident that briefly brought Britain and Israel to the brink of open conflict — and the American intervention that prevented Tel Aviv from becoming a wartime target.

Why is Egypt bolstering ties with Somalia now?

Why is Egypt bolstering ties with Somalia now?
February 14, 2026Bilateral ties between Egypt and Somalia continue to deepen.
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi assured his Somali counterpart, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud on Sunday in Cairothat Egypt stands firmly behind "Somalia's unity and territorial integrity."
On Wednesday, Cairo then followed up on an agreement from January 2025 and deployed 1,091 troops to Somalia's capital Mogadishu.
The deployment of Egyptian forces to Somalia — the first such deployment in their decades-old bilateral history — marks a significant shift. Until now Egypt had only sent military equipment as part of a joint security deal with Mogadishu from August 2024.
The Egyptian soldiers will be part of the African Union-led peacekeeping force, the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). The international mission — which first operated under the name African Union Transition Mission in Somalia — has been in place since April 1, 2022. Its mission is to train and advise the Somali army and police as Somalia has been fighting for stability since the collapse of its central government in 1991. Clan infighting and above all, the extremist group al-Shabab, have caused problems.
"I would say there is a geopolitical race for influence in this area," Riccardo Fabiani, North Africa project director at the think tank International Crisis Group, told DW.
"Cairo wants to make sure that weak states are strengthened and they don't become a playground for external actors trying to become geopolitical powers along the Red Sea," he said.
Somalia, part of the Horn of Africa region, lies at several key junctions: It is located along the Indian Ocean with access to the Red Sea via the Gulf of Aden, the key route to the Suez Canal. It is opposite Yemen and shares a long border with Ethiopia.
Egyptian-Ethiopian tension
Somalia's political fragility is further compounded by debate about the breakaway region of Somaliland in the country's northwest. While Somaliland proclaimed independence as the "Republic of Somaliland" in May 1991, it has remained officially unrecognized by the international community for more than three decades.
That has recently changed. In January 2024, Ethiopia and Somaliland signed a memorandum of understanding granting landlocked Ethiopia access to the Red Sea and thus to international shipping routes in exchange for Ethiopia moving toward possible recognition of Somaliland. This deal was later renegotiated, following widespread regional condemnation.
"Cairo still remains very worried about Ethiopia's aim to establish a military presence on the Red Sea," Fabiani explained.
In December 2025, Israel became the first United Nations member state to formally recognize the Republic of Somaliland as a sovereign state, a decision Somalia, Egypt and many other countries condemned as a violation of Somalia's territorial integrity.
This recognition soured ties between Egypt and Israel. Relations have deteriorated over the war in Gaza following the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
For Israel, ties to Somaliland could prove helpful in case fighting with the Iran-backed Houthi militia in Yemen — which lies less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) across the Gulf of Aden — flares up again. The Houthi group has frequently attacked Israel and international shipping in the Red Sea in what it has said is its bid to support Hamas in Gaza.
For Egypt, Israel's new footprint in the Horn of Africa is an additional concern alongside Ethiopia's ambition to secure access to the Red Sea, Crisis Group's Fabiani said.
Meanwhile, other countries, such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are also keen on increasing their strategic influence across the Horn of Africa. Furthermore the war in neighboring Sudan, as well as the political instability in Libya and the friction between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates over Yemen's secessionist ambitions, drive instability in the region.
Water security
While all of this is on Cairo's regional radar, its second concern revolves around water security via the Nile River.
Egypt, a downstream country of the Nile River, has been critical of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, or GERD, since Ethiopia began constructing the roughly $5 billion (€4.2 billion) dam in April 2011. The dam was inaugurated in September 2025.
"Egypt heavily depends on Nile River water as a fresh water source but there are still no binding agreements that would provide Egypt with guarantees about its access to water," Timothy Kaldas, deputy director of the Washington-based Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, told DW. "For Cairo, this remains a national security interest," he said.
Even though Somalia is not directly affected by the GERD water dispute, years of political strife between Egypt and Ethiopia have further aligned Somalia and Egypt in their aim to form a regional counterweight to Addis Ababa.
Somali interests
Somalia continues to be more focused on domestic issues. For Mogadishu, the benefit of having Egyptian troops in the country isn't necessarily about Red Sea security or Ethiopian expansionism, Fabiani says.
"They do agree with Cairo on these points but their main priority is to strengthen control over Somali territory and to make sure that there is sufficient international backing for the recognition of the Somali federal government as the only authority over Somalia," he told DW.
In his view, by having Egyptian troops as part of AUSSOM, Somalia obtains international recognition of its authority as well as international support for its fight against al-Shabab.

MSF suspends some hospital operations in Gaza due to presence of armed men
Doctors Without Borders said it has suspended some operations at the largest functioning facility in Gaza after patients and its staff said they witnessed armed, masked men in parts of the hospital
- Bookmark
Aid group Doctors Without Borders announced the suspension of some of its operations at one of the largest functioning hospitals in Gaza after patients and staff reported seeing armed, masked men roaming parts of the medical facility.
Nasser Hospital, in Khan Younis city, is one of the few functioning hospitals left in the strip. Hundreds of patients and war-wounded have been treated there and the facility was a hub for Palestinian prisoners Israel released in exchange of Israeli hostages as part of the ceasefire deal.
Doctors Without Borders, known by its acronym MSF, said in a statement all its non-critical medical operations at Nasser Hospital were suspended due to “security breaches” that posed “serious security threats to our teams and patients”.
While the suspension occurred in January, MSF’s comments in the“frequently asked questions” section on its website were the first to disclose its decision. It's unclear when the post was made, but MSF's site said it was updated Feb. 11. The comments were a rare public announcement by an international organization about the presence of armed men in or near medical facilities since the war began over two years ago.
MSF said it made the difficult decision after an uptick of patients and staff seeing armed men in parts of the hospital compound since the U.S.-brokered October ceasefire was reached. The gunmen were seen in areas the medical aid group didn’t operate.
“MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” said the statement.
It’s unclear who the armed men are. MSF said it was unable to specify.
Attacks on health facilities
Armed groups have mushroomed across Gaza as a result of the war, including groups backed by Israel’s army in the Israeli-controlled part of the strip. Nasser Hospital staff says that in recent months it’s repeatedly been attacked by armed tribesmen and militias, despite police presence there.
The group said it had expressed its concern to the relevant authorities, stressing that hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces. It said its concerns were also heightened by previous and deliberate Israeli attacks on health facilities during the war.
Throughout the war, Israel has struck hospitals on repeated occasions, including Nasser, accusing Hamas of operating in or around them. Hamas security men have also often been seen inside hospitals, blocking access to some areas of the facilities.
Some hostages that were released from Gaza have said that they've spent time during their captivity in a hospital.
Police to be deployed
The Hamas-run interior ministry, which oversees the police force in Gaza, said Saturday police would be deployed to secure hospitals and rid them of armed presence. It said it would take legal action against violators and was in the process of implementing stricter measures to ensure patients’ safety.
While international law gives hospitals special protections during war, they can lose this immunity if combatants use them to hide fighters or store weapons, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross. Still, there has to be plenty of warning to allow the evacuation of staff and patients before any operations take place. If harm to civilians from an attack is disproportionate to the military objective, it is illegal under international law.
Aid groups and rights organizations say Israel has decimated Gaza's health system, forcing most of its hospitals to shut down while heavily damaging others. During the war, Israeli forces raided a number of hospitals and struck others, detaining hundreds of staff.
Impact on depleted medical system
MSF said that until further notice, it will continue supporting critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical departments for patients with traumatic or burn injuries. However, it's ending support to the paediatrics and maternity wards, including the neonatal intensive care unit. It's also indefinitely suspended its outpatient consultations for 3D burn screening and mental health, as well as other services.
Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the records department at the health ministry, said MSF's suspension would have a significant impact as hundreds of patients are admitted to the maternity and burn wards daily. He said the Ministry of Health would take over maternity patient care, but said burn victims won't have many options.
Israel has been cracking down on aid groups operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including MSF. The group is one of more than three dozen aid groups that Israel has banned from operating in the strip for failing to comply with new registration rules.
MSF says Israel's decision will have a catastrophic impact on its work in Gaza, where it provides funding and international staff for six hospitals as well as running two field hospitals and eight primary health centers, clinics and medical points. It also runs two of Gaza’s five stabilization centers, helping children with severe malnutrition.

MUNICH, Germany — The U.S. is not interfering in European politics, a senior U.S. State Department official told POLITICO on Saturday, despite reported efforts by the Trump administration to fund MAGA-aligned organizations on the continent.
Speaking at the POLITICO Pub on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers pushed back on a POLITICO report that Rogers and other Trump officials had held talks with groups in France and Britain and asked the Washington-based Heritage Foundation to provide a list of potential organizations to fund.
“The idea that we have a slush fund for the far right is a lie,” Rogers said. “It's not America's decision to govern who's elected in Europe.”

Starlink: How Elon Musk's company influences geopolitics
February 14, 2026Lack of internet access is a major problem in many regions of the world today.
Starlink was initially developed by the American tech billionaire Elon Musk to solve this problem. It was designed as a way of quickly getting the internet into regions all over the world where this was either impossible to do by conventional methods, or so expensive that it wasn't worth attempting.
Since then Starlink's field of application has widened significantly. It's used as a means of communication in disaster zones, but also by armies or protest movements, for example in regions where the existing internet has been destroyed by enemy fire or shut down by authoritarian governments.
How does Starlink work?
Starlink is a satellite-based system consisting of 10,000 small satellites located around the world. They transfer data packages via laser links and do not require a constant, direct visual link to a ground station.
Unlike other internet satellites, which orbit at around 36,000 kilometers above the Earth, Starlink satellites are only about 550 kilometers up. This means they can transmit internet signals much faster than the others.
All users need is a small receiver terminal with an electronically controlled antenna, which automatically steers toward the satellites as they pass overhead. The terminals receive signals from these satellites and transmit them to a nearby router, which supplies the broadband internet connection.
Where has Starlink already been deployed?
Ukraine: Since the start of the Russia's full-scale war in February 2022, Starlink has become a vital instrument of communication in the war zone. The Ukrainian armed forces use Starlink to coordinate units, operate drones and control unmanned ground systems. In the civilian sector, the system is used by hospitals, emergency services, energy suppliers and the railway network.
The Russian army is also said to be accessing Starlink, using terminals smuggled in illegally via third countries. The Ukrainian defense ministry has said it is working closely with Starlink's operating company SpaceX to limit Russian usage as much as possible.
Sudan: In the Sudanese civil war, Starlink is used primarily by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group fighting against the internationally-recognized government. Hundreds of devices were smuggled into the country via the United Arab Emirates, and there is now a thriving black market for Starlink terminals in Sudan. The RSF use them to communicate and coordinate with their militias, while the Sudanese Armed Forces are trying to block both the import and use of the terminals.
Iran: In early January 2026, protests erupted all across the country against the regime in Tehran. The government's hardline response included a nationwide internet shutdown. Reportedly, thousands of Starlink terminals were smuggled into Iran and sold on the black market. This enabled the protest movement to go on coordinating demonstrations against the regime, using Starlink to circumvent state censorship of the internet.
Venezuela: Here too, Starlink has been used in the past to sidestep information blackouts and secure access to the internet. For a long time, the service was only available unofficially, by buying kits from local dealers. Following the US intervention in early January 2026, during which then-head of state, Nicolas Maduro, was taken prisoner, Musk offered the people of Venezuela a month's free broadband internet service via Starlink.
Gaza: Starlink has been used for humanitarian purposes in the devastated Gaza Strip since July 2024. Aid organizations and a field hospital use it to facilitate telemedical assistance and logistical coordination. Access for civilians remains limited because of Israeli security concerns.
Why has Starlink been criticized?
Starlink is often the only way to access the internet in conflict zones. This gives Musk and his operating company SpaceX tremendous influence. Previously, for example, Musk refused to activate Starlink in Ukraine to enable an attack in Crimea. US President Donald Trump has also threatened to switch off the satellites in Ukraine, as a way of forcing Kyiv to make concessions in peace negotiations.
There has also been criticism from an ecological perspective. The Starlink satellites have a lifespan of less than five years. Every day, on average, one or two of them burn up in the Earth's atmosphere. This releases aluminum oxide, which could affect the ozone layer, contributing to global warming. In addition, all those thousands of satellites reflect the sunlight, making the night sky brighter, and this may also have repercussions for the world's animals.
Any Starlink alternatives?
In an effort to break Starlink's monopoly, other companies, especially in Europe, are already working on alternatives. At present, the biggest private competitor to SpaceX is a company called Eutelsat. With a fleet of over 600 satellites, its OneWeb service is far smaller, focusing on business customers and maritime use.
But Eutelsat is also involved in the development of IRIS2 — an acronym for Infrastructure for Resilience, Interconnectivity and Security by Satellite, an ambitious EU project to establish a highly secure satellite network. The aim is to make Europe less dependent on Starlink, but IRIS2 won't be operational before 2029.
Elon Musk also has competition inside the US from another billionaire, Jeff Bezos, whose company Amazon is currently working on Amazon Leo, known until recently as Project Kuiper. This is establishing a network of more than 3,200 new low-Earth-orbit satellites. Amazon plans to roll out the service later this year in the US, Canada, France, Britain and Germany.
The sky is clearly getting crowded. China is also refining two satellite communications systems of its own. Guowang, a state project conceived primarily for national and military purposes, will consist of up to 13,000 satellites, while another project, Qianfan, with an estimated 12,000 satellites, is more commercially oriented and aims to provide services to newly industrialized and developing countries. The first mass starts for both of these projects are planned for this year.

Five European countries claim that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a deadly toxin and blame the Kremlin for it.
The foreign ministries of the U.K., France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said Saturday that analysis of samples from Navalny, who died two years ago, "have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine." It is a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America.
The countries said that "only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law" to carry out the attack.
They said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests as President Vladimir Putin's fiercest foe, died in the Arctic penal colony in February 2024. He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before his death. Navalnaya has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny's death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.

Marco Rubio’s address at the Munich Security Conference marked a more conciliatory stance for the U.S., following Vice President JD Vance’s harsh critique of Europe last year for ignoring an internal “threat,” shirking its defense responsibilities, and allowing left-wing influence in cultural matters. Although Rubio still encouraged European allies to consider policies akin to Donald Trump’s America, his speech clearly aimed to ease tensions and mend transatlantic relations. Senior Fellow at Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, Elisabeth Brown, tells us more.

Navalny was poisoned by Kremlin, say 5 European countries
February 14, 2026The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands issued a statement on Saturday saying they had concluded an analysis into death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.
The samples from the late politician, who died in prison two years ago, "have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine," a deadly toxin that comes from a South American poison dart frog.
"Only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law," to carry out the killing, their statement said, adding that they would report the Kremlin to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons for treaty violations.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him," said the German Foreign Ministry.
"Navalny's poisoning must have consequences," German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul added.
UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper added: "Russia saw Navalny as a threat. By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition."
Who was Alexei Navalny?
A former corporate lawyer, Navalny took to politics to fight widespread corruption and electoral fraud that observers say has long kept Putin's United Russia party in power.
He was imprisoned twice on embezzlement charges, which he and his widow Yulia Navalnaya say were fabricated to silence him. He survived an attempted poisoning with the Novichok nerve agent in 2020, a poison known to be used by Russian agents in political assassinations.
Navalny was jailed in a penal colony in the Arctic when officials announced that he had died on February 16, 2024.
Navalnaya said her late husband's killing was now proven by "science-proven facts' and thanked the investigators in a post on social media.
"Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes," she added.

Russia fatally 'poisoned' Putin critic Navalny with rare toxin, European states say
Five European countries accused Russia of "poisoning" opposition leader Alexei Navalny using a rare toxin found in South American dart frogs, according to a joint statement issued Saturday. A leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Navalny died in an Arctic penal colony in February 2024.
Five European countries accused Russia on Saturday of "poisoning" opposition leader Alexei Navalny in 2024 using a "rare toxin", according to a statement issued on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said, following an "analyses of samples" from his body.

"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death," the statement said.
"Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."

Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnya, said it was now "science-proven" that the Kremlin opponent had been murdered.
"Two years ago I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," Navalnaya said on the sidelines of the conference.
"I was of course certain that it was a murder... but back then it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts," Navalnaya added.
Navalnaya last September said that laboratory analysis of smuggled biological samples found he was killed by poisoning.
"Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin's barbaric plot to silence his voice," UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, who met Navalnaya while attending the Munich conference, said in a statement.

Navalny was previously poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in 2020 while campaigning in Siberia and was flown to Germany on an emergency evacuation flight, where he spent months recovering.
The charismatic anti-corruption campaigner had rallied hundreds of thousands across Russia in anti-Kremlin protests as he exposed the alleged ill-gotten gains of Putin's inner circle.

UAE-Saudi rift over security threats push Arab mediators to act
Bahrain and Egypt are attempting to mend ties between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, after a public falling out in December.
Bahrain and Egypt are attempting to mend ties between the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two sources said, weeks into a diplomatic rift between the Arab world’s most powerful countries.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE had a public falling out in December, when the kingdom accused its neighbour of threatening its national security by supporting Yemeni separatists who orchestrated a brief land grab.
A source close to the Saudi government insisted there was “no need for mediation” because direct channels are open between the two countries.
Although Riyadh and Abu Dhabi did not break ties, they have had no high-level diplomatic contact since the last week of December, according to several sources who requested anonymity.
“Bahrain is leading mediation efforts between Saudi and the UAE that aim at ending the ongoing misunderstanding,” said one Gulf official.
The goal, he said, was to “bridge the gap and bring viewpoints closer.”
“It’s a Gulf issue and it should be resolved in the Gulf,” he said, adding that this was a “Bahraini effort, not a GCC effort,” in reference to regional bloc the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was likely fatally poisoned in prison, European leaders say
An analysis of samples from deceased Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny shows he was likely fatally poisoned in a Russian prison, according to multiple European governments.
In a joint statement, the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said they are confident Navalny was poisoned. Samples from Navalny "conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine," a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America, according to the statement.
"Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes," the countries said. "But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause of his death. Navalny died while held in prison, meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison to him."
British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said in a statement that "Russia saw Navalny as a threat" and poisoned him as a show of strength.
"By using this form of poison, the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition," Cooper said.
The United Kingdom's foreign office said that "only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny" and that they "hold it responsible for his death."
Navalny's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany that her husband's death was now a "science-proven fact," according to the AFP.
"Two years ago, I came on stage here and said that it was Vladimir Putin who killed my husband," said Navalnaya, who said in September that independent labs found her husband was poisoned shortly before his death but did not provide proof for the claim or elaborate on what the alleged poison was. At the time, she said the labs were not publishing their results due to "political considerations."
"I was of course certain that it was a murder," Navalnaya continued, the AFP reported. "Back then, it was just words. But today these words have become science-proven facts."
Navalny was the loudest critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. He crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests. He was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok while flying from Moscow to Siberia in 2020 and treated in Germany. Navalny later told 60 Minutes' Lesley Stahl that he believed the poisoning was an assassination attempt engineered by Putin. Russia has denied any involvement.
Navalny returned to Moscow in 2021, facing certain arrest. He was convicted three times and received a sentence of 19 years for extremism. Navalny called the charges politically motivated.
He was jailed in January 2021 and moved to an Arctic penal colony in late 2023. He died there in February 2024.
Russian authorities gave few details on the cause of Navalny's death. Navalnaya said in August 2024 that she was told by Russian investigators that Navalny died from a combination of "a dozen different diseases" and that he finally succumbed to arrhythmia, or an irregular heartbeat, after a walk. Navalnaya said her husband exhibited no instances of heart disease before he was imprisoned.
The European leaders accused Russia of having "repeated disregard for international law" and the Chemical Weapons Convention, a 1997 treaty that prohibits the development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. Russia has also been accused of using Novichok in a 2018 incident that led to the death of a British woman, Dawn Sturgess.
"We are further concerned that Russia did not destroy all of its chemical weapons," the European leaders said. "We and our partners will make use of all policy levers at our disposal to continue to hold Russia to account."

Europe weighs nuclear options amid Russia fears, US doubts

22:18:00 KST

European leaders, increasingly alarmed about threats from a nuclear-armed Russia and uncertainty surrounding U.S. security guarantees, are intensifying debates over the continent’s nuclear deterrence.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Munich Security Conference (MSC) that he had "held confidential talks with the French president about European nuclear deterrence".
And Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, Europe's other nuclear power along with France, said it was "enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France".
The UK's nuclear deterrent already protects NATO members, and Starmer said "any adversary must know that in a crisis they could be confronted by our combined strength" alongside France.
Still, while the United States and Russia have thousands of nuclear warheads each, the combined French and British arsenal is in the hundreds.
Discussion of nuclear armament has long been viewed as taboo in many other European countries, but Russian aggression and worries about U.S. commitment have forced the issue into mainstream European politics.
In a report assessing "Europe's nuclear options" published for the MSC, experts warned that the relatively small nuclear arsenals of France and the United Kingdom might not be enough to face down Russia without U.S. support.
"Europeans can no longer outsource their thinking about nuclear deterrence to the United States," the group of 11 experts warn in the paper, which calls on Europe to "urgently confront a new nuclear reality" in the face of "Russia's nuclear-backed revisionism".
Many European officials are convinced that Moscow's territorial ambitions will not be confined to Ukraine, and that other European countries, including even NATO members, could face some sort of attack.
U.S. President Donald Trump's disdainful comments about NATO and his highly transactional approach to foreign relations, meanwhile, have Washington's European allies questioning whether they can risk relying on U.S. protection.
The MSC report lays out five nuclear options for Europe, but cautions that none are good and that there is "no low-cost or risk-free way out of Europe's nuclear predicament".
"The era in which Europe could afford strategic complacency has ended," the authors write.
"However uncomfortable the debate may be, the new security environment requires European policymakers to confront the role of nuclear weapons in the defence of the continent directly and without delay, and to invest the resources needed to do so competently."
The five options are: Continue to rely on American deterrence; strengthen the role of British and French nuclear weapons in a European deterrent; jointly develop European nuclear weapons as a deterrent; increase the number of European countries with their own nuclear arsenals; or expand European conventional military power to present a more intimidating non-nuclear deterrent.
Sticking with the status quo, and relying on America's unmatched military might, remains "the most credible and feasible option" in the short term, according to the authors.
"We have nuclear deterrence already" within the NATO framework "which is working, which has plans with capabilities and doctrines," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told AFP.
Merz declared that European NATO allies need to remain united while building up a European nuclear deterrence, stressing that "we will not allow different security zones to emerge in Europe".
The capability gap between the United States and Russia on the one hand, and the much small French and British arsenals on the other, is currently so large that very few believe Europeans can assume full responsibility for deterrence in the short term.
"If there's going to be some kind of bigger European investments in France or the UK's nuclear deterrence, that's only a good thing," Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen recently told AFP.
But he quickly added: "If you're talking about to compensate US nuclear deterrence, that's not realistic at this point."
Still, experts welcomed the increasingly serious political debate on an issue that has long worried military planners.
"That's very positive, but now we need action," Heloise Fayet of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), a contributor to the MSC report, told AFP.
The report notes that both France and Britain would face a range of challenges in growing their arsenals and extending nuclear protection across Europe, from hefty costs to tricky questions about who holds final authority to launch the warheads.
Britain's nuclear weapons also currently depend heavily on U.S. technology, meaning for the moment there is "no sustainable future for a UK nuclear deterrent without U.S. collaboration," the experts note.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has previously raised the possibility of extending France's nuclear umbrella across Europe, is scheduled to deliver a major speech on French nuclear doctrine at the end of February.
Macron said in Munich he was considering a doctrine that could include "special cooperation, joint exercises, and shared security interests with certain key countries".
"This speech by Macron will be very important," said Fayet. "It has generated enormous expectations in Europe."

How Israeli weapons are ‘obliterating’ Palestinians and why it constitutes a war crime

Thousands of Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza have simply vanished into thin air. No remains to identify, no bodies to bury. Nothing remains but blood spattered on the walls and fragments of tissue of those killed.
A major investigation on Wednesday documented at least 2,842 such cases since October 2023, drawing from records kept by Civil Defence teams about people inside a building when it was hit and subsequent body counts.
They look for blood patterns, tissue, anything that might tell them what happened. When the numbers don't match, when they've searched everywhere and come up empty, they mark those victims as "evaporated."
Yasmin Mahani, a Palestinian woman whose child was targeted in an Israeli strike on al Tabin school in August 2024, went back to the building. It had been sheltering families who'd fled their homes. She found scattered flesh. She found blood. She didn't find her son. "Not even a body to bury," she told Al Jazeera.
Experts say this happens when people are exposed to extreme heat, with many cases attributed to thermobaric and incendiary weapons.
Thermobaric weapons are designed to create a powerful explosion by using oxygen from the surrounding air to intensify their blast, according to Dr Arthur van Coller, Professor of International Humanitarian Law at the STADIO Higher Education.
“They function by releasing a fuel in the form of gas, aerosol, or fine powder into the air. This fuel cloud mixes with atmospheric oxygen and is subsequently ignited,” van Coller tells TRT World.
“The ‘blast’ generates intense heat and massive pressure waves that last longer than those of conventional explosives, creating a vacuum effect that can cause severe injuries that are difficult to treat.”
Van Coller, who has special expertise on the legality of the use of thermobaric weapons, adds that such weapons are particularly devastating in buildings and underground structures, where reflected pressure waves multiply their force, making it difficult to confine damage to military targets and increasing the risk to civilians.
These bombs work differently from regular explosives. They release clouds of combustible particles first, then ignite them. The result is a pressure wave and a fireball that can reach 2,500 to 3,000 degrees Celsius.
When used against humans, thermobaric weapons can cause multiple complex and severe injuries due to primary blast effects, including barotrauma to the lungs and other organs, according to van Coller.
“They can also inflict secondary injuries from shrapnel and debris, tertiary injuries such as blunt trauma from being thrown by the blast, and quaternary injuries, including burns from intense heat and the inhalation of toxic fumes,” he adds.
According to reports, Israel has used several weapons that fit this description, including the MK-84 bomb, the BLU-109 bunker buster and the GBU-39 glide bomb. That last one was used in the al Tabin strike, and it's basically designed to keep buildings standing while destroying everything inside through heat and pressure.
Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor flagged similar cases back in 2023 and 2024. The investigators documented victims who appeared to have melted or turned to ash after residential buildings were bombed.
“In confined spaces, the heat and pressure can thus cause severe burns, crush injuries, and disintegration of soft tissues. Bodies may be incinerated, fragmented, or rendered unrecognisable, and in some cases, only small remains or traces are found,” says Van Coller.
“However, ‘vaporisation’ is not an entirely accurate term to describe the effects of thermobaric explosions on the human body, as this term implies that the tissue is converted entirely into gas, leaving no physical remains.”
“The more appropriate term from forensic and medical literature is ‘incineration’, ‘fragmentation’, or ‘obliteration,’” he adds.
Incendiary weapons and white phosphorus
Incendiary weapons are another category that's been documented in Gaza.
“These munitions are designed primarily to set fire to objects or cause burn injuries to people through the action of flame, heat, or both, produced by a chemical reaction,” van Coller says.
“Common examples include napalm, thermite, and white phosphorus. These weapons contain chemicals that ignite and burn at extremely high temperatures for a prolonged period when deployed, thereby possibly causing secondary fires that spread to surrounding areas.”
“International humanitarian law places strict restrictions on the use of incendiary weapons, especially in populated areas, to protect civilians from their devastating effects.”
These restrictions emanate from Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), which prohibits making civilians or civilian objects the target of attack using incendiary weapons in all circumstances.
Verified video footage and eyewitness accounts indicate that Israeli forces used white phosphorus during their genocide in Gaza and attacks on southern Lebanon in 2023.
The material showed repeated airbursts of artillery fired white phosphorus over the Gaza City port and rural areas near the Israel-Lebanon border, dispersing burning particles across wide areas.
When it comes into contact with skin, it causes severe burns that are difficult to treat and can continue burning deep into tissue. Survivors often face long-term medical complications.
Indiscriminate, disproportionate harm
Thermobaric weapons aren't banned entirely. But that doesn't mean using them is legal.
"Thermobaric weapons are not per se prohibited under international law," Van Coller says.
"However, their use must be evaluated against the principles of proportionality and distinction. This means assessing whether the attack is directed at a legitimate military target and whether the expected civilian harm is excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage."
But here's the critical point that cannot be overstated: those principles about proportionality and unnecessary suffering only apply when you're targeting combatants.
Civilians should never be intentionally targeted at all. Van Coller emphasises that the legal framework for assessing "unnecessary suffering" assumes you're fighting other fighters, not bombing families in their homes.
When Israel drops these weapons on densely populated neighbourhoods where it knows families are sheltering, it's not a question of proportionality or distinction. It's deliberate harm against civilians.
That's a war crime, and part of Israel's ongoing genocide.
In theory, one could use thermobaric weapons legally against clear military targets if one can take precautions to protect civilians. In practice, it's nearly impossible to comply with those principles when you're dropping these bombs in densely populated cities.
Israel’s killing of more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounding of over 171,000 others, and widespread destruction of 90 percent of civilian infrastructure are already clear evidence that the principle of proportionality isn’t being followed.
Thousands of people are still missing, either buried under debris or reduced to traces so minimal they can't be identified.
These findings come despite the International Court of Justice ordering provisional measures and despite an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court against Israel's prime minister.
The disappearance of bodies creates another problem for accountability. These weapons destroy physical evidence so completely that identifying victims, confirming how they died, and collecting proof of unlawful use becomes extremely difficult.
Van Coller poses what he describes as “the ultimate question" on the issue: “whether one method of harming humans with the use of a particular weapon, such as a thermobaric weapon, is inherently more inhumane and thus unacceptable, as opposed to the harm caused by another weapon, such as a conventional explosive weapon."

‘Breathe and Paint’: Palestinian girls paint messages of hope on Gaza beach despite war fallout
‘We want to do that not only through bloody and heartbreaking images, as was the case over past 2 years, but also through art,’ says workshop organizer
- Fear, loss, grief transformed into paintings, alongside visions of a life participants still hope to reclaim
GAZA CITY, Palestine
In a gesture of resilience and hope that rises above the aftermath of Israel’s two-year war on Gaza and the continued violations of the ceasefire agreement, Palestinian girls organized a seaside painting workshop in Gaza City.
The workshop, titled Breathe and Paint, was held on Thursday and underscored how the sea has become a place of refuge not only for artists, but for Palestinians seeking relief after enduring the genocidal war that began in October 2023.
Set against sunlight and gentle sea breezes, the initiative offered moments of calm and reflection, symbolizing life’s persistence despite attempts to extinguish it.
Anadolu attended the workshop, which took place at the fishing port west of Gaza City, away from areas devastated by Israeli attacks.
The event gave young Palestinian girls, many bearing deep psychological scars from the war, space to express emotions through art.
Using vivid colors, the participants momentarily set aside the trauma of war. Some painted Palestinian women in traditional dress, while others depicted the sea, the sun, and open horizons, reflecting hopes of renewal despite devastation.
Drawings of the map of Palestine and the national flag also featured prominently, painted by young girls as expressions of belonging and attachment to their homeland.
Israel targets art
During the genocidal war, Israeli forces destroyed major cultural and artistic landmarks across Gaza -- actions Palestinians say were aimed at erasing their cultural identity.
Among the destroyed sites was the Rashad Al-Shawa Cultural Center in Gaza City’s Rimal neighborhood, established in 1985.
Israeli attacks also killed dozens of Palestinian artists, including visual artist Heba Zaqout during the war’s first month, theater artist Durgham Qreiqa in March 2025, and standup comedian Mahmoud Shurrab, who was killed when his tent was struck in Khan Younis in June 2025.
Palestinian and international organizations, including UNESCO, repeatedly condemned the targeting of artists, but Tel Aviv has ignored these denunciations and continued its assaults.
A space to breathe
Participant Farah Ajjour said the sea offered rare emotional relief after two years of confinement under war.
“This workshop gave us a chance to release what we were holding inside,” she told Anadolu.
Amid gentle sea breezes brushing her weary face, she said life had been on pause and that she now longs to resume it.
She added: “After the cultural center in Gaza City was destroyed (by the Israeli army), we no longer had a place to practice art.”
Insisting on continuing with life, she said: “I want my voice to be heard through my art. There is no place where I can do that except the seashore; that’s why we are here today.”
Art as resistance
Workshop organizer Noura Al-Qassasiya said the initiative aimed to restore color to the lives of girls deprived of normalcy for more than two years.
“Art helps us communicate the harsh reality of the Israeli genocide,” she said, noting that reaching the location itself was difficult due to widespread destruction and displacement.
She explained that the sea was chosen because it remained untouched by bombardment.
“The people of Gaza love art,” she said. “We want to do that not only through bloody and heartbreaking images, as was the case over the past two years, but also through art.”
Participant Amal Darwish said painting finally allowed her to speak after years of silence.
“Through art, I found space to tell our story and express resistance,” she said, adding that her greatest wish was for life to return “in bright colors.”
Throughout the workshop, fear, loss, and grief were transformed into paintings, alongside visions of a life participants still hope to reclaim.
The Oct. 10, 2025 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Kobi Farhi was probably the only Jewish kid in Jaffa who liked hearing the muezzin's call. Five times a day, his attention would lock onto the voice booming from the mosque minaret, summoning the faithful to prayer. Sometimes he would even join in, quietly muttering "Allahu Akbar." Years later, when he headed a successful metal band, this childhood fascination turned into an odd obsession: He wanted to record himself singing the muezzin's call – preferably from high atop a minaret.

Zelenskyy Calls For Strong Security Guarantees Against 'Slave To War' Putin
Unknown

22:13:21 KST

MUNICH - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered an impassioned plea for more Western weapons and for "real security guarantees," calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a "slave to war" who will threaten Europe if he is not stopped in Ukraine.
In a midday speech at the Munich Security Conference on February 14, Zelenskyy said he hopes a new round of trilateral talks with Russia and the United States next week will be productive, but suggested that US pressure for concessions is often aimed mainly at Kyiv and Russia has shown few signs it is ready for compromise.
"No one in Ukraine believes [Putin] will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelenskyy said. "He may see himself as a tsar, but in reality he is a slave to war."
Nearly Four Years Of Ukraine War
Zelenskyy's speech came 10 days before Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which set off the deadliest war in Europe since 1945, reaches the four-year mark and the casualty toll on the two sides taken together climbs toward 2 million soldiers killed, wounded, or missing.
In addition, Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainian civilians and pounded the country's energy infrastructure on a near-daily basis. "There is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes."
With US President Donald Trump seeking to broker peace since he returned to office in January 2025, Zelenskyy repeated that strong security guarantees for Kyiv are a crucial element of any agreement.
"There must be real security guarantees for Ukraine and for Europe, strong security guarantees." He said that Ukraine is ready to sign security-guarantee deals with the US and Europe and that these should "come before any agreement to end the war."
"We hope President Trump hears us. We hope the Congress hears us. We hope American people hear us," said Zelenskyy, who wants an agreement on security guarantees to be ratified by the US Congress and met with a group of US senators in Munich.
Zelenskyy met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio later in the day on the sidelines of the annual conference, which no high-level Russian official has attended since Putin launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022.
In his own speech and other comments earlier on February 14, Rubio said that "the issues to end the war have been narrowed, but the bad news is that now it's down to the hardest questions."
Rubio said he does not expect Russia to achieve its initial war objectives, which are widely understood to have included subjugating Ukraine, and that “now it’s largely narrowed down to their desire to take [the] 20 percent of Donetsk they don't currently possess.”
Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly said that Moscow will capture the rest of the Donetsk region – one of two provinces that make up the Donbas, by force or though diplomacy.
Zelenskyy pointed to the massive losses Russia has sustained in that effort, saying "on the Donetsk front the price Russia pays for one kilometer is 156 soldiers." He said 35,000 Russian soldiers were killed or badly wounded in December and 30,000 in January.
"Putin is not concerned about this now, but there is a level at which he will start to care. Every month Russia mobilizes about 40,000 people," Zelenskyy said. "For our army the mission is clear: destroy more Russian occupiers. The goal is at least 50,000 per month."
Russia is now "losing much more [manpower] than they can refill," Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof told RFE/RL in Munich. He said Western countries should "speed up" deliveries of air defenses and other weapons, and that he hopes "Ukrainian forces will be able to push back Russia more" in the near future.
With a third round of US-Ukraine-Russia talks set to be held in Geneva on February 17-18, Zelenskyy said Kyiv hopes the meetings "will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us," but added that "honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things."
Russia repeats demands that are unacceptable to Kyiv, he suggested, while "the Americans often return to the topic of concessions, and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia. Europe is practically not present at the table. This is a big mistake, to my mind."
At times over the past year, Trump has blamed Kyiv for a lack of progress toward peace. "Russia wants to make a deal and Zelenskyy's going to have to get moving, otherwise he's going to miss a great opportunity," he hold journalists outside the White House on February 13.
Zelenskyy said on social media late on February 14 that he he had spoken by phone with the lead US negotiators.
"I had a conversation with envoys of President Trump, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, ahead of the trilateral meetings in Geneva. We count on the meetings being truly productive," he said.
Speaking to RFE/RL on the sidelines of the Munich conference, British Defense Minister John Healey said that "Ukraine is under strong pressure but Ukrainians are fighting...with extraordinary defiance and courage just as [they]showed four years ago when Putin first invaded."
"The world should remember that this is a war Putin thought he would win in a week," and almost four years later, with Russia is suffering "huge losses, he is under huge pressure," Healey said. "Our job is to step up further for Ukraine with the aid we can give and to step up further the pressure on Putin to bring him the negotiation table."
The Dutch prime minister also said that "Europe and the US should put pressure on Putin to stop the war."
"I don't see any political will and intention [to make peace] on the part of President Putin," Schoof told RFE/RL, adding that "so far, it only looks like he is trying to win time."

Gaza committee says statements on handing over institutions pave way for managing transition
Media office in enclave renewed call for NCAG to begin carrying out its duties
CAIRO
The National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) said on Saturday that statements by the Gaza administration regarding readiness to hand over all public institutions pave the way for enabling the body to fully assume its responsibilities in managing the transitional phase.
In a statement, the committee, which was formed after the October ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, said it “views the recent expression of readiness for an orderly transition as a pivotal step in fulfilling its mandate as the transitional administration of Gaza.”
Gaza's media office on Thursday renewed its call for the national committee to begin carrying out its duties. Hamas has also repeatedly announced readiness to facilitate the committee’s work.
“We emphasize that full administrative, civilian, and police control by the NCAG is not merely procedural; it NCAG cannot be expected to carry responsibility without the full administrative, civilian, and police powers necessary to implement its mandate effectively,” said the statement.
The readout, however, did not specify when the committee would begin operating from Gaza. The NCAG earlier announced it started its work from Cairo in mid-January.
The entry of committee members into Gaza requires field and security coordination through crossings controlled by Israel. No official position has yet been issued by the body, explaining the delay in its entry, and Israel has not commented on the matter.
The committee said that enabling it to operate efficiently and independently in Gaza would “unlock international support for recovery, reconstruction, secure a complete Israeli withdrawal, and restore normal daily life.”
The committee also called on mediators and all parties concerned to “to intensify efforts to resolve outstanding issues without delay,” stressing that the Palestinian people “cannot afford more time lost; we must move now to ensure a smooth and credible transition.”
The Oct. 10 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians also have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Bangladesh's Tarique Rahman pledges to work for democracy after landslide victory in election
Bangladesh’s incoming leader says he will work to build a more democratic country, overcoming challenges related to weak institutions
- Bookmark
Bangladesh’s incoming leader said Saturday that he would work to build a more democratic country, overcoming challenges related to weak institutions after his party secured an election victory.
Tarique Rahman's Bangladesh Nationalist Party won a majority in Thursday’s election in the 350-member Parliament. An 11-member alliance led by the Jamaat-e-Islami party, the country’s largest Islamist party, is poised to form the opposition.
It was the first election since the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a mass uprising in 2024. An interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus oversaw the largely peaceful election. The voting marked a significant political shift in the South Asian nation of more than 170 million people.
The new government is expected to take the oath in days.
In his first press meeting in the capital, Dhaka, Rahman said that his priorities would be to improve law and order and handle a fragile economy.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by the authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions, and a deteriorating law and order situation,” he told reporters.
Rahman, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who died in December, also urged unity, promising that he would not undermine the country.
“To ensure that no evil force can reestablish autocracy in the country, and to ensure that the nation is not turned into a subservient state, we must remain united and uphold the will of the people,” he said.
The BNP is one of the country’s longstanding political forces alongside Hasina’s now-banned Awami League party. Hasina has been accused of increasingly becoming authoritarian during her 15-year rule. In recent years, the BNP refused to take part in the election under Hasina. She has been in exile in India since her ouster and has been convicted of crimes against humanity involving hundreds of deaths during the weekslong uprising.

Global warming hits 1st tipping point as security risks rise, senior officials warn at Munich Security Conference
'Top 10 threats to economy, 5 of them were ecological,' says German environment minister
ISTANBUL
The world has already crossed a critical climate threshold with potentially irreversible consequences, experts warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, saying global warming is rapidly becoming a central driver of instability, economic disruption, and security threats.
Speaking at a panel, titled Degrees of Instability: Climate Security in a Warming World, Mads Flarup Christensen, executive director of Greenpeace International, said the planet has entered a dangerous phase.
“We passed the first tipping point officially,” he told participants, adding: “We are in the danger zone now.”
Christensen warned that the world is approaching systemic environmental shifts that could disrupt ecosystems and societies, including the loss of major natural systems.
“If that's not security, what is?” he asked, arguing that climate risks must be treated as a top-tier strategic threat.
Moderator Erin Sikorsky, director of the Center for Climate and Security, said the planet is already moving beyond key warming limits.
“We're already heading into a world past 1.5 degrees of warming,” she said, warning that this would bring “greater instability, more extreme weather events … coming more frequently and more intensely than ever before.”
She added that such impacts are already affecting security systems worldwide, noting that “militaries around the world (are) deployed to respond to climate disasters,” while competition over food and water resources is intensifying geopolitical tensions.
Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stressed that climate shocks are already disrupting communities and livelihoods, particularly in vulnerable regions.
“We have to look at saving climate … and equally, saving communities,” she said, adding that climate volatility is also affecting defense readiness. “Our warfare and our soldiers and our equipments will have to be adept at all these places, climate change is disrupting even that.”
German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider said ecological threats are now among the world’s leading risks.
“Top 10 threats to the economy, five of them were ecological,” he said, describing climate change as “a threat to our growth, to the livelihood of the people, and the security issues.”
US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse warned that climate impacts are already triggering financial strain, particularly through insurance markets withdrawing coverage from high-risk areas.
“The insurance industry in America (is) leaving entire states,” he said, cautioning that this could mark “the opening stage of an economic cascade … to recession.”

Police set up national group to deal with UK-related Epstein allegations

British police have set up a new national group to deal with allegations that Jeffrey Epstein’s trafficking of women had ties to Britain, as well as claims against his associates, such as Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.
At least three British police forces are dealing with allegations triggered by the revelations about Epstein and his associates in documents released in the US, with more claims of wrongdoing expected by police officials.
A national committee to coordinate the police operations met this week and is scheduled to meet again next week. The group includes police experts on sexual offending and is chaired by a gold commander, Louisa Rolfe, who was previously a Metropolitan police assistant commissioner.
One senior policing source said a “tsunami” of allegations was expected as a result of the release of millions of papers relating to Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who trafficked women and had a network of powerful friends.
The forces involved include Thames Valley police, which are assessing two separate claims against Mountbatten-Windsor and whether they merit a full criminal investigation, and Surrey police, which are assessing another allegation against the former prince.
Mountbatten-Windsor has denied all wrongdoing.
The Met, which is also part of the group, is criminally investigating Peter Mandelson for allegedly passing information to Epstein while a Labour government minister.
Bedfordshire police were unable to say whether they were assessing claims that Luton airport, which is in the force’s area, was used by planes linked to Epstein to traffic women.
Similarly, Essex police could not say whether they were assessing claims that Stansted airport had been used for such flights, with the former British prime minister Gordon Brown saying police should take action.
A spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said: “A national coordination group has been set up to support a small number of forces assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the US DoJ [Department of Justice] Epstein files.
“We continue to work collaboratively to assess the details being made public to allow us to understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been published.”
The national coordination group is a measure similar to that set up to deal with the explosion in sexual abuse allegations triggered by the Jimmy Savile scandal more than a decade ago. It is intended to avoid duplication in the handling of allegations involving the same individuals.
Part of the group’s role is to make formal approaches to obtain the original unredacted documents from the US, rather than each police force having to make separate requests.
As yet, it is not a national investigation and each force retains operation control. A source with knowledge of discussions said: “It is not a national operation, but it is heading in that direction. The feeling in policing is this is going to grow arms and legs.”
The latest release of documents from the Epstein files a fortnight ago led to new revelations.
The Thames Valley assessment covers claims that Mountbatten-Windsor used his position as a British trade envoy to potentially give sensitive information to Epstein. Claims that the former prince used his position as a British trade envoy to pass potentially sensitive information to Epstein are being examined by the force.
They are also examining a claim that Epstein sent a second woman to the UK for sex with the former prince in Windsor in 2010.
Another police source warned that the avalanche of allegations and revelations in the news media might not be enough to prompt full criminal investigations, let alone bring prosecutions: “Andrew may be a barefaced liar, but that does not mean he committed a criminal offence.”
The Met has twice looked at sexual abuse allegations against Mountbatten-Windsor and decided they did not merit a full investigation.
A spokesperson for Surrey police said: “A number of police forces are currently assessing allegations that have emerged following the publication of the FBI Epstein files.
“As a result, nationally, policing is seeking access to unredacted versions of the material to enable a full and independent assessment of the information released. This will allow all forces to understand any potential impact arising from the millions of documents that have been made publicly available.”

ST. PETERSBURG, February 14. /TASS/. Vladimir Zelensky's statements have long been ravings of a sick person and an indicator he is not in his right mind, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has told the media.
"What Zelensky is saying can no longer be called statements. It’s ravings of a sick person, a sign of deranged mentality," she said, commenting on Zelensky's statements about postponing elections in Ukraine indefinitely. "There's vast evidence to this effect."
"First he's urging everyone to organize the electoral process, and then in a split second he either changes his mind or postpones them. It's impossible to tell what this all about," Zakharova added.
She also noted that it's no longer surprising how the Kiev regime is torturing Ukraine: "We've already realized this; we've long seen how they ruined Ukraine's statehood.".

Zelensky: US too often demands concessions from Ukraine, not Russia
He made the remarks during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
"We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all of us. But honestly, sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things. The Russians often speak about some spirit of Anchorage and we can only guess what they really mean. The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed in the context only of Ukraine, not Russia," Zelensky said.
He also noted that Europe is practically absent from the negotiation table. "It's a big mistake to my mind," he added.
According to Zelensky, Ukraine is making every effort to achieve a genuine peace. This is the focus of the entire peace process, including today's planned meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Meanwhile, the Russians, he said, are hoping for a repeat of the "Munich conspiracy."
"It seems Putin hopes to repeat Munich and not Munich 2007 when they only spoke about dividing Europe, but Munich 1938 when previous Putin began dividing Europe in reality. It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine," Zelensky said.
As reported, the next round of trilateral talks between Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia is scheduled for February 17-18 in Geneva.

Bangladesh election winner Rahman urges unity to rebuild nation

Tarique Rahman, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) that won a two-thirds majority in the recently held general elections, on Saturday called for national unity to rebuild the South Asian country.
The BNP, which secured a landslide victory on Thursday election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, is set form a government with Rahman to become prime minister.
The Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance won 77 seats and will sit on opposition benches, while the Awami League party of Sheikh Hasina, whose government was ousted in 2024 after student protests and a crackdown that killed 1,400 people, was barred from taking part.
"We are taking office at a time when we have to start our journey through a fragile economy, ineffective constitutional institutions, and weak law and order situation left by a fascist regime. However, if the people's strength is with us, no obstacle can stop us," Rahman said in his first address since Thursday's election.
‘Bangladeshi interests’
Asked about foreign policy, he said they do not have any country-centric policy, saying it will be decided based on "Bangladeshi interests."
"National unity is our strength, division is our weakness," he said, urging everyone to stay united.
"This victory belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to Bangladesh, this victory belongs to the democracy-loving people of the country. From today, we are free."
“We will not tolerate any kind of injustice or illegal activities. Regardless of party, opinion, religion, ethnicity, or differing views, we will not accept any attack by the strong against the weak under any pretext,” he said.

Navalny died ‘after being poisoned with dart frog toxin by Kremlin’
The UK and its allies said only Russia would have the ‘means, motive and disregard’ to launch such an attack

Putin arch-rival Alexei Navalny died after being poisoned with a lethal toxin and Russia is to blame for the attack, the UK and its allies have said.
The UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said on Saturday during a press conference at the Munich security conference that analysis of samples from Navalny "have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine."
It is a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America.
Yulia Navalnaya, his widow, appeared at a press conference at the event to announce the discovery.

The countries said that "only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law" to carry out the attack on the Russian opposition leader.
The allies also pointed to an attempt to poison Mr Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok in 2020, which followed the Salisbury poisonings in 2018.
They will now send their findings to the UN's chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).
Navalny, who crusaded against official corruption and staged massive anti-Kremlin protests, died in a penal colony in Siberia in February 2024.
He was serving a 19-year sentence that he believed to be politically motivated.
Ms Navalnaya said last year that two independent labs had found that her husband was poisoned shortly before his death. She has repeatedly blamed Putin for Navalny's death, something Russian officials have vehemently denied.
It is not clear how the frog poison was allegedly administered to Navalny.
Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper has met with Mr Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya at conference in Germany this weekend.
Ms Cooper said: “Since Yulia Navalnaya announced the loss of her husband here in Munich two years ago, the UK has pursued the truth of Alexei Navalny’s death with fierce determination
“Only the Russian Government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia.
“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat.
“By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”

U.S. strikes 30 ISIS targets in Syria as it continues "relentless military pressure" on terrorist network
Ten U.S. military strikes in Syria hit more than 30 Islamic State targets in Syria earlier this month, as it continues "relentless military pressure" on the terrorist network there, U.S. Central Command announced Saturday.
CENTCOM, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East, said U.S. forces hit ISIS infrastructures and weapons storage targets between Feb. 3 and Feb. 12.
The strikes were part of Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched in retaliation for an ISIS ambush that killed Sgt. Edgar Brian Torres-Tovar, Sgt. William Nathaniel Howard and an interpreter in Palmyra, Syria, on Dec. 13.
President Trump vowed "very serious retaliation" in a Truth Social post after the ambush.
On Dec. 19, the U.S. launched airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria in retaliation. More than 70 targets were hit in those strikes, a U.S. official told CBS News at the time.
In January, U.S. forces killed Bilal Hasan al-Jasim, who authorities said was a leader affiliated with Al-Qaeda, allegedly directly connected with the ISIS gunman accused of the deadly ambush.
"The death of a terrorist operative linked to the deaths of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces," Central Command Commander Adm. Brad Cooper said in a statement at the time. "There is no safe place for those who conduct, plot, or inspire attacks on American citizens and our warfighters. We will find you."
More than 50 ISIS terrorists have been killed or captured and more than 100 ISIS infrastructure targets have been hit during the operation, CENTCOM said on Saturday.
On Friday, U.S. military forces completed the transfer of thousands of ISIS detainees from Syria to Iraq, where they are expected to stand trial in the future.
CENTCOM said that the transfer that began on Jan. 21 saw U.S. forces transporting more than 5,700 adult male ISIS suspects from detention facilities in Syria to Iraqi custody.
The prisoners were transferred to Iraq at the request of Baghdad — a move welcomed by the U.S.-led coalition that had for years fought against ISIS.
"We appreciate Iraq's leadership and recognition that transferring the detainees is essential to regional security," Cooper said.
It's not clear if any of the prisoners have been charged with specific crimes or even been confirmed as ISIS members.

US, Europe belong together, Rubio reassures allies in Munich

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday offered a reassuring message to European allies, saying Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so Europe could help the U.S.’ mission of global “renewal”, after more than a year of President Donald Trump’s often-hostile rhetoric toward traditional allies.
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in U.S.-European relations sparked by Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about U.S. allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history," Rubio said, calling for "a reinvigorated alliance."
"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the U.S. "belong together."
He echoed Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration posed a threat, saying that "mass migration" was "a crisis which is transforming and destabilizing societies all across the West."
He said that Europe and the U.S. were "heirs to the same great and noble civilization" and that he hoped Europe "together with us are willing and able to defend it."
Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a "rift" between U.S. and Europe.
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of U.S. Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues including free speech, shocking European allies.
U.S.-Europe ties were further strained by the new U.S. National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with "civilizational decline" and by the Trump administration's courting of far-right parties.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.
Some breathed a sigh of relief following Rubio's speech, with Estonia's Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur telling AFP "it was needed to show that we are still allies and partners."
But others said they did not mark a shift in the U.S. stance, with former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis saying "it was simply delivered in more polite terms. I am not sure the white paint will hold."
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering on Saturday that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British leader Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," calling for a building of "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production".
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth grueling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine's Western-supplied air defence systems.
"No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kyiv to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the U.S. leader said.
But Rubio said on Saturday that "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."
Rubio renewed the Trump administration's criticism of the United Nations, saying that "it has no answers and has played virtually no role" on the most pressing conflicts like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.

How Jeffrey Epstein used the glamour of the Nobel Peace Prize to entice his global network of elites
Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly played up hosting the head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee in invitations to and chats with elites like Richard Branson, Larry Summers and Steve Bannon, the Epstein files show
- Bookmark
Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly played up his ties to the former head of the Nobel Peace Prize committee in invitations to and chats with elites like Richard Branson, Larry Summers, Bill Gates and Steve Bannon, a top ally of President Donald Trump, the Epstein files show.
Thorbjørn Jagland, who headed the Norwegian Nobel Committee from 2009 to 2015, turns up hundreds of times in the millions of documents about the former U.S. financier and convicted sex offender that were released by the U.S. Justice Department last month.
Since the release, Jagland, 75, has been charged in Norway for “aggravated corruption” in connection with an investigation prompted by information in the files, the economic crime unit of Norwegian police Økokrim said.
Økokrim has said it would investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with Jagland’s position. Its teams searched his Oslo residence on Thursday, plus two other properties in Risør, a coastal town to the south, and in Rauland to the west.
His attorneys at Elden law firm in Norway said Jagland denies the charges, and was questioned by the police unit on Thursday.
While there is no evidence in the documents seen so far of any outright lobbying for the Nobel Peace Prize, Epstein repeatedly played up hosting Jagland at his properties in New York and Paris in the 2010s.
From an ‘interesting’ guest to subject of banter with Bannon
In September 2018, during Trump’s first term and in an apparent allusion to his interest in the peace prize, Epstein had a varied text-message exchange with Bannon, at one point writing — in one of many messages with untidy grammar: “donalds head would explode if he knew you were now buds with the guy who on monday will decide the nobel peace prize.”
“I told him next year it should be you when we settle china,” he added, without elaborating.
In one email from 2013, mixing in investment tips and praise for PR tips, Epstein told British entrepreneur and magnate Richard Branson that Jagland would be staying with Epstein in September that year, adding: “if you are there, you might find him interesting.”
A year after she left a job as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, in 2015, Kathy Ruemmler got an email from Epstein saying: "head of nobel peace prize coming to visit, want to join?"
In 2012, Epstein wrote former Treasury Secretary and Harvard University president Larry Summers about Jagland, saying “head of the nobel peace prize staying with me, if you have any interest.”
In that exchange, Epstein referred to Jagland — also a former Norwegian prime minister and former head of the Council of Europe, a human rights body — as “not bright” but someone who offered a “unique perspective.”
The financier wrote Bill Gates in 2014, saying that Jagland had been reelected as head of the Council of Europe.
“That is good,” the Microsoft co-founder and the world's former richest man, wrote. “I guess his peace prize committee job is also up in the air?”
During Jagland's tenure as chair of the committee, it gave the peace prize to Obama, in 2009, and the European Union in 2012.
Jagland was brought into Epstein’s orbit by Terje Rød Larsen, a Norwegian diplomat who helped broker the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and Palestinians. Larsen and wife are also facing corruption charges in Norway due to their association with Epstein.

Russia killed Alexei Navalny with frog toxin, UK and four European allies say

Alexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, was killed by dart frog poison administered by the Russian state two years ago, a multi-intelligence agency inquiry has found, according to a statement released by five countries, the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands.
The US was not one of the intelligence agencies making the claim.
Navalny died in a remote Arctic penal colony where he was serving a 19-year sentence. Samples from his body were secured before his burial and sent to the laboratories of two countries.
The UK, describing the poisoning as barbaric, said it would be reporting Russia to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as a flagrant violation by Russia of the chemical weapons convention (CWC).
The intelligence agencies claimed laboratory testing found that the deadly toxin in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs (epibatidine) was found in samples from Navalny’s body and probably resulted in his death.
The statement adds: “Only the Russian state had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin to target Navalny during his imprisonment in a Russian penal colony in Siberia, and we hold it responsible for his death.”
“Epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America. Dart frogs in captivity do not produce this toxin and it is not found naturally in Russia. There is no innocent explanation for its presence in Navalny’s body.”
Although it had been widely assumed that Navalny had been poisoned by the Russian state, the evidence of the specific poison in his body is a new development. His wife, Yulia Navalny, posted in September that there was evidence of poison in his body at the time an autopsy was conducted.
Yulia wrote in a post on X that the named poison “causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death. I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with [a] chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes.”
The Kremlin has a long history of using poison as a weapon against its enemies. The death of Alexander Litvinenko in London from radioactive polonium in 2006, the nerve agent attack on the former spy Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018, and a previous poisoning attempt on Navalny have cemented Russia’s reputation for resorting to toxins to silence critics and defectors.
The Foreign Office, which oversees the intelligence agencies, said it has pursued the truth of Navalny’s death with partners from Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Germany. The UK added: “We know the Russian state now used this lethal toxin to target Navalny in fear of his opposition.”
The release of the information during the Munich Security Conference was designed to remind everyone that Russia announced the news of Navalny’s death just as the conference convened two years ago.
His wife, after some hesitation, made a short address to the conference in 2024 saying: “I would like Putin and all his staff, everybody around him, his government, his friends, I want them to know that they will be punished for what they have done with our country. With my family and with my husband, they will be brought to justice. And this day will come soon.”
The UK foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said: “Only the Russian government had the means, motive and opportunity to deploy this lethal toxin against Alexei Navalny during his imprisonment in Russia.
“Today, beside his widow, the UK is shining a light on the Kremlin’s barbaric plot to silence his voice.
“Russia saw Navalny as a threat. By using this form of poison the Russian state demonstrated the despicable tools it has at its disposal and the overwhelming fear it has of political opposition.”
The UK has led the way in trying to expose what it regards as nefarious Russian suppression of the regime’s opponents using poison, including the attempted killing of the UK agent Sergei Skripal with novichok on the streets of Salisbury in 2018. The UK has also led claims about Russian troops’ frequent use of chemical weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine.
In it statement the UK said it was clear Russia did not destroy all its chemical weapons as claimed in 2017, and that it has not renounced biological weapons, as it is obliged to under the biological and toxin weapons convention.

Exiled son of Iran’s last shah calls on Trump to help ‘bury’ the Islamic Republic

Exiled son of Iran’s last shah calls on Trump to help ‘bury’ the Islamic Republic
Pahlavi’s appeal at Munich conference comes as Trump sends second aircraft carrier to Middle East, says regime change would be ‘best thing’
MUNICH, Germany — The exiled son of Iran’s last shah called on US President Donald Trump on Saturday to help the Iranian people “bury” the current regime and said it was “time to end the Islamic Republic.”
The opposition figure has urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations against the authorities, calling on them to chant slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8:00 pm on Saturday and Sunday, to coincide with protests in Germany and elsewhere.
“To President Trump… The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them,” the US-based Reza Pahlavi told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.
Trump had said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen,” as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic Republic.
He had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown. The verified death toll has passed 7,000, with many more still feared dead.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency — which offered the latest figure of 7,005 people killed, including 214 government forces — has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists in the country to verify deaths.
Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy, said in Munich: “It is time to end the Islamic Republic. This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it.”
Pahlavi had encouraged Iranians to join the wave of protests, which Iranian authorities have said were hijacked by “terrorists” fueled by their sworn enemies, the United States and Israel.
“In this spirit, I invite you, on the evenings of February 14 and 15 at 8 p.m., to raise your voices and chant from your homes and rooftops. Shout your demands. Show your unity. With an unbreakable will, we will prevail over this occupying regime,” he said.
Many protest chants had called for the monarchy’s return, and Pahlavi, 65, has said he is ready to lead a democratic transition.
The Iranian opposition remains divided, and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel, making a highly publicized visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father’s autocratic rule.

EU countries should fear officials in Brussels, not eastern neighbors — Hungarian PM

BUDAPEST, February 14. /TASS/. European Union member states should worry less about their eastern neighbors and more about EU leaders and officials in Brussels, as that is where the real threat to their sovereignty and independence comes from, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
"Those who value freedom should fear Brussels, not the countries of the East, they should be wary of Brussels," Orban said during a traditional speech in Budapest addressing the past year’s political results and the government’s plans for the near future. According to the prime minister, "Brussels is the real source of danger," because it seeks to take sovereign governments under its control.
Orban noted that the previous US administration under President Joe Biden interfered in Hungary’s internal affairs in a manner similar to the EU leadership today. The situation changed after the election of current President Donald Trump. "After his return to office, we agreed that Hungarians would walk down the main street of history again, while their opponents would be on the dirty side alley. And that is exactly what happened," Orban said.
"However, only half the work is done. Brussels’ repressive machine is still operating. Bribed politicians, journalists, judges - that is how Brussels acts today," he added. Orban recalled that European censorship was raised as an issue even during hearings in US Congress. He emphasized that his government would not tolerate it.

El Paso Airspace Shutdown Is ‘Case Study’ in Complexity of Counter-Drone Ops: Experts
Unknown

22:02:00 KST

The use of a military counter-drone laser on the southwest border this week—which prompted the Federal Aviation Administration to abruptly close the airspace over El Paso, Texas—will be a “case study” on the complex web of authorities needed to employ such weapons near civilian areas and the consequences of agencies failing to coordinate properly, experts say.
The FAA ordered a 10-day shutdown of all flight traffic over El Paso after U.S. military units operating on the U.S.-Mexico border allowed U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to use a military laser designed for counter-drone operations, according to a report by the Associated Press confirmed by Air & Space Forces Magazine.
The shutdown wound up lasting only a few hours before airspace was reopened, but the abrupt disruption to air traffic caused confusion and panic and quickly led to lawmakers and public officials demanding answers.
Sen. Jack Reed (R.I.), the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, has called for answers, questioning whether proper safety protocols were followed, and why public communications “appear to have been inconsistent” about what occurred over El Paso.
“The airspace closure over El Paso triggered immediate chaos and confusion and cannot be dismissed as a minor misunderstanding, Reed wrote in a Feb. 11 statement. “The conflicting accounts coming from different parts of the federal government only deepen public concern and raise serious questions about coordination and decision-making.”
U.S. officials have provided few official details about the incident except to say it involved Mexican drug cartels flying drones at the border. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the FAA and the Pentagon “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” according to Feb. 11 post on X.
U.S. Northern Commander’s Air Force Gen. Gregory M. Guillot told lawmakers in March 2024 that roughly 1,000 incursions by unmanned aircraft systems occur daily along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The incident is the latest high-profile example of the threats drones—even small, cheap ones—present to the U.S. homeland. While this threat was at the border near the Army’s Fort Bliss, the Air Force has been dealing with the issue since December 2023, when unidentified drone swarms flew unchecked over Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va., for several days. Other drone incursions followed over air bases in Ohio, Utah, and other locations, compelling the Air Force and its sister services to place a top priority on finding ways to detect, identify, track and, if necessary, bring down these small, inexpensive drones.
Last year, the Pentagon began scrambling to buy low-collateral counter-drone technology that’s safe to use near populated areas, and the Air Force and other services have been investing hundreds of millions on counter-drone weapons.
Experts that have followed the government’s counter-drone effort have warned that using such weapons will require coordination with the FAA and other agencies. Now, those same experts are cringing at the apparent lack of coordination between the Pentagon and FAA.
“In terms of interagency coordination, this is a pretty bad scenario. … There was a failure to communicate between the military, CBP—which was actually using the laser, I understand—and the FAA,” said Henry Ziemer, an associate fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This is a case study in how not to do it.”
Zeimer, who has focused on criminal organizations in Latin America, recently wrote a CSIS commentary on the need for a “drone wall” to counter drone usage by drug cartels on the southwest border.
“Criminal organizations are nothing if not adaptable, and so when you see a crackdown in one area, like we’ve seen on sort of land crossings along the border, they adapt,” Zeimer said. “Drones have been super useful in that regard and allow cartels to survey large stretches of the border to try and identify where the border patrol presence is and reorient their routes and figure out where to go next.”
“Most of the incursions don’t cross into U.S. airspace, but they’re hovering right just outside, observing the border patrols … and figuring out where they are,” he added.
A key challenge of countering the drone threat over military installations has been ensuring military commanders have the proper authorities they need to bring down potentially hostile drones if necessary. While details are still emerging, the Feb. 11 incident occurred in the area of Fort Bliss, Texas, which now sits adjacent to a new “National Defense Area” that runs between Bliss and the Southwest border for the purpose of “denying illegal activity along the southern border,” according to a May 2025 NORTHCOM announcement.
The Pentagon’s Joint Inter-Agency Task Force 401, which focuses on finding counter-drone solutions, recently published updated guidance designed to empower “installation commanders to take decisive action to protect military facilities, assets, and personnel within the homeland.”
The new guidance is designed to streamline policies for counter-drone operations under authority of U.S. law governing the protection of certain facilities and assets from drones, by providing commanders with more options such as allowing drone-defense activities to go beyond an installation’s fenceline, according to the document.
Stacie Pettyjohn, director of the Defense Program at the Center for a New American Security, acknowledged the efforts the Pentagon has undertaken to counter drones over the U.S., but she said the incident in El Paso points to a lack of coordination and “shows how ill-prepared the U.S. Government writ large is for the small drone threat.”
“In trying to strip away some of the red tape, they’ve moved fast and haven’t necessarily ensured that the level of coordination that’s needed for some of these weapons to be employed,” Pettyjohn said, adding that she questions the decision to allow CBP members to employ counter-drone laser near a heavily traveled air corridor.
“Can you imagine if a laser hit a civilian airliner?” said Pettyjohn, who recently co-authored a CNAS report on protecting the joint force in the drone age. “It’s not just that the laser would damage an aircraft, it could blind the pilots and just cause an accident.”
It’s still unclear what laser technology was used in the El Paso drone incident. Reuters reported that the Army had deployed AeroVironment Inc’s LOCUST laser counter-drone weapon system near El Paso International Airport. AeroVironment delivered two Joint Light Tactical Vehicle equipped with 20 kilowatt laser systems to the Army in December as part of the second increment of the Army Multi-Purpose High Energy Laser prototyping effort. The Army has conducted numerous tests of its Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense, or DE M-SHORAD, that’s equipped with a 50-kilowatt laser for counter-drone operations.
Air & Space Forces Magazine reached out to the Pentagon and NORTHCOM for this story. NORTHCOM deferred to the Pentagon, which did not respond to the query by press time.
Pettyjohn questions the amount of training CBP members received before being cleared to use such as weapon. Military air defense units have “deep expertise” in the capabilities of counter-drone laser weapons, which has come through years of testing, she said.
“I think this does highlight the risks of transferring advanced weapons system to Customs and Border Pretection agents, who are not trained on it necessarily and might not be as aware of some of the potential risks of employing these,” Pettyjohn said.
Pettyjohn said she thinks it’s appropriate for Pentagon officials to accept risk in trying to change some of the restrictions on using counter-drone systems in the U.S., “but they’re accepting a lot of risk by transferring them to someone else to use.”
“I think this does highlight questions about the appropriate roles of missions between the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon for this … and I think there needs to be clear guardrails for employing different types of counter-drone defeat systems in the U.S.,” Pettyjohn said. “Is the laser the appropriate system to be using on the border or for a base? I think there are questions about that and so, and if they are going to employ it, they need to make sure that they do so safely and deconflict with commercial traffic.”

Son of Iran’s last shah urges US military intervention in Iran
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Feb 14 said US military intervention in Iran
The exiled son of Iran’s toppled shah told Reuters in an interview that there were signs that the Iranian government was on the brink of collapse, and that an attack could weaken it or accelerate its fall.
Mr Pahlavi was speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where officials from the Iranian government are banned.
“It’s a matter of time. We are hoping that this attack will expedite the process and the people can be finally back in the streets and take it all the way to the ultimate regime’s downfall,” said Mr Pahlavi, who is based in the US and has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
A campaign of mass arrests and intimidation
The protests began on Dec 28 as a modest demonstration in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.
Trump has questioned level of support for Pahlavi
Iran’s opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions – including the monarchists who back Mr Pahlavi – and appears to have little organised presence inside the Islamic Republic.
In an interview with Reuters in January, Mr Trump sounded sceptical about the level of Mr Pahlavi’s support inside Iran.
The Trump administration has engaged with Iran to see if a nuclear deal can be struck
“People are hoping that at some point, the decision will be made that there’s no use, there’s no point, we’re not going to get anywhere with negotiations. Therefore, that’s time for the United States to intervene and do what President Trump promised he will do, to have the people’s back,” Mr Pahlavi said.
“Intervention is a way to save lives.”
On Feb 13, in a speech to US troops in North Carolina, Mr Trump said Iran has been difficult in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the stand-off peacefully.
Two US officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Feb 13 that the US military was preparing for the possibility of a sustained, weeks-long operation against Iran if Mr Trump ordered an attack. REUTERS

The violent deaths linked to the group known as Zizians stopped at six a year ago, after a U.S. border agent was killed and three members were arrested on trespassing and gun charges in the woods of western Maryland. Seven of the group's members are jailed in three states, all awaiting trial.
Police in Maryland quickly connected Jack “Ziz” LaSota, Michelle Zajko and Daniel Blank to homicide investigations in California, Pennsylvania and Vermont after a landowner found them living in box trucks at the end of a snow covered dirt road last February, according to court documents and pre-trial testimony.
“All the suspects involved are to be questioned regarding other crimes that have occurred across the country and have ties with the Zizians Cult,” Maryland state Trooper Brandon Jeffries wrote after their Feb. 16, 2025 arrests. But their prosecutions have only inched along amid trial delays and little action in other cases.
Called “Zizians” by outsiders, the young, highly intelligent computer scientists appear to share radical beliefs about veganism, animal rights, gender identity and artificial intelligence. Since 2022, members have been tied to the death of one of their own during an attack on a California landlord, the landlord’s subsequent killing, the shooting deaths of Zajko’s parents in Pennsylvania, and a highway shootout in Vermont that left the border agent and another Zizian dead.
Arguing they’re victims of injustice
Jury selection was supposed to start this week in Cumberland, Maryland, where LaSota, Zajko and Blank are charged with possession of LSD and possession with intent to deliver LSD, multiple gun violations, trespassing and hindering a police officer.
The trial was delayed until June, however, after Zajko, who also is charged with resisting arrest, fired her attorney, briefly represented herself and hired a new lawyer.
In handwritten filings, she has made sprawling allegations of rights violations by snitches inside the Allegany County Detention Center and lies by police and prosecutors.
“In the interest of Hope, Justice and Truth, for the good of all people, and for the establishment of a true peace, the defense moves to dismiss this case,” Zajko declared in 20 pages of neat but almost indecipherably small handwriting.
Their lawyers and the lead prosecutor have all declined comment or not responded to interview requests.
Vermont border agent killed
Zajko also is accused of supplying the guns two other Zizians used in a fatal shootout in Vermont in January 2025, although her federal court docket starts and ends with the complaint charging her with lying to a Vermont gun dealer.
In that case, Teresa Youngblut is accused of opening fire on Border Patrol Agent David Maland during a traffic stop before another agent wounded her and killed her companion, Felix Bauckholt. The encounter happened just hours after President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, but in a Maryland court filing, Zajko sought to blame it on a culture of impunity she says is now evident in the administration’s mass deportation campaign.
“Renee Good is probably dead because the regime has so far been able to get away with murdering Ms. Bauckholt & framing Youngblut,” Zajko claimed. Good was fatally shot last month by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis. Neither ICE nor border patrol officials responded to messages seeking comment.
Zajko claimed authorities arrested the group to prevent them from exonerating Youngblut, who has pleaded not guilty in Vermont to murder and could face the death penalty if convicted.
“It is an act of obscene cruelty, despotism & the mark of a tyrannical regime to use a bad faith investigation & the threat of phony charges to conceal exculpatory evidence, threaten witnesses into silence, or threaten to put an innocent person to death, all to protect a murderous border patrol human,” wrote Zajko.
The judge in Youngblut’s case last week suspended deadlines for pretrial motions, citing the complexity of the capital case and noting that the exchange of evidence “will include material related to investigations into other individuals in multiple jurisdictions.”
Murder trials pending in California, an open case in Pennsylvania
Two other Zizians, Suri Dao and Alexander Leatham, are charged in a 2022 attack on a landlord in California that left another member, Emma Borhanian, dead, but their trial has been postponed multiple times. Another member, Maximilian Snyder, is charged with killing the landlord, Curtis Lind, three years later, just days before the Vermont shooting.
Dao’s attorney, Brian Ford, said proceedings are suspended for competency hearings and that his client is not guilty. Attorneys for the others, as well as family members of victims and those accused, either declined to comment or did not respond to messages.
LaSota, described by authorities as the apparent leader of the Zizians, has a May trial date in Baltimore federal court on a separate charge of being an armed fugitive — a charge she has asked to have dismissed, arguing it violates her Second Amendment rights.
Authorities allege LaSota faked her own death to evade charges after a 2019 protest in California and disappeared again after being accused of obstructing the investigation into the December 2022 shooting deaths of Zajko’s parents, Richard and Rita Zajko, in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania.
No one has been charged for killing the Zajkos, and the Delaware County district attorney’s office said only that it still is being investigated. Jeffries, the Maryland trooper, said in a report that “Blank is under investigation for a double homicide that occurred in Delaware County, PA.”
Authorities also have described Zajko as a person of interest in her parents’ death. She has denied any role. In her recent filing, she referred to them as “adoptive guardians” and suggested her father might have killed her mother and then himself. Richard Zajko’s sister-in-law, Rosanne Zajko, declined to comment on behalf of the family.
Mountainside arrests in Maryland
James Broadwater wasn’t sure what to make of the strangers dressed all in black who parked their trucks near his home in Eckhart Mines, outside Frostburg, Maryland. Then Jeffries, the state trooper, told him to Google “Zizians.”
Broadwater testified recently that he had encountered LaSota and Zajko about a half-mile uphill from his house. They asked to stay, but Broadwater gave them until the next morning to leave. After talking with his wife he called state police.
“He changed his mind because he was afraid what would happen if he asked you guys to leave,” Jeffries said when questioned by Zajko in court.
Jeffries testified that a dispatcher had told him about an Associated Press article on the Zizians, published the day before, reporting details about the six deaths. He said LaSota told him they were willing to leave but the three would not identify themselves.
Jeffries said his suspicions were heightened because of the news coverage, their tactical gear that included ammunition on gun belts, and how the trucks were parked with chains on their tires. “I wanted to make sure I identified them before they left,” he testified, and they made the arrests.
The Zizians in Maryland have been working on a joint defense while jailed, though Blank’s parents are pressing the judge to release their son on bail, and his lawyer has sought to distance him from the others. Blank "should not be detained because of the company in which he was arrested,” attorney Rebecca Lechliter wrote.

BrewDog owners say craft beer company could be sold off
The brand, which produces Elvis Juice and Punk IPA, is looking for new investors

Craft beer brand BrewDog could be sold off after the company started the process to find new investors.
The Scottish beer brand recently announced plans to close all of its distilling brands, meaning it would no longer produce any of its spirits, including Duo Rum, Abstrakt Vodka, and Lonewolf Gin, at its distillery in Ellon, Aberdeenshire.
The company, which was founded in 2007, said it made the decision to focus on its beer brands, including the highly-popular Punk IPA, Elvis Juice, and Hazy Jane.
Now, in a statement, a spokesperson for BrewDog said the company had appointed Alix Partners to “support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business.”
The statement said: “As with many businesses operating in a challenging economic climate and facing sustained macro headwinds, we regularly review our options with a focus on the long-term strength and sustainability of the company.
“Following a year of decisive action in 2025, which saw a focus on costs and operating efficiencies, we have appointed AlixPartners to support a structured and competitive process to evaluate the next phase of investment for the business. This is a deliberate and disciplined step with a focus on strengthening the long-term future of the BrewDog brand and its operations.”
Although no decisions have been made, a sale is under consideration.
In a statment BrewDog added: “BrewDog remains a global pioneer in craft beer: a world-class consumer brand, the No.1 independent brewer in the UK, and with a highly engaged global community. We believe that this combination will attract substantial interest, though no final decisions have been made.”
According to reports by Sky News, AlixPartners had begun sounding out prospective buyers in the last few days.
The company, which has 72 bars worldwide and four breweries in Scotland, the US, Australia, and Germany, said its breweries, bars, and venues will continue to operate as normal. It employs 1400 people across the organisation.
BrewDog’s founders James Watt and Martin Dickie are the company's major shareholders alongside private equity company TSG, which invested £213 million in 2017, making it a 21 per cent shareholder.
In 2024, the beer brand grossed £357 million in sales, and it is a major independent brewer with 4 per cent market share in the UK grocery market.

Ex-Reform MP who came to blows with Farage launches new political party – with very similar name
Rupert Lowe once accused Nigel Farage’s group of a ‘brutal smear campaign’ against him
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A former Reform UK MP who once accused Nigel Farage’s group of a “brutal smear campaign” against him has launched a new political party, with a very similar name.
Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe formally unveiled his Restore Britain party on Friday night.
Mr Lowe, currently an independent MP, used to sit as a Reform representative until he was expelled following allegations of bullying and verbal threats towards the party’s chairman, Zia Yusuf.
Mr Lowe vehemently denied all allegations against him and called them vexatious in a row that at one point saw tech billionaire Elon Musk suggest Mr Lowe should replace Mr Farage as the leader of Reform.
It erupted after Mr Lowe called Reform a “protest party” led by “the Messiah” in a newspaper interview.
Leaked WhatsApp messages later showed Mr Farage denounced his behaviour as “disgusting” and “contemptible” and accused him of “damaging the party just before elections”.
Restore Britain was initially set up as a “political movement” by Mr Lowe after his departure from Reform UK.
It is now expected to act as an umbrella political party, with locally based political parties as its partners.
Mr Lowe, for example, will stand again for the Great Yarmouth constituency with local party Great Yarmouth First, which will be a partner for Restore Britain.
Senior Conservative figures Susan Hall and Sir Gavin Williamson had been involved in an advisory board for Restore Britain when it was described as a political movement.
Former minister Sir Gavin suggested to the Press Association he would end his involvement with Restore Britain as a result of it becoming a political party.
Ms Hall, the Conservative leader in the London Assembly, is also thought to be leaving the party’s board.
Last May, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Mr Lowe would not face criminal charges in relation to the alleged threats, “following a thorough and detailed review of the evidence”.
In a statement, Mr Lowe accused Reform of carrying out a “brutal smear campaign”.
He also attacked his former party’s leader, calling him “a coward and a viper”.

Drone strikes claim lives in Ukraine and Russia ahead of fresh peace talks
Attacks on Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odesa and in the border region of Bryansk have killed two people
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Drone strikes claimed lives in both Ukraine and Russia on Saturday, casting a grim shadow over the prospect of fresh peace talks scheduled for next week.
An elderly woman was killed when a Russian drone struck a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service confirmed.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a civilian died in a Ukrainian drone attack on a car in the border region of Bryansk, according to regional Governor Alexander Bogomaz. These incidents followed a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian border city of Belgorod the previous day, which killed two people and wounded five, as reported by Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Against this backdrop of escalating hostilities, a new round of US-brokered discussions between envoys from Russia and Ukraine is set to take place in Geneva next week.
The talks, confirmed by officials in Moscow and Kyiv on Friday, will occur just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated the discussions would be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, a schedule corroborated by Dmytro Lytvyn, communications adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The negotiations unfold amid relentless fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometre front line, persistent Russian bombardment of Ukrainian civilian areas and its power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on military-related assets within Russian territory.
Previous US-led efforts to find common ground, including two recent rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, have failed to resolve contentious issues such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland, which is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday, President Zelenskyy expressed profound gratitude to American and European allies for their provision of air defence systems, which he said protect vital infrastructure like power plants and "save lives." He emphasised the constant threat, stating: "Russian attacks happen almost every night in Ukraine and at least once a week, massive strikes."
He added: "Without you Americans, Europeans, and everyone who stands with us, it would have been very, very difficult to hold on." Mr Zelenskyy reiterated his conviction that security guarantees for Ukraine must precede any peace agreement with Russia. He also noted last week that the United States had set a June deadline for Ukraine and Russia to reach a deal, though previous deadlines given by Donald Trump have largely passed without consequence.

Sybiha: Ukraine will be ready to deploy its troops to other geographic regions in future
A number of partner countries from Europe and elsewhere have confirmed their readiness to deploy their troops to Ukraine after the ceasefire. Ukraine, in turn, will be prepared to deploy its troops to other regions of the world in the future, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiha emphasized at the discussion panel "Focus on Security Guarantees for Ukraine" at the Munich Security Forum, which began on Friday.
"The presence of troops on the ground is an important part of future security guarantees, as well as for business opportunities. Having a presence on the ground also serves as a deterrent, a guarantee for future investors, and an incentive to invest in Ukraine. Therefore, we have also received confirmation from some European capitals, and not only European capitals, of their readiness to deploy troops on the ground," Sybiha said.
According to him, this will happen after the ceasefire is reached. "I don’t know whether this concerns a peacekeeping mandate or a peace monitoring group, because that’s still in the process. But we need this presence in Ukraine. Ukraine is also ready to deploy its armed forces to other geographic regions in the future," the minister added.

Zelensky urges US to intensify pressure on Russia
Zelensky made the remarks in an interview with POLITICO at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
"Be honest, today only Ukraine [is] defending Europe. Today, only Europe gives money to Ukraine and helps Ukraine. Today, only [the] United States can stop Putin," he said.
He criticized the U.S. for trying to force the Ukrainians to concede territory in the Donbas region without demanding sacrifices from the Kremlin.
"What I see, they give more signals that Ukraine has to make compromises and not Russia. This is not [the] right position," he said.
He also stressed that Congress would need to backstop security guarantees, either with more money for Ukraine's postwar military or by sealing a treaty agreement.
"Security guarantees will work only after Congress will vote," he said.
The Ukrainian president pushed back on President Donald Trump's demand that Kyiv and Moscow wrap up a peace settlement by the summer. He said the Kremlin has strung the U.S. along in talks in an effort to normalize the relationship and ease sanctions.
"Until there is enough pressure," Zelensky said, "they [the Russians] play."
He applauded a NATO initiative to give Ukraine more U.S.-made weapons, but said it had not changed Putin's impression that Europe was weak. "Putin really doesn't respect Europe," Zelensky said, adding that the Russian leader's efforts to divide the continent have not been successful.
According to Zelensky, Putin has little time left.
"I'm younger than Putin – this is important," Zelensky said. "He doesn't have too much time."

Zelenskyy: Orbán can focus on growing his belly and not worry about Russian tanks returning to Budapest
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has reminded Europe that it is thanks to the sacrifices made by Ukrainian soldiers that European countries can live in peace.
Source: Zelenskyy speaking at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Zelenskyy pointed out that it is the Ukrainians who are holding the European front.
"Behind our people stand an independent Poland and the free Baltic states," he said, adding that not everyone in Europe understands this.
Quote: "And even one Viktor can think about how to grow his belly – not how to grow his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to the streets of Budapest."
More details: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who for a long time stayed in good shape, has gained a significant amount of weight in recent years.
Zelenskyy reminded everyone that Ukraine wants to end the war.
Quote: "None of our people chooses to be such heroes. Ukraine did not choose this war… Ukrainians are people, not terminators. Our people are dying too."
Background:
- Earlier at the conference, Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte warned what Russia is actually seeking to achieve through the peace talks.
- Zelenskyy also described how air defence missiles arrived from the EU just before Russia's 12 February attack.

Rubio sweet-talks Europe in Munich, sharply contrasting with Vance’s attacks last year
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio struck a conciliatory tone with European leaders at the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 14.
Rubio’s style and wording stood in sharp contrast to U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s confrontational and accusatory speech at the 2025 Munich Security Conference. Vance's address turned into a searing attack on Europe's ideals and a call to embrace far-right parties.
Rubio emphasized the U.S. admiration for Europe and referred to shared history.
"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the Transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe," he said.
While the delegates welcomed the speech "with relief," many highlighted that Rubio was not proposing an equal partnership but rather an alliance mainly shaped by the U.S. President Donald Trump's perspective, said Patrick Wintour, the diplomatic editor at the Guardian.
Regarding the ending of the war in Ukraine, Rubio said that despite some progress in peace talks, there are still the "hardest questions to answer." He referred to Russia's demand that Ukraine withdraw from parts of the Donbas and Moscow's claims over the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.
"They say they are (interested in talks), and under what terms they were willing to do it, and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine upon that Russia will always agree to, but we're going to continue to test it," Rubio said.
On Feb. 13, Rubio skipped a Berlin Format meeting on Ukraine held on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Rubio was expected to join leaders from a dozen European countries — including Germany, Poland, and Finland — along with officials from the European Commission and NATO. However, the Financial Times reported that he canceled at the last minute, citing scheduling conflicts.

NGU Omega Special Operations Center Conducted Operation to Free Wounded Officer Who Had Been Held Captive for 27 Days

The Omega Special Operations Center of the National Guard of Ukraine carried out a unique combat operation in the Pokrovsk sector.
Special forces operatives acted almost behind enemy lines to free an officer of the 1st detachment with the call sign ‘Karat’ from captivity, said the head of the Center, Pavlo Yatsiuk.
The soldier fell into enemy hands after being wounded and was held captive for 27 days. During the operation, the Omega group eliminated eight Russian soldiers.
The special forces were supported by fighters and the leadership of the SSU’s Special Operations Center Alpha. The 14th Brigade of the National Guard ‘Chervona Kalyna’ and the command of the 1st Corps of the National Guard ‘Azov’ also provided assistance in conducting the operation.
Karat is currently on his way to Kyiv for treatment of his injuries.
As a reminder, in January, a wounded Ukrainian soldier was captured by the Russians, but managed to convince the invaders to surrender to the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
His condition is now stable after surgery on his pelvic bone, and the command is preparing documents for a state award.

Zelensky says US too often asks Ukraine, not Russia, for concessions
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
- Ukrainian President Zelensky hopes for "substantive" Geneva peace talks but feels Ukraine is pressed for concessions, suspecting Russia changed negotiators to delay decisions.
- Land, especially Russia demanding more Donetsk territory, is the major sticking point. Ukraine refuses to cede it but considers a US-proposed free trade zone.
- Zelensky urged stronger Western action, including tougher sanctions and more weapons, calling on Trump to force a ceasefire and for Europe to play a bigger role.

KYIV – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky voiced hope on Feb 14 that US-brokered peace talks in Geneva next week would be substantive, but he said Ukraine was being asked “too often” to make concessions.
He also accused Moscow of seeking to delay decisions by changing its lead negotiator.
Ukrainian, Russian and American delegations are due to meet in the Swiss lakeside city on Feb 17 and 18 as US President Donald Trump seeks to push through a deal to end Europe’s biggest war since 1945.
“We truly hope that the trilateral meetings next week will be serious, substantive, helpful for all us but honestly sometimes it feels like the sides are talking about completely different things,” Mr Zelensky said in a speech at the annual Munich Security Conference.
Ukraine and Russia, which invaded its neighbour in February 2022, have engaged in two recent rounds of talks brokered by Washington in Abu Dhabi described by the sides as constructive but achieving no major breakthroughs.
Mr Zelensky called for greater action from Ukraine’s allies to press Russia into making peace - both in the form of tougher sanctions and more weapons supplies.
Recalling his appeal four years ago, when he spoke at the same conference days before tens of thousands of Russian forces poured into Ukraine, Mr Zelensky said there was too much talk by Western officials and not enough action.
Mr Trump has the power to force Mr Putin to declare a ceasefire and needed to do so, Mr Zelensky said. Ukrainian officials have said a ceasefire is required to hold a referendum on any peace deal, which would be organised alongside national elections.
The Ukrainian leader, a former television entertainer, acknowledged he was feeling “a little bit” of pressure from Mr Trump, who yesterday said Mr Zelensky should not miss the “opportunity” to make peace soon and urged him “to get moving”.
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” Mr Zelensky said.
Instead, Mr Zelensky said, he wanted to hear what compromises Moscow would be ready for, as Ukraine had already made many of its own.
Russia said its delegation to Geneva would be led by Putin adviser Vladimir Medinsky, a change from negotiations in Abu Dhabi at which Russia’s team was led by military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov.
Mr Zelensky told reporters on Feb 14 the change was “a surprise” for Ukraine, and suggested to him that Russia wanted to delay any decisions from being agreed.
Ukrainian officials have criticised Mr Medinsky’s handling of previous talks, accusing him of delivering history lessons to the Ukrainian team instead of engaging in constructive negotiations.
Deadlock over territory
Land remains the major sticking point in negotiations, with Russia demanding that Ukraine cede the remaining 20 per cent of the eastern region of Donetsk that Moscow has failed to capture - something Kyiv steadfastly refuses to do.
At a news conference on Feb 14, Mr Zelensky said that US negotiators had told Ukraine that the Russians had promised a swift end to the war if Ukrainian forces immediately withdrew from the part of Donetsk it still controls.
He said earlier he was instead ready to discuss a US proposal for a free trade zone in that region, while freezing the rest of the 1,200km front line.
Ukraine’s chief negotiator, Mr Rustem Umerov, who sat beside Mr Zelensky during the media briefing, said the only two options were either that Ukraine sticks to the current lines of control, or that a free economic zone is established.
Russia occupies about 20 per cent of Ukraine’s national territory, including Crimea and parts of the eastern Donbas region seized before the full-scale invasion in 2022.
Analysts say Moscow has gained about 1.5 per cent of Ukrainian territory since early 2024. Its recent air strikes on Ukraine’s cities and electricity infrastructure have left hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians without heating and power during the course of a bitterly cold winter.
Ukrainian officials have repeatedly expressed concern in recent weeks that US congressional mid-term elections in November could focus the Trump administration on domestic political issues after the summer.
Mr Zelensky said he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations, and that there would be an opportunity for Europe, which he said was currently sidelined, to play a bigger role.
“Europe is practically not present at the table. It’s a big mistake to my mind,” he said.
Mr Zelensky said that Russia had to accept a ceasefire monitoring mission and an exchange of prisoners of war; he estimated that Russia currently had about 7,000 Ukrainian troops while Kyiv had more than 4,000 Russians.
Mr Zelensky also suggested Moscow was opposed to the deployment of French and British troops in Ukraine after the war - which Paris and London have said they are willing to do - because Russian President Vladimir Putin “wants to have the opportunity to come back.” REUTERS

Finland files protest over Olympic sprint waxing dispute
Finland

Finland has filed a formal protest with the International Ski Federation over events during the men’s Olympic sprint at the Milan–Cortina Winter Games, alleging rule breaches by Norway and the United States.
The Finnish Ski Association and the Finnish Olympic Committee submitted the complaint to the sprint jury on Saturday morning.
The protest concerns the final of Tuesday’s race, in which Norway’s Johannes Kläbo took gold ahead of American Ben Ogden and Norway’s Oskar Vike.
Finland’s Lauri Vuorinen finished fourth.
Finnish officials argue that both Norway and the United States gained an advantage through equipment procedures that breached competition rules and instructions issued to team leaders before the event.
According to the Finnish Olympic Committee, the protest relies on information that emerged only after the race.
The dispute centres on activity in the service area during the sprint heats.
Finland states that the United States team brought a liquid substance into the waxing zone, which they described as a wax removal agent. Such liquids are banned under FIS regulations for the event.
Norway, in turn, received permission from FIS to use an electric waxing pot in the service area during the heats. Pre-event guidelines sent to teams prohibited the use of such equipment. Finland says other teams were not informed that Norway had been granted an exception.
The Finnish Ski Association said FIS later admitted it had made an error in handling the matter and apologised.
“FIS has itself admitted making a mistake, and this has led to an unfair competition in which two countries received an undue advantage without others knowing,” said Marleena Valtasola, executive director of the Finnish Ski Association, in a statement.
“Such action is impossible to accept, and a mere admission of error or apology does not correct the damage that has been done.”
Finland demands that the results be amended to reflect a situation in which no athlete benefited from action contrary to the rules.
Finnish coaches learned of the incidents on Thursday, two days after the race. At that stage, they were informed that the 48-hour time limit for lodging a protest had expired.
Both the Olympic Committee and the Ski Association state they are prepared to pursue further action if the initial protest is rejected.

"I want to be very clear: we can negotiate without the Europeans if we want, but that will not lead to peace at the negotiating table. This is precisely why I decided to establish a direct channel of communication with Russia in full transparency with Ukraine, our European partners, and our American allies," he said speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday.

UK to send carrier north in show of force against Russia
United Kingdom

The UK will deploy a Carrier Strike Group to the North Atlantic and High North in 2026 under Operation Firecrest, in what the Ministry of Defence describes as a major show of force aimed at deterring Russian aggression and protecting critical undersea infrastructure.
The deployment will be led by HMS Prince of Wales and will include warships, F-35 aircraft and helicopters, as part of a broader effort to strengthen NATO’s deterrence posture in the Euro-Atlantic and Arctic regions.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the move comes amid growing concern over increased Russian naval activity in the North Atlantic. The government claims there has been a “30% increase in Russian navy vessels threatening UK waters” over the past two years.
The strike group is expected to operate closely with the United States, including activity off the North American East Coast and a port visit in the US. The MOD said American aircraft are also expected to operate from the flight deck of HMS Prince of Wales during the deployment.
Operation Firecrest will also contribute to NATO’s new Arctic Sentry mission, launched this week, with the government citing the strategic impact of melting sea ice opening new routes and increasing the risk of hostile activity in the High North.
The MOD highlighted concerns around Russian operations in the Greenland-Iceland-UK (GIUK) gap, as well as the vulnerability of undersea cables and pipelines.
Defence Secretary John Healey said the deployment would reinforce British leadership in the region.
“I’m proud that we’re stepping up UK leadership on High North and Atlantic security,” Healey said.
“This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad.”
The operation will involve thousands of personnel across all three armed services. The MOD said the Carrier Strike Group will also exercise alongside NATO’s Standing Naval Maritime Group1, which will be led by the UK throughout 2026, with HMS Dragon acting as the command ship.
Parts of the deployment will fall under NATO command and will include cooperation with Joint Force Command Norfolk, which the government said is expected to be led by a British officer for the first time.
Operation Firecrest follows the UK’s 2025 carrier deployment to the Indo-Pacific, which the MOD said involved more than 1,000 F-35 sorties and engagement with over 30 nations, and resulted in the Carrier Strike Group being declared fully “mission ready” for NATO operations.

BUDAPEST, February 14. /TASS/. Hungary will not abandon its independent stance in the European Union and will not allow its right of veto to be removed, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said during a traditional speech in Budapest on the past year’s political results and the government’s plans for the near future.
This year, Orban’s address attracted particular attention as it came ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for April 12. One of the issues on the agenda of the ruling Fidesz-Hungarian Civic Union party concerns disagreements with EU leadership over the conflict in Ukraine. Budapest believes Brussels is attempting to strip Hungary of its right of veto in order to ensure Ukraine’s accession to the bloc. The ruling party says Brussels is seeking a change of leadership in Hungary by backing the opposition Tisza party.
However, Orban emphasized that Hungary will maintain its independent position on these issues despite pressure from Brussels. "An independent stance must be guarded like the apple of the eye," the prime minister said. He added that if the opposition party comes to power, it will "integrate Hungary into the common European foreign policy." "This must not happen. We will not allow our right of veto in the EU to be removed," Orban said.

Israel is building a NIS 7b. airport – history says it will cost much more - analysis

The numbers were impressive. NIS 7 billion. Ten million passengers a year. Seventy thousand aircraft movements. A "national necessity," the Prime Minister's Office declared, that would "effectively eliminate the concept of periphery."
On February 4, the offices of the prime minister, transportation minister, and finance minister jointly announced that a new international airport would be built at Ziklag in the northern Negev, between Rahat and Netivot – ending years of debate over where to build a second major aviation hub. A cabinet vote was scheduled for February 8 but was postponed less than an hour before the session amid disagreements over whether to include a parallel airport at Ramat David in the Jezreel Valley.
The government's confidence would be reassuring if not for one problem: Israel has not completed a single major government-funded infrastructure project on time and on budget in the past two decades. Not one.
The track record
The Tel Aviv Red Line light rail was approved in 2010 at NIS 10.7 billion. It opened in August 2023 at NIS 18.71 billion – 75% over budget and a full decade late. The State Comptroller found the original budget allocated just 16% for contingencies versus the international standard of roughly 50%. Budget changes worth hundreds of millions of shekels went undocumented. NTA diverted funds between line items to create the appearance of operating within budget.
The A1 fast train to Jerusalem was approved in 2001 at NIS 2.5 billion with a target date of 2008. It reached full service in December 2019 at roughly NIS 7 billion – a 180% overrun and more than a decade late.
The Jerusalem light rail was estimated at NIS 2.2 billion around 2002. The final cost reached NIS 3.8 billion – a 73% overrun. The line opened in December 2011, five to seven years behind schedule. In 2020, the government paid NIS 1.6 billion to buy back the failed CityPass concession.
The pattern extends to projects still underway. The Tel Aviv Purple Line, budgeted at roughly NIS 11 billion, is now projected at NIS 12.5 billion and running three years late. The Green Line, directed to open by 2020, won't achieve full service until 2030 at the earliest – NTA's own CEO described even that target as "ambitious." The Comptroller found that the construction pace on these lines was 48% slower than international norms.
These are not cherry-picked failures. A Calcalist-cited study found that the average budget overrun for Israeli infrastructure projects exceeds 20%, with large government bodies responsible for 62% of all overruns. For major rail and transit, the median overrun exceeds 70%.
Why it happens
The pattern is structural, and it has been documented extensively by the State Comptroller and confirmed by global academic research.
Bent Flyvbjerg, an Oxford professor who assembled the world's largest database on megaproject performance – more than 16,000 projects across 136 countries – found that 91.5% of megaprojects go over budget, over schedule, or both. The mean cost overrun globally is 62%. For rail projects, it is 44.7%. The core mechanism is what Flyvbjerg calls "strategic misrepresentation": initial budgets are deliberately set low because stating the real cost would make the project politically unpalatable.
His description reads almost exactly like the Comptroller's findings about the Red Line. The November 2022 Comptroller's report – the most authoritative document on the subject – found that NTA diverted budgets between sections to mask overruns, that changes worth hundreds of millions of shekels went unreported to the Transport and Finance ministries, and that the government failed to set binding completion dates. Israel is not an outlier. It is a textbook case – one that happens to perform worse than the global average.
The airport precedent
There is one Israeli project that provides a direct comparison to Ziklag: Ramon Airport.
Government authorization came in July 2011 at NIS 1.6 billion. The airport opened in January 2019 – 21 months late – at a reported NIS 1.7 billion, though total investment approached NIS 2 billion when all-in costs were included.
The cost overrun was modest by Israeli standards. But data published by the Israeli Airport Authority shows that in 2025, of the 750,000 total passengers, only around 7,500 were international. Almost NIS 2 billion invested in what has been described as a "white elephant." It was designed for 2.5 million passengers a year. In practice, it functioned primarily as a domestic shuttle point for Arkia and Israir.
Ziklag is being sold on the same premise: build it in the periphery and the passengers will come. The estimated cost is more than three times higher.
What the professionals said
The Ziklag decision was not made on professional advice. It was made against it.
For years, the debate centered on two alternatives: Ramat David in the Jezreel Valley, where a master plan was approved as early as 2007, and Nevatim in the Negev, adjacent to the existing air force base. The National Planning and Building Council had been advancing Ramat David since 2017 and was expected to complete its work next month.
Then, last June, Netanyahu announced the airport would be built at Ziklag – a third site that neither the planning establishment nor the defense establishment had recommended.
The Defense Ministry imposed what Calcalist described as an "absolute veto" on airports in the south. The IDF and Air Force argued that civilian flight paths would interfere with training and operational sorties from the Nevatim and Hatzarim air bases, and that relocating squadrons would cost an estimated NIS 15 billion. Planning authorities determined eight years ago that Ziklag's flight paths overlap with Ben Gurion's – meaning the new airport would add to congestion rather than relieve it.
Industry sources told TheMarker the decision was politically driven by the insistence of Regev and Deputy Minister Almog Cohen on a southern airport "apparently at any cost, even if the professional considerations do not support the plan." Aviation officials separately told Haaretz it was driven by political pressure from Likud officials in the south.
The "Negev Takes Off from Nevatim" campaign – a coalition of local authority heads including Dimona Mayor Beni Biton, a Likud figure close to both Regev and Netanyahu – called the Ziklag decision "disconnected from reality and absurd by any measure." They argued Nevatim already had billions invested in airport infrastructure and that new planning at Ziklag would take at least a decade while producing no immediate solution to Ben Gurion's capacity problem.
Biton told Walla Sheva that IDF Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir and the Air Force commander had misled Netanyahu about the feasibility of Nevatim, claiming former chief of staff Benny Gantz told him directly: "There is no problem whatsoever to build an airport at Nevatim."
Retired Maj. Gen. Nimrod Sheffer, former head of the Air Force Planning Division, told Calcalist: "The state needs to do what is right for the state, even if the Air Force opposes it. There is no problem without a solution."
The exceptions that prove the rule
In two decades, precisely two categories of Israeli projects have been completed on time and on budget: desalination plants and the National Library.
The Ashkelon and Sorek desalination plants – NIS 950 million and NIS 2.1 billion respectively – were both delivered on schedule under BOT contracts in which private firms bore the construction cost risk. The government's exposure was limited to the contracted water price, not construction costs.
The National Library opened in October 2023 at its budgeted NIS 845 million. The decisive factor: 86% of funding came from private donors – the Rothschild/Yad HaNadiv Foundation and the Gottesman Family – who imposed strict professional oversight. Only 14% was government money.
Same country. Same regulatory environment. Same labor market. The variable was who bore the risk and who managed the project. Ziklag has neither private risk-sharing nor independent oversight. It is a fully government-managed project on public funds.
What NIS 7 billion likely means
For Israeli government projects over the past 20 years, the median cost overrun for rail and transit exceeds 70%. Ramon Airport came in 6% to 25% over budget – but it was a simple project compared to building an entirely new airport on a site that lacks infrastructure, in a location the military opposes, with unresolved airspace conflicts.
If the Israeli median overrun of 50% to 75% applies – conservative, given that several projects have exceeded 100% – the realistic cost range is NIS 10.5 to 12.25 billion. The government has not stated a completion date. Critics estimate at least a decade. Given that the Israeli median delay runs five to ten years beyond stated targets, the mid-2040s is more realistic than the mid-2030s.
The Ziklag airport will also be competing for scarce resources. The December 2025 Comptroller's report on the Tel Aviv Metro – a project whose cost had already risen from NIS 150 billion to NIS 177 billion – found the Metro Authority had no permanent director and only five employees. Israel faces a shortage of 4,500 civil engineers, expected to grow to 8,000.
The bottom line
Seven kilometers from the proposed airport site, Hamas terrorists carried out the October 7 massacre. Deputy Minister Cohen noted this fact himself when the decision was announced – apparently as a point of pride rather than a security concern.
The government has approved NIS 7 billion for an airport that professional planners did not recommend, in a location the military opposes, on a site that lacks infrastructure, with overlapping airspace, without a stated completion date, without private risk-sharing, and without the oversight that characterizes the only Israeli projects ever completed on budget.
If the data is any guide, and 20 years of it suggests it is, the final price tag will not be NIS 7 billion.

Doctors Without Borders suspends activities at Gaza hospital due to presence of gunmen
Aid group says incidents, including suspected weapons transfers, have increased since ceasefire; statement marks 1st time international group confirmed gunmen in Gaza hospitals
Doctors Without Borders said in a statement that it has suspended non-critical medical activities at Nasser Hospital in Gaza’s Khan Younis due to the presence of armed men at the medical facility and “a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons.”
The aid group said that armed men have additionally been arresting patients.
MSF’s statement appeared to mark the first time that an international humanitarian group in Gaza has publicly reported the presence of armed men in a hospital or the possible use of such a facility for moving weapons.
“In recent months, in Nasser hospital in Khan Younis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital. This had not been in areas where MSF has activities, but in other parts of the hospital compound,” Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said in the statement explaining its decision to halt work at the Nasser Hospital since January 20.
MSF has been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel triggered a two-year war in the enclave. Israel and Hamas agreed to a US-brokered ceasefire in October, though both sides have repeatedly accused each other of violations.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” the humanitarian organization said. “These incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
An MSF representative told Reuters the organization continued to support some critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical care for certain patients requiring lifesaving treatment.
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said in a statement it was committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action would be taken against violators. It suggested that armed members of certain Gazan families had recently entered hospitals, but did not identify those involved.
Israel has repeatedly offered evidence of medical facilities’ regular use by Palestinian terror groups as bases of operations due to their protected status. Hostages have also said they were held at Nasser Hospital.
Last year, a doctor, who also serves as a spokesperson for Nasser Hospital, hinted that he had been threatened by Palestinian Islamic Jihad due to his refusal to let the terror group’s operatives enter and use the hospital.
Israel announced earlier this month that it was terminating all MSF’s activities in Gaza and the West Bank after it failed to provide a list of its Palestinian staff.
MSF slammed the move, which takes effect on March 1, as a “pretext” to obstruct aid. Israel has previously accused MSF of having at least two employees who held membership in the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas terror groups.
Oxfam sued for “toxic antisemitic culture”
The scrutiny of MSF comes amid broader criticism of international aid organizations’ conduct regarding the Gaza conflict.
This week, the former CEO of Oxfam GB announced she is suing the charity, alleging a “toxic antisemitic culture” and claiming she faced pressure to prematurely use the term genocide to describe Israel’s military campaign.
“Because to use the word genocide, it has to be something that we arrive at with consultation and evidence and good legal advice,” Halima Begum told Channel 4 News. “And to try and use that term before we’re ready as an organization feels quite risky to me.”
“Essentially, it was very hard to hold on to neutrality and impartiality,” she added. “And I say that as a Muslim woman,”
In a statement to Channel 4 News, Oxfam GB said it refutes Begum’s allegations.
Oxfam works in over 70 countries, helping people in developing countries out of poverty and providing emergency aid during humanitarian crises.
Mark Goldring resigned as CEO of Oxfam GB in 2018 following revelations that the charity’s aid workers used sex workers while in Haiti following a 2010 earthquake. The British government halted funding for Oxfam in 2021 after it reported it had suspended staff members in the Democratic Republic of Congo over claims of sexual misconduct and bullying.

Heavy air pollution and cloudy skies: The dusty haze covering Israel carries possible health risks
Unknown

21:42:51 KST

Israel's air quality plummeted on Saturday, with Jerusalem and Tel Aviv topping the list of the most polluted major cities worldwide, according to IQAir's live ranking. The sky was a cloudy orange-gray, visibility was significantly impaired, and monitoring stations across the country indicated very high to abnormal levels of air pollution.
The haze was caused by strong southwesterly winds carrying large amounts of dust from North Africa. These deposit fine dust particles into the atmosphere, where they combine with urban emissions from heavy traffic and industrial emissions.
Stagnant atmospheric conditions and a lack of rainfall are the final components that allow dense smog to form.
According to reports, some improvement is expected in the north of the country and the Golan Heights later today, but very high pollution levels will prevail in other areas.
Health Ministry, Environmental Protection Ministry issue warnings
The Health Ministry and the Environmental Protection Ministry both issued warnings to the public regarding the dust.
Sensitive populations, including heart patients, lung patients, asthmatics, the elderly, children, and pregnant women, are advised to avoid staying outdoors and to stop all strenuous physical activity outside the home.
The healthy population is also advised to reduce strenuous activity in the open air as much as possible.
The ministries emphasized that the massive transport of dust raises the concentration of respiratory particles to levels that may be dangerous, especially for people with underlying diseases.
The impact of the haze is not limited to discomfort or burning in the eyes. It is a real biological burden on the body's systems.
The tiny dust particles can penetrate through the respiratory tract into the trachea and bronchi, and sometimes into the lung nodules. The body recognizes the particles as a foreign agent and triggers an inflammatory response.
IgE antibodies activate during the response and trigger a chain of biological processes that include blood vessel dilation, mucosal edema, and increased sputum secretion. The result is throat irritation, a bothersome cough, a burning sensation in the eyes, and sometimes narrowing of the airways.
In patients with asthma and chronic lung diseases, the effect may be more dramatic.
The narrowing of the airways causes wheezing, shortness of breath, and sometimes attacks that require treatment with inhalers or inhalations. In some cases, the particles in the air form a substrate for viruses and bacteria to adhere to, which may increase the risk of infections in the respiratory tract.
The cardiovascular system can also be damaged by the dust molecules. Polluted air contains less available oxygen, which requires the heart to work at an increased load to supply oxygen to the body's tissues.
In heart patients with narrowing of the coronary blood vessels, the increased demand may lead to ischemia of the heart muscle and a possible heart attack. The load may also increase blood pressure and increase the risk of stroke.
Reducing exposure to air pollution, dust particles
To reduce exposure to the dust particles, it is recommended to close windows in the home, office, and car. Air conditioners should be set to internal circulation and not to draw air from outside.
Heart and lung patients are advised to stay in closed spaces as much as possible. Asthma patients should make sure that inhalers are easily accessible, and those who have suffered from severe asthma attacks in the past should consult a doctor about preventive treatment.
Outdoor physical activity is not recommended because physical exertion increases breathing rate and can draw a larger volume of polluted air into the lungs, thereby increasing exposure to harmful particles.
Children playing outside, running, or riding bicycles are at increased risk because their breathing rate is higher relative to their body weight.
Some dust inhalation symptoms may require immediate medical care. Severe shortness of breath that does not improve with rest, chest pain, a feeling of choking, or a sudden worsening of respiratory status requires urgent examination.
Heart patients who feel pain radiating to the shoulders, neck, jaw, or back should seek urgent medical care, especially if the pain is accompanied by nausea, cold sweats, or extreme weakness. Symptoms such as sudden confusion, difficulty speaking, or weakness on one side of the body could indicate the occurrence of a stroke and require immediate treatment.
Patients with asthma or chronic lung disease who struggle with severe wheezing that does not respond to normal treatment, or who use accessory muscles in the chest to breathe, should also seek treatment.

China’s disappearing elite: The high-stakes gamble behind Xi’s crackdown - analysis
Unknown

In the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, the choreography is usually flawless. The red flags are perfectly aligned, and the applause is synchronous.
The goal of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and President Xi Jinping, who has ruled the country since 2012, is to project an image of unbreakable unity and inevitable rise.
However, in recent years the carefully curated image of stability has been shattered by a reality that looks more like a high-stakes thriller than a bureaucratic procession. The dominant feature of Beijing’s political landscape is no longer the applause but the empty seats.
From the unceremonious removal of a former president from his chair in front of TV cameras to the vanishing of foreign and defense ministers and the purging of top generals, China is undergoing a political earthquake that has left Western intelligence agencies and geopolitical analysts scrambling for answers. Is this a sign of a paranoid dictator losing his grip, or a supremely confident leader fine-tuning his machine for a conflict that will reshape the world order?
The tremors began publicly in October 2022, during the closing ceremony of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party. In a scene that shocked the world, former Chinese leader Hu Jintao was physically led out of the hall while seated next to Xi Jinping.
“An unceremonious departure for a former Chinese leader,” Zi Yang, a senior research fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, tells the Magazine. “Hu was basically asked to leave. It seems like Hu had no idea what was going on. To see a former leader carried out like that was, of course, quite shocking to many observers.” It was a visual declaration: The old guard was gone. This was Xi’s party now.
But what followed was even more bizarre. One morning in July 2023, Qin Gang, the foreign minister, simply evaporated – he did not arrive at an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit. “Health reasons” was the official explanation given by the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
A rising star in the CCP and former ambassador to the United States, Qin “had been a favorite of Xi Jinping. It’s said that Xi Jinping actually liked to drink on his airplane with Qin Gang, that they were very good friends,” explains Prof. Dennis Wilder of Georgetown University, a former senior director for East Asia at the National Security Council.
'Regarding your question, I have no information to provide'
When asked about Qin’s whereabouts, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Mao Ning, offered a response that has become a hallmark of the current era: “Regarding your question, I have no information to provide.” Weeks later, Qin was stripped of his title. Rumors swirled.
“What seems to have happened in this case is that Qin Gang began an illicit relationship with a Chinese news reporter,” Wilder suggests, noting reports that the affair may have resulted in a child.
Qin was not alone. Liu Jianchao, the man responsible for the party’s international liaison work, also vanished from the public eye that same year. The pattern was clear: Proximity to the leader offered no protection.
If the diplomatic purges were mysterious, the upheaval in the People’s Liberation Army was alarming. The very men tasked with modernizing China’s military and preparing it for a possible invasion of Taiwan are being removed at a staggering rate.
“Nowhere in Chinese military history – except perhaps under chairman Mao – have we seen anything as unprecedented as this purge,” notes Wilder.
The purge has reached the very apex of the military hierarchy. Gen. Zhang Youxia, the vice chairman of the Central Military Commission and effectively the second-most powerful man in the military, came under scrutiny and was removed from his post last month.
“Resolutely investigating and dealing with Zhang Youxia is a major achievement in the party and military’s struggle against corruption,” stated Jiang Bin, a spokesman for China’s Ministry of National Defense, using the party’s preferred euphemism for political removal.
“They didn’t really use the word ‘purge’; they used the phrase ‘under investigation.’ But that’s basically the first step of being purged. Usually, nobody is found innocent through these investigations,” says Zi Yang.
The chaos has been particularly acute in the Defense Ministry. Li Shangfu, who became the defense minister with the shortest tenure in Chinese history, was ousted amid corruption allegations. His successor, navy veteran Dong Jun, has reportedly faced similar scrutiny.
Brig. Gen. (res.) Assaf Orion, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies and director of the Diane & Guilford Glazer Israel-China Policy Center, views this as a systemic cleansing of the officer corps.
“We are talking here about a cleaning out – or elimination – of the entire group... the Chinese military top brass, who were all appointments from Xi Jinping’s era,” Orion explains.
According to Orion, the official line always circles back to “corruption, disciplinary violations, and violations of party laws,” but the subtext is power dynamics. The accused are often charged with creating “cliques or influence networks” that can be viewed as a threat to Xi’s rule.
The Wall Street Journal has reported even more damaging allegations, suggesting that some generals, including Zhang Youxia, were suspected of leaking secrets related to China’s nuclear program to the United States.
While Wilder believes these leaks might be a “cover for what’s really happening” – a raw political struggle – the implication is stark: Xi feels he cannot trust the men who control his nuclear arsenal.
“There seems to be quite a lot of infighting among the elites,” says Zi Yang. “And Xi seems like he does not trust anyone at that level.”
WHY IS Xi Jinping dismantling the very leadership structure he spent a decade building? The conventional wisdom suggests a leader gripped by paranoia, seeing shadows of treason in every corner.
However, Ian Johnson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and renowned China scholar, offers a counterintuitive perspective. In an interview, Johnson argued that these moves might stem not from fear but from hubris.
“I think he is fundamentally unsure about the people he’s surrounded himself with,” Johnson says. “He is probably doing this out of not so much paranoia but perhaps extreme self-confidence.”
According to Johnson, Xi feels he has such absolute control that he can afford to treat the military leadership as interchangeable parts.
“He feels that he can get exactly the people he wants running the military. It might be like fine-tuning the leadership,” Johnson explains.
While it is easy to “construct a scenario where he’s paranoid, schizophrenic,” Johnson contends that Xi is acting out of a belief that he has “complete control.”
This view contrasts with the assessment of other analysts who see the purges as a sign of fragility. “When some of these generals start building up their own factions by promoting their own underlings, perhaps that alarms Xi,” Zi Yang says. “Xi is very afraid of his subordinates getting too powerful.”
Orion highlights the scale of the campaign: “In total, during his years in office, about 200,000 people were purged. This shows that even those closest to him cannot be trusted, and therefore, he purges them.” For the international community – and particularly for US allies like Israel, which closely monitor global stability – the burning question is how this affects a potential invasion of Taiwan.
In Taiwan, senior officials say that 2027 is a year to watch. This aligns with US intelligence assessments that Xi has ordered the military to be ready for action by that date. But does a purged military fight better?
A purged command structure is a compliant one. However, Orion warns of the operational costs: “When a military is undergoing a turnover of senior officers, this is not the height of stability needed to launch an operation with such high risks.”
Essentially, Xi may be buying political loyalty at the cost of military competence.
Johnson, however, pushes back against the idea that the purges signal an imminent war. He remains skeptical about the “invasion next year” theories derived from reading political tea leaves.
“I still assume that the leadership in Beijing is rational,” Johnson argues. “And if I assume that they’re rational, then it would not make sense to invade right away because time is on Beijing’s side militarily.”
Johnson points out that while the United States is distracted by conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, China is methodically building aircraft carriers and expanding its arsenal. He also notes that the domestic political situation in Taiwan – where the pro-independence leadership is unpopular – may eventually break in Beijing’s favor without a single shot being fired.
“It makes sense to wait and see how that plays out, meanwhile building up the military and not pushing a hasty invasion,” Johnson concludes. “I don’t think the purges are directly related to some sort of impending military adventure.”
WHETHER DRIVEN by paranoia or confidence, Xi Jinping has fundamentally altered the DNA of the Chinese Communist Party. By abolishing term limits and refusing to groom a successor, he has centralized power to a degree not seen since Mao Zedong.
“I think it’s all about President Xi’s desire to remain leader for life in China,” says Wilder. “He has given no indication of who a successor might be because he doesn’t want one. A successor would mean he becomes a lame duck.”
This isolation creates a paradox. The system appears stable because there are no rivals. “He doesn’t have any clear heir apparent, and he doesn’t have any real rivals inside the system,” Johnson observes.
But this superficial stability masks a deep, existential risk for the regime.
“If one day he dies – as all people do – or becomes incapacitated, there will be no clear person to succeed him,” Johnson warns. “And I think this is the problem facing China in the next five years or so.”
For now, the empty seats in the Great Hall of the People serve as a silent warning to the Chinese elite. The applause may still be loud, but everyone knows that in Xi Jinping’s China, the distance between the inner circle and a prison cell has never been shorter.
In the opaque world of Beijing politics, the only certainty is that the next purge is only a matter of time.

The Ethiopian Media Authority has declined to renew the accreditation for three Addis Ababa-based journalists from Reuters, the news agency said.
The EMA also revoked the news agency's accreditation to cover the 39th African Union summit, which was taking place in the Ethiopian capital on February 14-15.
"Reuters is reviewing the matter and will continue to cover Ethiopia in an independent, impartial, and reliable way in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles," Reuters said in a statement.
Ethiopia gets involved in Sudanese Civil War
The move comes days after the news agency published an investigative report that said Ethiopia was hosting a secret camp to train thousands of fighters for the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group in neighboring Sudan. Ethiopia has not publicly commented on the story.
The camp constitutes the first direct evidence of Ethiopia’s involvement in Sudan’s civil war, marking a potentially dangerous development that provides the RSF a substantial supply of fresh soldiers as fighting escalates in Sudan’s south.
Eight sources, including a senior Ethiopian government official, said the United Arab Emirates financed the camp’s construction and provided military trainers and logistical support to the site, a view also shared in an internal note by Ethiopia’s security services and in a diplomatic cable, reviewed by Reuters.
The news agency could not independently verify the UAE's involvement in the project or the camp's purpose. In response to a request for comment, the UAE foreign ministry said it was not a party to the conflict or “in any way” involved in the hostilities.
While the EMA has informally indicated that the February 10 Reuters story prompted its decision, it has not made an official statement.
The EMA could not immediately be reached for comment.

A group of armed Gazans emerged from the ruins of a building on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line on Saturday, and at least two were subsequently killed, the IDF reported on Saturday evening.
The group, spotted near an IDF post in Beit Hanoun, appeared to have entered the territory in the eastern section of the Strip via subterranean tunnels, the IDF stated.
Beit Hanoun is approximately two kilometers from the Yellow Line. The IDF did not clarify whether the Gazans entered the tunnels on the Gazan side of the line or whether they crossed the line and then used the tunnels to draw closer to the IDF post.
Israeli forces continued to patrol the area in case any further armed threats made themselves known, the IDF report added.
The IDF characterized the incident as a "blatant violation of the ceasefire agreement."
In addition, IDF also stated it has begun striking Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon on Saturday night, in response to "Hezbollah’s repeated violations of the ceasefire agreement."
Smuggling attempt
IDF observation troops and the Aerial Control Center intercepted a drone attempting to smuggle three M-16 rifles into Israel on Friday, the military announced on Saturday.
The drone, which was identified as entering Israeli territory from the west, was located by troops and discovered to be carrying rifles.
The weapons were transferred to security forces for processing, the IDF stated.
IDF Chief of Staff conducts situational assessment
Also on Friday, IDF Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Eyal Zamir visited IDF troops stationed in Rafah during a situational assessment in the Gaza Strip.
Zamir spoke to soldiers, instructing the troops to keep removing threats present in the area and emphasizing the importance of destroying Hamas’s underground terror tunnel infrastructure.
“The IDF is deployed along a security border – the Yellow Line – overseeing the crossings to the Gaza Strip, and is precisely dis"antling terro" infrastructure in the area,” Zamir said. “We are prepared to transition from a defensive posture to an offensive one. For any violation, we w"ll respond and degrade their capabilities.”
Zamir added that the IDF refuses to relinquish the or"ginal objectives of the Israel-Hamas War, “the full demilitarization of t"e"Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas.”
“We are operating in accordance with the directive of the political echelon, while maintaining military plans for their defeat, and we stand ready to act defensively as required. We will continue strengthening the defen"e of the communities of the western Negev,” he"affirmed.
Zamir stated tha" there will b" “no immunity for terrorism,” adding that “what applies to terrorists in Gaza applies"to the terrorists "n other arenas as well,” and that the IDF “will continue to remain focused and remove threats, w"th determination and a proactive approach.”

The United States struck over 30 Islamic State targets in Syria over the past two weeks, including infrastructure and weapons storage sites, US Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Saturday.
According to CENTCOM, American forces hit targets in 10 strikes using precision munitions delivered by fixed-wing, rotary-wing, and uncrewed aircraft.
The strikes are a part of the larger Operation Hawkeye Strike, which was launched on December 13, 2025, in response to attacks on US forces in Syria’s Palmyra, which resulted in the death of two US service members.
“More than 50 ISIS terrorists have been killed or captured and over 100 ISIS infrastructure targets have been struck with hundreds of precision munitions during two months of targeted operations,” the CENTCOM statement said.
It noted that the strikes came after an earlier round of five attacks from January 27 to February 2 on an ISIS communication facility, logistics node, and weapons storage sites.

Swear words fly as cheating allegations made in curling at Winter Olympics
Two of curling’s best men’s teams, Sweden and Canada, involved in fiery and controversial match at Winter Olympics.
The often sedate world of curling has gotten heated at the Winter Olympics as cheating allegations and audible swear words overshadowed a feisty match between two of the best men’s teams.
Canada’s Marc Kennedy got offended when he was accused by Swedish rival Oskar Eriksson of “double-touching” – essentially, touching the rock again after initially releasing it down the sheet of ice – during Canada’s 8-6 win in round-robin play late on Friday.

Kennedy repeatedly used expletives to deny he broke any rules. The match came to a brief standstill as fingers were pointed and Kennedy argued with members of the Swedish team across the ice.
“I don’t like being accused of cheating after 25 years on tour and four Olympic Games,” the 44-year-old Kennedy said.
“So,” he added, “I told him where to stick it. Because we’re the wrong team to do that to.”
Eriksson said he simply wanted everyone to “play by the same rules”.
“We want a game that is as sportsmanlike, honest and clean as possible,” he said, “so we call it out as soon as I see that the Canadian No 2 is, in my eyes, there poking the stone.”
The rules state that a stone must be delivered using the handle that sits on top of the rock and that it must be released from the hand before it reaches the hog line. At the Olympics, that is the thick green line at each end.
Replays appeared to show Kennedy releasing the stone using the handle, then touching it again with an outstretched finger as it approached the hog line.
In the early ends of the match, Sweden notified the officials of their complaints. An official then remained at the hog line to monitor Canada’s curlers, and no action was taken. Curling does not use video replays.
World Curling did not take any action against either team.

European Parliament President Roberta Metsola called Russia’s plans regarding the elections in Ukraine during the war cynical.
"We want to send a message to Russia and the Putin administration, as well as to the cynicism with which we discuss elections in Ukraine. When have there been fair elections in Russia? When can we say that if bombs are falling on cities, people without electricity cannot be forced to vote?" she said during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
Metsola added that "this is a cynical plan" and "we absolutely must not allow this."

Zelensky: The longer the war continues, the more dangerous Putin's evolution becomes
He made the remarks during a speech at the Munich Security Conference, Ukrinform reports.
Zelensky said that the war reveals forms of evil that nobody anticipated, and the longer it continues, the more resources the aggressor receives. The consequences become more dangerous, the evolution of the weapons and the war itself becomes more dangerous, and so does the evolution of Putin, he said.
He added that Putin has already become a "slave to war" and cannot imagine life without it.
According to Zelensky, right now, Putin's attention is on Ukraine, and no one in Ukraine believes he will ever release the Ukrainian nation. But he will not release other European nations either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war. He may see himself as a tsar, but in reality, he is a "slave to war," Zelensky said.
The president noted that the Russian leader no longer lives a normal life. Putin cannot imagine life without power or after power and ordinary things do not interest him, Zelensky said. Putin consults more with Peter I and Empress Catherine II about territorial gains than with any living person, Zelensky added.
The 62nd Munich Security Conference began on February 13, serving as a leading global forum to discuss major international security challenges.
About 1,000 participants from nearly 120 countries are attending the three-day event, including almost 60 heads of state and government, 56 foreign ministers, over 30 defense ministers, and leaders of more than 40 international organizations.

IMF simplifies conditions for opening new program for Ukraine: VAT threshold for sole proprietors raised to UAH 4 mln – PM

IMF simplifies conditions for opening new program for Ukraine: VAT threshold for sole proprietors raised to UAH 4 mln – PM
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission has simplified the agreements reached in November to open a new Extended Fund Facility (EFF) for Ukraine, including revising the preliminary measures and structural benchmarks, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko announced.
"The Ukrainian program will be reviewed at the next meeting of the IMF Board of Directors," she told reporters, noting that the revision of the agreements was influenced, among other things, by consultations directly with the Fund’s Managing Director, Kristalina Georgieva, who visited Kyiv in January during the widespread shelling of Ukrainian energy infrastructure.
According to Svyrydenko, the most sensitive issues of the IMF program are the taxation of sole proprietors.
"The details are important here. Working with the IMF, we agreed to raise the threshold (annual income) for VAT introduction for sole proprietors to UAH 4 million (equivalent to approximately EUR 85,000) – this is the maximum VAT level on goods in Europe. Therefore, these changes will not affect two-thirds of all sole proprietors," the head of government noted.
She clarified that the question of when exactly the regulation will come into effect is the subject of our further work.
"There’s a lot of discussion about how this will be implemented. We’re working with parliamentarians and will likely adopt these measures as part of the consolidated tax bill. It will also address issues related to digital platforms, parcels, and the retention of military tax after martial law ends, which are well received by businesses," Svyrydenko said.
The Prime Minister recalled that Ukraine’s cooperation program with the IMF is the anchor for all international financial support, in particular for receiving a EUR 90 billion loan from the European Union.
As reported, a four-year EFF program with the IMF totaling $15.6 billion has been in effect since March 2023, with the next, 9th tranche, amounting to SDR1.117 billion ($1.6 billion at the current exchange rate), scheduled for December 2025.
Initially, the current program envisaged total external financing for Ukraine with the participation of international partners of $115 billion in the base case and $140 billion in the negative case, but as the war dragged on, these figures were increased to $153 billion and $165 billion, respectively.
During the IMF mission to Kyiv from September 3 to September 10, 2025, Svyrydenko, along with the governor of the National Bank of Ukraine and the Minister of Finance, formally requested a new program, tentatively for 2026–2029. The need to consider a new program stems from the fact that the war unleashed by Russia is protracted, while the current EFF program is scheduled to end by March 2027.
At the end of November 2025, Ukraine and the Fund reached a staff-level agreement (SLA) on a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program worth approximately $8.1 billion.

Merz Pours Cold water on Macron’s Push for Putin Talks

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz distanced himself on Friday from calls by French President Emmanuel Macron to open up direct talks with Moscow to end the Russian war in Ukraine.
Asked at the opening of the annual Munich Security Conference about efforts to bring Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table, Merz said Russia is “not yet willing to talk seriously.”

“If it makes sense to talk, we are ready to talk, but [the Russians] have to concede that they are really willing to talk about a ceasefire and then about a peace plan,” Merz said.
Macron suggested last year that Europe should reestablish direct communication with Putin if the US makes no progress in peace talks. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni later backed Macron’s push. Macron said in January that he would set up a phone call with Putin – something that has yet to take place.
On Thursday, Macron said such a phone call would not take place in the immediate future.
“We Europeans, we also have things to discuss, that’s why we want to be around the [negotiating] table,” he said, name-checking Ukraine’s economic recovery and Europe’s future security architecture.
Macron dispatched his diplomatic adviser to the Kremlin this month, prompting a mocking response from Russia.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy predicted this week that a separate European track of talks with Russia would only lead to Moscow humiliating the Europeans.
Trump’s Trading of Ukraine
Without naming Viktor Orbán, Merz referred to a trip Hungarian Prime Minister made to Moscow in 2024 to hold talks with Putin.
“He had no mandate. He went there. He achieved nothing,” Merz said.

Hong Kong users warned of heavier mega bridge traffic as Zhuhai link suspended
A temporary link bridge in Zhuhai will be closed for repairs from Sunday until further notice
Transport authorities have warned of heavier traffic on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge from Sunday because of the combined effect of a key link’s suspension in Zhuhai and increased travel over Lunar New Year.
A temporary link between the mega bridge’s Zhuhai Port and Qinglu South Road will be closed for repairs from Sunday until further notice, with Hong Kong’s Transport Department urging users to plan ahead and use public transport as far as possible.
Drivers could access the Zhuhai Port via the G94 Pearl River Delta Ring Expressway, a department spokesman said.
According to Zhuhai authorities, the temporary link bridge was designed to serve until a municipal bridge connecting the port and Qinglu South Road was completed by the end of 2027. However, heavy use has taken its toll earlier than expected and a safety hazard was found recently.
The closure could affect traffic on neighbouring roads because of the large number of border-crossing vehicles anticipated during mainland China’s Lunar New Year holiday between Sunday and February 23.

British PM Starmer calls for stronger ‘hard power’ and European defence ties
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
LONDON - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer stressed the need to bolster Britain’s “hard power” and military readiness, calling at the Munich security forum for stronger defence integration within the continent to cut NATO’s overreliance on the US.
He also hinted at further alignment with the European Union’s single market – which allows goods, services, capital and people to move freely across member states – and deeper economic integration, six years after Britain exited the EU.
“We are not at a crossroads today. The road ahead is straight and it is clear we must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age,” Mr Starmer said on Feb 14.
“We must be able to deter aggression, and yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight.”
His remarks come against the backdrop of strains in the NATO alliance due to US President Donald Trump’s stated desire to acquire Greenland
Mr Starmer said the US is an indispensable ally that has made an unparalleled contribution to Europe’s security, but a more European NATO would help reduce the continent’s overdependence on Washington.
“I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal, but answers the call for more burden-sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well.”
He emphasised that the new normal was for Europe to take primary responsibility for its own defence, as outlined in the Trump administration's national security strategy, urging “a step change” in collaboration.
Mr Starmer called as well for a new approach to defence procurement to avoid unnecessary duplication in Europe’s defence industrial base, warning that the current fragmentation had left the continent a “sleeping giant”.
Britain, he added, will deploy its carrier strike group to the North Atlantic and the Arctic in 2025, operating alongside US, Canadian and other NATO allies in a show of Euro-Atlantic security commitment.
Further alignment with EU single market
The Labour Party leader has sought to reset ties with the EU since coming to office in 2024, following years of Conservative governments whose Brexit negotiations sometimes strained relations with Brussels.
He has also taken a leading role in coordinating European support for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion.
“The United Kingdom is ready. We see the imperative. We see the urgency. We want to work together to lead a generational shift in defence industrial cooperation. Now this includes looking again at closer economic alignment,” Mr Starmer said.
“Deeper economic integration is in all of our interests. So we must look at where we could move closer to the single market in other sectors as well, where that would work for both sides.”
While talks for Britain to join the EU’s SAFE defence fund broke down in 2025, Mr Starmer has said that he is open to joining a new version of SAFE.
Mr Starmer declared that “we are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more”, to applause from the room, before adding that to turn inward would surrender control of Britain's security.
“There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain,” he said. REUTERS

'All records broken' as Storm Nils leaves swaths of southwest France under water
France's flood alert agency has been working round the clock over the past month amid relentless rain and a series of winter storms, the agency's chief said Saturday, as large swaths of the southwest remained under water following the passage of Storm Nils.

The flood alert system in France has been working at a record pace as relentless rain over the past month has saturated soils, the head of the agency told AFP on Saturday.
"For 30 days we have been in continuous orange or red alert somewhere on the national territory," Lucie Chadourne-Facon, director of Vigicrues, told AFP, referring to the two highest alert levels.
"That is 81 departments in alert simultaneously for 154 rivers, so we have exceeded all our records," she said.
WatchFloods and high winds hit France as Storm Nils sweeps in
Chadourne-Facon said soil moisture had also reached a record since data collection began in 1959.
"We are facing a generalised flood situation across the entire country because all the soils are saturated everywhere" and have "lost their infiltration capacity", she said.
"As a result, today rivers are extremely sensitive to the slightest precipitation, the slightest rainfall that hits the country, and they react very quickly," she added.

Hundreds of agents search for Nancy Guthrie as her case spotlights other families left behind

Hundreds of agents search for Nancy Guthrie as her case spotlights other families left behind
Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance highlights how differently police respond when a case draws national attention
- Bookmark
As hundreds of federal and local agents scoured the Arizona desert and chased down potential leads in the nearly two weeks since Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her affluent neighborhood, families of other missing people are reminded how elusive answers can be.
On the one hand, families who spoke to The Associated Press share in the deep pain that Nancy Guthrie's children, including the well-known “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie, have expressed publicly.
On the other, people like Tonya Miller — whose own mother disappeared under suspicious circumstances in Missouri in 2019 — say they feel frustrated as they watch seemingly endless resources flood into the search for Guthrie.
“Families like ours that have just your normal missing people, they have to fight to get any help,” Miller, 44, said.
Miller's mother, Betty Miller, is one of the thousands of people who are listed as abducted each year, according to federal statistics. In most cases, families like Tonya Miller's say it's a full-time job advocating for a fair and thorough investigation.
Guthrie investigation flooded with resources
The country has been engrossed by the apparent kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, after authorities said they believe she was taken against her will. People in her neighborhood have tied yellow ribbons to tree to express their support.
Multiple news outlets have reported receiving ransom notes, and the Guthrie family has expressed a willingness to pay — although it’s not known whether ransom notes demanding money with deadlines that have already passed were authentic.
In the meantime, several hundred detectives and agents are now assigned to Nancy Guthrie's investigation, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said.
FBI spokesperson Connor Hagan declined to say how many of those agents were federal law enforcement, and how many were already assigned in Arizona. He also didn't clarify how the federal agency prioritizes different missing persons cases.
However, he said agents from the Critical Incident Response Group, technical experts and intelligence analysts are working to bring Guthrie home. There is also a 24-hour command post where dozens of agents parse through the 13,000 tips that have flooded in from the public, among other responsibilities, according to a post the agency made.
Abductions are rare
The vast majority of people who are reported missing are believed to be runaways — not kidnapped or abducted.
Throughout all of 2024, the latest year that National Crime Information Center published the data, over 530,000 missing person records were entered. By the end of the year, just over 90,000 cases remained unresolved on that list — some going back decades.
Roughly 95% of the hundreds of thousands of cases filed in 2024 were believed to be runaways and only 1% were listed as abducted.
Often, the abductor is a parent who doesn't have legal guardianship over a child, the report said. It's even more rare for someone to be abducted by a stranger.
Disproportionately Black and Indigenous people
The FBI names five kidnapped or missing people, including Nancy Guthrie, from Arizona on its online database of 125 missing or kidnapped people. All five from Arizona are listed as Native American or otherwise disappeared from tribal communities, except for Guthrie.
That racial trend holds true for the rest of the country, too.
A disproportionate number of Black and Indigenous people were among the abducted in 2024, according to the National Crime Information Center report. Roughly a third of the 533,936 missing people listed as abducted in 2024 were Black, even though the U.S. Census reports only 13% of the U.S. population as Black. Similarly, almost 3% of the missing people listed as abducted were Indigenous, compared to the 1.4% of people who are Indigenous in the U.S. writ large.
“Every person deserves to be safe, and when someone is missing, there should be an immediate, coordinated, and effective response," Lucy Simpson, the chief executive officer for the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center said. “For many Native women, longstanding gaps in resources, coordination, and systemic support for Tribal Nations have made prevention and response more difficult.”
No answers for families
Experts have said that sometimes the attention on high-profile cases can be a major obstacle to law enforcement operations. But Savannah Guthrie's celebrity status has also garnered extensive resources from the federal and local government — including a $100,000 FBI reward for accurate information about her whereabouts or that could lead to an arrest and conviction of whoever took her.
That's in stark contrast, Miller said, to the dearth of help she's received in Sullivan, Missouri, where she's had to use her own time and money to search for her mom, who was last seen in her apartment in the roughly 7,000 person town. A box of Betty Miller’s prescribed fentanyl patches were missing from the apartment and her prescription eye glasses were left on an armchair, Tonya Miller said. There was a massive scratch on her mom's front door that wasn't there before.
The Sullivan Police Department didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday.
Despite those suspicious circumstances, local police didn’t treat her mother’s apartment like a crime scene, Tonya Miller said. She had to beg them to take fingerprints and often had to prod them to follow up on tips filed by the public. In the weeks that followed, Tonya Miller organized search parties, printed out fliers and held fundraisers to scrape together a $20,000 reward for her mother.
Tonya Miller said it has become harder as the years go by to know how to help find her mom. She's written letters to elected officials at all levels of government, including President Donald Trump.
“I feel so helpless,” Miller said, “because you just don’t know what to do anymore.”

All of Ukraine’s power plants have been damaged by Russian attacks, but the country’s energy system continues to function thanks to the efforts of energy workers, physical protection of facilities and support from air defence partners, President Volodymyr Zelensky said.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Zelensky said that despite extensive destruction to energy infrastructure, Ukraine is still generating electricity.

“We continue to produce electricity thanks to our people. And we have preserved our system thanks to the physical protection of our facilities and everyone who helps us with air defence,” he said.
Zelensky warned that one of the most critical moments comes when air defence units are forced to expend all available missiles to repel massive Russian attacks, while resupply is delayed despite intelligence warnings of further strikes.
He noted that during one of the most recent large-scale attacks, Ukraine used air defence missiles that had arrived only days earlier, underscoring the constant and urgent need for additional air defence supplies.
An overnight Russian drone strike on Odesa set a residential building on fire and killed a woman inside, the governor of the southern Ukrainian region said on Saturday morning.
Russian forces attacked the area with strike drones, hitting a one-story private home in the city. The impact damaged the roof and sparked a fire, which emergency crews quickly extinguished. During search and rescue operations, responders later discovered the body of a woman beneath the rubble.
Merz Pours Cold water on Macron’s Push for Putin Talks
Odesa Regional Military Administration head Oleh Kiper confirmed the fatality, saying the victim was killed as a result of the drone strike. Odesa Military Administration chief Serhii Lysak added that the woman was born in 1950 and was found trapped under the debris of the destroyed house.
The latest deadly attacks come as US and European leaders, diplomats and defence chiefs gather for a high-powered summit in Munich, with how to end the war in Ukraine top of mind.

Syria foreign minister, ICC chief discuss holding Assad accountable in first meeting
Asaad al-Shaibani Shaibani meets Tomoko Akane on sidelines of Munich Security Conference
DAMASCUS
Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani met on Saturday International Criminal Court President Tomoko Akane to discuss the issue of holding ousted leader Bashar al-Assad and figures of his erstwhile regime accountable, in the “first meeting of its kind” between the two sides.
AlIkhbaria Syria TV, quoted an unnamed Foreign Ministry source as saying that al-Shaibani held a meeting with the ICC president on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
The source said the meeting discussed “files related to transitional justice and ways to hold those responsible for crimes to account, foremost among them the criminal Bashar al-Assad and a number of figures of the defunct regime.”
The source added that the meeting “is the first of its kind,” without providing further details.
In late September, Damascus investigative judge Tawfiq al-Ali announced the issuance of an in-absentia arrest warrant against Assad, as a prelude to pursuing the case internationally through Interpol.
Assad, who ruled Syria for nearly 25 years, fled to Russia in late 2024, ending the Baath Party’s decades-long grip on power that began in 1963. A new transitional administration led by President Ahmad al-Sharaa was formed in January 2025.

Artists for Palestine sends letter backing UN’s anti-Israel rapporteur Albanese
Mark Ruffalo, Javier Bardem among those supporting figure with history of antisemitic statements who is facing calls from EU governments to quit over comments calling Israel ‘the common enemy’
Over a hundred figures from the world of entertainment signed an open letter Saturday in support of UN Palestinian Palestinian territories rapporteur Francesca Albanese who faces mounting calls to resign over comments about Israel and the war in Gaza.
France, Italy and Germany, along with several other European nations, have called for Albanese — who has been repeatedly accused of antisemitism and extremist rhetoric toward Israel — to step down over remarks last weekend cited a “common enemy” that enabled Israel’s “genocide” in Gaza — a charge Israel has strongly rejected.
Pro-Israel activists accused Albanese of referring to Israel as the “common enemy,” which she denied.
In a letter organized by the Artists for Palestine group and shared with AFP, over a 100 cultural figures backed her, including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel-winning author Annie Ernaux and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories “offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist,” the letter says.
“There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means,” it concludes.
Published in French on the Artists for Palestine website, it also reproduces the full remarks by Albanese, who was speaking via videoconference at a forum last Saturday organized by the Al Jazeera TV network.
Other celebrities to offer support for her include actresses Rosa Salazar and Asia Argento, Oscar-nominated film directors Yorgos Lanthimos and Kaouther Ben Hania, Latin music star Residente, and photographer Nan Goldin.
A group of French MPs sent a letter to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Tuesday denouncing Albanese’s remarks as “antisemitic.”
Barrot called for her to step down a day later, saying that France “unreservedly condemns the outrageous and reprehensible remarks.”
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul on Thursday said her position was “untenable.” Austria and Italy, Albanese’s home country, also said her comments showed she was unsuitable for her post.
Albanese is one of the most outspoken critics of Israel’s more-than-two-year war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip that was launched following the October, 7, 2023, Hamas massacre.
She has called it “the shame of our time” and says she always asks prime ministers, presidents and foreign ministers the same question: “How do you sleep? When will you act?”
Albanese has a long history of making statements accused of being antisemitic, anti-Israel and pro-Hamas.
On October 11, 2023, four days after the attack, Albanese said she doubted reports of rape and sexual violence. Instead, she said the US and Israel were spreading these claims to escalate tensions. She said Israel had no right to self-defense immediately after the Hamas invasion of Israel; said Israelis should be “considered suspect” and investigated when they are abroad; said other countries should halt pharmaceutical exports to Israel; characterized Israel as a “genocidal society”; and positioned the Jewish state as an impediment to global justice.
She told a Harvard University gathering that when Hamas refers to killing Jews (Yahudi), they do not actually mean Jews.
She has called accusations that UNRWA employees participated in the October 7 massacre “fallacious allegations,” though there has been clear evidence supporting it.
Last November, she posted a cartoon denouncing Israel, depicting what appeared to be a global spiderweb, its strands draped with cash and weapons, in an image that experts said echoed age-old antisemitic tropes.
The Italian-born legal expert, who began her unpaid role in 2022, was targeted with sanctions by the Trump administration in July last year over what it called her “unabashed antisemitism” and “biased and malicious” work.
UN special rapporteurs like Albanese are independent experts who are appointed by the UN rights council, but do not speak on behalf of the United Nations.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres distanced himself from Albanese on Thursday when his spokesman said, “We don’t agree with much of what she says.”
“We wouldn’t use the language that she’s using in describing the situation,” his spokesman Stephane Dujarric added.

Trump’s Trading of Ukraine

President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that US-Russian economic talks are underway, addressing issues of Ukrainian territory and security. The Ukrainian intelligence service has learned of a package of economic agreements between the US and Russia, worth as much as $12 billion. This package already has a name in Kyiv: the “Dmitriev package.”
There is nothing accidental about that name. It clearly indicates the political and economic circles from which such an idea originates. It is not a peace package; it is a trade package – one in which Ukraine once again risks becoming a commodity.
JOIN US ON TELEGRAM
Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
Zelensky was clear: Ukraine will not accept any arrangement that violates its constitution, including any recognition of Crimea as Russian territory. That statement should not be news; it ought to be an axiom. Yet, in today’s world, this principle no longer seems to hold true.
What makes this alleged package particularly dangerous is not only its financial scale. The logic behind it is dangerous – a logic in which the war does not end with justice but with a “deal.” A logic in which aggression is not punished but monetized. A logic in which the territory of a sovereign state is treated as an item on a balance sheet.
This is the essence of Trump’s transactional model of politics. The world is not divided into right and wrong or good and bad, but into profitable and unprofitable. Alliances are based not on values but on contracts. Sacrifices are acceptable if they “create space for agreement.”
Merz Pours Cold water on Macron’s Push for Putin Talks
According to this logic, Ukraine is not a country defending itself against aggression; it is “a problem to be solved.” And it is solved by turning part of its sovereignty into a ticket for a major deal with Moscow.
The moment “grand deals” are mentioned, Crimea becomes a reference point for whether Ukraine is regarded as a subject or as an object. Recognizing Crimea as Russian would not only violate the Ukrainian Constitution; it would also cancel the entire international order established after 1945.
If Crimea can be “legalized” after its annexation, then no border in Europe can be considered permanent. If aggression is rewarded, it will be repeated. If Ukraine is pressured to accept what was taken from it by force, a message is sent to all revisionist regimes that violence is a rational investment. That is not peace; it is an invitation to the next war.
The role of European countries in this situation is particularly devastating – or, more precisely, their absence. While arrangements that directly affect European security are discussed behind closed doors, Europe remains silent or issues carefully worded statements that do not commit anyone to anything.
For years, support for Ukraine has been presented as a matter of European security. Today, key decisions are discussed without Ukraine’s participation and without European political influence. If Europe allows Trump to negotiate independently with Moscow over Ukraine’s fate, it is accepting its own political irrelevance – and the fact that it will bear the consequences of such agreements.
The risks of not involving Ukraine
At this point, the greatest danger is not the specific “Dmitriev package.” The biggest danger is the normalization of the idea that negotiating over Ukraine without its involvement is legitimate, that it is acceptable to treat its territory as a variable, and that it is legitimate to weigh its Constitution against other people’s economic interests. This is cynicism that no longer hides; it is presented as “realism.” But realism that ignores aggression is not realism – it is complicity in a crime.
While amounts and economic packages are discussed, in Ukraine, the dead are counted every day, civilians are buried, and people lose their homes. This is not a difference in perspective but a difference between reality and comfort. Ukraine does not ask for privileges in this situation; it asks for the application of the rules the West has repeated for decades: that borders are not changed by force and that the aggressor is not rewarded with agreements. Any deal that calls this into question, regardless of its economic attractiveness, represents a betrayal of those principles.
In this context, Zelensky’s statement carries significance beyond daily politics. It serves as a reminder that Ukraine, despite enormous pressure, still refuses to accept the logic of trading its own country and future. This is not stubbornness; it is a fundamental responsibility to the people who have borne the burden of a war they did not choose for more than three years. Ukraine cannot support agreements that violate its constitution, as that would mean abandoning the cause for which it is fighting.
At a time when economic arrangements with Russia are being considered in Washington, Ukrainian cities face daily attacks, people are freezing without heat, and Ukraine’s territory is discussed as part of someone else’s negotiation offer. This means the war is not being viewed in terms of who attacked and who is defending. It is a deliberate choice to turn war into a marketplace and sovereignty into an object of exchange.
This signals to Moscow that aggression does not close the door to negotiations but accelerates them. Instead of aggression resulting in political isolation, it becomes a way to return to the negotiating table. This alters the dynamics of the entire conflict: weapons no longer serve as obstacles but become arguments. In such circumstances, every Russian grenade gains additional political value. This is the reversal Russia has sought for years – not the admission of defeat, but the normalization of violence.
If Ukraine is negotiated over today as the subject of an agreement between Moscow and Washington, then tomorrow no one in Europe will have the right to invoke security guarantees. Russia will conclude that war pays off if it is fought long enough and brutally enough.

UK Carrier Strike Group to deploy to North Atlantic to keep UK safe

UK Carrier Strike Group to deploy to North Atlantic to keep UK safe
UK will bolster regional security by deploying a Carrier Strike Group to the North Atlantic and High North
-
UK to deploy Carrier Strike Group to the North Atlantic and High North in 2026 in a major boost for regional security.
-
Powerful show of force with Royal Navy warships, F-35 jets and helicopters to deter Russian aggression and protect vital undersea infrastructure.
-
Deployment will include major exercises alongside US, Canadian, and Northern European allies.
Britain will send its Carrier Strike Group back to sea in 2026 in a major show of force across the Euro-Atlantic and High North, reinforcing NATO’s deterrence at a time of rising Russian threats in the region.
Known as ‘Operation Firecrest’ and led by HMS Prince of Wales – the largest warship in the Royal Navy – the UK will deploy the strike group across the North Atlantic and Arctic. It will include world-class Royal Navy warships and RAF fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets to bolster defence and security.
It comes as Russia’s military activity in the North Atlantic continues to increase. Over the past two years, there has been a 30% increase in Russian navy vessels threatening UK waters.
The deployment will see the UK and US working side-by-side on Euro-Atlantic security around the North American East Coast, boosting the historic alliance between the two nations. The Carrier Strike Group will sail across the Atlantic to visit a US port, with US jets also expected to operate from the flight deck of HMS Prince of Wales.
The deployment will include activity under NATO’s Arctic Sentry mission, launched this week, strengthening the Alliance’s security in a region where melting sea ice is opening new routes and increasing threat from hostile state activity.
With growing concern over Russian operations in the Greenland-Iceland-UK gap and the increased risk to critical undersea cables and pipelines, the deployment will send a clear message that the UK will always defend its waters, protect critical infrastructure, and stand shoulder-to-shoulder with its Allies.
Defence Secretary John Healey MP said:
I’m proud that we’re stepping up UK leadership on High North and Atlantic security.
This deployment will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad.
Operation Firecrest will involve thousands of personnel from all three services of the Armed Forces, demonstrating Britain’s ability to project force wherever it is needed and operate seamlessly within NATO. The Carrier Strike Group will exercise alongside NATO’s Standing Naval Maritime Group 1, itself being led by the UK, with HMS Dragon acting as the command ship of the NATO maritime group throughout 2026.
Parts of the deployment will fall under NATO command, including close cooperation with operational headquarters Joint Force Command Norfolk, which is set to be under the command of a British officer for the first time.
The deployment will be carried out alongside key allies including the United States, Canada, and Joint Expeditionary Force nations, building on the UK’s growing defence cooperation in the High North and reaffirming the strength of the historic UK–US defence relationship.
This reinforces the UK’s commitment to High North security and builds on the Defence Secretary’s commitment to double the number of UK troops deployed to Norway, from 1,000 to 2,000.
It also reaffirms the Government’s commitment to stepping up on defence. The UK has committed to the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War – hitting 2.6% of GDP from 2027 – to ensure that Britain and our allies are safe.
The deployment follows the success of the UK’s 2025 Carrier Strike Group mission to the Indo-Pacific, which saw over 1,000 F-35 sorties and activity with over 30 nations, and resulted in the UK’s Carrier Strike Group being certified fully ‘mission ready’ and committed to NATO.

A Europe that spends much more on defense and is much less reliant on Washington for its security. But Donald Trump may not like what American pressure is creating.
Leader after leader from Europe took to the podium of the Munich Security Conference on Friday and talked about boosting military budgets and reframing the transatlantic alliance as a “NATO 3.0.”

ICU patients’ lives at risk in Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Hospital amid Israel’s war

ICU patients’ lives at risk in Gaza’s Al-Aqsa Hospital amid Israel’s war
The hospital may be forced in the coming hours to ration electricity so that certain wards can be prioritised.
Israel’s more than two-year genocidal war has decimated Gaza‘s health system, as medical personnel and doctors struggle to treat patients with limited and damaged equipment, with a “ceasefire” doing nothing to ease the peril and suffering the ill face.
According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, more than 1,700 healthcare workers – including doctors, nurses and paramedics – have been killed since Israel’s war began. The United Nations has accused Israel of deliberately targeting Gaza’s health facilities and killing medical personnel to destroy the besieged enclave’s healthcare system.

All medical facilities have been damaged or destroyed
Doctors at Al-Aqsa Hospital, in central Gaza, have been appealing for urgent intervention, as both of the medical facility’s main generators no longer function.
The situation is extremely dire, said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Gaza City.
“Generators are now seen as the heartbeat of every hospital here [in Gaza] … as they power ventilators, incubators, surgical theatres and dialysis machines.
“But now these lifelines are breaking down,” said Abu Azzoum, with the lives of many critically ill patients in the intensive care unit hanging in the balance.
The hospital lacks the fuel and essential spare parts needed to keep the generators going, Abu Azzoum added.
“Without them [the generators], the healthcare system could easily collapse.”
The hospital now only has “two small backup generators that medical teams describe to be completely unreliable to sustaining critical life-saving services and departments,” said Abu Azzoum. They may also shut down at any moment due to a lack of fuel and spare parts.
It is possible that in the coming hours the hospital will significantly ration electricity so that critical wards can be prioritised, he noted, adding: “This crisis will extend” if no spare parts or oil can be brought into Gaza.
Despite a United States-backed “ceasefire” in place since October, Israel continues to violate its truce agreement daily, with attacks and by failing to allow the free flow of agreed quantities of medical aid trucks and humanitarian assistance into Gaza.
Nearly 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since the October 10 ceasefire alone.
This has deepened what the Health Ministry has described as a critical and ongoing health emergency, with the majority of the enclave’s hospitals out of service, medication shortages and a desperate lack of equipment.
There is also a critical shortage of staff, as Israel continues to hold 95 Palestinian doctors and medical workers, including 80 from Gaza.
More than 72,000 Palestinians have been killed and 171,000 wounded in attacks in Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza since October 2023.

Zelenskyy and NATO chief warn Russia uses peace talks to pursue its aims
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte have expressed scepticism about Russia's current willingness to hold real talks and warned the West against misreading Moscow's intentions.
Source: Zelenskyy and Rutte speaking on a joint panel at the Munich Security Conference on 14 February, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Rutte said Russia's decision to change its lead negotiator in the trilateral talks shows that Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin is not seeking a genuine peace agreement.
"Is he [Putin] serious about all of this? And he is again sending this 'historian' to the talks in Geneva so he could again lecture the Ukrainians about how the [Kyivan] Rus [developed] from Sweden or whatever," Rutte said, referring to the appointment of Vladimir Medinsky to lead Russia's delegation for the next round of talks.
Zelenskyy said he is convinced that Russia wants to secure Ukraine's partition, but that this would not stop it from wanting to continue the war.
Quote from Zelenskyy: "It seems Putin hopes to repeat Munich – and not Munich 2007, when they only spoke about dividing Europe, but Munich 1938, when [the] previous Putin began dividing Europe in reality. It would be an illusion to believe that this war can now be reliably ended by dividing Ukraine, just as it was an illusion to believe that sacrificing Czechoslovakia would save Europe from a great war."
More details: Zelenskyy said Ukraine remains ready to continue with the negotiations and hopes Western pressure can force Russia towards peace.
Quote: "We have invested in this process, and we're in constant contact with Steve Witkoff, with Jared Kushner and with everyone President Trump appoints. And Ukraine wants the result of all these efforts to be real security and real peace. Not what came out of Geneva in 2021, not what the Russians hope for from this so-called 'spirit of Anchorage'."
Background:
- Zelenskyy said earlier that Ukraine is aware of the so-called Anchorage formula.
- Fresh talks on Ukraine are planned to be held in Geneva, and Russia plans to send Putin's aide Vladimir Medinsky to lead the Russian delegation. Rustem Umierov, head of the Ukrainian delegation in the trilateral talks, has named the delegates in Ukraine's team.
- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in Munich that Europe is willing to talk with Russia if there is any sense in talking.

Zelenskyy: It's mistake that Europe absent at negotiating table
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes it is a mistake that Europe is currently absent from the negotiating table.
"The Americans often return to the issue of concessions. And too often, these concessions are discussed in the context of Ukraine alone, not Russia. Europe is practically absent from the table. This is a big mistake, in my opinion," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
According to the president, the Russians often talk about "some kind of Anchorage spirit" during negotiations, and we "can only guess what they really mean."
The head of state added that the Ukrainians are trying to fully engage Europe in the negotiating process so that Europe’s interests and voice are taken into account.
"Ukraine will do everything, truly everything, to make these negotiations successful. We’ve invested in this process, and we’re in constant communication with Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and everyone else appointed by President Trump," Zelenskyy emphasized.

Starmer stresses ‘urgency’ of closer defence ties with Europe at Munich conference
Unknown

21:17:21 KST

Keir Starmer said there was an urgent need for a closer UK defence relationship with Europe, covering procurement and manufacturing, so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup.
In a rare visit to the Munich Security Conference, the British prime minister told the audience, to applause, “we are 10 years on from Brexit. We are not the Britain of the Brexit years.”
Starmer argued that the long-term threat posed by Russia and the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defence required the UK to integrate more closely on defence procurement with European allies.
The UK and France, often the country regarded as the most resistant to non-EU states accessing the European defence market, are both keen to reopen talks about the UK joining Security Action for Europe, an EU rearmament scheme, after discussions stalled last year over the cost of entry for the UK.
France has insisted the high cost of the UK’s proposed membership of the scheme was not due to French pressure, but a result of European Commission calculations, in which France played no part.
Starmer is also examining the case for a European Defence Mechanism, which would be an intergovernmental instrument open to all European democracies, whether inside or outside the EU. Members of the proposed institution would finance joint procurement and joint assets across Europe.
The idea has been promoted by the Bruegel institute and more recently by the former UK foreign secretary David Miliband.
Starmer called Europe “a sleeping giant”.
“Our economies dwarf Russia’s more than 10 times over. We have huge defence capabilities, yet too often this adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Fragmented industrial planning and procurement have led to gaps in some areas and massive duplication in others,” he said, adding that the situation was “wildly inefficient and it harms our collective security. Now, the US security umbrella has allowed these bad habits to develop, but now we must break them.”
He added: “There is no British security without Europe and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history and is today’s reality as well. So together, we must rise to this moment. We must spend more, deliver more and coordinate more.”
The new normal was for Europe to take primary responsibility for its own conventional diplomacy, he said. “Rather than pretending that we can simply replace all US capabilities, we should focus on diversifying and decreasing some dependencies. We should deliver generational investments that moves us from overdependence to interdependence.
“We see the imperative, we see the urgency. We want to work together to lead a generational shift in defence industrial cooperation.”
He said he realised there was politics and trade-offs in moving closer to the EU single market, but “the status quo is not fit for purpose, and to me there’s no question where the national interest lies”.
He stressed that a closer UK-EU defence relationship did not imply any weakening of the UK-US relationship, or the strength of Nato.
He described Nato “as the most effective defence alliance we have ever known and we should never move away from it”, adding that the security and intelligence relationship with the US “was [as] tight as it had ever been”.
Greater European defence autonomy did not herald a US withdrawal from Nato, he said. But Starmer added that European leadership needed to be more honest with their electorates about how the world had changed, and that the cost of defence would rise.
He insisted he had emerged from his turbulent week in domestic UK politics stronger than at the start, saying that was a good place to be.
In reference to the rising popularity of other parties in the UK, Starmer said: “the peddlers of easy answers are ready on the extremes of left and right and they will offer their solutions instead. It’s striking that the different ends of the spectrum share so much. Soft on Russia, weak on Nato, if not outright opposed, and determined to sacrifice the relationships we need on the altar of their ideology.
“The future they offer is one of division and then capitulation. The lamps would go out across Europe once again.”

MUNICH, Germany — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on Europe to help the Trump administration refashion the global order with a focus on sovereignty, reindustrialization and military strength.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, he made no apology for the Trump administration’s repeated calls to annex Greenland or at times harsh criticisms of Europe, but he took a conciliatory tone — stressing that the U.S. wants to cooperate with Europe to “revitalize an old friendship.”
“We do not want allies to rationalize the broken status quo rather than reckon with what is necessary to fix it,” Rubio said. “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline.”

Cash, coercion, abuse: Israeli efforts to block returns to Gaza via Rafah

Palestinians attempting to return to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt describe interrogations, detentions and alleged pressure tactics, including offers of money to leave or cooperate with the Israeli army, according to testimonies and human rights groups.
On Wednesday, Gaza's Government Media Office said only 488 travelers of 1,800 had been able to cross Rafah in both directions since its reopening through Tuesday -- an Israeli compliance rate of about 27%.
In a statement, the office said 275 people left Gaza while 213 entered, and 26 travelers were denied permission to leave for Egypt during the same period.
Israel reopened the Palestinian side of the crossing on Feb. 2 after closing it since May 2024, but only in a very limited manner and under extremely strict conditions.
On Feb. 5, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory said returnees reported after crossing, that they were taken by armed Palestinians, backed by the Israeli army, identified as members of the Abu Shabab militia, to an Israeli military checkpoint. There, some were handcuffed, blindfolded, searched, threatened and had personal belongings confiscated.
The same day, Israel's public broadcaster KAN reported that Israeli authorities had allowed members of the Abu Shabab militia to take part in searches of Palestinians entering and leaving Rafah.
A day later, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper reported that Israel was secretly supporting armed militias in Gaza with money, weapons and field protection to counter Hamas, operating in areas where Israeli forces are deployed under a ceasefire agreement.
According to the paper, the Israeli army has used the militias "for limited tactical tasks, including pursuit and arrest operations and searching for Hamas fighters in tunnels or among the rubble."
The U.N. human rights office said returnees described a pattern of violence, degrading interrogations and intrusive body searches that violated their privacy. In some cases, people in need were denied medical care or access to toilets, resulting in severe humiliation.
Several returnees said they were asked whether they would accept money to go back to Egypt with their families and never return to Gaza. Others said they were offered money to act as informants for the Israeli army.
Taken together, the testimonies point to a pattern of conduct that violates Palestinians' rights to personal security and dignity, and their protection from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, the office said.
It warned that the reported practices raise serious concerns about coercive measures aimed at discouraging Palestinians from exercising their right to return to areas from which they were forcibly displaced, a dynamic that could amount to ethnic cleansing in Gaza.
Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. human rights office in the occupied Palestinian territory, said the international community has a responsibility to ensure that all measures related to Gaza comply with international law and fully respect Palestinian human rights.
"After two years of destruction, their ability to return safely and with dignity to their families and whatever remains of their homes is the absolute minimum," he said.
According to returnees, the crossing process involves passing through five stages: the Egyptian side, the Palestinian Authority, European Union representatives, a militia operating with Israeli backing, and Israeli soldiers.
In response to the accounts, two Israeli human rights organizations, Adalah and Gisha, called for an end to "a policy of abuse and unlawful restrictions" imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return through Rafah, warning that the measures amount to "forced displacement."
In a statement Thursday, the groups said they had sent an urgent letter to Defense Minister Israel Katz, Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara and the military prosecution.
They demanded an immediate halt to "the policy of abuse and illegal restrictions imposed on Gaza residents seeking to return via the Rafah crossing on the Palestinian-Egyptian border."
Testimonies collected by the organizations, including from elderly people and children, described harsh Israeli military interrogations, while stressing that returnees remain determined to stay on their land and reject any attempt to displace them.
The groups said the closure of the crossing has prevented wounded and sick Palestinians from leaving for treatment and blocked the return of thousands who had left Gaza or were stranded abroad.
They said all travelers are subject to prior Israeli security approval, with severe restrictions on entry and exit, and that only limited numbers of those who left during the war are allowed to return.
Field reports indicate that only small numbers, mostly women and children, have been permitted back, despite claims of an agreement allowing about 50 people to enter daily, without any clear explanation for the discrepancy.
The testimonies also describe blindfolding, handcuffing and confiscation of personal belongings. Some Palestinians were transported inside Gaza by armed groups coordinating with the Israeli army and subjected to security interrogations involving pressure and threats of arrest.
The organizations said the practices violate international law, which guarantees the right of return without arbitrary restrictions, and warned that preventing return and imposing security conditions could amount to "forcible transfer prohibited under the Geneva Conventions."
They called for the removal of all obstacles to return, the lifting of security conditions and full compliance with international law.
In a widely circulated video, Palestinian returnee Adel Imran said armed men opened the bus door and transferred passengers in military vehicles to the Morag area between Rafah and Khan Younis, where they were searched and handed over to Israeli forces.
In the same video, Amani Imran said the armed men confiscated their luggage before Israeli soldiers summoned passengers one by one for photographing and interrogation about why they left Gaza and why they were returning.
In another recorded testimony, an elderly Palestinian woman said she was interrogated for three hours after returning from a long medical trip to Egypt. She said the bus was surrounded by military vehicles before passengers were taken to an area under Israeli control.
She added that they were handed to an "anti-terror unit," led by Ghassan al-Deheini, the commander of the Abu Shabab militia inside Gaza, where they were questioned and asked about Palestinians killed during the war in what she said was an attempt to intimidate returnees.
Egyptian and Israeli media had earlier reported that 50 Palestinians would be allowed into Gaza daily, with a similar number exiting to Egypt for medical treatment, but that arrangement has yet to materialize.
Palestinian estimates in Gaza indicate that 22,000 wounded and sick people need to leave the enclave for treatment due to the collapse of the health sector after the war.
Quasi-official figures also show that 80,000 Palestinians have registered to return to Gaza, underscoring widespread refusal of displacement and insistence on returning despite the destruction.
Before the war, hundreds of Palestinians crossed Rafah daily in both directions under a mechanism managed by Gaza's Interior Ministry and Egyptian authorities, without Israeli involvement.
Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Israel was supposed to fully reopen the crossing when the truce took effect Oct. 10, but it has failed to do so.

Arrests of protesters continue to roil Iran weeks after demonstrations, government crackdown
The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.
The women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country's theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
"Authorities continue to identify people and detain them," said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Nazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.
Held for weeks with no contact
The protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.
Security forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran's government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran's judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters "terrorists" and calling for fast-tracked punishments.
Since then, "detentions have been very widespread because it's like a whole suffocation of society," said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother's friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.
The Nakhii sisters, 37-year-old Nyusha and 25-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran's notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women's prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.
Other people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.
Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.
Authorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters' relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.
In past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.
"The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been," Barzin said.
Signs of defiance continue
Despite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.
The Writers' Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against "47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination."
It also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.
A national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. "Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children's names public," it said in a statement.
A spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.
"Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list," Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. "But the next morning, new names arrive again."
Bar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran's state-sanctioned doctors' council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.
Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi called for a "global day of action" on Saturday, urging supporters to take to the streets in Munich, Los Angeles and Toronto to push for "urgent, practical steps in support of the Iranian people."
"We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?" Pahlvai said in a news conference in Munich on Saturday. An annual security conference of global security figures and European leaders is taking place in the German city this weekend. Police told the AFP that about 200,000 people attended a protest in Munich.
Pahlvai, who is the son of Iran's deposed shah and is trying to position himself as a player in Iran's future, warned of the likelihood of more deaths in Iran "if democracies stand by and watch." He added that the continued survival of the Iranian government "sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power."
Anger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.
The Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.
Iran and the United States
President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.
Iran's theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran's leadership "for the first time is afraid of being overthrown."

Ukrainian Red Cross continues to support population during energy crisis
For five weeks since the energy crisis began to worsen, the Ukrainian Red Cross Society (URCS) has been providing continuous humanitarian aid to residents of Kyiv and communities across the country.
"Since early January 2026, the organization has been supporting the operation of over 100 heating stations deployed by the State Emergency Service of Ukraine in Kyiv, and has also been organizing its own heating stations. Here, people can warm up, get hot meals, hot drinking water, and recharge their devices. During this period, more than 250,000 people have received assistance," said Maksym Dotsenko, URCS CEO.
The Ukrainian Red Cross is also establishing warming centers at schools across the capital. More than 15,260 blankets, 5,040 bedding sets, 1,380 bedding sets, 5,940 hygiene kits, heaters, and hot meals have been donated to support residents. Volunteers and staff at the Ukrainian Red Cross also provide psychosocial support.
Additionally, the organization supports the work of 40 field kitchens of the State Emergency Service of Ukraine, donating essential food and delivering thousands of hot meals and drinks. Volunteers also deliver food to warming stations and provide targeted assistance to people with limited mobility and those living alone who are unable to reach them.
A separate area of the response is ensuring community energy resilience. The Ukrainian Red Cross is implementing a program to provide communities with 560 generators with a total capacity of 9.16 MW to support critical infrastructure, Points of Invincibility, and social protection institutions. This ensures the continued operation of vital services even during extended power outages. International partners played a key role in this initiative: 447 of the 560 generators were donated from the European Union's Strategic Reserves (rescEU) under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. These generators are intended to support communities most affected by Russian attacks on energy infrastructure. Additionally, the German Red Cross and the Belgian Red Cross provided an additional 34 powerful generators.
The URCS also recalled that since the beginning of the Russian Federation's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the organization has already donated more than 15,000 generators to support medical facilities, schools, and kindergartens.
The Ukrainian Red Cross coordinates with government agencies and international partners, quickly responding to the needs of communities. The Ukrainian Red Cross acknowledged the support and solidarity of donors and partners from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the US Department of State, and the European Union.

War can be ended with dignity, which is most important thing for Ukraine - Zelenskyy
Ukraine is ready for an agreement that will bring real peace and end the war with dignity, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said.
"Ukraine is ready for an agreement that will bring real peace for us, for Ukraine, for Europe, and I am confident that this war can be ended. Above all, with dignity. This is the most important thing for us," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
The President noted that Ukraine is ready to invest in Europe’s shared security and share everything it has learned during this war.
"And right now, as we work together to protect lives in Ukraine, we are building a new system, a new security, a new response architecture, new approaches to protect lives in any European country when needed," Zelenskyy emphasized.

Ukraine needs air defense systems of various calibers available in Japan – Zhovkva
Ihor Zhovkva, Deputy Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine, said this in an interview with TSN, Ukrinform reports.
"We are closely following the process of legislative changes in Japan. There are mechanisms for obtaining from Japan what they have and what we need. We have already gone through a stage where we received everything that was available, even if sometimes it was not needed. Today, we need air defense systems of various calibers. They exist in Japan, we know this, and we can and will discuss it," Zhovkva said.
He noted that Ukraine can also discuss technology exchanges with Japan and formalize such cooperation in intergovernmental documents.
"In this case, Ukraine can provide its own products, which are of interest to Japan as well. For example, Ukraine is a leader in the production of naval drones, which Japan also needs," he added.
Zhovkva expressed Ukraine's gratitude to Japan for the level of support it has already provided.
"Yes, it is non-lethal assistance. But $15 billion during the war is significant and important. We are really pleased with the election results and Ms. [Sanae] Takaichi's decisive victory. She received a constitutional majority, which will facilitate further government management," Zhovkva said.
He also said that Ukraine has requested Japan to allocate a certain amount of funds for non-lethal weapons under the PURL program.
"We know that such items exist [within PURL], and Ukraine needs this assistance. So let's hear the official position of the Japanese side. We hope they respond positively to this request," he said.
Zhovkva added that new military aid packages and contributions from NATO member states – and beyond – are expected, not only under PURL.
"During a visit to Kyiv, the NATO Secretary General said that Ukraine receives 75% of Patriot missiles thanks to Alliance coordination, which was promised when the NSATU mechanism was established. NATO's role is, in a good sense, to pressure member states to provide military assistance regularly and according to what is needed," Zhovkva said.
He stressed that Ukraine primarily needs Patriot missiles (used to intercept ballistic threats), as well as missiles for other systems – NASAMS and IRIS-T.

India vs Pakistan match is a godsend for T20 World Cup hosts Sri Lanka
Sri Lanka braced itself for massive losses after Pakistan’s boycott call, but now awaits a thrilling clash on Sunday.
Colombo, Sri Lanka — Almost 30 years ago today, India and Pakistan formed a combined cricket team to take on Sri Lanka ahead of the 1996 Cricket World Cup in an unprecedented moment of unity in the sport’s history.
The two age-old rivals put aside their differences and came together in an act of solidarity to support a fellow South Asian team, who faced the threat of match boycotts in a tournament they had battled hard to host.

India versus Pakistan is the most highly marketed fixture at every multination tournament – the World Cup, Asia Cup or Asian Games – whether it’s a men’s, women’s or Under-19 event.
Few sporting events globally carry the weight and anticipation of an India-Pakistan cricket match. So, when Pakistan’s government ordered its team not to face India at the ongoing T20 World Cup, the tournament was briefly pushed into a state of chaos.
It also left Sri Lanka, the designated host of the fixture, holding its collective breath.
A week of negotiations led to a dramatic late U-turn by the Pakistani government and the match will now take place as scheduled on Sunday at the R Premadasa International Cricket Stadium in Colombo.
But what if the boycott had gone ahead? The impact could have been catastrophic, not just for Pakistan, but also for the International Cricket Council (ICC), as well as Sri Lanka.
With the crisis seemingly averted, the island nation stands poised to reap the benefits in its financial landscape, diplomatic standing and community.
‘Massive impact’ on tourism
For a country that is still grappling with the aftermath of the economic crisis of 2022, an India-Pakistan cricket fixture at a World Cup could prove to be a godsend.
The tourism and hospitality industry was one of the hardest hit during Sri Lanka’s financial meltdown and this match will see an enormous influx of fans from India and Pakistan coming into the country.
Hotels in and around Colombo were fully booked out well ahead of the tournament but the industry braced itself for heavy losses after Pakistan threatened a boycott.
“There’s been a massive impact since the boycott was announced,” Sudarshana Pieris, who works in Sri Lanka’s hospitality sector, told Al Jazeera.
“All major hotels in Colombo were fully booked by Indian travel agencies well ahead [of the match] and once the boycott was announced, we lost almost all of those bookings,” he said.
“But after Pakistan reversed their decision, hotel room rates shot up by about 300-400 percent at five-star establishments in Colombo.”
It’s not just hotels but several other local businesses – from street vendors to high-end restaurants – who are hoping for an increased footfall and spending over the weekend.
These short trips and the experiences they offer could influence visitors to extend their stay or return to Sri Lanka on holiday, long after the game has ended, in a potential long-term benefit to the industry.
Another relatively underestimated impact of the game would be the employment opportunities it creates, albeit temporarily, in the media, event management, security and transportation industries.
Asanka Hadirampela, a freelance journalist and broadcaster currently working as a Sinhala language commentator for the World Cup, recognises the marquee match as a great opportunity from a personal standpoint.
“This is my first World Cup as a broadcaster,” Hadirampela said.
“The India-Pakistan fixture is the biggest and most-watched game of the tournament. So to get to work on such a match is exciting and I consider it a special achievement.”
A geopolitical win
The lines are always blurred between sport and politics in South Asia.
So while the financial gains are expected to be significant, the fixture’s impact on the region’s geopolitical environment cannot go amiss.
Pakistan’s boycott, too, was explicitly political, as confirmed by the country’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif when he said that they were offering support to Bangladesh after the Tigers were kicked out of the tournament by the ICC.
The reversal of Pakistan’s decision, which they said came after requests to reconsider the boycott by several regional “friends”, was steeped in politics, too.
Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake reportedly had a phone conversation with PM Sharif, urging his government to rethink their decision to boycott the game as the successful staging of this encounter would not only position Sri Lanka as a capable host of global sporting events but also reinforce its standing as a neutral mediator in a region fraught with geopolitical complexities.
Sri Lanka and Pakistan have always maintained strong diplomatic relations, which have extended to the cricket field as well.
Sri Lanka were one of the first teams to travel to Pakistan following their 10-year ostracisation from international cricket, which came as a result of a terrorist attack targeting the Sri Lankan team in March 2009.
When Al Jazeera reached out to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), its vice president Ravin Wickramaratne confirmed that SLC did, indeed, reach out to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) after the boycott was announced.
“We asked them to reconsider the decision,” Wickramaratne said.
“It [boycott] would have impacted Sri Lanka economically, whether directly or indirectly.
“We have always had a good relationship with the PCB and we have always supported them, so we’re happy with their decision.”
A little over 24 hours ahead of the match in Colombo, there is a sense of palpable excitement and a growing buzz around the fixture as it returns from the brink of cancellation.
As of Saturday morning, 28,000 tickets had been sold for the game but local organisers expect a capacity crowd of 40,000 to make it into the stands.
Come Sunday, thousands more will line the streets in and around Maligawatte, the bustling Colombo suburb that houses the famous Premadasa Stadium.

Arc de Triomphe knife attack highlights difficulty in monitoring radicalized former prisoners

Only two months after being released early from prison, where he had been serving a 17-year sentence for stabbing two Belgian police officers in 2012 – one of whom, a woman, was seriously injured at the time – a radical Islamist attempted to knife gendarmes preparing to take part in a ceremony to rekindle the flame at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe, in Paris's 8th arrondissement.
On Friday, February 13, shortly after 6 pm, according to a statement from France's national anti-terrorism prosecutor's office (PNAT): "A man attacked a member of the Gendarmerie nationale with a knife and a pair of scissors. Another gendarme responded by using his service weapon to neutralize the assailant. The attacked gendarme was not physically injured, as the knife struck the collar of his coat." The gendarmerie specified that the individual had targeted "musicians of the mobile gendarmerie." The alleged assailant, whose name was not released by the PNAT, was treated and transported by firefighters to Georges-Pompidou Hospital, where he died from his injuries. He was reportedly struck twice in the chest.

Ukraine, ASEAN discuss advancing mutually beneficial cooperation, deepening dialogue
Top Ukrainian diplomat says ASEAN ‘important partner’ of Kyiv in today’s int'l architecture amid talks with bloc's chief in Munich
ISTANBUL
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha on Saturday discussed advancing mutually beneficial cooperation between his country and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) during a meeting with the bloc’s chief.
Following a meeting with ASEAN Secretary-General Kao Kim Hourn on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Sybiha said through US social media company X that they discussed advancing cooperation, as well as deepening dialogue and expanding practical engagement, particularly in food security, energy, and digitalization.
“ASEAN is an important partner of Ukraine in today’s international architecture. Ukraine reiterates its intention to become an ASEAN Sectoral Dialogue Partner,” Sybiha further said.
He added that he also invited the secretary-general to visit Ukraine.
“Both sides discussed ways to promote cooperation between ASEAN and Ukraine, among others,” the bloc said in a separate statement on X following the meeting.
Ukraine signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, one of ASEAN's founding documents, in November 2022.
Last month, the Philippine News Agency quoted Ukrainian Ambassador to the Philippines Yuliia Fediv as saying that Kyiv is seeking to become an official dialogue partner of ASEAN by the end of this year.

Zelenskyy: Thanks to Ukraine, Orban doesn't have to worry about building up his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to Budapest
Ukraine is keeping a European front, which is why the free Baltic states and an independent Poland can exist, and even Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán need not think about building up his army to defend against Russia, says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
"It is the Ukrainians who hold the European front. An independent Poland and free Baltic states stand behind our people. A sovereign Moldova and Romania without dictatorship is possible. And even Viktor alone can think about how to grow his belly, not how to build up his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to the streets of Budapest," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference.
The President emphasized that Ukraine did not choose this war.
"Ukrainians are people. People, not terminators. Our people are dying too. And that’s why we are doing everything we can to stop this war and guarantee security," the head of state added.

The ceremony ended with a minute’s silence in honour of the 41 people who died and the 115 who were injured. Afterwards, attendees were invited to a memorial lunch in Vétroz, a village just west of Sion.
For several days, a flyer circulating on social media had been calling on people to gather “in memory of those who died and in support of the injured following the tragic events in Crans‑Montana”. The event, themed around “remembrance, sharing and commemoration”, was open to all.

Ban on Palestine Action ‘massively backfired’, says group’s co-founder
Unknown

21:04:41 KST

The co-founder of Palestine Action has said the ban on the group “massively backfired” and called for its proscription to be suspended after the high court found it to be unlawful.
Three senior judges ruled on Friday that the ban was disproportionate and constituted very serious interference with the rights to protest and free speech.
But the proscription order remains in place pending arguments from lawyers for the home secretary, Shabana Mahmood, on why it should not be lifted, meaning the fate of more than 2,500 people remains in limbo.
Huda Ammori, who co-founded Palestine Action in 2020 and brought the successful legal challenge, said her lawyers would resist Mahmood’s attempts to retain the ban while the home secretary tried to appeal against the judgment.
Ammori said: “Considering the thousands of people who are going through the criminal justice system are being prosecuted for holding up signs saying: ‘I oppose genocide, I support Palestine Action’ and the chaos that’s created, it’s ridiculous to even try and maintain an unlawful ban.
“The logical next step is for either the [proscription] order to be quashed, and, if not quashed completely, for the effect of the proscription to be stopped whilst the government attempts an appeal.
“This is a huge, huge step forward, and we’re closer than ever to getting the ban lifted. So even though it didn’t happen immediately, I have faith that it’s going to happen quite soon. The ban has been proven unlawful from its inception so the fact that we haven’t been de-proscribed immediately – we can wait a little bit longer.”
Saying that the government would appeal on Friday, Mahmood added: “The proscription of Palestine Action followed a rigorous and evidence-based decision-making process, endorsed by parliament.”
More than 500 of the 2,500-plus placard-holders have been charged under section 13 of the Terrorism Act but their cases have been delayed while the outcome of the judicial review was awaited. They took part in a civil disobedience campaign of mass protests defying the ban and earned a glowing tribute from Ammori.
She said: “It’s just been incredible, it’s been so inspiring and moving to see how many people have been inspired to resist this ban, to defy it.
“When I first heard about the proscription going through, it’s just like a ton of bricks, and then when you see the amount of solidarity and support – it’s incredibly uplifting. And I won’t say ‘I think’ – I know this victory is in huge part thanks to them.”
The judges described Palestine Action as “an organisation that promotes its political cause through criminality and encouragement of criminality”, a definition seized on by Mahmood. But they found that, as such, most of its activities could be dealt with by criminal law, and did not amount to terrorism – meaning that proscribing the group could not be justified given the interference with protected rights.
Ammori said winning on the free speech and right to protest ground – one of two on which she was successful – was important. If she had succeeded only on a procedural ground, such as the failure to consult Palestine Action before the ban, which was rejected by the judges, it would have been open to Mahmood to consult and still reach the same decision to proscribe.
But the result was an emphatic one after months that Ammori said had taken a personal toll on her. “It’s not easy to be labelled or smeared as a terrorist, to see that something that was made and founded in order to disrupt the Israeli weapons industry, to stop the greatest crimes happening against the Palestinian people, can be labelled as a terrorist organisation,” she said.
“I think with my background being Palestinian and Iraqi, it’s not the first time I would have had the kind of slur but I remember the first month or two, every time I heard the words terrorist organisation on a news programme, you can’t connect with that. It just makes you feel sick to your stomach to hear that’s how they describe Palestine Action.”
Ultimately, she believes it was an own goal for a Labour government bent on destroying the organisation.
“This has made Palestine Action a household name,” she said. “It has sparked outrage among thousands, if not tens or hundreds of thousands of people across the country and across the world and it has increased the support for direct action massively. It’s now proven that they did all this unlawfully, did all those arrests unlawfully. That’s a huge attack on people’s rights and I think that has massively backfired on them.”

Beijing slams US, UK, Australia and EU over Jimmy Lai sentencing remarks
Commissioner’s office says it summoned representatives from the countries and bloc in Hong Kong to voice ‘strong dissatisfaction’
The Chinese foreign ministry’s arm in Hong Kong has lodged “solemn representations” with local envoys for Britain, the US, Australia and the EU over remarks made by their officials and politicians about the sentencing of former media boss Jimmy Lai Chee-ying.
The Commissioner’s Office of China’s Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong issued a statement on Saturday, saying it had summoned representatives from the countries and the bloc on Wednesday and Thursday.
“The commissioner’s office lodged solemn representations against the negative remarks made by the officials and politicians of these countries and organisations regarding the sentencing in the Lai Chee-ying case, [and] expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition,” it said.
“[The office] urged those countries, organisations and politicians to respect China’s sovereignty and the rule of law in Hong Kong, cease making irresponsible remarks about the trial of national security cases in Hong Kong and refrain from interfering in any form in Hong Kong affairs and China’s internal affairs.”
The former media boss was convicted of two conspiracy counts of collusion with foreign forces and a third of conspiracy to print and distribute seditious articles.
Six former senior executives at Apple Daily received sentences of six years and nine months to 10 years, while two activists were jailed for up to seven years and three months.

Zelenskyy says air defence missiles arrived just days before 12 February attack
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has described how Ukraine received interceptor missiles just before Russia's large-scale combined attack on 12 February, meaning that ballistic missiles could be shot down.
Source: Zelenskyy speaking at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Zelenskyy said Russia launched 24 ballistic missiles and 219 attack drones against Ukrainian cities on the night of 11-12 February.
Quote: "Our air defence used the missiles that arrived from our partners just a few days earlier. They came on Sunday… and on Thursday night the missiles were already protecting our skies."
More details: Zelenskyy said this is not the only time that a timely delivery has enabled Ukraine to supply air defence units with missiles at the last moment.
Quote: "Honestly, one of the worst things a leader can hear in wartime is a report from the air force commander saying the air defence units are empty and they used their missiles to stop Russian strikes and there was no resupply. And intelligence says a new massive attack may come in a day or two. Sometimes we manage to deliver new missiles for our Patriots or NASAMS just before an attack."
More details: Separately, Zelenskyy thanked the European countries whose support enables Ukraine to receive air defence missiles.
Quote: "Most of the air defence missiles that can stop Russian ballistic missiles come to us thanks to the PURL [the Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List programme]. And PURL exists because of Europe. Europe is paying for our ability to stop ballistic attacks. Thanks [to] everyone who helps us. Thank you.
I want to especially thank Germany, Norway and the Netherlands for their strong leadership in Europe in giving us air defence systems. Thank you very much. These systems save our lives."
Background:
- Zelenskyy criticised Europe at Davos over problems with air defence missile deliveries. NATO insisted there had been no delay in the supply of Patriot missiles, contrary to Zelenskyy's remarks.
- NATO later said a number of partners would provide Ukraine with air defence missiles from their own stocks to address the shortfall in supplies from the United States.
- Earlier, Alona Hetmanchuk, Ukraine's ambassador to NATO, listed the six countries that have provided Ukraine with the most support through PURL.

Venezuelan deportee welcomes chance of US return but fears repeat of ordeal

A US federal judge’s order that some of the Venezuelan men sent by the Trump administration to a notorious prison in El Salvador must be allowed to return to the United States to fight their cases has been greeted with hope and a sense of vindication – but also fear – by one of the deportees.
US district judge James Boasberg ruled on Thursday in Washington DC that the Trump administration should facilitate the return of deportees who are currently in countries outside Venezuela, saying they must be given the opportunity to seek the due process they were denied after being illegally expelled from the US last March.
Boasberg added that the US government should cover the travel costs of those who wish to come to the US to argue their immigration cases.
Luis Muñoz Pinto, 27, is one of the men affected and he spoke exclusively to the Guardian on Thursday by telephone from Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, where he has lived since being released from detention in El Salvador.
“I would like to go back to the US to defend myself in court and prove that I am not a member of the Tren de Aragua [gang] – but what happens if they detain me and I have to live through another nightmare?” Muñoz Pinto said.
He has no criminal record in any country. He was an engineering student in Venezuela and fled in 2024 after being beaten by police while protesting against the dictatorship there, first to Colombia and then north. He had an appointment in the US to request asylum under the Biden administration but instead was arrested and accused of being a member of the dangerous Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua because he had some tattoos, despite no evidence being presented of actual gang connections.
The judge acknowledged that if any of the men return to the US to argue in court, it was his understanding that “they will be detained upon their arrival”.
Muñoz Pinto said: “Do you have any idea what my family went through after finding out I was sent to that prison in El Salvador? I went from chasing a dream to work and support my family to being humiliated by guards beating me in the face and my entire body.”
On the night of Saturday 15 March last year, the Trump administration abruptly deported more than 250 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, defying a court block and orders that any such flights should turn around.
Images then emerged of the men shackled held bent over by baton-wielding Salvadoran police, before their heads were shaved and they were imprisoned at the notorious Cecot mega-prison. Former detainees said they were told they would die there, and had no outside communications with lawyers or family. Then last July they were returned to Venezuela in a US-brokered prisoner swap.
Boasberg on Thursday told the Trump administration to prioritize the deportees currently living in third countries but also explain “the feasibility of returning plaintiffs still in Venezuela”, while US-Venezuela relations remain vexed.
A White House spokesperson, Abigail Jackson, blasted Boasberg’s ruling, saying in a statement it was “an absurd, unlawful ruling from a far-left judicial activist trying to undermine the president’s lawful authority to carry out deportations”.
She added: “Americans elected President Trump based on his promise to deport criminal illegal aliens and Make America Safe Again. Boasberg has no right to stop the will of the American people, and this will not be the final say on the matter.”
Lee Gelernt, the lead ACLU attorney in the case, said he was aware of only a small group of the deportees living outside Venezuela.
Boasberg’s order in principle applies to the 137 men deported to El Salvador under the Alien Enemies Act invoked by Donald Trump, when the US president made an unprecedented claim that the US was being “invaded” by gang members allegedly with ties to the Venezuelan state. The others sent to Cecot last year were deported under regular US immigration law and are not covered by the current case.
“It is worth emphasizing that this situation would never have arisen had the government simply afforded plaintiffs their constitutional rights before initially deporting them,” Boasberg said on Thursday.
However, he added that the number of men who may seek to return to the US “would be likely very small if not zero”.
Muñoz Pinto is torn.
“I know Trump deported me to Cecot and I’m not over that nightmare yet, but the US is still the land of opportunities,” he said.
He was deported under the Alien Enemies Act, he said, a fact which the Guardian verified via sources familiar with the case, who were not authorized to speak openly on the matter.
Before Boasberg’s latest order, the ACLU had argued in court that the men should have the right to either return to the US or have a remote hearing to challenge their deportation.
In January, lawyers for the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, argued in a court filing that bringing the 137 men back into the US “would risk material damage to the US foreign policy interests in Venezuela”.
Even remote hearings, lawyers for Rubio added, “also present a serious risk of intentional interference by anti-American elements in Venezuela that would undermine the interests of justice”.
Human rights investigators found that Cecot guards dished out beatings, torture, denial of food and alleged sexual assault. Lawyers for some of the Venezuelans said they endured “state-sanctioned torture”.
El Salvador’s government does not make efforts to publicly rebut allegations of violence and deprivation amounting to torture. The president, Nayib Bukele, responded sarcastically to allegations of cruelty at Cecot made by Hillary Clinton last year. Some online influencers are invited in to make videos of the harsh conditions.
Before Boasberg’s latest ruling, Muñoz Pinto had also spoken to the Guardian in person, in Bogotá, in his first non-TV interview. He was briefly featured on CBS’s 60 Minutes show, aired in the US last month.
Muñoz Pinto recounted that on arrival at Cecot: “Three guards threw me to the ground and kicked me in the face so badly that it caused me a nosebleed and all my gums bled too.”
He added: “I started to cry because I didn’t know what to do, I had tried to be a good man since I was little, I had gone to college, I had tried to help my parents, who are still sick in Venezuela, and I was then in the worst prison on the entire planet and I had not committed a crime.”
Old friends in Colombia helped him find work delivering food across Bogotá, arguing it was a better opportunity to support his family financially than he could get in Venezuela.
Muñoz Pinto said: “This court decision is devastating because I want to go back [to the US], yes, but why do they want me detained again? How many months this time? I am not sure if I can do it again.”

Danish state could face legal action over deal that gives US powers on its soil

Denmark could face legal action over an agreement that gives the US sweeping powers on Danish soil, over claims it is “unconstitutional” and could pose problems in talks with Washington over Greenland.
The agreement, which was signed under the Biden administration in 2023 and was passed by the Danish parliament last year, gives the US “unhindered access” to its airbases and powers over its civilians.
Since then, Donald Trump has made threats to invade Greenland, part of the kingdom of Denmark, resulting in a diplomatic crisis between the longtime allies and a deployment of soldiers to Greenland by a number of European countries.
Theresa Scavenius, an independent MP, plans to sue the Danish state over the agreement on the basis that she believes it to be unconstitutional. The Danish constitution states that its sovereignty can be transferred to “international authorities” but only with a constitutional amendment that requires the support of five-sixths of parliament, which the defence agreement does not have.
“The law is unconstitutional because it delegates authority to the US governmental bodies or soldiers on Danish territory over Danish civilians. That is explicitly not allowed in our constitution,” Scavenius told the Guardian.
While the agreement does not apply to Greenland, critics claim the Trump administration’s statements on Greenland show the US could be willing to use force on civilians.
It was essential that any constitutional matters be resolved urgently before beginning negotiations over Greenland, said Scavenius.
Despite strong criticism from politicians and human rights experts – and heightened tensions between the US and Denmark after Trump’s previous push to acquire Greenland – MPs voted overwhelmingly in favour of the defence agreement in June 2025.
The agreement keeps US soldiers in Denmark under US jurisdiction, gives them access to Danish airbases in the Danish cities of Karup, Skrydstrup and Aalborg, and grants American soldiers and military police powers over Danish civilians at these locations and outside them.
At the time, the government said it did not have the potential to surrender Danish sovereignty and was not a violation of the Danish constitution. The prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said tensions between Denmark and the US made it even more necessary to maintain close ties. “The problem is not too much involvement from the US in Europe,” she said at the time. “On the contrary, the risk is that the US will withdraw and move troops away or stop donations to Ukraine.”
Scavenius has submitted a request for free legal aid, a process that is expected to take several weeks, after which she plans to sue the Danish state.
The Danish Institute for Human Rights has said the agreement risks giving US soldiers the right to stop demonstrations outside their bases and would prevent Denmark from prosecuting them if they used excessive force.
Peter Vedel Kessing, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for Human Rights, told the Guardian in May: “If the bill is passed and American soldiers carry out illegal acts in Denmark, it will be beyond Danish control and outside the reach of the Danish legal system to prosecute such actions.”
The Danish defence ministry said it had noted that a claim was expected to be filed but declined to comment further. A spokesperson said: “As the ministry has not received such a claim at this time, the ministry has no comment.”

Tokyo releases captain of Chinese fishing boat found in Japanese EEZ
Zheng Nianli freed after China files bail payment guarantees, broadcaster NHK reports
Japan’s fisheries agency said the captain was released before 8pm on Friday after China submitted documents guaranteeing payment of bail, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported on Saturday.
The agency said the boat, the Qiong Dong Yu, was seized inside Japan’s EEZ off its southwestern Nagasaki prefecture on Thursday. It was ordered to stop for an inspection “but the vessel failed to comply and fled”. The 47-year-old captain, Zheng Nianli, was arrested on the same day, the agency said.
In its response, Beijing urged Tokyo to protect its crew members’ rights.
“It is hoped the Japanese side will strictly abide by the China-Japan fisheries agreement, enforce the law impartially and ensure the safety as well as the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese crew members,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said on Friday.
Lin added that the Chinese consulate general in Fukuoka was assisting the Chinese crew members in their return.

China’s gold rush: why families are doubling down on precious metals
Gold is becoming more popular in China ahead of the Lunar New Year, with households viewing the asset as a safety net amid an uncertain economy
People across China are buying up gold in large volumes ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, as surging prices for the precious metal fuel its popularity as both a festive gift and an investment.
From migrant workers splashing out on gold-coated jewellery, to white-collar workers pouring their savings into gold-linked investment funds, the metal is widely seen not only as a marker of social respectability, but also as a safety net amid an uncertain world.
The price spike has sparked a surge in sales of gold-plated silver jewellery in Chinese factory hubs such as Dongguan. Gift-giving is a huge part of the Lunar New Year, as millions of migrant workers return to their hometowns laden with boxes of food, cash-filled red envelopes and other presents for their relatives and prospective partners.
And with prices for both gold and silver soaring, gold-plated jewellery is becoming a popular gift: it is more affordable than pure gold items, but is still likely to hold its value, explained Chen Li, a sales assistant at a jewellery shop in Dongguan.
“Inquiries and sales of gold-plated silver items have noticeably increased ahead of the Lunar New Year, mainly from migrant workers at nearby factories,” Chen said, adding that the recent spike in silver prices was likely to fuel the trend even more this year.

In the hands of innovators from the Global South, AI can transform lives

In the hands of innovators from the Global South, AI can transform lives
Artificial intelligence is no longer the sole preserve of rich western nations. The applications for the Global South, in areas ranging from health to agriculture and industry, are having a transformative effect on people’s lives.
Fodder cutters are fearsome machines with huge circular blades spinning at high speed, powered by small generators. Operated by rural workers in several developing countries, including India, Pakistan and Kenya, they pose a constant risk – many have had hands or arms amputated following accidents.
The consequences are devastating. Tasks that shape daily life – harvesting crops, kneading dough, stitching embroidery – suddenly become impossible. Thousands of women are left with reduced independence, lost livelihoods, and, too often, social exclusion.
Until recently, advanced prosthetics were far beyond their reach. Now, homegrown AI tools are opening the door to the same kinds of sophisticated devices available in wealthier countries.
Karachi-based Bioniks Technologies partnered with UN Women to design and deliver prosthetic limbs tailored specifically for affected female workers in Pakistan’s Sindh province. The initiative harnessed frontier technologies – 3D modelling, digital scanning, and artificial intelligence – to create lightweight, durable, and intuitive bionic arms capable of transforming daily life.
“Through this collaboration, we provided advanced prosthetic arms, hands-on training, psychological support and awareness sessions to help communities understand safety practices and prevent such injuries in the future,” says Ayesha Zulfiqar, co-founder of Bioniks.
“Watching these incredible women regain their mobility, dignity, independence and return to hand embroidery, their main source of income, has been profoundly inspiring. This is more than technology, it’s restoring hope, confidence and opportunity.”
The India AI Impact Summit: A first for the Global South
This initiative is a powerful example of what can be achieved when AI is available to innovators based in the Global South.
Democratising AI is a major priority for the United Nations, which is working to ensure that this rapidly evolving technology is developed ethically and benefits people everywhere.
At the India AI Impact Summit, taking place from 16 to 20 February in New Delhi, several UN agencies will showcase the initiatives they are supporting in the country and across developing nations.
The Summit is the first major event of its kind in the Global South. Building on the momentum of the 2023 AI Safety Summit convened by the UK, and the 2025 AI Action Summit in France, it will also feature UN Secretary‑General António Guterres and Amandeep Gill, his Special Envoy for Digital and Emerging Technologies.
Speaking to author and podcaster Anirudh Suri in the run-up to the conference, Mr. Gill said that the UN is focused on bridging the growing ‘AI divide’ (between wealthy and developing economies, as well as the rich and poor within countries) and making AI more accessible to people everywhere.
“The concentration of economic and technological power is our biggest concern at the United Nations,” said Mr. Gill. “We’ve seen this story before, during previous industrial revolutions, when those who missed steam power found themselves 50 years behind in terms of development. We cannot afford to let that happen again.”
Despite the fears he expressed, Mr. Gill pointed to regions that have put plans in place to capitalise on AI and avoid being left behind. “I see this in Southeast Asia, in many parts of Africa and in India, where the government is taking the lead, subsidising access to AI for researchers, developers and smaller companies.”
Although the AI Impact Summit is not a UN event, Mr. Gill has been involved in shaping the agenda and considers it to be an important moment on the path to international governance. “It’s exciting to see the focus on bridging the AI divide, building capacity and involving citizens in a democratic approach to the technology.”
What to expect at the Summit
- AI Impact Summit Week will run from 16 to 20 February at Bharat Mandapam Convention Centre in New Delhi
- It will bring together global leaders, policymakers, technology companies, innovators and experts to deliberate on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence across governance, innovation and sustainable development
- UN Secretary-General António Guterres will speak at the Summit on Thursday 19 February
- Several United Nations entities are holding side-events, showcasing the ways that they are using AI for social good.
- They include the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP), UN Women, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the World Health Organization (WHO), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the UN reproductive health agency (UNFPA), the UN science agency (UNESCO) and the UN Office for Digital and Emerging Technologies (ODET).
The UN and AI
Here is a selection of the work on AI that is taking place across the UN system. These initiatives are aimed at reducing global inequalities by addressing the uneven distribution of AI benefits and supporting digital capacity in developing countries.
- Global Digital Compact, a global framework for digital cooperation and AI governance, adopted by world leaders at the 2024 Summit of the Future
- Principles for the Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence in the UN System, a guide to the ethical adoption of across UN agencies
- The High‑Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and the Global Dialogue on AI Governance, created to improve evidence‑based policymaking, global coordination, and participation across Member States
- AI for Good, the UN system’s largest, action‑oriented platform for scaling practical AI solutions to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals
- UNESCO Recommendation on the Ethics of AI (2021), The world’s first global AI ethics framework, adopted by all 193 Member States, covering human rights, transparency, fairness, environmental impact, and governance obligations across the AI lifecycle.
- Generation AI (UNICEF), a global effort to build evidence, shape policy, and co‑develop AI solutions that uphold child rights

World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum puts women at the heart of economic transformation
Women entrepreneurs must be recognized as the architects of economic change and not the beneficiaries.
That was the central message of the Manama Declaration, issued at the close of the World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum (WEIF) held this week in Bahrain.
The declaration places women at the heart of economic transformation, underscoring that empowering them within business and innovation ecosystems is essential to achieving inclusive and sustainable growth.
It also calls for strengthening women’s presence across emerging sectors, including the green, blue and orange economies which respectively promote environmental responsibility, sustainable use of ocean resources and creativity.
Organized by the UN Industrial Development Organization’s (UNIDO) Investment and Technology Promotion Office in Bahrain, the forum convened leaders, investors and entrepreneurs from around the world to shape a more resilient global economy and unlock new opportunities for women-led enterprises.
“An amazing opportunity”
For many participants, the forum delivered tangible results.
Doris Martin, CEO of DMartin Consultancy in Bahrain, attended in search of meaningful collaboration and found it.
Through business-to-business (B2B) meetings facilitated during the event, she established partnerships with companies in the United Arab Emirates and Morocco.
“This forum has been effective for me,” she told UN News. “I’ve had B2B collaboration with regional companies through Bahrain and through UNIDO.”
Tosin Arwejulo, CEO of Leadership Excel Consultancy and a Nigerian-American entrepreneur based in Bahrain, described the forum as a “powerful networking platform.”
“I’ve had the opportunity to talk to people from literally every continent,” she said. “It has been an amazing opportunity to connect with like-minded leaders.”
Shared challenges, shared solutions
The forum’s impact extended beyond the Arab region.
Ayanthi Gurusinghe, President of the Ceylon Chamber of Women Entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka and representative of the South Asian Women Development Forum, attended alongside delegates from India, Nepal, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
She said participants exchanged valuable lessons, particularly around access to finance, a challenge faced by women entrepreneurs across regions.
“It was a good opportunity for networking, to come together, share views, learn and exchange experiences,” she said, expressing appreciation to UNIDO for creating a space where global connections could flourish.
Special focus on artists with disabilities
Beyond panel discussions and networking sessions, the forum also spotlighted inclusive entrepreneurship through three exhibitions including on “Determined Creative Entrepreneur.”
Among the exhibitors was Nisreen Samour of Micro Art Center in Bahrain, which specializes in training and developing artistic talent, with a special focus on artists with disabilities.
“Today, we have about nine students participating, each specializing in an artistic field that aligns with their interests and abilities,” she said.
“I personally train them, and we are currently working on developing their skills and empowering them to produce professional artwork that will help them effectively enter the art market and the job market, thus contributing to increased productivity and the center's overall performance” she told UN News.
The centre also works with orphans, helping them develop artistic skills and showcase their work publicly — fostering independence and self-reliance through creativity.
The role of academia
One recurring theme was the role of higher education in preparing young women to enter the world of entrepreneurship.
In an interview with UN News, Dr. Nihal Al-Najjar, professor at the Royal University for Women in Bahrain, highlighted the need to embed entrepreneurship deeply within academic systems.
“Our academic role is to integrate entrepreneurship not just as a subject, but as a methodology,” she said, explaining that experiential learning and practical application are key. “We encourage students to think, innovate and identify gaps in society, and then work to find solutions.”
She added that universities must go beyond classroom teaching by connecting students to the wider entrepreneurial ecosystem, guiding them towards mentorship, funding opportunities and professional networks when they are ready to launch their own ventures.
A driving force for sustainable development
The World Entrepreneurs and Investment Forum (WEIF) was preceded by the annual conference of the International Women Entrepreneurial Challenge (IWEC)—a New York-based NGO that helps women-owned businesses to grow.
Speaking at the conference, UNIDO Director General Gerd Müller described women’s entrepreneurship as a driving force for sustainable development, global innovation and economic inclusion.
“We must ensure that women everywhere have a level playing field and are given the opportunity to unlock their full potential,” he stated, highlighting persistent barriers to finance, technology, and higher-skilled roles for women globally.
Reaffirming UNIDO’s commitment, he added that “empowering women is essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.” The 17 SDGs, adopted by governments in 2015, provide a blueprint for a more just and equitable future for all people and the planet.
Mr. Müller praised Bahrain’s leadership in supporting entrepreneurship and women’s economic participation and outlined UNIDO’s ongoing work in crisis-affected countries, noting, “UNIDO has just started working to set up recovery programmes in Syria, Sudan, and Palestine… mostly the women there are affected, and they need our support.”
Women as engines of business
In her opening remarks, IWEC Chair Ibukun Awosika highlighted women’s transformative role as engines of business, leadership, and national progress.
She emphasized that women constitute half of the world’s productive assets and, when empowered, become game changers in corporate and political leadership. Drawing on her own journey, Ms. Awosika recalled building a manufacturing group over 36 years before becoming the first and only woman chair of sub-Saharan Africa’s oldest financial institution, First Bank of Nigeria.
“What women represent to the world is 50 per cent of its assets — productive, constructive assets that are game changers when fully deployed,” she said.
“Every nation that has enough wisdom to invest and to actualize the talent that is in 50 per cent of its population is a country that is set to win.”
Success Stories from Bahrain and Nigeria
According to its website, the International Women Entrepreneurial Challenge (IWEC) has recognized 575 distinguished awardees globally, honoured annually at its conferences and nominated by partner organizations, representing women-owned businesses from across the world.
In Bahrain, IWEC recognized a new cohort of awardees from the Middle East and Africa.
Among them was Sonia Mohamed Janahi, founder of Maya La Chocolaterie, who highlighted UNIDO’s role in advancing women’s entrepreneurship.
With UNIDO’s support, Janahi expanded her Bahraini chocolate brand into Africa, establishing a cocoa processing plant in Côte d’Ivoire, creating jobs, promoting ethical supply chains, and ensuring global recognition for African-produced chocolate.
“UNIDO has played a very vital role in my progression. They have taken my project and opened opportunities for me,” she told UN News, underscoring UNIDO’s commitment to recognizing women entrepreneurs across Bahrain, the Middle East, and Africa.
“This event represents women globally and investments over $6 billion that bring women globally together. It awards women who have not just started a business but have sustained a business and scaled up a business and have had an impact on the economy and on the society.”
Also honoured was Nigerian entrepreneur Oluwakelemi, who discussed her gifting and lifestyle retail business, which employs women and supports household incomes across Nigeria while preparing to expand internationally.
“I am passionate about building scalable African businesses with global reach,” she told UN News. “Not less than 5,000 people have been able to benefit from our business, from our work.”

Biden administration tried to manage the war so that Russia wouldn't win, but Ukraine couldn't retake occupied territories – Zelenskyy
The idea of the 46th US President Joe Biden’s administration was that the USA could manage the speed of the war to reach a point where Russia could no longer attack and Ukraine would agree not to return its occupied territories, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference.
"I remember how a full-scale war was perceived in the first years, and we were told that support would continue, but not on the scale required for Ukraine to win or Russia to lose. And what did that mean? It meant time. The idea was that America could manage the speed of the war and the risk of escalation to reach a point where Russia could no longer attack and Ukraine would agree not to return its occupied territories," he said on Saturday.
The President thanked the United States for all the weapons supplies received, but noted that the months spent on tanks, the years spent on aircraft—"it all took time."
"This hasn’t made the situation any easier for anyone, because in war, war itself controls time. And it uses that time against people, of course. And that’s why not a single day, not a single opportunity to protect lives, must be lost. Everyone who seeks security and peace must understand this. Every day counts," Zelenskyy emphasized.

Von der Leyen rebukes NATO chief over 'no security without US', calls for European mutual defence

Von der Leyen pushed back on comments made by NATO chief Rutte suggesting Europe cannot guarantee its security without the United States. The Commission President said the picture is more complex - and she made it clear to her 'dear friend Mark' in rebuke.
Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday directly challenged the head of the NATO military alliance who suggested Europe can "keep on dreaming" about becoming more independent when it comes to guaranteeing its own security.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, the head of the European Commission said the security picture on the continent is far more nuanced and called on European leaders to instill momentum to mutual defense commitments among EU nations.
"I believe the time has come to bring Europe's mutual defence clause to life," she said on Saturday. "Mutual defence is not optional for the UE, it is an obligation."
While most EU countries are also NATO allies, the world's biggest defensive security alliance, the bloc's founding treaties also include a mutual defence clause under Article 42.7 which until now had remained elusive. Since the return of President Donald Trump, there has been a push to define in specific terms what European mutual defence means.
Von der Leyen also referred to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte's remarks that Europe is not in a position to guarantee its security alone at this point.
"My dear friend, there is not only status quo goes on or division and disruption. There's a lot in between and status quo is not satisfactory, neither for us nor the US," the European Commission president said following her speech at the Munich Security Conference.
"Let’s develop our strength without constantly leaning on someone else," she added.
Late last month, Rutte sparked outrage when he told European lawmakers that "if anyone thinks here, again, that the European Union, or Europe as a whole, can defend itself without the US, keep on dreaming. You can't. We can't. We need each other."
The NATO chief argued that European nations would have to spend 10% of their GDP, rather than the current goal of 5%, to make up for the loss of Washington's backing.
"You'd have to build up your own nuclear capability. That costs billions and billions of euros," he said. "In that scenario, you would lose the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the US nuclear umbrella. So, hey, good luck!"
In her address at the conference on Saturday, von der Leyen argued Europe is "delivering" when it comes to defence, with spending up nearly 80% since the start of Russia's war against Ukraine. But Europe must go beyond just spending, the Commission chief said, and "no taboo can go unchallenged".
"This commitment only carries weight if it is built on trust and capability," she said, referring to Article 42.7 in force since 2009.
The clause states that "if an EU country is the victim of armed aggression on its territory, the other EU countries have an obligation to aid and assist it by all means in their power".
Article 42.7 has only been triggered once in response to the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 but it is generally seen as weaker than the collective defence clause of NATO.
Under NATO commitments, if one ally is attacked, the rest would come to its defense including the United States. Some 23 of the EU's 27 members also belong to NATO.
The EU 'will not flinch' on its digital rules
The head of the EU executive also stressed that in order to truly be ready to be in a position to defend itself, the EU "must make decisions faster".
"And this may mean relying on the result of a qualified majority rather than unanimity. We do not need to change the Treaty for this. We need to use the one we have."
She also called for the bloc to be "creative", notably through partnership with other partners, citing the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force and the Coalition of the Willing for Ukraine.
"What we need to do now, is formalise the ad hoc beginnings of new security collaborations. This starts by working of course with our closest partners, like the UK, Norway, Iceland or Canada," she said.
"We want to increase our offer to many of these vital partners. This means, in this acutely volatile time, Europe and in particular the UK should come closer together – on security, on economy or on defending our democracies."
The British Prime Minister, who took part in the discussion with von der Leyen, echoed that message, saying the UK needs to restart its relationship with the EU a decade on from the UK's referendum as a matter of "urgency" in the context of the Ukraine war.
“This is of some urgency, because I think that on defence and security, until the Ukraine conflict we didn’t really wake up the reality that we’re facing,” Keir Starmer said.
Europe as a whole "hasn't done enough" for its defence and "must seize this moment" to strengthen itself. "We want to more with the EU even more closely in light of the challenge" they face, he also said.
Beyond defence, von der Leyen said Europe will have to become independent across the board, from energy to technology. "There is no other choice," she warned.
"The European way of life – our democratic foundation and the trust of our citizens – is being challenged in new ways.
"On everything from territories to tariffs or tech regulations," she added in a thinly veiled reference to the US, which has wielded the threats of tariffs on partners to secure preferential access and has decried the EU's digital rules as an assault on free speech.
"I want to very clear: our digital sovereignty is our digital sovereignty" and the EU "will not flinch where this is concerned," she said.

Top Trump official denies culture war allegations as ‘a lie’

MUNICH, Germany — The U.S. is not interfering in European politics, a senior U.S. State Department official told POLITICO on Saturday, despite reported efforts by the Trump administration to fund MAGA-aligned organizations on the continent.
Speaking at the POLITICO Pub on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, U.S. Under Secretary of State Sarah Rogers pushed back on a POLITICO report that Rogers and other Trump officials had held talks with groups in France and Britain and asked the Washington-based Heritage Foundation to provide a list of potential organizations to fund.
“The idea that we have a slush fund for the far right is a lie,” Rogers said. “It's not America's decision to govern who's elected in Europe.”

Rubio speech signals US-Europe relations are bruised but still friendly
World leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, have been gathering in Munich for Europe's biggest security and defence conference.
The burning question on everyone's minds: is the US still an ally of Europe?
The keynote speech that everyone was waiting for was from Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.
Would he repeat the attacks made on Europe last year by the US Vice-President JD Vance? Or would he be conciliatory?
The hall was packed to the rafters. Generals and admirals, bemedalled in their uniforms, prime ministers and presidents, diplomats, ambassadors, US Congressmen and women, European politicians and their Spads - all waiting nervously to hear what President Donald Trump's top diplomat had to say.
The applause did not come straight away. In fact, for the first few minutes, as Rubio got into his stride, it began to sound very much like a repeat attack on Europe.
Free trade, mass migration, green policies on climate change – all came in for sharp criticism.
He even talked about "a climate cult" that was harming America's economy, while he went on to slam the United Nations, saying it had failed to resolve the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine.
The US secretary of state, impeccably neat and groomed, stood with one hand casually in his trouser pocket, delivering this from a prepared script at a podium.
But then he spoke the words everyone in the room wanted to hear: "Our destiny will always be intertwined with yours (in Europe)."
"The end of the transatlantic era," he went on to say, "is neither our goal nor our wish... we will always be a child of Europe".
Rubio spoke of "unshackling creativity", of shared goals in securing supply chains for critical minerals, and of the European culture he so admired, a continent that had given the world Shakespeare, Mozart and the Rolling Stones (he got a muffled laugh for that).
But there was a sting in the tail. What we have together, he said, was unique and "we in the US have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline".
So what did people make of this? It was broadly positive – about half the audience stood up at the end to applaud him.
There was certainly a palpable sense of relief that after all the upsets of the last few months, with tariffs and the threat of a US grab for Greenland, the transatlantic alliance was not dead.
"It was a good speech," Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, told me afterwards.
"I think the Europeans sighed with relief because it was saying that Europe is important, that Europe and America are very intertwined and good allies, and have been for so long and will be in the future."
She did not deny, though, that there remain real differences in policy in some areas between Washington and Europe.
And while both sides agree that Europe needs to shoulder much more of the burden for its own defence, I have encountered some quiet exasperation here in Munich at Trump's refusal to put enough pressure on Russia to end the Ukraine war, that is poised to enter its fifth, bloody year.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. The world should call to "catch the nazi" Vladimir Zelensky following his comments on Russians competing for other countries’ teams at the 2026 Winter Olympics, Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told TASS.
"The moment when a supposed president of a country says something like this, thousands of international officials should shout ‘catch the nazi’ in unison, and millions of human rights advocates organize protests against neo-Nazism," the diplomat said.
Earlier, Zelensky described the participation of Russian athletes in other countries’ Olympic teams as "nasty" and "disturbing.".

TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown

TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown
TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown
A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year.
Transportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on DHS’ annual funding. TSA officers also worked through the record shutdown that ended Nov. 12, but aviation experts say this one may play out differently.
Trade groups for the U.S. travel industry and major airlines nonetheless warned that the longer DHS appropriations are lapsed, the longer security lines at the nation’s commercial airports could get.
Here’s what to know about the latest shutdown and how to plan ahead.
What’s different about this shutdown?
Funding for Homeland Security expired at midnight. But the rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations.
According to the department’s contingency plan, about 95% of TSA workers are deemed essential personnel and required to keep working. Democrats in the House and Senate say DHS won’t get funded until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations.
During past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended to build over time, not overnight. About a month into last year’s shutdown, for example, TSA temporarily closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. That same day, the government took the extraordinary step of ordering all commercial airlines to reduce their domestic flight schedules.
John Clark, arriving at Detroit Metropolitan Airport from a business trip in Mississippi, said he was impacted by that earlier shutdown and is worried.
“You might not be able to get home if you’re already out, or it might delay if you worked all week and you’re trying to get home,” said Clark, who frequently travels for his job balancing machines. “It’s really bad.”
John Rose, chief risk officer for global travel management company Altour, said strains could surface at airports more quickly this time because the TSA workforce also will be remembering the last shutdown.
“It’s still fresh in their minds and potentially their pocketbooks,” Rose said.
What is the impact on travelers?
It’s hard to predict whether, when or where security screening snags might pop up. Even a handful of unscheduled TSA absences could quickly lead to longer wait times at smaller airports, for example, if there’s just a single security checkpoint.
That’s why travelers should plan to arrive early and allow extra time to get through security.
“I tell people to do this even in good times,” Rose said.
Experts say flight delays also are a possibility even though air traffic controllers are not affected by the DHS shutdown.
Airlines might decide to delay departures in some cases to wait for passengers to clear screening, said Rich Davis, senior security adviser at risk mitigation company International SOS. Shortages of TSA officers also could slow the screening of checked luggage behind the scenes.
Burnest R. Green, who flew to Detroit from Phoenix for his sister’s 70th birthday, says he wants the shutdown ended before he flies back in over a week’s time.
“I just hope that things start to get better before they get any worse,” he said.
What travelers can do to prepare
Most airports display security line wait times on their websites, but don’t wait until the day of a flight to check them, Rose advised.
“You may look online and it says two-and-a-half hours,” he said. “Now it’s two-and-a-half hours before your flight and you haven’t left for the airport yet.”
Passengers should also pay close attention while packing since prohibited items are likely to prolong the screening process. For carry-on bags, avoid bringing full-size shampoo or other liquids, large gels or aerosols and items like pocketknives in carry-on bags.
TSA has a full list on its website of what is and isn’t allowed in carry-on and checked luggage.
At the airport, Rose said, remember to “practice patience and empathy.”
“Not only are they not getting paid,” he said of TSA agents, “they’re probably working with reduced staff and dealing with angry travelers.”
Will the shutdown drag on?
The White House has been negotiating with Democratic lawmakers, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week before senators and members of Congress were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break.
Lawmakers in both chambers were on notice, however, to return if a deal to end the shutdown is struck.
Democrats have said they won’t help approve more DHS funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
In a joint statement, U.S. Travel, Airlines for America and the American Hotel & Lodging Association warned that the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel season approaches.
“Travelers and the U.S. economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,” the statement said.

Iran’s crown prince says ahead of protests that inaction against Tehran encourages bullies

Crown prince urges the world to stand with the people of Iran as 250,000 rally in Munich
Crown prince urges the world to stand with the people of Iran as 250,000 rally in Munich
MUNICH (AP) — About 250,000 people demonstrated on Saturday against Iran’s government on the sidelines of a gathering of world leaders in Germany, police said, answering a call from Iran ’s exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi for cranked-up international pressure on Tehran.
Banging drums and chanting for regime change, the giant and boisterous rally in Munich was part of what Pahlavi described as a “global day of action” to support Iranians in the wake of deadly nationwide protests. He also called for demonstrations in Los Angeles and Toronto. Police said in a post on X that the number of protesters reached some 250,000, more than the organizers had expected.
“Change, change, regime change” the huge crowd chanted, waving green-white-and-red flags with lion and sun emblems. Iran used that flag before its 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled the Pahlavi dynasty.
At a news conference, Pahlavi warned of more deaths in Iran if “democracies stand by and watch” following Iran’s deadly crackdown on protesters last month.
“We gather at an hour of profound peril to ask: Will the world stand with the people of Iran?” he asked. He added that the survival of Iran’s government “sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power.”
An estimated 350,000 people marched on the streets of Toronto as part of the Global Day of Action Rally, Toronto Police spokesperson Laura Brabant said.
At the Munich rally, demonstrators sported “Make Iran Great Again” red caps, mimicking the MAGA caps worn by U.S. President Donald Trump ‘s supporters. Among those sporting the caps was U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who gave a speech to the crowd during which he was photographed holding up the headwear.
Many at the rally waved placards showing Pahlavi, some that called him a king. The son of Iran’s deposed shah has been in exile for nearly 50 years but is trying to position himself as a player in Iran’s future.
The crowd chanted “Pahlavi for Iran,” and “democracy for Iran” as drums and cymbals sounded.
“We have huge hopes and (are) looking forward that the regime is going to change hopefully,” said Daniyal Mohtashamian, a demonstrator who traveled from Zurich, in Switzerland, to speak for protesters inside Iran who faced repression.
“There is an internet blackout, and their voices are not going outside of Iran,” he said.
About 500 protesters also rallied outside the presidential palace in Nicosia, Cyprus, with many holding up banners with slogans against Iran’s government and in favor of Pahlavi.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says at least 7,005 people were killed in last month’s protests, including 214 government forces. It has been accurate in counting deaths during previous rounds of unrest in Iran and relies on a network of activists inside Iran to verify deaths.
Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. Iran’s theocracy in the past has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the death toll, given authorities have disrupted internet access and international calls in Iran.
Iranian leaders are facing renewed pressure from Trump, who has threatened U.S. military action. Trump wants Iran to further scale back its nuclear program. He suggested Friday that regime change in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen.”
Iran was also the focus of protests in Munich on Friday, the opening day of an annual security conference in the city gathering European leaders and global security figures. Supporters of the Iranian opposition group People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, also known as the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, demonstrated.

Italy pledges deeper cooperation at second Italy-Africa Summit
Italy has pledged to deepen cooperation with African countries during its second Italy-Africa summit
- Bookmark
Italy pledged Friday to deepen cooperation with African countries during its second Italy-Africa summit, the first on African soil, aimed at reviewing projects started in critical sectors such as energy and infrastructure during Italy’s first phase of the Mattei Plan for Africa.
The plan, launched in 2024, is aimed at promoting investment-led cooperation rather than traditional aid.
Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni addressed dozens of African heads of state and governments in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, and reiterated that a successful partnership would depend on Italy’s “ability to draw from African wisdom” and ensure lessons are learned.
“We want to build things together,” she told African heads of state. “We want to be more consistent with the needs of the countries involved.”
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said Italy had provided Africa with a gateway to Europe through these partnerships.
“This is a moment to move from dialogue to action,” he said. “By combining Africa’s energetic and creative population with Europe’s experience, technology and capital, we can build solutions that deliver prosperity to our continents and beyond.”
After the Italy-Africa summit concludes Friday, African leaders will remain in Addis Ababa for the annual African Union Summit that begins Saturday.
Kenyan writer and political analyst Nanjala Nyabola said tangible results from such summits depend on preparations made by countries.
African governments often focus on “optics instead of actually making summits a meaningful engagement,” she said.
Instead of waiting to receive a list of demands, countries should “present the conclusions of an extended period of mapping the national needs” and engage in dialogue to see how the needs can be met.
Since it was launched two years ago, the Mattei Plan has directly involved 14 African nations and has launched or advanced around 100 projects in crucial sectors, including energy and climate transition, agriculture and food security, physical and digital infrastructure, health care, water, culture and education, training and the development of artificial intelligence, according to the Italian government.

Unions say they will fight hard-hitting jobless benefit reforms

Unions say they will fight hard-hitting jobless benefit reforms
Unemployed people could lose up to €900 a month under the new cabinet’s plans to cut spending on jobless benefits (WW), Dutch trade unions have told the AD.
Calculations by the FNV and CNV union federations show that the proposed reforms would significantly reduce both the level and duration of payments for many future claimants.
The coalition parties D66, VVD and CDA have agreed to cut around €1.5 billion from the WW budget partly by reducing the maximum duration of benefits from 24 months to 12 months.
In addition, the new administration plans to lower the cap on maximum payments to €3,700 a month from the current €4,600 a month, hitting higher earners. WW benefits are based on 70% of last earning salary up to the maximum.
The FNV estimates that around 24% of current claimants would receive less if the new rules were applied to them and warns that percentage could rise, pointing to recent job cuts at Heineken, ING and ASML.
Anyone earning around €5,000 gross a month, including holiday pay and a possible 13th month, would face lower benefits if they became unemployed under the new rules, the union said.
Halving the maximum duration from 24 to 12 months would also have a major impact, particularly on people over 55, who often find it hardest to return to work. The CNV calculates that an older, higher-earning employee could lose up to €66,000 in benefits as a result of both the lower cap and the shorter duration.
Younger workers would also be hit. Under current rules, someone must have worked 14 years to qualify for 12 months of benefit. Under the new plans, that would rise to 24 years. A 35-year-old who has worked for 14 years would in future be entitled to only seven months of benefit instead of 12.
Both unions have said they will oppose the plans.
“Unemployment benefits are funded by contributions for employers and employees,” said CNV chairman Piet Fortuin. “Politicians plan to dip into that money.”

China to scrap tariffs for most African nations as Italy proposes climate-linked debt relief

Chinese President Xi Jinping has announced that Beijing will scrap tariffs for all but one African country on May 1.
According to state media on Saturday, Xi said that the zero-tariff deal "will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development", announcing the date as leaders across the continent gathered in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, for the annual African Union summit.
China already has a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries, but Beijing said last year it would extend the policy to all 53 of its diplomatic partners on the continent.
China is Africa's largest trading partner and a key backer of major infrastructure projects in the region through its vast "Belt and Road" initiative. From May 1, zero levies will apply to all African countries except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
Many African countries are increasingly turning to China and other trading partners since US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs worldwide last year.
Italy offers climate‑shock debt suspension
Meanwhile, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that Italy and its African partners had focused their latest talks on the continent's debt burden, with Rome offering countries a chance to suspend repayments when hit by extreme climate events.
"Today, once again, we focused on an issue that is central for Africa, which is debt," Meloni said late on Friday at the close of the second Italy–Africa meeting in Addis Ababa.
"We have launched a broad initiative on debt conversion for joint development projects. To this, we are adding the introduction of debt‑suspension clauses for those nations affected by extreme climate events," she added.
On Saturday, Meloni attends the plenary session of the African summit. She did not give details on how the proposed suspension mechanism would work or which states might take it up.
Italy has made cooperation with African countries a cornerstone of its foreign policy, particularly through its "Mattei Plan," which Rome says aims to build long‑term partnerships in energy, agriculture, and infrastructure.
Water, sanitation drive at top of agenda
On Saturday, African heads of state and government gathered in Addis Ababa for a two-day summit centred on water security, climate pressure, and strengthening Africa’s representation in global institutions.
Leaders are launching the AU’s 2026 theme of the year — Assuring Sustainable Water Availability and Safe Sanitation Systems to Achieve the Goals of Agenda 2063.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the Italian prime minister, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, and other international leaders are participating in the summit at AU headquarters, underscoring growing international engagement with Africa’s development and security priorities.
In addition to discussions on water governance and climate resilience, leaders are expected to review peace and security situations across the continent, assess progress on Agenda 2063 — the AU’s long-term development blueprint — and consider institutional reforms aimed at improving the effectiveness and financial sustainability of the continental body.

Europe has every right to take part in Ukraine peace talks – Wang Yi
The top Chinese diplomat made the remarks at the Munich Security Conference, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
"China's position and stance is clear: all regional hotspot issues should be resolved through dialogue and consultation and we need to find a political settlement. So this holds true for the Ukraine crisis [as it is officially referred to in China] but China is not a party directly involved. We don't have the final say. What we are doing is to promote talks for peace," Wang said.
He added that Beijing is sending messages through every possible channel that it seeks the fastest possible cessation of hostilities and the resumption of dialogue, and it is finally possible to see that peace talks have begun.
"Finally, now we are seeing that the peace talks have begun and I think now real issues are being discussed. We welcome this because without dialogue how can peace ever arrive. If we don't keep dialogue going, a peace deal or treaty will not fall from the sky. So we hope that through our consistent efforts we can reach a comprehensive, durable, lasting and binding peace deal acceptable to all parties," the minister said.
Wang recalled that at last year's Munich Security Conference he insisted on the mandatory participation of European countries in Ukraine peace talks and continues to hold that view.
"Europe should not watch this from the sidelines. Right here in Munich last year, at that time, the United States had started engagement with Russia and Europe seemed to be left watching from the sidelines. And I said then that since the conflict broke out right here in Europe, Europe has every right to participate in the negotiation in due course," he said.
He noted that Europe has now dared to speak with Russia, which he sees as a positive signal and supports, but stressed that dialogue should not be for the sake of dialogue; it must produce results.
"Europe should come up with ideas and plans on how to resolve this issue. And in this process, we need to foster a more balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture for Europe. So by doing this, we are addressing the root causes of the crisis and we can prevent it from reoccurring," Wang said.
"To achieve sustainable and lasting peace, China will in its own way give its full support for the peace process," he added.

The 62nd edition of the Munich Security Conference, which opened on Friday, February 13, chose a wrecking ball as its symbol. The organizers of this major event in transatlantic relations said it was a metaphor for a world order "under demolition" due to Donald Trump's brutality and his disregard for rules. Just one year after the shock caused by a speech from US Vice President JD Vance, political leaders from across Europe were expected to deliver their response to an America that shows them contempt, and to carve out their place in this new world.
But Vance was not in the room to hear the European response. It was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio who spoke on Saturday on behalf of the United States at the Art Deco Bayerischer Hof hotel. Rubio is considered less hostile toward Europeans, but his assessment was the same as that of Trump and the vice president. The secretary of state described, as Vance had done a year earlier, the West as plagued by two scourges, "mass migration" and "deindustrialization," which must be fought in order to restore pride to a Western civilization in peril.

Quote: "I now want to speak about the cost of war on the ground. What does one month of war mean for Putin? Just in December, our forces wiped out 35,000 occupying soldiers, killed and badly wounded. In January there were fewer Russian assaults, and as a result, Russia's losses were about 30,000 killed and badly wounded.
There is even a clear price Russia pays for every kilometre of occupied Ukrainian land. On the Donetsk front – it's one of the most intense areas and everyone knows about it – the price Russia pays for one kilometre now is 156 soldiers."
Details: Zelenskyy said Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin "is not concerned about this now, but there is a level at which he will start to care".
He said Russia mobilises about 40,000 people each month, and not all of them reach the front line, so the overall size of the Russian contingent in Ukraine is not growing this year.
Quote: "For our army, the mission is clear: to kill more Russian occupiers, because they are occupiers. And the goal is specific: at least 50,000 per month. Even for Russia, that would be serious, I'm sure. And it would affect Putin's decisions because we are speaking mainly about frontline troops – those leading the assaults and attacks."

Rubio calls for renewed US-Europe alliance in Munich

United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio told European leaders that Washington does not seek the end of the transatlantic era and wants to work “together” with its allies, as the Munich Security Conference opened amid strain over defence and Ukraine.
“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish,” Rubio said in his address.
“For us Americans, our home may be in the western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
Rubio spoke to an audience of nearly 50 heads of state and government at the annual gathering in Bavaria.
He said the United States does not want to act as “caretakers of the west’s managed decline” and urged allies to reform international institutions.
“We do not live in a perfect world,” he said. “The UN and other bodies need urgent reform.”
Rubio called for stronger allies and said Washington would remain direct in its counsel “because we care deeply”.
He said the United States would not step back from efforts to end the war in Ukraine. At the same time, Rubio did not mention Russia by name during his main speech and avoided detailed references to Nato.
Reuters reported that his remarks were notably short on specifics.
The tone of his speech drew a positive response from several European leaders.
Finland’s foreign minister Elina Valtonen said Rubio’s address was “exactly what has been needed both in Europe and in the United States”.
“Now there was a clear gesture of outreach,” she told reporters in Munich. “This is a good basis on which to continue.” Valtonen noted that Rubio repeated the word “together” during his speech.
Finnish President Alexander Stubb met Rubio at the conference venue. The two shook hands at The Economist’s studio before holding formal talks later in the day.
Stubb has said Europe must take greater responsibility for its own security while keeping the United States engaged.
Rubio’s address preceded a panel on Ukraine that included Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola and US Senator Roger Wicker.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy detailed the scale of Russian attacks on his country.
In January alone, Ukraine faced more than 6,000 attack drones, over 150 missiles and more than 5,000 glide bombs, Zelenskyy said.
“There is not a single power plant in Ukraine that has not been damaged,” he told delegates.
He said Russia loses 156 soldiers for every kilometre of Ukrainian territory it captures.

Refugees in Swiss canton train as care assistants
In the refugee training centre in Ringgenberg in western Switzerland, 32 people with asylum or refugee status are currently training to work in nursing care.
+ Get the most important news from Switzerland in your inbox
The centre has been operated by the Bernese Oberland Asylum Association on behalf of canton Bern since August 2025. Over roughly 20 months, refugees receive language tuition and vocational training to help them move into jobs in the care sector.
Ringgenberg is the canton’s second training centre of this kind, after the one in Bellelay. “This shows that early integration is the right approach to give refugees real prospects and help them settle into society from the start,” said Pierre‑Alain Schnegg (Swiss People’s Party), the canton’s director of health, social affairs and integration, during a visit to the centre.
The canton said the initiator of these training programmes – which are unique in Switzerland – also thanked the municipality of Ringgenberg. The local authorities had agreed to convert the former collective accommodation into a training centre.
Fully booked
The first two modules, each with 16 participants, are already fully booked. Once all four courses are up and running, around 60 people will be in training.
All participants in the first group passed their A1 language exam in December. Alongside their language lessons, the trainee nursing assistants also completed practical placements at 14 institutions across the Bernese Oberland. In the final module, they finish their training with a Swiss Red Cross (SRC) certificate.
The first certificates were awarded in Bellelay in mid‑January, according to the authorities. Around 120 people are currently training there, and another centre is planned in Sumiswald.

Russian attack on Thurs night thwarted by missiles Ukraine received on Sunday - Zelenskyy
Ukraine received air defense missiles from its partners last Sunday, and they were already used to repel a Russian attack on the night of Thursday, February 12, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced.
"Our air defense used the missiles that our partners had delivered to us just a few days earlier. They arrived on Sunday. And by Thursday night, these missiles were already defending our skies. And that was just one night, but Russian attacks occur almost every night in Ukraine, and at least once a week, massive strikes are carried out," Zelenskyy said speaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
The President also noted that in January, the Russians launched 6,000 attack drones, more than 150 Russian missiles of various types, and more than 5,000 guided missiles against Ukraine.

Winter Olympics hit by another suspected sabotage of rail services
Italy’s Transport Minister Matteo Salvini says ‘lives at risk’ as services between Milano Cortina Games hit.
Trains operating through the heart of Italy suffered delays of more than an hour on Saturday following the latest suspected act of sabotage during the 2026 Winter Olympics.
Services between Naples in the south and the capital, Rome, were affected, and there were also delays on the line heading north towards Florence.

Transport Minister Matteo Salvini condemned those behind the incidents following similar problems last Saturday on the network and another, less serious case midweek.
The stoppages come as Italy hosts the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo from February 6-22.
“These are hateful criminal acts aimed at workers and at Italy,” Salvini said in a statement.
“I hope that no one plays down or tries to justify these crimes which put lives at risk,” he added.
The authorities were investigating burned cables on a section of the high-speed line between Rome and Naples on Saturday, and two other possible acts of vandalism between the capital and Florence.
An anarchist group claimed responsibility for an attack on the network last Saturday, the first full day of the games, when rail infrastructure was damaged near Bologna, causing delays of up to two and a half hours on high-speed, intercity and regional services.

T20 World Cup: Pakistan ‘always ready’ for India despite late green light
Both teams say they are set for Sunday’s showdown despite the late decision for India’s match with Pakistan to proceed.
Pakistan skipper Salman Agha says his team were “always ready” to face India on Sunday at the T20 World Cup, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.
The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.

The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the Islamabad government made a U-turn on its order to boycott the blockbuster Group A game.
“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Agha said before the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.
“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”
Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the United States by 32 runs. India have also won both their matches so far.
“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Agha.
But he warned: “We have to play good cricket to win the match.”
The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.
Agha believed spin would dominate, calling Tariq Usman his trump card against India’s powerful batting lineup.
“Tariq has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Agha said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Tariq’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.
“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”
Agha hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during their three Asia Cup matches in Dubai last year.
“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” said Agha.
“It has been the norm in cricket for years, but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”
The winner will be guaranteed their berth in the next Super Eights round.
India have a doubt over explosive opener Abhishek Sharma, who has been suffering from a stomach bug.
“I hope he plays tomorrow. I hope he’s recovering well,” said Agha. “We want to play against the best, good luck to him.”

US Department of Homeland Security enters partial shutdown by budget impasse
France

20:37:00 KST

The Department of Homeland Security entered a partial shutdown on Saturday, February 14, as US lawmakers fight over funding the agency overseeing much of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.
At the center of the budget dispute is the department's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents killed two US citizens amid sweeping raids and mass protests in Minneapolis. Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations. In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.
"Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday. "Dramatic changes are needed," Jeffries told a news conference. "Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government."
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that "Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons."
But while DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in last year's government spending bill. Senator John Fetterman pushed against his fellow Democrats, saying: "This shutdown literally has zero impact on ICE."
The primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters. The Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait timecanceled elled flights.
Stalled negotiations
The shutdown would be the third of Trump's second term, including a record 43-day government closure last October and November. The government just reopened from a smaller, four-day partial shutdown earlier this month, also over DHS funding.
Even if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the body's 100 members to advance the budget bill, meaning several Democrats would need to get on board. In response to the Democrats' demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate over immigration enforcement policy. Senate Majority Leader John Thune called it "an extremely serious offer," but warned Democrats are "never going to get their full wish list."
Some concessions were made during the previous shutdown amid Democratic pressure and national outcry after federal agents shot and killed Renee Good, a mother of three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse who worked with military veterans, in Minneapolis last month. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents in the city would wear body cameras "effective immediately" in a move that would be later "expanded nationwide."
The Senate went into recess for a week starting Thursday, but senators could be called back to Washington in case of a rapid leap in negotiations. For the moment, however, talks between the White House and Democrats appear to be at a standstill.

Arundhati Roy quits Berlin film festival after jury chief’s ‘unconscionable’ Gaza remarks
Booker winner says jury’s argument that art shouldn’t be political is ‘jaw-dropping’
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Booker-winning author Arundhati Roy has withdrawn from the Berlin International Film Festival after jury president Wim Wenders said filmmakers should “stay out of politics” when asked about Israel’s war on Gaza.
Roy, who was due to attend a screening of a restored version of her 1989 film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, said she was “shocked and disgusted” by remarks made during a press conference at the festival’s opening on Thursday.
When a reporter asked the jury members for their views on the German government’s “support of the genocide in Gaza” and the festival’s “selective treatment of human rights” issues by speaking out about Ukraine and Iran but not Palestine, Wenders, the chair of the seven-member jury, responded that filmmakers “have to stay out of politics”.
In a statement, Roy called the comments “unconscionable” and said she had decided to withdraw “with deep regret”.
“To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping,” the novelist said. “It’s a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time – when artists, writers and film-makers should be doing everything in their power to stop it.”
Roy, who won the Booker Prize in 1997 for The God of Small Things, said that “what has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the state of Israel”.
“It is supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries in Europe, which makes them complicit in the crime,” she added. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them.”
Roy has long been an outspoken critic of governments in India and abroad and has repeatedly voiced support for the Palestinian cause.
The Berlin festival, commonly known as the Berlinale, is partly funded by the German government. At the same press conference, a jury member, Ewa Puszczyńska, said it was “a bit unfair” to expect the jury to take a stance on the issue.
The festival said it “respected the decision” even though Roy’s presence “would have enriched the festival discourse”.
Israel’s brutal war on Gaza has killed over 71,000 Palestinians so far, reduced the besieged territory to rubble and displaced most of its 2.1 million people. The war began after about 1,200 people were killed during a Hamas attack on southern Israel in October 2023.
A few months into the war, Berlinale was drawn into a controversy after the festival’s documentary award went to No Other Land, a film about the dispossession of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
German officials at the time criticised “one-sided” remarks made about Gaza by the directors of the film and others at the awards ceremony.

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen did not deny reports that US Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not participate in a meeting between European leaders and Vladimir Zelensky on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, organized by the European Commission.
During a panel discussion at the conference, the moderator asked her to comment on reports of Rubio’s absence from the meeting. Von der Leyen sidestepped the question, stating only that she considers it very important for the European Union, the United States and Ukraine to be on the same page.

Iran’s crackdown continues: arrests, disappearances and fear after mass protests
Unknown

Iranian security agents arrived at 2 a.m., pulling up in about half a dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke the sisters, Nyusha, 37, and Mona, 25, forced them to hand over the passwords to their phones and took them away.
The January 16 arrest came a week after the sisters took part in nationwide protests that shook the Islamic Republic, a friend told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
Such arrests have continued for weeks following a sweeping crackdown that crushed demonstrations calling for an end to Iran’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have emerged from major cities and rural towns alike, reflecting what activists describe as a broad dragnet across Iranian society.
University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been detained, along with reformist figures seen as close to President Masoud Pezeshkian. Many detainees are held incommunicado for days or weeks, denied contact with family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. Relatives often search desperately for news of their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says more than 50,000 people were arrested during the crackdown. The AP has not independently verified that figure. Tracking detainees has been difficult after authorities imposed internet blackouts during the unrest.
Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters, said authorities continue to identify participants and detain them. The committee has so far verified the names of more than 2,200 detainees, including 107 university students, 82 minors as young as 13, 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Authorities have reportedly reviewed municipal street cameras, store surveillance footage and drone video to identify demonstrators and track them to their homes or workplaces.
Held for weeks without contact
The protests began in late December, fueled by anger over soaring prices and a collapsing currency. They spread rapidly nationwide, peaking on January 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands rallied in more than 190 cities and towns.
Security forces responded with what activists described as unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency says more than 7,000 people were killed, though it acknowledges the true toll may be higher. On January 21, the Iranian government issued its only official figure, saying 3,117 people had died. In previous unrest, authorities have been accused of undercounting fatalities or not reporting them at all.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, the head of Iran’s judiciary, labeled protesters “terrorists” and called for expedited trials.
“Detentions have been very widespread. It feels like a suffocation of society,” said one protester reached by the AP in Gohardasht, near Tehran. He said two relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the early days of the crackdown, along with several neighbors. He also spoke anonymously out of fear.
The Nakhii sisters were initially taken to Tehran’s Evin Prison, where they were briefly allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. They were later transferred to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran that rights groups have long criticized for overcrowding and poor hygiene.
Other detainees have effectively disappeared. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his January 15 arrest at a factory in Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder requiring medication. Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since being taken from his Tehran home on January 29 by security agents who allegedly beat him.
Authorities have also suspended bank accounts, blocked SIM cards and confiscated property belonging to relatives of protesters or those who publicly support them, according to Musa Barzin, a lawyer with Dadban, a group of Iranian attorneys based abroad.
“In the past, authorities sometimes maintained a veneer of due process. Not this time,” Barzin said. “Following the law is in the worst situation it has ever been.”
Defiance and geopolitical pressure
Despite the crackdown, civic groups continue to issue statements of defiance. The Writers’ Association of Iran described the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.” Teachers’ organizations have urged families to speak publicly about detained minors.
Mohammad Habibi, a spokesman for a teachers’ council, said the group has documented at least 200 minors killed during the crackdown. “Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” he wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”
Anger over the bloodshed compounds economic frustration in a country battered by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The national currency has plunged and inflation has reached record highs.
The crackdown unfolds as tensions rise over Iran’s nuclear program and the possibility of U.S. military action. U.S. President Donald Trump has moved military assets, including aircraft carriers, to the Persian Gulf and said he prefers a deal with Tehran but warned it would be “very difficult” to reach.
Asked recently about regime change, Trump said it “may be the best thing that could happen,” while two U.S. officials told Reuters that the military is preparing contingency plans for a prolonged operation should diplomacy fail.
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran’s last shah and a prominent opposition figure, called on Trump to support the Iranian people. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, Pahlavi said, “The Iranian people heard you say that help is on the way and they trust you. Help them. This is the time to bring the Islamic Republic to an end.”
Iran’s clerical establishment has survived past unrest and foreign pressure. Authorities this week organized large pro-government rallies marking the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said the ferocity of the crackdown signals something deeper. “For the first time,” he said, “the leadership is afraid of being overthrown.”

Taiwanese visits to mainland China topped 3 million in 2025, still below pre-Covid levels
Taiwanese media attributes slow post-pandemic recovery to cross-strait tensions, partial travel bans
According to Taiwan’s Tourism Administration, around 3.24 million Taiwanese visited the mainland last year, nearly 17 per cent more than in 2024.
But this was still 20 per cent lower than the figure for 2019, the year before the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan’s Central News Agency on Saturday attributed the decline to worsening cross-strait relations, the ban on group tours to the mainland since 2020 and Taiwanese travellers’ preference for alternative destinations such as Japan and South Korea.
Tourism across the Taiwan Strait has been significantly disrupted in recent years by shifting political tensions and government policies.
Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te, who took office in 2024, has labelled Beijing as a foreign hostile force, the strongest rhetoric from Taipei to date. Last March, Lai introduced 17 security measures to counter what he called infiltration, espionage and coercion efforts by mainland China.

Bangladesh election winner Tarique Rahman calls for ‘unity to rebuild nation'
BNP chairperson will swear in as prime minister by Feb. 18 as his party secures two-thirds majority
DHAKA, Bangladesh
Tarique Rahman, chairperson of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) that won a two-thirds majority in the recently held general elections, on Saturday called for national unity to rebuild the South Asian country.
The BNP, which secured a landslide victory on Thursday election with 209 seats in the 300-seat parliament, is set form a government with Rahman to become prime minister.
The Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance won 77 seats and will sit on opposition benches, while the Awami League party of Sheikh Hasina, whose government was ousted in 2024 after student protests and a crackdown that killed 1,400 people, was barred from taking part.
"We are taking office at a time when we have to start our journey through a fragile economy, ineffective constitutional institutions, and weak law and order situation left by a fascist regime. However, if the people's strength is with us, no obstacle can stop us," Rahman said in his first address since Thursday's election.
Asked about foreign policy, he said they do not have any country-centric policy, saying it will be decided based on "Bangladeshi interests."
"National unity is our strength, division is our weakness," he said, urging everyone to stay united. "This victory belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to Bangladesh, this victory belongs to the democracy-loving people of the country. From today, we are free."
“We will not tolerate any kind of injustice or illegal activities. Regardless of party, opinion, religion, ethnicity, or differing views, we will not accept any attack by the strong against the weak under any pretext,” he said.

Rubio sticks to Trump's firm stance, takes softer tone in speech to allies

Rubio calls for U.S. and Europe to "revitalize an old friendship" in speech to allies
Munich —Secretary of State Marco Rubio delivered a message of reassurance in remarks at the Munich Security Conference, calming some fears that months of sharp U.S. rhetoric and policy disputes had opened a lasting breach between Washington and its European allies.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history," he said.
Though he admonished European nations for prioritizing welfare programs over self-defense and embracing migration policies that threatened their societal cohesion, he framed his critique as part of a shared reckoning.
"We made these mistakes together, and now together, we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward — to rebuild," he said.
At last year's conference, Vice President JD Vance delivered a combative address that rattled European capitals and fueled fears of an accelerating trans-Atlantic split. In contrast, Rubio paired sharp criticism of the post-Cold War order with repeated affirmations of shared destiny.
He argued that postwar "euphoria" had led the West into a "dangerous delusion" of borderless globalization and overreliance on international institutions.
"This was a foolish idea that ignored both human nature and the lessons of 5,000 years of recorded human history. It has cost us dearly," he said.
Still, Rubio paid homage to what he described as a civilizational bond between the continents.
"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that it is neither our goal nor our wish," Rubio said. "For us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe."
The address drew a standing ovation. Conference chair Wolfgang Ischinger said afterward that the remarks were widely seen as reassuring.
"Mr. Secretary, I'm not sure you heard the sigh of relief through this hall," he told Rubio.
In a brief question-and-answer session, Rubio said efforts to broker an end to Russia's war in Ukraine were continuing, with another round of talks expected Tuesday.
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war; they say they are," he said. "We're going to continue to test it."
On China, Rubio said Washington has "an obligation to communicate" with Beijing, even as "fundamental challenges" remain, and stressed that any engagement must protect U.S. national interests.
Since arriving in Munich, Rubio has met with senior European leaders, including German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, as well as officials from Denmark, Greenland, Poland, Croatia and Moldova. He also met with senior Syrian officials to discuss preserving a ceasefire and protecting minority communities, according to the State Department.
A U.S. official said Rubio did not attend one meeting on Ukraine support due to scheduling conflicts, though he is expected to meet briefly on Saturday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
After Munich, Rubio is set to travel to Bratislava and Budapest, where he is expected to meet Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Europeans reassured but not complacent
The president of the European Union's executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Rubio's speech was "very reassuring" but noted that "in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics," according to the Associated Press.
In her speech to the conference, she stressed that "Europe must become more independent," including on defense, and insisted upon "digital sovereignty" in the continent's approach to hate speech on social media.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that "we shouldn't get in the warm bath of complacency," the Associated Press reported. He said the U.K. must re-forge closer ties with Europe to help the continent "stand on our own two feet" in its own defense, and said there needs to be investment that "moves us from overdependence to interdependence."
Shortly after Rubio's remarks, the United Kingdom said it would send its Carrier Strike Group, led by the largest warship in the Royal Navy and including fighter jets, across the North Atlantic and Arctic. The deployment will visit a U.S. port, and U.S. jets are expected to operate from the deck of the warship, the HMS Prince of Wales. Defense Secretary John Healey said the deployment "will help make Britain warfighting ready, boost our contribution to NATO, and strengthen our operations with key allies, keeping the UK secure at home and strong abroad."
The conference pointed to tensions beyond those in the trans-Atlantic alliance, the Associated Press reported.
Speaking after Rubio, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Beijing felt "gratified" that President Trump respects President Xi Jinping and China, but warned that some voices in the U.S. are leery of China's rise.
"We see that some forces and some people are still trying their best to suppress and contain China, and are still attacking and slandering China by any means," Wang said, according to the Associated Press.
He cautioned that "law of the jungle and unilateralism have taken hold" and said some countries "even revive the Cold War mentality."

Six European Countries to Develop Low-Cost OWE 500+ Cruise Missile: What Are Its Characteristics?

Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, and Sweden have signed an agreement on the joint development and production of an inexpensive cruise missile.
This was reported by Hartpunkt.
It is noted that the document was signed during a meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels. The project will be implemented as part of the European Long Range Strike Approach (ELSA) initiative to create conventional long-range weapons.
In professional circles, the project is known as One Way Effector 500 Plus (OWE 500+).
The idea is to conduct research on the possibility of developing a joint, cost-effective platform that can be equipped with national combat units or other useful payloads.
The production of missiles is planned to be distributed among the participating countries. This should ensure faster scaling of production and increase the resilience of production capacities in the event of the failure of individual enterprises.
The overall concept is to create a weapon that can be purchased at a relatively low price and used in large quantities to overwhelm enemy air defense systems.
According to Hartpunkt sources, the OWE 500+ is designed to deliver a payload of about 50 kg with high precision at a range of up to 500 km.
It is known that the German side plans to use these systems for its land forces.
In December, during a speech at a parliamentary event organized by Förderkreis Deutsches Heer e.V., it was announced that by 2029, the army would form a battery as the basis for a future multi-domain task force.
It is expected to be equipped with high-precision long-range surface-to-surface weapons. According to informed sources, Germany has promised NATO to create three such batteries.

US-EU clash erupts over Trump’s Gaza Board of Peace

US-EU clash erupts over Trump’s Gaza Board of Peace
A transatlantic row over the future of Gaza erupted into public view at the Munich Security Conference, with senior European officials openly challenging Donald Trump’s controversial "Board of Peace", the Guardian has reported.
EU leaders accused the US president of reshaping an originally UN-mandated mechanism into a body that no longer reflects its original legal framework or guarantees Palestinian participation.
The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said the board as currently constituted no longer reflected the original UN security council resolution.
She said the resolution "provided for a Board of Peace for Gaza, but it also provided for it to be limited in time until 2027, it provided for the Palestinians to have a say, and it referred to Gaza, whereas the statute of the Board of Peace makes no reference to any of these things".
"So I think there is a security council resolution but the Board of Peace does not reflect it," she added.
Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, also accused Trump of attempting to bypass the original UN mandate and excluding Europe from the process, despite the EU being one of the main funders of the Palestinian Authority, the Guardian reported.
The remarks mark the first time divisions over Trump’s Gaza initiative have surfaced so publicly at a high level. A meeting of the Board of Peace is due to take place in Washington next week amid uncertainty over the durability of the Gaza ceasefire.
US officials pushed back against the criticism.
In exchanges described by the Guardian as "testy", Mike Waltz dismissed what he called “hand-wringing” about the Board of Peace and said the status quo of repeated war, with Hamas in control of Gaza, had to be broken.
He confirmed that Indonesia had agreed to contribute 8,000 troops to an International Stabilisation Force, with further announcements on troop deployments expected in the coming week.
Waltz also claimed some countries were not comfortable putting billions of dollars in reconstruction funds through the UN system.
Describing Trump’s approach as "focused multilateralism", he said it had been necessary to "put the UN on a diet and make it go back to basics of peacemaking".
The Trump-appointed high representative for Gaza, Nickolay Mladenov, sought to avoid the political row and instead stressed urgency on the ground.
"All of this needs to move very fast. If we do not, we are not going to implement the second phase of the ceasefire but the second phase of the war," he said.
Mladenov said he would not engage with allegations of Israeli genocide and that his focus was improving humanitarian aid, decommissioning weapons held by all factions and ending Gaza’s internal division.
"If we do not address the issue of Hamas and Gaza itself divided into two parts, please tell me how we get to a two-state solution, because I do not see the pathway," he said.
"We are setting ourselves up for complete and utter failure, and the price will be paid by both Israelis and Palestinians down the line."
Democratic senator Chris Murphy raised separate concerns that the board lacked safeguards to prevent reconstruction funds ending up "in the hands of Trump’s friends and cronies", according to the Guardian.
Meanwhile, Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti warned that wider developments in the occupied territories risked undermining any political plan for Gaza.
"The whole of the West Bank has been made open for settlements and Israel is putting the final nail in the coffin of the Oslo accord," he said. "It is not just about accountability for genocide, but who is going to stop this process of killing the two-state solution."

Britain set to deploy aircraft carrier strike group

Keir Starmer has confirmed that the UK will deploy its Carrier Strike Group to the North Atlantic and High North regions later this year, with HMS Prince of Wales set to lead the deployment.
The Prime Minister said the carrier will operate alongside the United States, Canada and other NATO allies, describing the deployment as “a powerful show of our commitment to Euro-Atlantic security.”
The announcement places the Royal Navy’s flagship at the centre of a renewed focus on the High North, a region increasingly framed by NATO as strategically critical amid heightened Russian military activity and competition over Arctic routes and infrastructure.
Starmer also linked the move to wider European deterrence efforts, saying it was part of the UK’s commitment to NATO security. “That is also why we’re enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France,” he said.
He added: “For decades, the United Kingdom has been the only nuclear power in Europe to commit its deterrent to protect all NATO members.”
HMS Prince of Wales, commissioned in 2019, is one of the Royal Navy’s two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers and is capable of operating an air wing of up to 24 F-35B Lightning II aircraft, alongside helicopters such as Merlin, Chinook, Apache and Wildcat. The carrier previously led Operation Highmast, an eight-month deployment to the Indo-Pacific in 2025, including exercises with India and other regional partners, underlining the UK’s ability to operate at range while maintaining NATO-linked commitments.

Separate talks on Iran and Ukraine-Russia set for Tuesday in Geneva, source says
Two sets of diplomatic negotiations, on Ukraine and Iran, are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters news agency on Friday.
A US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, the source said. Representatives from Oman will be on hand and mediate the US-Iran contacts, the source said.
Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
President Donald Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large US naval presence in the region.
Meanwhile, the exiled son of Iran's last shah called on US President Donald Trump on Saturday to help the Iranian people and said it was "time to end the Islamic republic".
"To President Trump... The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them," the US-based Reza Pahlavi told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.
Trump had said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
He is also trying to coax Ukraine and Russia into an agreement to end Moscow's four-year-old invasion of Ukraine.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Saturday that he did not know if Russia was serious about ending its war against Ukraine.
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war," he told the Munich Security Conference, with the conflict soon set to enter its fifth year.

Finland welcomes Marco Rubio's comments on transatlantic unity

Finland's political leaders have welcomed comments by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on transatlantic unity during his speech at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
"In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe," Rubio said.
Finnish foreign minister Elina Valtonen (NCP) told reporters that Rubio's speech was "exactly what has been needed both in Europe and in the United States", adding that it was a welcome change in tone compared to the rhetoric at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos last month.
"Now there was a clear gesture of outreach; this is a good basis on which to continue," Valtonen said, noting that Rubio repeatedly used the word "together".
News agency Reuters reported however that Rubio's speech was "notably short on specifics", as he did not mention Russia once during his half-hour address nor did he specifically refer to Nato by using the alliance's name.
Finnish President Alexander Stubb is also attending the conference, and he is due to meet with Rubio later on Saturday. The pair encountered each other briefly as Stubb was leaving The Economist's on-site studio at the summit, just as Rubio was arriving.
Altogether nearly 50 heads of state and government are attending this year's annual conference, which aims to promote conflict resolution via improved international cooperation and dialogue.

‘Not on the menu, but at the table’: China’s top diplomat urges EU to engage Russia over Ukraine war
'Europe should not watch this from the sidelines,' says Wang Yi
ISTANBUL
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday emphasized the importance of the EU's participation in peace negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war, urging Europe to be "not on the menu" but "at the table."
Asked what China could do to convince Russia end its war on Ukraine at the Munich Security Conference, Wang said: "Europe should not watch this from the sidelines. Right here, in Munich last year at that time United States had started engagement with Russia, and Europe seemed to be left watching from the sidelines ... Europe has every right to participate in the negotiation in due course. ... Europe should not be on the menu, but should be at the table."
He added that "China is not a party directly involved," and promotes dialogue for peace.
"Now we're seeing that Europe has come up with the courage to talk with Russia," he said, urging Europe to come up with new ideas and plans.
The US, Russia and Ukraine are currently holding trilateral dialogue to end the war that continues since February 2022, which has been hailed by Wang.
Wang said the EU and China are “partners who are not systemic rivals or strategic competitors.”
"We acknowledge that we there are differences and divergences between us, but that doesn't mean that we couldn't reach better harmony," he said. "It is more important for China and the EU to practice multilateralism, to safeguard the authority of the United Nations, to say no to unilateral practices, and to safeguard free trade and oppose block confrontation." He was answering another question about "China's strategy to convince Europeans that it's a good idea and not a bad idea to engage more strongly with China."
The Chinese foreign minister also hailed the UN. “Without the UN ... many medium and small sized countries would lose the multilateral foundation critical to their survival and development,” he said, blaming "certain countries seeking to magnify differences and disagreements" for why the international system "is not functioning well enough."
He urged major countries to lead in advancing cooperation, observing rules, promoting equality, encouraging openness.
Wang emphasized that "the realization of ceasefire and reconstruction will require unremitting efforts" to implement the two-state solution in Gaza and that "restoring justice to the Palestinian people is the unstable responsibility of the international community."
He also said that the situation in Iran "has a direct impact on peace in the Middle East."
The three-day Munich Security Conference began on Friday and brings together dozens of heads of state and government, ministers and senior officials from around the world.
- 2 ways for US-China relations
Wang said that US-China relations have two roads ahead, diverging from each other.
One is the one where Washington "can understand China reasonably and objectively and have a positive and pragmatic policy toward China and our two sides work together in the same direction, expand our interests that will lead us to cooperation," which would be the "best outcome for both countries and the world," he said.
The other, he added, is "seeking decoupling from China and severing supply chains, and opposing China on everything in a purely emotional knee jerk way," such as efforts to "split Taiwan" from China.
It "would very much likely push China and the US toward conflict," Wang said.
China wants to see "the first prospect, and I believe you share the same way, but China is well prepared to address all kinds of risks."

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio rejected the idea that the Western alliance is weakening.
Addressing the Munich Security Conference, he noted that after World War II many also believed that Western dominance had come to an end. "In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish," he said. "We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West's managed decline," Rubio emphasized. He added that Washington needs strong allies who are proud of their culture and heritage and are prepared to defend a shared civilization.

Bangladesh PM-to-be celebrates landslide win, thanks protesters
Prime minister-in-waiting Tarique Rahman dedicated his victory to those who ‘sacrificed for democracy’ after the first polls since a deadly 2024 uprising
Bangladesh’s prime minister-in-waiting Tarique Rahman on Saturday dedicated his landslide election win to those who “sacrificed for democracy”, calling for unity after the first polls since a deadly 2024 uprising.
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader Rahman, 60, the scion of one of the most powerful political dynasties, is set to lead the South Asian nation of 170 million people after sweeping elections on Thursday.
“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” he said, in his first speech since the vote. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”
He will take over from an interim government that has steered Bangladesh since the student-led uprising ended the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.
Rahman’s success marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political turmoil.
The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance of 11 political parties, according to the Electoral Commission.

The Simpsons showrunner says series will ‘never have a finale’
Unusual way long-running animated series would end has been revealed
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The Simpsons fans have long been predicting the show will end soon, but the animated series’s showrunner has now shed light on what that would look like.
The series, which premiered in 1989, is on its 37th season and 800th episode – and it’s being speculated that the forthcoming film, a sequel to 2007’s The Simpsons Movie, could serve as its swansong.
Should the show come to an end, though, Matt Selman is adamant it won’t be your standard season finale and would merely seem like just another episode.
“We did an episode about a year-and-a-half ago that was like a parody of the series finale,” he said.
“We jammed every possible series finale concept into one show, so that was sort of my way of saying we’re never going to do a series finale.”
He told TheWrap the episode “made fun of all the ideas of wrapping everything up or ending”, adding: “If the show ever did end, there’s no finale; it would just be a regular episode that has the family in it. Probably a little Easter egg here and there, but no ‘I’m going to miss this place.’”
Selman said The Simpsons “isn’t supposed to change” each week, stating: “The characters reset every week. It’s like Groundhog Day, but they don’t know it – and they don’t die that much.”
Despite Selman’s comments, the show has killed off several characters in recent years.
In November, The Simpsons killed off Alice Glick, the organist in Springfield’s church, who died during a service being led by Reverend Lovejoy.
Alice Glick was introduced in season two episode 21, “Three Men and a Comic Book”, which aired in 1991, and was voiced by Cloris Leachman. Tress MacNeille took over the role following Leachman’s death in 2021.
Executive producer Tim Long confirmed Glick’s death, telling People: “In a sense, Alice the organist will live forever, through the beautiful music she made. But in another, more important sense, yep, she's dead as a doornail.”
The year before, The Simpsons killed off Larry the Barfly, a beloved character who had featured on the show since season 10.
In response to an outcry from viewers, Long said: “I’m sorry if some fans are upset, but we really wanted to use Larry’s death as a way to show that even the most peripheral people in our lives have dignity and worth, and that we really shouldn’t take anyone for granted.”

Massive Russian drone and missile attacks kill five Ukranians right before Munich summit

In Munich, leaders are discussing a "June deadline" for peace ahead of trilateral talks in Geneva on Tuesday.
Russian forces launched a massive aerial strike and drone attacks across Ukraine, primarily using 112 kamikaze drones like the Shahed, Gerbera, and Iskander-M ballistic missiles, between Friday evening and Saturday morning, according to Ukraine's air force.
It is reported that 91 of 112 drones were downed, and at least 18 of them hit 11 locations.
As a result, in Odesa, one woman in a residential fire was killed, in Zaporizhzhia, one was killed, three were wounded, and in Sumy, a 44-year-old woman was killed, three were injured, and in Kherson, two were killed, one of them a 52-year-old man, and four were wounded, according to agencies and Ukrainian media.
Also, in Kyiv Oblast, a man and a woman were hospitalised with injuries, and in Kharkiv Oblast, a Russian drone strike on the village of Fesky injured a 22-year-old man, regional governors reported.
"The fire was quickly extinguished by rescue workers. Unfortunately, a woman was killed in the attack," posting on Telegram, the governor of the southern Ukrainian region, Oleg Kiper, said on Saturday morning.
"Over the last 24 hours, the invaders carried out 655 strikes on 41 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region," the regional military chief, Ivan Fedorov, said.
Ukraine strikes back
Meanwhile, Russian regional Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov confirmed that a Ukrainian missile strike killed two people and wounded five in the Russian border city of Belgorod on Friday.
And the same day, a Russian ammunition depot was struck near the settlement of Novoekonomichne in Russian-occupied Donetsk Oblast, according to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
Right before the security conference
The strikes coincide with the Munich Security Conference, where German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio are discussing military aid and the "June deadline" for a peace deal, a deadline reportedly set by the Trump administration that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has publicly acknowledged.
Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and has been meeting with multiple allies, is expected to address the meeting on Saturday.
No Russian officials have been invited to this year's summit, which marks a continuation of the exclusion policy following the 2022 invasion.
On the other hand, trilateral talks between Russia, Ukraine, and the US are confirmed for Tuesday and Wednesday in Geneva, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said in a statement carried by Russian news agencies.

NAIROBI, Feb 14 - The Ethiopian Media Authority has declined to renew the accreditation for three Addis Ababa-based journalists from Reuters, the news agency said.
The EMA also revoked the news agency's accreditation to cover the 39th African Union summit, which was taking place in the Ethiopian capital on February 14-15.
The move comes days after the news agency published an investigative report that said Ethiopia was hosting a secret camp to train thousands of fighters for the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group in neighbouring Sudan. Ethiopia has not publicly commented on the story.
While the EMA has informally indicated that the February 10 Reuters story prompted its decision, it has not made an official statement.
"Reuters is reviewing the matter and will continue to cover Ethiopia in an independent, impartial and reliable way in keeping with the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles," Reuters said in a statement.

Palestinian president calls for lifting Israeli obstacles to Gaza truce

20:16:00 KST

Palestinian President Mahmud Abbas on Saturday urged the removal of what he described as Israeli-imposed obstacles to advancing the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire.
"We emphasize the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement," Abbas said, in a speech read by his prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the day-to-day governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to "ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery", the president said.
Abbas accused Israel of "continuing to violate" the ceasefire agreement that took effect in October and ended Israel's two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The U.N. estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
"From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed (in Gaza), which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase," Abbas added.
Even though the U.S.-brokered truce entered its second phase last month, Israel has continued airstrikes across the territory, killing 591 and injuring over 1,578 others.
The deal is aimed at permanently ending the war in Gaza and was endorsed in November by the United Nations.
Its second phase stipulates that Israeli forces gradually withdraw from Gaza and Palestinian group Hamas should disarm, with an international stabilization force deployed to ensure security.
Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
The Israeli army still occupies more than half of the Gaza Strip.
Fifteen Palestinian experts on the technocratic committee, which is being overseen by a "Board of Peace" set up by U.S. President Donald Trump, are currently based in Egypt, despite a partial reopening on Feb. 2 of the Rafah border crossing, Gaza's only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel.

Indian Air Force to help train British jet pilots

Indian Air Force instructors are set to begin training Royal Air Force fast jet pilots at RAF Valley under a new agreement that may also help ease long-running pressure on Britain’s military flying training pipeline.
The British High Commission in New Delhi confirmed that three Indian Qualified Flying Instructors (QFIs) will deploy to RAF Valley for an initial two-year period, marking the first time Indian instructors will directly support fast jet training for RAF pilots at the base.
RAF Valley, located in Anglesey, is central to the UK’s fast jet training system, hosting training aircraft such as the Hawk T2 and Texan T1. The announcement comes after repeated concerns raised in defence circles about bottlenecks across the wider UK Military Flying Training System.
The High Commission said the move was agreed following the 19th UK–India Air Staff Talks in New Delhi, describing it as part of a broader effort to expand military training engagement between the two air forces.
Air Vice Marshal Ian Townsend, Assistant Chief of the Air Staff, said the agreement was “a significant step” in strengthening ties between the two services. “Bringing Indian QFIs into UK Military Flying Training Systems deepens our cooperation, enhances interoperability and reinforces our shared commitment to excellence in aircrew training,” he said.
“Together, we are investing in the foundation of a long-term collaboration and shaping a partnership that is both enduring and strategic in its outlook.”
The British Defence Adviser in New Delhi, Commodore Chris Saunders, also emphasised the wider strategic framing of the initiative, linking it to the long-term UK–India defence agenda. “The forthcoming deployment of Indian Qualified Flying Instructors to the UK represents another significant milestone in our expanding defence relationship,” he said.
“It reinforces the mutual trust and shared experience that underpins our training cooperation and exemplifies the increasingly sophisticated levels of interoperability we are building together across our services.”
The agreement follows a separate development earlier this year, when an Indian Air Force officer was deployed as an instructor to RAF College Cranwell, the UK’s air officer training academy. UK officials said this meant all three of Britain’s military academies now host Indian instructors from their respective services, including at Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.
The High Commission added that the Indian instructors will remain under Indian Air Force command while carrying out instructional duties under RAF commanders at Valley.

In 400 of Kyiv’s more than 2,000 residential buildings, utility workers have restored heating following the enemy attack on the night of February 12, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko.
"Heating has been restored in 400 Kyiv buildings," he wrote on Telegram.
Klitschko added that utility workers are working to restore heat to other high-rise buildings that were left without power supply as a result of the enemy attack on Kyiv’s infrastructure on February 12.
"As a reminder, 2,600 residential buildings were left without heat at that time," the mayor emphasized.

Geneva burkini ban blocked after government rules proposal unlawful
A proposal to effectively ban the burkini in Geneva’s public pools was blocked on Friday after the cantonal government ruled it unlawful.

In Geneva, the right‑wing majority in the cantonal parliament was set on Friday to approve a bill regulating swimwear in public pools, a move that would have effectively banned the burkini. But the cantonal government stepped in, ruling the proposal unlawful and halting the process by cancelling the final debate.
+ Is the Swiss burka ban a tyranny of the majority?
The issue is expected to return to the cantonal parliament at a future session, as the executive must now put forward legally compliant alternatives. Carole‑Anne Kast, member of the cantonal government and head of the Department of Institutions, criticised the bill, calling it “completely disproportionate and a blatant violation of women’s rights and freedoms”.
The cantonal parliament had originally been debating a proposal put forward by the Swiss People’s Party to introduce penalties for wearing the burkini in public pools. Green Party member Dilara Bayrak condemned it as “a sexist and xenophobic bill”. Calling the debate unworthy of the canton, she urged that women be free to dress as they choose.
Government warns of disproportionate restrictions
Yves Nidegger, from the Swiss People’s Party, argued that “we live in a society where women don’t need to be covered up to avoid being assaulted”. With that, the tone of the debate, not the first of its kind in Geneva’s parliament, was set. But proceedings soon shifted into more technical territory.

Burkini permitted in Geneva city swimming pools
A majority, comprising the Swiss People’s Party, the Radical-Liberal Party, the Centre Party and almost all the Geneva Citizens’ Movement members, backed an amendment from the Centre. The proposal, presented by Alia Chaker Mangeat, recast the original text as a new bill on public swimming pools and baths, sidestepping the issue of banning the burkini through criminal law. Most lawmakers considered a criminal‑law route excessive.
Burkini ban push stalls
The amendment specifies that “the only clothing allowed in swimming pools is one‑piece or two‑piece swimwear that does not extend below the knee and leaves the arms uncovered”. In practice, this excludes the burkini. “Public spaces should be places of emancipation, not of pressure,” said Mangeat, who voiced concern about a resurgence of conservative attitudes.
When pressed on holding a third debate, the step needed for a final vote, Kast avoided giving a direct answer. She pointed instead to a series of practical and legal complications that, she said, made the bill unworkable, including the autonomy of the communes and the costs linked to enforcing the rules.

Gisèle Pelicot wants to look ex-husband ‘straight in the eye’ as she needs answers

Gisèle Pelicot has said she needs to visit prison to look her abusive ex-husband “straight in the eye” after his conviction for drugging her and inviting dozens of men to rape her in a case that shocked France and the rest of the world.
Pelicot, 73, said she needed “answers” from Dominique Pelicot over the potential abuse of their daughter and the case of an estate agent who was raped and murdered in 1991, which he is under investigation for.
Dominique Pelicot was jailed for 20 years by a French court in December 2024 after being found guilty of the attacks, alongside 50 other men whom he invited to rape and sexually assault his wife. There are thought to have been at least 70 perpetrators but police have not been able to identify them all.
Questions also remain over whether the couple’s daughter, Caroline Darian, was also abused by Dominique, something that caused a rift when Darian accused her mother of not believing her when police discovered two photos of her unconscious and wearing underwear she did not recognise.
Pelicot said the revelations had not brought the family together, instead describing them as “an explosion that blows everything away”, but she is rebuilding her relationship with her daughter whom she now speaks to every day on the phone.
She told the New York Times that the uncertainty for Darian was “inescapable hell”. “There are those two photos of her asleep that open up a lot of questions. But I don’t have any answers, and Monsieur Pelicot didn’t give her any answers either.”
Pelicot said of her ex-husband: “I hope that when we’re face to face, he’ll be able to tell me the truth, both about his daughter and about everything else he’s now accused of. Maybe he’ll have some remorse. I’m still holding on to that hope. Maybe I’m naive, maybe I won’t get an answer.”
Pelicot described the day in November 2020 when she had been brought into the station to discuss, she thought, an incident where her then husband was caught filming up women’s skirts.
She saw a police officer’s “face start to change” as he pointed to a stack of files. She was asked if she recognised herself in a photo of a woman being raped by a man she did not know.
“And of course I didn’t recognise myself, because I was with a man I didn’t know, who was raping me. I said: ‘I don’t know this man’ … He shows me a second photo, which is pretty much the same, and he says: ‘That’s you there.’ I say no, and he says: ‘This is your room, Madame Pelicot, these are your bedside lamps. We searched your home, these are your belongings.’”
The police officer told her Dominique was in custody and that 53 people had been arrested. “He tells me that I have been raped about 200 times. I say: ‘But that’s not possible.’ And then I ask for a glass of water because I can’t talk any more.”
She described later watching the videos. “I’m a rag doll. It’s as if I’ve come out of surgery, because I’m completely anaesthetised. These men, when you see what they’re doing to me – how is it possible that my body couldn’t feel anything? … Fortunately for me, I have no memories, because I think I would have killed myself afterward.”
She described feeling shame and spending “hours in the shower trying to wash away this filth, this dirt that makes you feel dehumanised”.
Pelicot also talked about specific incidents, including a crown on one of her teeth coming loose, which she later realised was caused by oral rape.
“When I discovered the videos showing the violence these men inflicted on me, in my limp mouth – they have to hold my head because my face is falling, I have no muscle tone – and Monsieur Pelicot doesn’t even react. There is no empathy, no pity for this woman who is there, completely dead in her bed. It was incredibly violent to tell myself that even that, they didn’t spare me.”
During the trial, Pelicot waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse. “The shame is theirs,” she famously stated of her abusers – and became a global feminist icon, leaving court each day to applause from gathered crowds.
Support poured in from high-profile people, including the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who thanked her for her “dignity and courage”, and Queen Camilla of the UK.
In a letter, Camilla wrote to express her “heartfelt admiration for the courage, grace and dignity with which you have faced the horrific crimes committed against you”.
Speaking to BBC Newsnight at the weekend, Pelicot said: “I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.”

German military expert: Ukraine and Russia too far apart for peace
German military expert Christian Moelling said this in a comment to Ukrinform.
"The key question is whether there is any room for maneuver for both sides – for the Russians and the Ukrainians. My impression is that right now it is almost impossible, because Putin cannot go home with what is currently on the negotiation table, but Zelensky also cannot go home with what is on the table," the expert said.
He believes the situation has effectively reached a deadlock and admits he does not feel optimistic. At the same time, Moelling hopes developments could lead to a solution acceptable to both sides.
When asked whether U.S. President Donald Trump could end Russia's war against Ukraine, Moelling noted that the U.S. leader himself seems to think so.
"But it depends on how strongly he [Trump] wants to pressure the Ukrainians. And obviously, he is not prepared to put too much pressure on the Russians," the expert added.
As previously reported, Trump recently said that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to "get moving" to avoid missing a "great opportunity" to reach a peace deal, as Russia, in his view, wants such an agreement.
The next trilateral meeting of representatives from Ukraine, the U.S., and Russia is scheduled to take place in Geneva on February 17-18.

Four-week-old infant in Ashdod died of respiratory failure, Health Ministry says

The Health Ministry announced the cause of death for a four-week-old baby who passed away at Samson Assuta Ashdod University Hospital as respiratory failure on Friday.
The announcement was made after the conclusion of an external review committee ordered by the Director General of the Health Ministry after the infant’s death was reported on February 7.
The Health Ministry investigation revealed that the baby had consumed Nutrilon products from a recalled batch before its death.
The Nutrilon formula, which was recalled by Teva Israel in late January, was pulled from shelves due to toxin levels exceeding acceptable threshold values.
Cereulide, a toxin produced by certain strains of the bacteria Bacillus cereus, was found in multiple batches of Nutrilon formula. The presence of the toxin was caused by a malfunction in the production process of the baby formula, a Health Ministry statement published at the time of the recalls stated.
The consumption of Cereulide toxin can cause vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cramps in infants, but it has not been proven to cause death.
Further testing, investigation ordered by Health Ministry
According to the Health Ministry statement, the National Center for Forensic Medicine determined that the infant’s death in Ashdod was not caused by Cereulide consumption.
Despite Cereulide toxicity being ruled out, the Health Ministry ordered that additional tests be conducted and stated that “the external review committee will also examine this issue,” adding that the committee's further conclusions will determine whether any additional action is needed.
The Health Ministry stated that they share the family of the infant’s grief and affirmed that it will “continue to act with full transparency, thoroughly and quickly to clarify the circumstances of the case, and will update on the findings and conclusions of the examination.”
Dr. Itay Gal contributed to this report.

Palomino: Taste the latest Italian creations at a Jerusalem favorite - restaurant review

I have been a fan of Palomino since it opened in Jerusalem almost five years ago, especially their Friday brunch, which I think is one of the best deals around. It includes both an extensive buffet and a dish ordered from the menu for NIS 109 per person.
In fact, I like to think that I may have had a little to do with the brunch menu, as I reviewed it when it first started. (www.jpost.com/food-recipes/article-739786) and told Alon Ravia, one of the four owners who have been friends since childhood, that the only thing missing was something sweet to end the meal. The next time I went, they had small squares of delicious chocolate cake at the end of the buffet. Mission accomplished.
Visiting Palomino is like taking a trip to Italy, as the dishes offer classic Italian fare. They have now launched a new menu of specials called Chef’s Table, which will rotate every two months. The specials are meant for “sharing,” the new trend in Israeli restaurants. My favorite husband and I found all the specials that we tried creative and unique.
We started with a cocktail, which always makes a meal feel special. I had a rum-based “girly” drink, which was delicious and not too sweet. Cliff had a twist on a whisky sour, which was also good (but not as good as mine!).
From the Chef’s Table menu, we started with the crudo of red tuna (NIS 78), which was slices of red tuna in a blood-orange vinaigrette with fleur de sel and a disk of marmalade made from limoncello. It was absolutely delicious, although a relatively small portion.
We moved on to the gnocchi ricotta (NIS 68), also from the specials menu, which was gnocchi made from ricotta cheese instead of potato; it came in a cream of Parmigiana sauce with thyme and chives. I’d never had gnocchi made from ricotta before, and they were light and creamy.
We also tried the tortellini de zucca (NIS 69), which were handmade tortellini filled with pumpkin cream in a salsa sauce, with crumbled amaretto cookies (also made in-house) on top. No need to say anything else! Since the portions are relatively small, we shared a delicious sea bass with gnocchi in a lemon cream sauce from the regular menu (NIS 138) before moving on to dessert.
'Crime against the palate to skip dessert'
Remember, this is a dairy restaurant, so it’s basically a crime against the palate to skip dessert. We tried the only dessert from the specials menu, which was kassis gelato (NIS 41) – blackcurrant ice cream made at the restaurant. Then we couldn’t resist the cannoli, which is worth a special trip to Palomino. Cannoli in Italy is often made with lard, so this is a good opportunity to try this iconic Italian dessert. It consisted of three small tubes of fried pastry dough with a sweet filling made with ricotta. Worth every calorie. We ate it below a neon sign on the wall that reads, “Leave the gun and take the cannoli.”
The specials menu is a great addition to Palomino’s regular menu and well worth a try.

Jeffrey Epstein ‘asked Andrew to fix him a meeting with Gaddafi’
It comes as police held discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service over allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with the late paedophile
- Bookmark
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor spoke to a Libyan contact to help arrange a meeting for Jeffrey Epstein with Colonel Gaddafi in Tripoli, emails appear to show.
Messages within the latest release by the US Department of Justice of its Epstein files, from autumn 2010, show that the disgraced financier contacted royal aide David Stern, saying [sic] “i want to go to tripoli lets organize with pa”.
The paedophile then appears to have sent another email to Mr Stern, writing: “people that have seen the father, have asked me if i want to meet him as he does not know where to put his money as opposed to what to do with it, currencies etc, I wondered if Pa should make the intro instead.”
The emails were first unearthed from the Epstein files by Channel 4 News, which reported that “the father” refers to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, to distinguish him from his well-known son Saif.
The initials “PA” are believed to refer to the then Prince Andrew, and this is how Mr Stern and Epstein appear to refer to him in multiple emails.
It appears that Mr Stern then consulted Andrew, in a reply dated the following day, 8 October 2010, writing: “He is thinking about the best approach and will discuss with me when I see him next on 17th Oct in Hong Kong (he is leaving today for Asia).”
The former Duke of York made an official visit to China in October 2010, and was the UK’s trade envoy at the time.
Later emails from “The Duke”, signed “A”, to Epstein’s address, say: “I will call you later this evening after I have had my chat with my Libyan contact to see what we can arrange for you in Tripoli.”
On the same day, 4 November 2010, “A” follows up to Epstein, writing: “Libya fixed. Call me whenever.”
It comes after Thames Valley Police said on Wednesday that they had held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with Epstein.
It appears that the planned meeting between Epstein and Gaddafi did not go ahead, as Epstein did not end up flying to the Libyan capital, Channel 4 News reported.
Elsewhere, in emails from June and July 2010, it appears that “A” discussed a loan from Libya to Dubai with an investment banker called Terence Allen.
Mr Allen wrote: “In light of our conversation last week in relation to Dubai, is there anything I can do there for you??”
“The Duke” replied: “Good question! I know that the only person who can make this decision is the Colonel himself. I will just ask our Libyan friend Tareq to see where he is on the subject, as he has the ear of the private office of Brother Leader.”
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been contacted for comment.

Marco Rubio tells Europe Trump expects ‘seriousness and reciprocity’
‘We care deeply about your future and ours,’ says US Secretary of State at Munich Security Conference
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Marco Rubio, the US Secretary of State, has sought to mend transatlantic ties at the Munich Security Conference, despite also delivering a stark critique of Western nations’ missteps over the past four decades.
His address offered a significant contrast to a blistering attack on America’s European allies made by vice president JD Vance in 2025.
Mr Rubio insisted that the fate of the United States and Europe “will always be intertwined”, stating that Donald Trump “demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe” because “we care deeply about your future and ours”.
However, he also criticised the United Nations and warned that the "rules-based global order" that emerged after the Cold War had been a "dangerous delusion". The conference agenda is dominated by European defence and the future of the transatlantic relationship, particularly as America’s commitment to Nato faces scrutiny.
Amidst these discussions, Mr Rubio notably failed to attend a meeting of Ukraine’s allies, who gathered on Friday as the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion approaches.
US officials cited scheduling conflicts, but his absence was perceived by some Europeans as a sign of the White House’s diminishing interest in involving them in efforts to end the conflict.
In his speech, Mr Rubio affirmed: "We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive because the two great wars of the last century serve for us as history’s constant reminder that, ultimately, our destiny is and will always be intertwined with yours. Because we know that the fate of Europe will never be irrelevant to our own."
He suggested that the West’s victory in the Cold War had fostered complacency, telling attendees: "The euphoria of this triumph led us to a dangerous delusion that we had entered, quote, The End of History, that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood, that the rules-based global order – an overused term – would now replace the national interest, and that we would now live in a world without borders, where everyone became a citizen of the world."
Mr Rubio acknowledged that "we made these mistakes together, and now together, we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild."
He further claimed that the UN was among the global institutions requiring reform, adding: "We cannot ignore that today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role." Wolfgang Ischinger, the conference chairman, noted a "sigh of relief through this hall" during Mr Rubio’s speech, highlighting its divergence from Mr Vance’s earlier remarks.

R48 Chef’s Table: A Far East testing menu in Tel Aviv - restaurant review
Unknown

11:11:31 UTC
20:11:31 KST

Just inside the hotel lobby at R48, located off Rothschild Boulevard, a small dining room fills quietly in the early evening. There is no sense of urgency. Guests settle in knowing the night ahead will unfold course by course, guided entirely by the chef. The experience is as aesthetically pleasing as it is delicious.
This is R48 Chef’s Table, an intimate fine-dining experience led by chef Ohad Solomon. With just nine tables and 22 seats, it has become one of Tel Aviv’s most sought-after reservations, often booked weeks in advance by diners celebrating milestones or seeking a serious tasting-menu experience.
Indulging in the season
The current winter tasting menu at R48 Chef’s Table draws inspiration from across the Far East, exploring a range of techniques, aromas, and contrasts rather than adhering to a single tradition. The result is a 12-course progression that builds gradually, with the season expressed mainly through ingredients. The price is NIS 620 per person, including soft drinks.
The menu opens with a Lion’s Mane “Pie Tee”: an ultra-thin crisp shell filled with porcini cream, topped with seared lion’s mane mushroom, thin slices of king oyster mushroom, and mushroom powder. It’s served alongside a sake and lavender sphere, created using a technique that encapsulates the liquid into a bubble that bursts as you bite into it.
The Cheung Fun course is bright and aromatic: a broth infused with kaffir lime, galangal (a root from the ginger family), and lemongrass, poured over somen (thin Japanese wheat noodles) and zucchini noodles, accompanied by a black cod roll wrapped in rice paper. Ginger salsa and fresh herbs complete the dish.
Another standout plate features appam, a South Indian-style fermented rice bread that’s thin, airy, and lightly tangy. It’s paired with small parcels wrapped in pickled nori, filled with soybeans and pak boong (water spinach); finished off with thin slices of local sirloin.
For those who prefer a fish and dairy menu or avoid seafood altogether, the team is happy to accommodate.
The menu concludes with a new, show-stopping dessert: Rice & Koji, Jaggery Caramel, and Toasted Coconut. I was tempted to ask for another.
Beyond wine pairings
In addition to classic and premium wine pairing options, priced at NIS 250 and NIS 450 respectively, R48 Chef’s Table offers a cocktail-based spirits pairing that has become one of its signatures. In fact, it’s the only restaurant in the country offering a cocktail pairing alongside a tasting menu, and it’s a complete yes.
The beverage program is led by Nika, R48’s sommelier and head of beverages. Nearly everything in the cocktails, aside from the base spirits, is made in-house, including seasonal syrups and infusions developed specifically to match the menu. Standout pairings include a tequila-based cocktail and a rich cognac cocktail, both designed to mirror the flavors on the plate. I’m still thinking about both.
A non-alcoholic pairing is also available and crafted with the same attention to structure and progression, priced at NIS 280.
One chef, two experiences
It’s worth noting that R48 operates a dual culinary concept, with two restaurants serving distinct purposes. On Rothschild Boulevard, the R48 Brasserie is a street-facing Mediterranean restaurant built around à la carte dining, business lunches, and lively evenings. Inside the hotel, the Chef’s Table offers a focused, high-end tasting menu designed for guests who want to fully commit to the chef’s vision for the evening.
Together, the two restaurants allow R48 to operate across different moods and moments, while maintaining a consistent culinary identity thanks to Solomon, whose path to R48 is rooted in some of Tel Aviv’s most formative kitchens.
After completing stages in Italy, France, and London, Solomon returned to Israel to work at Toto, long regarded as one of the country’s most demanding culinary training grounds. He later joined the R2M group, spending nearly a decade as head chef of Coffee Bar. Three years ago, he left Coffee Bar to establish R48.
The Chef’s Table opened first as a tightly focused project, allowing him to explore the tasting-menu format without compromise. Nearly a year later, the Brasserie followed, expanding the concept into a more accessible, everyday setting.
At home, Solomon says he tends to cook simply. But dining out, in his view, should deliver something layered and unexpected. That mindset led him toward the cuisines of the Far East, which serve as the inspiration behind the Chef’s Table winter menu.
Justifying fine dining in Israel
Solomon sees the growing interest in chef-driven tasting menus as part of a broader shift in Israel’s dining culture. Diners are increasingly curious, well traveled, and open to committing time and attention to a meal.
“These menus offer a complete journey,” he says. “Guests let go, trust the chef, and step into something intentional.” But that trust comes with responsibility. “If you want to charge at a high level, the experience has to justify it every night.”
The winter menu will run through April, after which a spring-inspired version will be introduced. Take a seat at R48 Chef’s Table to see how a seasonal menu unfolds in the hands of a confident chef.

MSF halts non-critical operations in Gaza's Nasser hospital amid sightings of armed men, weapons

Doctors Without Borders (MSF) announced the suspension of all noncritical medical operations in Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza after reports emerged of armed men using the facility to move weapons and interrogate patients on Saturday.
“In recent months, in Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis, patients and MSF personnel have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the large compound of the hospital,” the nonprofit organization said in a statement published on its website.
It also specified that these situations occurred in parts of the medical compound where the MSF is not conducting activities.
“With an uptick since the ceasefire, MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts – including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients, and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons,” MSF said, adding that “these incidents pose serious security threats to our teams and patients.”
The organization said that “MSF formally expressed our strong concern to the relevant authorities, and emphasized the incompatibility of such violations with MSF’s medical mission. Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity, to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care.”
According to a Reuters report, this directive was also applied to several other hospitals in southern Gaza where armed men were spotted.
The Reuters report included a statement by the Hamas-run Gaza Interior Ministry, which claimed that it was committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action would be taken against violators.
Israel to terminate MSF activity in Gaza after org. fails to provide staff list
MSF has been under scrutiny recently after failing to provide a staff list that would confirm it has no links to terrorist organizations.
On January 30, the organization announced it would not provide the staff lists requested by Israel to maintain access to Gaza and the West Bank, citing the inability to secure assurances about the safety of its teams as the reason for its decision.
As a result, Israel moved to terminate MSF’s presence in Gaza, announcing that all operations would cease on February 28.
“Unfortunately, MSF is once again demonstrating a lack of transparency and acting out of irrelevant interests,” said Diaspora Affairs and Combatting Antisemitism Minister Amichai Chikli. “The organization abruptly changed its position after publicly committing to act according to procedure.”
Chikli went on to say that “we are aware that MSF employs individuals who are active in terrorist organizations, which is why it hides its employee lists.”
“The organization operates in coordination with the Hamas Health Ministry, and not by coincidence, its statements were published in proximity to similar statements from elements within the Gaza Strip,” he said.

Shoes off, sushi on: Terasu redefines omakase in Israel - restaurant review

On a street in Jaffa, behind an unassuming door, chef Daniel Schiff is serving one of the city’s most intimate and in-demand dining experiences: Terasu, a modern sushi omakase that’s both elevated and personal.
Guests begin the evening not by pulling up a chair at a counter, but by taking off their shoes, seated low to the floor in a minimalist, Japanese-inspired space that instantly signals this is something different from a typical night out in Tel Aviv.
Schiff, 32, is the kind of chef whose path doesn’t follow the traditional culinary-school-to-fine-dining pipeline. In fact, much of his training was self-taught. “When I started, there weren’t many places to really learn traditional sushi in Israel,” he explains. “So I taught myself the basics.”
He honed in on that curiosity by over the years occasionally working alongside private chefs. But his biggest leap came recently: a six-month internship in Tokyo under renowned chef Hiroyuki Sato, who runs a traditional sushi omakase counter in Ginza. It left a lasting impression, not only in technique but in work ethic. “The chef goes to the market every day at 6 or 7 a.m. and finishes at 1 a.m. Daily. With one day off.”
It’s that level of dedication that Schiff brought back with him to Tel Aviv.
Terasu: rice, fish craft and care
Dinner at Terasu is a 22-course progression of small bites, beginning with around seven appetizers before moving into sushi. The fish is succulent, while the rice strikes a subtle balance between sweet and savory. Throughout the evening, diners enjoy fish including hamachi and a variety of bluefin tuna cuts, from akami (the lean red meat from the upper back of the tuna), to chutoro (a medium-fatty cut from the side and underbelly), and otoro (the fattiest belly portion). The menu also features bites topped with ikura (salmon roe) and one of the evening’s highlights: sweet red shrimp nigiri.
This is not an experience for vegetarians or those who avoid fish entirely. And if you don’t eat shellfish, don’t fret: the team will ensure your meal remains a fish-only journey. The structure of the meal stays consistent, with the fish changing depending on season and daily availability. Desserts rotate occasionally. I’m still dreaming about the chocolate mousse with miso.
The price is 590 NIS per person (excluding drinks and service). Schiff’s sake program ranges from small pours at NIS 50–75 to bottles priced between NIS 300–600. Wine is also available, with bottles ranging from NIS 190–290. Classic cocktails are offered as well, with three options priced from NIS 55–70.
Terasu typically operates Tuesday through Thursday, with occasional special Friday services. The dining room seats 12 guests per seating, with two services each night at 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., lasting about two to two-and-a-half hours. Unsurprisingly, the restaurant is booked out months in advance.
A balcony of humble beginnings
When you enter Terasu, which I would consider locally a semi-fine dining experience, it doesn’t feel strict or stuffy. It’s sophisticated but comfortable, perhaps partly due to the restaurant’s modest beginnings in Schiff’s own home.
About three years ago, he started hosting couples and small groups on the balcony of his apartment on Rothschild Boulevard. The name Terasu is a nod to those beginnings: “terrace” in Japanese. Since then, Terasu has grown into a fully realized omakase experience, one that continues to evolve with every trip Schiff takes to Japan. Much of what guests see and touch throughout the meal, from the handcrafted tableware to the uniquely beautiful sake glasses, has been imported directly from Japan. These small aesthetic details are intentional, adding another layer to the experience.
“I picked everything out myself while I was there,” Schiff says. “Handmade Japanese pottery and porcelain is a big part of the experience at the table.”
“Each time I come back from Japan, Terasu becomes a bit more traditional and minimalistic,” he adds. “But I still leave some things for the Israeli taste.” That balance is part of what defines Terasu: Japanese technique and restraint, with subtle Western touches. Schiff points to appetizers that are slightly saltier than what you might find in Tokyo, and desserts that lean more European than Japanese. “The dessert isn’t Japanese,” he admits. “It’s more Western.”
A growing appetite for omakase
Terasu’s dining format is unique here, as sushi omakase is still relatively rare in Israel. Some restaurants offer Japanese fare with sushi included, but not a true sushi-focused omakase. But Schiff believes that is changing.
“The demand is growing,” he says. “More and more people are traveling to Japan, and when they come back, they crave that connection to Japanese culture.” He sees the rise of omakase not as competition, but as a sign of a maturing dining scene.
“People focus on the fish, but sushi is rice,” Schiff says. “Eighty percent of the importance is the rice.” It’s a philosophy rooted in tradition, and one that stands in contrast to the elaborate sushi rolls that dominate much of the local market. “I’m not against it,” he says, referencing popular additions like sweet potato, avocado, or spicy mayo. “But it’s not traditional Japanese sushi that we focus on at Terasu.”
Looking ahead
For now, Schiff, the restaurant’s sole owner, is focused on continuing to refine Terasu. Still, he hints at future ambitions, including the possibility of opening a more casual spot in Tel Aviv.
In a city that never slows down, Terasu offers something increasingly rare: a quiet, deliberate meal where diners settle close to the floor and surrender to the rhythm of the chef’s choosing. It’s a new chapter for omakase in Israel, and demand shows no sign of slowing.

Europe must defend itself 'at all times,' says EU Commission chief
'Time has come to bring Europe's mutual defense clause to life,' says Ursula von der Leyen
ISTANBUL
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Saturday that Europe must be ready to defend itself “at all times,” warning that rising geopolitical tensions and external pressure on democratic systems require the continent to strengthen its strategic independence.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, von der Leyen said Europe faces “the very distinct threat of outside forces trying to weaken our union from within,” alongside intensifying global rivalry affecting everything from territory to technology regulation.
“Fundamentally, all of this points to a simple reality in today's fractured world, Europe must become more independent. There is no other choice,” she said, stressing that independence must cover defense, energy, trade, raw materials, and digital technology.
Von der Leyen rejected suggestions that stronger European autonomy could weaken transatlantic ties, saying “an independent Europe is a strong Europe, and a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance.”
Highlighting the bloc’s defense efforts since Russia’s war on Ukraine, she said European military spending in 2025 rose nearly 80% compared with prewar levels.
“The time has come to bring Europe's mutual defense clause to life,” she said, describing collective defense under Article 42.7 of the EU treaty as “not an optional task” but a binding commitment.
Von der Leyen called for faster decision-making on security matters, suggesting the EU may increasingly rely on qualified majority voting rather than unanimity to accelerate action.
She also urged closer cooperation with partners outside the bloc, particularly the UK, saying that “10 years from Brexit, our futures are as bound as ever,” and calling for deeper coordination on security, democracy, and economic resilience.
Drawing lessons from Ukraine’s battlefield experience, she stressed that industrial capacity and innovation are decisive factors in modern warfare, noting that drones now account for “around 80% of battlefield damages on both sides.”
Europe must therefore strengthen defense production and dual-use technologies such as artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing, she said.
“Some ask whether we can afford this, but I say we cannot afford not to,” von der Leyen added, arguing that investment in defense is essential to safeguard “peace and freedom.”

Royal Marines fire mortars in Arctic Norway training

Royal Marines have carried out live mortar firing drills in northern Norway as part of preparations for a major NATO exercise and an expanded UK role in Arctic security, the Royal Navy stated.
The mortar training took place near the village of Moen, more than 200 miles inside the Arctic Circle, as around 1,500 UK Commandos continue intensive mission rehearsals in sub-zero conditions. The activity forms part of NATO’s wider efforts to strengthen its northern flank and protect Nordic member states.
According to the Royal Navy, the marines practised firing 81mm mortars from Viking and BV206 all-terrain vehicles, combining mobility with fire support training in harsh terrain. The service said the weapons are capable of delivering around 15 rounds per minute, with ranges of up to 3.5 miles.
The drills are part of preparations for Cold Response 26, NATO’s largest Arctic exercise this year, due to take place from 9 to 19 March. The exercise is expected to involve around 25,000 troops from 14 nations operating across northern Norway and Finland.
The Royal Navy said the training also comes amid plans to increase Britain’s presence in the region, alongside expected UK participation in NATO’s Arctic Sentry mission and further Joint Expeditionary Force activity later this year.
Defence Secretary John Healey said: “Demands on defence are rising, and Russia poses the greatest threat to Arctic and High North security that we have seen since the Cold War.”
He added: “The UK is stepping up to protect the Arctic and High North, doubling the number of troops we have in Norway and scaling up joint exercises with NATO allies.”
Healey said: “Cold Response and Lion Protector will this year see thousands of troops deploy across the Arctic and North Atlantic, with the UK leading the way. We train together, we deter together, and if necessary, we will fight together.”
The Royal Navy said the mortar troops fired day and night for a week in temperatures close to -20°C, using vehicles to rapidly reposition through deep snow in order to avoid remaining static. The service noted that modern battlefield radars can detect mortar firing positions, increasing the importance of mobility to reduce vulnerability to counter-fire.

Dutch foreign minister says US nuclear umbrella 'will remain' central to Europe’s security

MUNICH
The Netherlands' foreign minister said Saturday that discussions around a potential French nuclear umbrella for Europe are legitimate, but stressed that the US nuclear guarantee will remain fundamental to the continent’s security architecture.
Speaking to Anadolu on the second day of the Munich Security Conference, David van Weel said that discussions about expanding Europe’s nuclear deterrence, particularly around France’s capabilities, are not objectionable but emphasized confidence in existing US guarantees.
"So I'm not against these talks and seeing what the French nuclear deterrence could mean for Europe, but I have no doubt that the nuclear umbrella that the US provides us a lot of safety and will remain there," he said.
He also addressed debates over NATO contingency planning amid a possible reduction in Washington's military contributions.
The minister said recent remarks by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reassured European allies about continued transatlantic cooperation.
"I think we had a very comforting speech here from Secretary Rubio, who said that, yes, we want Europe to do more. ... Yes, we feel that Europe needs to accept the world as it is and not how it should be in their view, but at the same time that the transatlantic bond is here to stay, and they want to build together with Europe," he said.
Van Weel described the current moment as a "wake-up call" for Europe to increase defense efforts, while maintaining a strong alliance with Washington.
"We need to step up our own defense. We need to be able to take care of our own security more. But on top of that, we will have a strong NATO and a strong transatlantic one," he said.
Van Weel also highlighted Türkiye’s role within the alliance, calling it a key contributor to European security.
"So, I think, Türkiye is critical for European security," he said. "I'm therefore very happy that we have this strong nation within NATO."
"I've worked at NATO, so I've seen the large contribution that Türkiye makes to our safety, and I think we should all be happy for them," he concluded.

Iranian president says regional countries can resolve issues together, rejects need for external guardianship
Pezeshkian praises regional leaders’ efforts to boost security and governance, citing cooperation among Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Oman, Pakistan, Afghanistan
ISTANBUL
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that countries in the region are capable of resolving their problems collectively and peacefully, stressing that they do not need external guardianship, state news agency IRNA reported.
Speaking at the international Iran Corridor 2026 conference in Tehran on investment opportunities and financing for rail and road corridors, Pezeshkian said: “We do not need a custodian. Regional countries can sit together and solve their problems.”
Pezeshkian said the world has become “very small,” and that nations must work to create conditions for peace, security, and stability for present and future generations.
“No country benefits from war,” he said, noting that conflict, violence, and bloodshed do not lead to progress.
He praised efforts by regional leaders to enhance security and governance, citing cooperation among countries including Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.
“We are all trying, and capable, of solving our problems together in peace and calm,” he said.
The Iranian president highlighted the country's “deep and extensive” ties with Russia, saying agreements and signatures reached at the conference reflect concrete implementation rather than symbolic commitments.
“We will implement, we will act, and we will swiftly remove any existing obstacles,” he said.
The remarks came as US President Donald Trump on Friday signaled support for the idea of regime change in Iran, which recently saw protests over worsening economic conditions.
“Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters after a visit to Fort Bragg in the state of North Carolina.
The US and Iran held indirect talks in the capital Muscat on Feb. 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program.
The sit-down marked the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June 2025.
The US in recent weeks significantly increased its military footprint in the region, urging Tehran to make a deal before its too late.
The US wants Iran to halt uranium enrichment and has also sought to include its missile program and alleged support for armed groups in the region in the negotiations. Tehran, however, has repeatedly said it would not talk on issues beyond its nuclear program.

China warns US of ‘confrontation’ over any ‘plotting’ on Taiwan

China’s top diplomat, Wang Yi, warned at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that any U.S. effort to use Taiwan to undermine Beijing’s claims could cross a red line and risk direct confrontation between the two powers.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Foreign Minister Wang said that in the future, the United States could adopt a China policy that involves "instigating and plotting to split China through Taiwan, crossing China's red line".
"This could very likely lead to a confrontation between China and the United States," he said.
He added that he hoped Washington would pursue a "positive and pragmatic" approach, "but we are also prepared to deal with various risks".
China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under its control.
The United States has long been the democratic island's most important backer and biggest arms provider, and Taiwan would be heavily reliant on US support in a potential conflict with China.
During his Saturday comments, Wang also weighed in on Beijing's current relationship with Tokyo, which has been under heavy strain since Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi took office in October.
"The Japanese people should no longer allow themselves to be manipulated or deceived by those far-right forces, or by those who seek to revive militarism," Wang said.
"All peace-loving countries should send a clear warning to Japan: if it chooses to walk back on this path, it will only be heading toward self-destruction."

MILAN - Trains operating through the heart of Italy suffered delays of more than an hour on Feb 14, following the latest suspected act of sabotage during the Olympic Games.
Services between Naples in the south and the capital Rome were affected, and there were also delays on the line heading north towards Florence.
Transport Minister Matteo Salvini condemned those behind the incidents following similar problems on Feb 7 on the network and another less serious case midweek.
The stoppages come as Italy hosts the Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d’Ampezzo from Feb 6 to 22.
“These are hateful criminal acts aimed at workers and at Italy,” Mr Salvini said in a statement.
“I hope that no one plays down or tries to justify these crimes which put lives at risk.”
The authorities were investigating burnt cables on a section of the high-speed line between Rome and Naples on Feb 14, and two other possible acts of vandalism between the capital and Florence.

Trump’s repeal of landmark Obama-era climate rule: four key takeaways
Environmental groups say ‘cynical and devastating’ reversal of endangerment finding has grave implications
The Trump administration has dismantled the basis for all US climate regulations, in its most confrontational anti-environment move yet.
The 2009 endangerment finding determined that greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare and should therefore be controlled by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). By revoking it on Thursday, officials eliminated the legal foundation enabling the government to control planet-heating pollution.
Trump said the rollback constituted “the single largest deregulatory action in American history”, while EPA secretary Lee Zeldin said it would end “the holy grail of federal regulatory overreach”.
“The endangerment finding, and the regulations that were based on it, didn’t just regulate emissions,” said Zeldin. “It regulated and targeted the American dream.”
The move prompted widespread condemnation from climate experts and advocates for environmental, public health, and economic justice. Asked to respond to environmental concerns about the new rule on Thursday, Trump said: “Don’t worry about it.”
“This has nothing to do with public health,” he said of the endangerment finding. “This is all a scam, a giant scam.”
The repeal is part of Trump’s sweeping assault on climate policy. On Thursday, he said the endangerment finding formed “the basis for the green new scam”. Since returning to office last January, Trump’s administration has moved aggressively to dismantle pollution rules and boost fossil fuels. That anti-environmental agenda, critics say, serves his fossil-fuel donors.
“These modern-day robber barons would gladly add to their already obscene piles of wealth by making us less safe from climate change,” said Manuel Salgado, federal research manager at the nonprofit We Act for Environmental Justice.
An EPA spokesperson told the Guardian: “The Trump EPA is following the law, ending the bogus overreach of previous administrations done by agenda-driven climate zealots.”

UK migration could be negative this year – how will that hit the economy?
Unknown

When Greenwich and Kent universities said this month they would merge to save money, the heart of their financial difficulties could be found in the UK government’s crackdown on immigration.
Tough restrictions on foreign students have sent the number of university applications from abroad plummeting, cutting lucrative tuition fees and leaving all universities facing the same squeeze.
Companies are in a similar quandary: construction companies, health trusts and care homes are among those with recruitment worries, after new rules curtailed a longstanding reliance on foreign skilled workers.
The latest official figures, released this week, documenting the number of visa applications to live and work in the UK showed a further slump in people successfully navigating the new rules.
Only three years ago, annual net migration soared to almost 1 million. This year the number of people entering the UK could fall to such an extent that it drops below the number moving in the opposite direction, sending the figure for net migration below zero for the first time since 1993.
While the trend may ease pressure on Keir Starmer from Reform UK, for the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, the trend presents a significant headache, hurting both the businesses that rely on immigrants and a loss of expected tax receipts for the Treasury.
Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a thinktank, likened the effect to Brexit, saying that if net migration fell to zero, it would knock 3.7% off the UK’s annual national income by 2040. According to the Treasury’s economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, Brexit has set the economy back by 4%.
The political incentive
Rob Ford, the professor of political science at Manchester University, says zero net migration would provide Starmer with the opportunity to steer the domestic political agenda away from the core topic of interest for Reform UK supporters. Reform leader Nigel Farage backed billionaire industrialist Jim Ratcliffe, who said immigrants were “colonising” the UK. Ratcliffe later apologised, after public pressure from Starmer.
While most Britons’ attitudes to migration vary little over time, Ford believes it will tumble down the list of voters’ biggest concerns next year, as the downward trend feeds through into data and, eventually, public attitudes.
“It means that significant numbers of voters could peel away from the parties that make immigration a key element of their platform,” he says.
The data released this week showed that the fall in skilled worker applications which began last July continued in January. The figures will soon be followed by more detailed data giving a breakdown of visa applications, and how many were granted, from October to December 2025.
The expected downward trend will not reflect the government’s success or failure at stopping small boats crossing the Channel. Instead, the fall will largely follow a collapse in the number of immigrants entering the UK relative to the increasing number who are being denied a visa extension and must leave, many of them students.
The route to zero net migration
By the end of this year, the annual number of non-EU migrants entering the UK on visas could drop below 550,000 after reaching more than 1.1m in 2023, according to a report by a Warwick University data analyst, James Bowes. It argues this is the effect of a clampdown under the previous Conservative administration, and tighter rules brought in by Labour last year.
If the flow out of the country by non-EU nationals also accelerates, as expected, the emigration numbers could hit 430,000 by the end of the year, up from 88,000 in 2021.
With about 900,000 fewer immigrants this year than in 2023, it is possible that net migration of 860,000 in 2023 and 431,000 in 2024 could fall to 184,000 in 2025 and -60,000 this year.
The extent of the turnaround in migration since 2023 is a matter of contention, largely because poor government data allows analysts to fill the gaps in information with their own estimates, but the broader trend is not in dispute.
In March 2024, care workers were banned from bringing spouses and children with them to the UK, while in April of the same year the salary threshold increased for work visas and family visas from £20,480 to £33,400, with an opt-out for some categories of worker set at £25,000.
Most foreign postgraduate students were also told to leave their families behind. The minimum salary for a skilled worker visa increased from £26,200 to £38,700,
Madeleine Sumption, the head of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, says: “It’s difficult to know exactly where we go next, mainly because we have a high number of people with temporary status and many of them might stay, or not.”
Before 2024, foreign students could finish their course and get a job with a salary that satisfied relatively low government thresholds to convert their student visa into a work visa.
Many would pay the price of a one-year master’s degree – which can be more than £30,000 – to get a student visa and within 18 months would be working in a care home.
A doubling of the salary thresholds makes it difficult to continue this route into work, says Bowes.
Last July, the qualification threshold for getting a skilled worker visa or health and care visa also increased. Starmer went further by stopping overseas recruitment of social care workers, shortening the list of jobs eligible for the visas and increasing application fees.
Sumption says the sponsors used by government to verify work visa applications have also faced a stricter regime.
“There is an ongoing crackdown on dodgy sponsors who declare they have firms on their books with jobs for people when they don’t exist. This is another measure restricting the number of successful visa applications,” she says.
The Observatory estimates that net migration will fall temporarily to a little over 250,000 this year before rising to 340,000 by the end of the decade.
“The thing that gets lost in the debate is that the current situation is temporary and the fall that is undoubtedly taking place at the moment will be reversed later in the decade,” says Sumption.
The economic impact
Jonathan Portes, an economics professor at King’s College London, says the impact could be limited by the weak state of the economy.
“We had large labour shortages during the pandemic but that is clearly not the case now,” he says.
Alan Manning, a professor at the London School of Economics, says the “fiscal impact” may be limited, especially in the longer term, if most of those leaving are in lower-paid jobs and their dependents.
Nevertheless, Portes says the draconian restrictions on migration are “an act of self-harm”.
Survey data and figures from HMRC documenting the pay that recent immigrants receive show they earn above average wages and generally have high skill levels in their field.
Manning says: “If we further restricted work visas – which would have to be done to get to net zero longer term – then that would be reducing the number of high earners and there would be a hit to the public finances from that.”
Jane Gratton, the deputy director of public policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, says recruiting from overseas was usually conducted as a last resort.
“The recent fall in net migration has had a particular impact on sectors such as hospitality and healthcare,” she adds.
She says BCC surveys show just 13% of member firms access the immigration system.
“However, it’s vital that the immigration system works for those employers who need it to fill urgent vacancies. Currently, firms tell us it is too expensive, restrictive and difficult.”
The OBR said last year it expected net migration of 262,000 in the year to mid-2026. That compares with the 47,000 Bowes believes is more realistic.
The 200,000 difference will translate into a shortfall of between £6bn and £8bn in the public finances, says Portes.
“The UK has benefited hugely from decades when it was an open economy that absorbed people arriving to do jobs and fill gaps in the labour market. What the Conservative and Labour party policies have done is reverse that, which is nothing short of self-harm,” Portes says.
Germany embraces migrants
Jean-Christophe Dumont, the head of the international migration division at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), says: “The UK Treasury has benefited from migrants, even when their use of all public goods and services are taken into account.”
OECD analysis shows immigrants working in the private sector have “proved positive for wages” though there are wide variations from one industry to another.
Dumont contrasts the UK with Germany.
The UK is moving towards what Portes describes as a “guest-worker approach” where immigrant workers have little chance of becoming permanent residents. Starmer has opened talks about increasing the number of EU citizens admitted to the UK under the youth mobility scheme, but this will only marginally affect the migration figures.
Dumont says Germany is moving firmly in the opposite direction, aware that it needs young people from outside the country to supplement its ageing population. AfD voters disagree, but the mainstream parties are fairly united in arguing that Germany’s survival depends on it, he says.
For instance Germany, like Spain, Austria and Switzerland, have opened apprenticeships to foreign-born labour in addition to the steady stream of German school leavers. The UK has an effective ban.
“People too often focus on the cost, but migrants contribute more on average than they cost,” he says.
If forecasts for zero net migration come to pass, it will prove to be a boon for Starmer and a problem for Reeves, who will count the cost in hard cash.

‘It’s been life-changing’: young Britons on why they left the UK to work abroad

As young people bear the brunt of a downturn in the jobs market, figures show a significant number are leaving the UK.
Although statisticians caution against comparing annual figures after a recent change in methodology and stress younger people are traditionally more drawn to emigration, a net 111,000 people aged 16 to 34 emigrated from the UK in the year to March 2025, according to the Office for National Statistics.
However, against the backdrop of a tough economy and high rents, young adults now living across the globe told the Guardian why they decided to leave Britain and how their new life compares.
The finance worker, Dubai
‘Working people are squeezed in the UK’
Ben*, 24, graduated in 2023, won a scholarship to a US university and had every intention of returning to the UK in 2025, but rapidly changed his mind.
“I am not keen on the UK at all right now. Push factors definitely outweigh the pull of the UK. London itself is a rip-off. Working people are squeezed, and the allure is waning. It’s a conversation I have pretty much every week with friends back there.” says Ben, an Oxbridge graduate, who now works in finance. Dubai has increasingly become home to individuals leaving the UK, US and Europe to work in the financial sector.
Ben adds: “Racial strife, toxic politics, a stagnant economy, regional inequality (which makes most other parts of the UK outside London non-starters for ambitious graduates) mean that there is very little the place has to offer.
“People around my age didn’t get to vote in 2016 and were first-time voters in 2019, by which point Brexit was a foregone conclusion, and they feel pretty screwed over.”
Ben, who says he “very much identifies as a British Nigerian”, took up his finance role in Dubai as a way to kickstart his career, he adds.
“The UAE wouldn’t be my ideal place to be, but it just happened to be that the job offer was there,” he says. “There are problems with the UAE, and I have some reservations. But if you are a young person and you’re looking to gain overseas experience, which allows for career progression, then the UAE is good for that.”
The sustainability worker, Berlin
‘I now never have to question if I can afford to do things’
Caitlin moved to London after university but couldn’t settle and, after a trip to Berlin, decided to move there three years ago.
“I really struggled to adapt to London, it was always so busy and expensive,” says Caitlin, 27, originally from Manchester. “I felt happier during those 10 days [in Germany] than I had in the entire last year, I decided to make the jump and move a few months later.
“I did my university year abroad in Berlin, so it was familiar to me, and I had already setup a community here to come back to.”
Her first job in Berlin was in customer service, and to start, she took work she was overqualified for to get a foot in the door and a working visa. Since then, she has transferred to a Blue Card visa – a residence permit for non-EU nationals – which she says has “given me much more flexibility”.
“It also makes it easier if I lose my job,” she adds. “There is a little more leniency as I get six months before I’d be told to leave the country if I hadn’t found work.”
When it comes to accommodation, there is a marked contrast with London.
“It is a renters’ economy here, so I have a rental contract for life with stabilised rent in a gorgeous, large apartment for quite a cheap price – it would be triple that in London,” says Caitlin.
However, Caitlin is one of the lucky ones. In the past few years, Berlin’s housing crisis has escalated to unprecedented proportions, with median asking rents across the city rising by 21.2% in 2023 alone.
One reason for this, among many, is a loophole in German federal law that means if flats are rented out as “temporary” and “furnished”, owners can evade tenancy regulations and charge considerably higher rents.
One aspect, however, that remains “a big barrier” for her is the language. “I am still learning German – it’s so hard,” she says. “It also counts me out of a lot of jobs”
“I do really miss my family and friends at home, and think that this, probably combined with career opportunities, will eventually draw me back.”
The digital nomad, Thailand
‘If I were in the UK, I wouldn’t be able to save’
After Maisie* graduated, she decided to go travelling and has been following the “sun and the digital nomad community” ever since, creating a regular pattern each year.
“That was about three years ago,” says Maisie, who is a freelance journalist and originally from North Yorkshire. “It has been life-changing.”
She moves away for four to six months of the year during the colder, winter periods, spending three to four months in south-east Asia, staying in Thailand, the Philippines and Laos. She then goes on to Europe in the spring before returning to the UK.
While she loves the north of England, she feels resentful at how her generation has been treated, citing Brexit and her “crippling” student loan. She says she is bitter about being unable to get on the property ladder.
“I don’t feel that the younger generations in the UK are being looked after,” she says. “I feel as though the odds have been stacked against me from the beginning.”
She says it is cheaper for her to live in south-east Asia over the winter than the UK.
Maisie calculates her outgoings, including shared accommodation, food, travel, and flights, at “about £1,000 a month”.
“The irony is I am saving more money travelling than I would if I lived in the UK, and I am still having a really nice quality of life.”
“I do get tired from travelling, but I think ‘slowmadding’ – living slower and longer term in places – helps.
“My ties to the UK are mostly because of my family,” she says. “What I am doing is not a permanent way of life, but for now it’s good.”
The web developer, Vancouver
‘I felt I had nothing to lose’
Nat Watson, 24, says he “just couldn’t take” living in the UK any more.
“I’ve lived all over: Brighton, Bristol, Bath, Cardiff, London, and visited many cities, and never enjoyed their vibe and never felt at home,” he says.
He moved to Vancouver, Canada last September, “settled and got a job really quickly”, and is being paid “more than I ever would be in the UK”.
Watson, a web developer, had been living in Wales and was feeling disillusioned with the job prospects as there is “little on offer in the tech sector” in Wales, he says. To make ends meet, he had to move back in with his parents.
“The last job I had there, I was making just over £1,000 a month,” he says. “I have been working in the industry for almost 10 years because I started very, very young. I know my stuff and I was almost insulted by the wages, but it was the only job available.
“I felt I had absolutely nothing to lose. I wanted somewhere with nature and things to do, and Vancouver just fits the bill.”
Watson also felt the “ever-rising cost of living and the ever-rising rightwing political extremism” made him want to leave.
“The quality of life is much better, people are friendlier, and I’ve been welcomed by everyone,” he says. “It’s cheaper for me to live in the middle of Vancouver than it is for me to live in Merthyr Tydfil.”

US man who fled jail and pleaded to Trump and Kim Kardashian gets 60-year term

A man who joined nine others in fleeing a New Orleans jail – then publicly pleaded for help from Donald Trump, a rapper whom the president pardoned and reality TV star Kim Kardashian while on the run – recently got a 60-year prison sentence for kidnapping and raping his ex-girlfriend.
Antoine Massey, 32, received his punishment on Thursday at a suburban New Orleans state courthouse, months after his jailbreak-related capture and subsequent conviction at trial of prior charges.
The 16 May 2025 breakout from a New Orleans jail that Massey had a hand in is one of the largest in recent US history. Authorities said the men yanked open a faulty cell door inside the lockup, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the dark – all while taunting officials with scrawled messages, including a misspelled one reading, “To Easy”.
Eight of the escaped men had been retaken into custody when Massey filmed videos that he released on social media in which he pleaded for Trump and Kardashian – among others – to come to his aid.
“Please, I’m asking for help,” Massey said in one of the videos, which achieved internet virality. “When I get back in custody, I’m asking y’all please to come and help.”
Others whom Massey named in his entreaty were rappers Lil Wayne and NBA YoungBoy, who are from New Orleans and nearby Baton Rouge, Louisiana, respectively.
NBA YoungBoy, whose legal name is Kentrell Gaulden and who had been sentenced to two years in prison on federal weapons-related charges, is among a number of celebrities whom Trump has pardoned during his second presidency. But Trump’s pardoning powers do not extend to the state charges with which Massey had been grappling then.
Police ultimately captured Massey in late June at a home in New Orleans about 2 miles (3km) from where the jailbreak occurred.
The last of the men who escaped was caught in Atlanta in October. In November, Massey went in front of a jury in Covington, Louisiana, north of New Orleans on preceding charges of second-degree rape, second-degree kidnapping, domestic abuse battery involving strangulation and violating a protective order.
The charges dated back to November 2024, when Massey was found to have beaten and sexually assaulted his girlfriend in Slidell, which is relatively near Covington. Prosecutors said his victim managed to escape and get a stranger in New Orleans to help her contact police, leading to his detention at in the facility where the breakout would later take place.
Jurors returned a guilty verdict against him. The sentence imposed on him Thursday does not afford him any possibility of parole.
“This … was brutal and extreme violence,” judge Alan Black said to Massey.
Massey has pleaded not guilty of any crime in connection with the New Orleans jailbreak. In his viral videos, he claimed to have been “let out” of the lockup.
He also faces several other charges in unrelated cases.

A missing woman, bloodstains and a masked intruder: tantalising clues but few leads in hunt for Nancy Guthrie
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

20:00:51 KST

Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her Tucson, Arizona, home two weeks ago, setting off a potent chain reaction of federal and local criminal investigation, amateur sleuthing and public obsession that – so far – has resulted in neither the 84-year-old grandmother being located or anyone named as a suspect or, indeed, arrested.
It is a case that is both enthralling and baffling the American public, casting doubts on the ability of investigators to get to the bottom of the mystery that each day generates a fresh 24-hour news cycle – but seemingly little in the way of solid fresh leads likely to solve the case.
On Thursday suspicions grew that the case may not be a kidnap-for-ransom scheme focused on the mother of the NBC Today show host Savannah Guthrie – or at least that her abduction did not start out as a kidnapping – but perhaps a burglary gone wrong.
Guthrie’s family have ceased issuing appeals to the would-be kidnapper or kidnappers. No communication is recorded. No ransom has been paid. But the FBI has doubled the reward for information leading to an arrest to $100,000, offered a description of a man 5ft 9in or 5ft 10in tall with an average build, and given a description of a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker backpack he was wearing.
“We hope this updated description will help concentrate the public tips we are receiving,” the FBI stated in the X post. The agency said it had collected more than 13,000 tips since Guthrie was taken from her home on 1 February.
Donald Trump was asked Friday whether the drug cartels or potentially another “nation state” could be involved in Guthrie’s disappearance.
“You can’t say that yet”, he responded outside the White House. “It’s a little bit early. But it’s somebody [who] either knew what they were doing very well, or they were rank amateurs. Either way, it’s not a good situation”.
The Pima county sheriff’s department said it had fielded more than 18,000 calls and asked residents living near Guthrie’s home for video surveillance footage going back weeks. Then surveillance video circulated online of a man attempting to scale a wall five miles away, wearing similar clothes and backpack to a man seen in video recovered from the doorbell camera at Guthrie’s home on the night of the crime. Officials told NBC News that law enforcement officers had cleared the man.
That video, recovered from Google archives, showed the presumed abductor, or an accomplice, in a ski mask and neoprene gloves carrying what appeared to be a pistol in an oddly placed holster, attempting to block the lens with vegetation from Guthrie’s garden.
The black-and-white image of a masked man bearing flowers, described as a small “bouquet of weeds” by some observers, vividly gave form to the contours of deception and ill-intent playing out across the inhospitable terrain of the desert south-west.
Soon after, delivery driver Carlos Palazuelos was detained during a traffic stop south of Tucson near the US-Mexico border. His home in Rio Rico was searched on a judge’s approval. Palazuelos, who was later released, told Telemundo that he didn’t recall delivering anything to Guthrie’s house, didn’t know who she is and wasn’t involved.
Then there was a black glove found on a road, and one in Guthrie’s home. Rumors of a rift between local investigators and the FBI emerged after one was sent to a private crime lab in Florida and not to FBI headquarters in Virginia for analysis. The Pima county sheriff, Chris Nanos, denied he was withholding evidence from the FBI and that an agent had told him, “We do not want the media to divide us.”
Investigators have also made repeated trips to the home of Annie Guthrie, sister of Savannah and a poet, and her husband Tommaso Cioni, a science and biology teacher, and the last to see Nancy when he dropped her at home hours before her abduction.
The sheriff’s department hasn’t provided an official news briefing in over a week, allowing the citizen sleuths to fill the vacuum with a range of theories Almost any man who fits the rough description of a 5ft 10in man connected to the family has been brought under online suspicion.
The case, likened variously to the Lindbergh baby case in the 1930s, to an episode of Columbo and to the Keystone Cops, has at root a missing elderly woman whose fate is unknown. A series of purported ransom emails containing a demand for $6m in bitcoin and two deadlines sent to celebrity news outlet TMZ and two local TV stations are now rarely mentioned.
Guthrie’s family have said they believe she is still alive but have no way to directly contact the ransom seekers and have not received the so-called “proof of life” they asked for.
Joe Petito, father of Gabby Petito who went missing on a 2021 cross-country road trip and was later found to have been murdered by her fiance, Brian Laundrie, told Fox & Friends that false leads and misinformation made the search more difficult.
“A lot of outside influence will try to give an opinion,” Petito said. Investigators, he added, “have all of the information or as much as possible. So I just hope they’re listening to what they feel is best.” The statement, and its implicit appeal to intuition, brought to mind Columbo.
But armchair detectives are not out in the field, as FBI agents are, knocking on doors and picking through inhospitable desert terrain of cactuses, bushes and boulders, in 80F heat in search of clues to crack a case of a missing woman authorities believe was taken against her will and whose blood was found on her front porch.
“In hindsight we can say that ransom note was a fake and sent after the case went national,” says Bryanna Fox, a former FBI profiler at the University of South Florida.
“That said, imagine being in the Guthries’ shoes and thinking ‘what if it is real and we don’t treat it as real?’ But who conducts a kidnapping-for-ransom and goes to the crime scene without a ransom note prepared? It’s so contrary to kidnapping.”
Fox says the recent harvest of clues, despite lacking any definite resolution in the case, are substantial. “We’re waiting for the dividends,” she says. “One of those 4,000 tips sent to the FBI has to play out.”
The task now will be to winnow them out and to get a potential suspect or suspects “committed to a story and track down the details of their story. If there are a lot of holes in it, you’ve got something more.” Fox says it’s possible Palazuelos knows more. “I’m not saying this man is involved, but is that a possibility? Yes.”
Key to cracking the case may be the black-and-white images. Fox points to the resolution of recent cases – the murder of the United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson, to name one – in which a suspect was arrested with help from surveillance films. “Maybe we just have to let a little more time go by for those leads to turn into an identification,” Fox says. “I’m optimistic.”

Peter Attia appears to be staying at CBS News despite Epstein communications
Unknown

Two weeks after a trove of files revealed extensive – and inappropriate – communications between Jeffrey Epstein and a recently named CBS News contributor, the longevity expert Peter Attia, the network appears to have settled on keeping him.
“Everyone internally unofficially concluded he was staying as of about a week ago,” one CBS News staffer told the Guardian.
Officially, CBS News has been silent about Attia, and declined to comment when asked on Friday. Attia is one of the 19 on-air contributors that editor-in-chief Bari Weiss said she was “so excited” to announce during an all-staff meeting on 27 January.
“We’re pissed off about it,” a second CBS News staffer, who was also not authorized to comment, said.
Announcing his appointment, CBS News said the contributors, “all experts in their field”, would allow the network to “significantly [expand] its knowledge base”. Attia, who hosts a popular podcast, is known as an expert in the fields of longevity and preventative medicine, though he has faced skepticism from some in the medical world.
But on 30 January, the justice department’s release of millions of documents showed that Attia had expressed a fondness for Epstein and used extremely graphic language in at least one email to him. That Attia had met with Epstein was previously known before CBS News hired him.
A search of Attia’s name in the justice department’s database returns 1,838 results.
“I go into JE withdrawal when I don’t see him,” Attia wrote in one January 2016 email to Epstein’s assistant.
A year earlier, in an exchange with Epstein, Attia seemed to hint at his knowledge of Epstein’s misdeeds – though he has denied that he was referring to criminal sexual activity.
“You [know] the biggest problem with becoming friends with you?” he wrote in the email. “The life you lead is so outrageous, and yet I can’t tell a soul … ”
And in one particularly lewd 2016 email, Attia wrote to Epstein: “Pussy is, indeed, low carb. Still awaiting results on gluten content, though.”
Attia also stayed at one of Epstein’s apartments, according to the correspondence made public. “I’m spoiled after staying in your great place. Mine is kind of a dump,” Attia wrote Epstein in February 2016.
On 2 February, Attia published a long message he had sent to his employees explaining his connections to Epstein.
“I was not involved in any criminal activity,” he wrote. “My interactions with Epstein had nothing to do with his sexual abuse or exploitation of anyone. I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties. That said, I apologize and regret putting myself in a position where emails, some of them embarrassing, tasteless, and indefensible, are now public, and that is on me.”
Attia said he met with Epstein approximately seven or eight times between 2014 and 2019 “regarding research studies and to meet others he introduced me to”. He also admitted to answering Epstein’s medical questions and recommending doctors to him on occasion.
“The man I am today, roughly 10 years later, would not write them and would not associate with Epstein at all,” he wrote.
Attia appeared in an October episode of 60 Minutes and was interviewed by correspondent Norah O’Donnell, who said he “has become both a pioneer and a star in the growing field of longevity medicine”.
CBS had been scheduled to re-air O’Donnell’s interview of Attia on 8 February, Super Bowl Sunday, but decided against it amid the backlash.
Although Attia is still on the payroll as a CBS News contributor, it’s not clear when – or if – he will actually appear on air.
When addressing her staff, Weiss had encouraged shows to book the network’s new contributors – but programs are not obligated to book specific individuals.
Attia has been keeping a low profile. He has not posted on X since his apology. He also has not posted any episodes of his popular podcast, The Peter Attia Drive, this month.
Jennifer Ashton, a one-time CBS News medical correspondent who then spent more than a decade as ABC News’s chief health and medical correspondent, recently criticized her former network and said she would not appear while Attia remains a contributor.
“The fact that CBS News hasn’t taken action is deeply troubling,” she wrote on Instagram. “People have been fired from network television for far less. Morality clauses exist for a reason. If documented language like this doesn’t cross that line, then the bar has fallen dangerously low.”
Mary Claire Haver, a menopause specialist, said her publisher had arranged an exclusive interview on CBS Mornings to promote her forthcoming book, The New Perimenopause. “But given their decision to retain Peter Attia, I’m making the decision not to go on CBS,” she said in her own Instagram post. “This is my way of saying no, I’m not going to stand for this.”

EU official warns Russian shadow fleet threatens Europe

20:00:14 KST

A senior European Union official has warned that Russia’s “shadow fleet” poses a growing threat to maritime security and undersea infrastructure, as concerns mount over the vulnerability of key shipping routes and subsea cables.
Speaking during a maritime security panel at the Munich Security Conference on Friday, Belén Martinez Carbonell, Secretary-General of the European External Action Service, said the shadow fleet represents a direct threat to Europe, both through its role in sustaining Russia’s war economy and through the risks it creates at sea.
“For us, there’s a very direct threat very close to home,” she said. “I call it as the result of a huge violation of the UN Charter, and that’s the amplification of the Russian aggression through the shadow fleet.”
She added: “For us, the Russian shadow fleet is the most direct threat to European security.”
Carbonell argued that the issue extended beyond sanctions evasion, warning that poorly regulated vessels posed environmental dangers and could present threats to critical maritime infrastructure. “We know that those shadow fleets pose risks besides feeding the coffers of war,” she said. “They also are at risk environmental risk… They also pose a risk, because of the risks to cables, maritime cables.”
The panel, moderated by Mina Al-Oraibi, Editor-in-Chief of The National, focused on the growing global importance of maritime security amid geopolitical tension and attacks on shipping lanes. Al-Oraibi told the audience that maritime security now affects everyday life worldwide. “More than 80% of world trade relies on the waterways of the world,” she said, adding that “95 to 99% of our connectivity relies on underwater cables that have become the lifeline for international trade.”
Carbonell said the EU was pursuing a range of non-military and regulatory measures to counter threats posed by the shadow fleet, including sanctions, outreach to flag states, and legal tools under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. “We have sanctions already, like 600 shadow fleet vessels and 40 enablers,” she said.
She added that the EU was also engaging directly with countries whose flags were being used by vessels linked to sanctions evasion. “We’re doing outreach to flag states that might not know what’s behind their flags,” Carbonell said. The official also pointed to legal provisions within UNCLOS, arguing they could be used to address unflagged vessels. “We’re also trying to use all possibilities offered precisely by UNCLOS,” she said, citing “article 110… [which] allows, under certain conditions, the boarding of flagless vessels.”
Carbonell also said work was ongoing through the International Maritime Organization, particularly on environmental and safety standards.
Alongside regulatory efforts, she highlighted the EU’s naval operations as part of a broader approach to protecting freedom of navigation. “We have a number of maritime missions and naval operations,” she said, naming Irini, Atalanta and Aspides as key examples. Referring to the Red Sea mission Aspides, she said it had already supported a large number of commercial transits. “It’s there to ensure the safe transit, and has already done it for more than 600 merchant vessels in the Red Sea,” Carbonell said.
She added: “We have saved to this mission, more than 100 sailors and seafarers.”
The panel also included Rashad Mohamed Ali Al-Alimi, Chairman of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, who warned that regional instability in the Red Sea was being driven by Iranian-backed militant groups. “The most urgent threat derives from that corner,” he said, accusing Iran of investing heavily in militias in order to gain leverage over maritime security.
Singapore’s Defence Minister Chan Chun Sing also warned that rising strategic mistrust between major powers was increasingly shaping maritime risk globally. “The main threat… would be the increasing strategic mistrust between and among the major powers,” he said.

The Story Behind the Viral Photograph of 5-Year-Old Liam Conejo Ramos
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-14
11:00:00 UTC
20:00:00 KST

On Jan. 20, one of the coldest days of the year in Minneapolis, Ali Daniels received a text message warning that ICE agents were targeting school bus stops in Columbia Heights. Daniels, an office administrator working in the metro area, had recently completed legal observer training and was participating in rapid response work for the second time.
Grabbing a friend as her passenger seat sidekick, the two patrolled the neighborhood for signs of ICE activity. After about 10 minutes of turning down residential streets, they spotted a large SUV stopped in the middle of the road. She recalls seeing ICE agents in masks and tactical vests standing outside the vehicle.
That’s when Daniels saw Liam Conejo Ramos—a small, wide-eyed child in a Spider Man backpack and blue bunny hat—being escorted to a slush-streaked car. Daniels recalls agents shouting “get it in the car,” referring to Liam.
People at the scene pleaded with the agents to allow the five-year-old to go with authorized staff from Columbia Heights schools, where Liam attended pre-kindergarten classes. Daniels says the agents refused.
“I decided to start taking pictures,” she said. “This wasn’t part of the training; it was something I did out of impulse.”
Daniels took out her Samsung to snap photos of the agents, the vehicle, and then bent down to Liam’s eye-level. “He was silent, staring ahead, undoubtedly scared and in shock,” she said. “That’s when I got the photo of him.”
Daniels posted the image to her private Facebook page, unaware of the journey this one photograph would take.
We all know this photo and the surrounding details intimately now. Liam was returning from school with his father when immigration agents pulled them from their car near their home, according to the school district. The boy’s father, Adrián Alexander Conejo Arias, was also detained, and the pair were transferred to an immigration detention center outside San Antonio.
A lawyer for the family said that Mr. Conejo Arias, who is from Ecuador, had entered the United States under existing asylum guidelines. The Department of Homeland Security, however, charged that he entered the country unlawfully in Dec. 2024. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that “ICE did NOT target a child,” and that the operation was instead to arrest the child’s father.
Against this backdrop, Daniels’ image of Liam’s seizure went mega-viral at a moment when public anger over immigration enforcement was already acute in Minnesota and elsewhere across the country—the incalculable, inescapable kind of viral in which images move faster than explanation.
X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and BlueSky were flooded with versions of the photo: cropped, captioned, subtitled, paired with legal explainers, donation links, and calls to action demanding Liam’s release. The power of these posts came from their terrifying precision: that this child could be anyone’s, that Minneapolis could be home.
By Jan. 31, Judge Fred Biery, a U.S. District Judge for the Western District of Texas, ordered the release of both Liam and his father from immigration custody, condemning their removal from their suburban Minneapolis neighborhood as unconstitutional. At the bottom of his three-page ruling, Judge Biery included the viral photograph of Liam with the caption: “Matthew 19:14” and “John 11:35.”
Those New Testament verses quote Jesus saying “Let the little children come to me” and “Jesus wept.” The image that had proliferated on social media was now part of the legal record.
After more than a week in detention, Liam and his father were released from the Texas immigration facility and returned to Minneapolis, according to U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro. Castro documented the trip on social media, where he shared a photo of a handwritten note he gave Liam, in which he wrote that the boy had “moved the world.”
“Liam is now home. With his hat and his backpack. Thank you to everyone who demanded freedom for Liam,” Castro, a San Antonio Democrat, wrote on X.
To be sure, this is not the first social movement in which social media has played a central role in global political resistance. During the Arab Spring, platforms like Facebook and Twitter functioned as organizing tools and distribution channels for footage that state-controlled media suppressed—most notably in Egypt in 2011, when live updates and images from Tahrir Square transformed local protests into an international crisis within days.
A decade later, mass mobilization around Black Lives Matter was catalyzed by cellphone video made by then 17-year-old Darnella Frazier documenting the murder of George Floyd, turning a single Minneapolis street into the epicenter of a worldwide uprising.
Since the racial justice protests of 2020, however, political posting has existed under sustained suspicion as performative. During the summer of 2020, critics of all ideologies mocked symbolic gestures untethered from action: black squares on Instagram, TikTok videos of white influencers (hair done, makeup snatched) raising fists to trending audio, memes lampooning allyship that required no material risk.
That skepticism has lingered over the past several years, particularly when crises feel distant or abstract, where posting about Sudan or Gaza, for example, can resemble a stand-in for action. “Spreading awareness” remains notoriously difficult to measure.
What makes this moment distinct is that the debate no longer feels theoretical. As recently as last week, reposting Liam’s photo was criticized as performative on platforms such as TikTok. But the outcome complicates that charge. The circulation, and the demands it elicited, forced visibility, legal scrutiny, and response.
The spread of Daniels’ photo of Liam shows how public pressure on social media can still bend the machinery of the state.
This is not to say that posting is enough. It is easy to criticize a celebrity wearing a political pin on the red carpet (or a Facebook infographic, or a hashtag in an Instagram bio) as virtue signaling. Talk can only take you so far.
Social media can also flatten nuance. As the photo was reshared and reposted on Facebook, Daniels began seeing comments questioning its authenticity, suggesting it was fake or AI-generated. She decided to identify herself as the photographer to establish the image’s provenance.
“It’s hard to be told you’re changing hearts and minds with one photo, yet knowing that no amount of saying ‘I saw this firsthand’ will make people see how cruel and unjust the whole institution is,” Daniels told me. “Nothing is that easy.”
Liam is far from the only child impacted by the Trump administration’s policies. According to a Guardian analysis of records obtained by the Deportation Data Project, ICE booked about 3,800 minors into immigrant family detention from Jan. to Oct. 2025. The number of children currently in migrant detention centers remains unclear. Posting on social media will not free the thousands of children currently detained.
Minnesotans like Daniels with a cell phone camera are demonstrating in real time how social media can push beyond symbolism into tangible change. The photograph of Liam, videos of the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, and other images have contributed to stepping up the pressure on the federal government, ultimately forcing a reversal of its tactics in Minnesota.
And social media is proving to be an indispensable tool for coordination. Instagram, X, Facebook, Threads, WhatsApp, and Signal are being used to track ICE activity, mobilize protests, circulate witness requests, and distribute precise call and email templates for elected officials. On streets across the country, Americans are putting their own bodies on the line to impede the operations of a federal police force in their city.
“Like so many people in the Twin Cities, I got trained [as a legal observer and rapid responder] because I felt like I had to,” Daniels said. “I couldn’t just do nothing while our neighbors are being snatched up from their homes.”
Instead, she turned to her phone’s camera. Her image not only helped change the life of one child, it helped change policy.

Kaillie Humphries Underwent 4 Embryo Transfers to Have a Baby. Now She’s Back in the Olympics at 40

American bobsledder Kaillie Humphries has already won three Olympics gold medals in her standout career. Back-to-back wins for her birth country of Canada in the two-woman event in 2010 and 2014, plus another gold, after a contentious, stressful battle to switch national allegiances, for the United States, in the inaugural driver-only monobob event in Beijing. So as well as anyone, Humphries can paint a picture of an ideal Olympic run down the refrigerated track in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, in February.
“The sled should look smooth,” says Humphries, 40, during an interview from San Diego, where she lives with her husband, former USA bobsledder Travis Armbruster, and their son, Aulden, who will turn 20 months old in mid-February. “It should look effortless. You shouldn’t see a lot of sideways movement. That’s usually a Kaillie Humphries special. Especially when the pressure gets big. I can drive the heck out of a sled better than anybody else in the entire world. So my goal is to be good enough at the start, then crush them in the driving on the way down.”
Humphries thought she might miss her chance to add to her Olympic legacy, as she moved forward with plans to start a family with Armbruster after Beijing. She had tried to get pregnant naturally prior to those Games, but in 2021 Humphries was diagnosed with stage IV endometriosis, an often painful condition in which tissue that is similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.

Endometriosis can cause fertility struggles, so in the summer of 2022, Humphries began IVF treatments. Three transfers did not result in a baby, but in August 2023, with the qualification period for Milano Cortina fast approaching, she decided to keep trying. “It got to the point of, I’m going to continue down this path, and it may cost me a future Olympics,” she says.
A month later, she got pregnant. Humphries gave birth to Aulden in June 2024. While she missed the 2023-2024 World Cup bobsled season due to her pregnancy, Humphries had to return to the track just five months postpartum in order to protect her rankings and put herself in the strongest possible position to qualify for the 2026 Olympics. “I would have liked a little more time to bond with my son, to physically recover from giving birth,” she says. “On the recovery piece, we are devaluing what it takes to go through pregnancy, to go through the birth process. You're pregnant for nine months, you give birth, it's going to take at least a year to get back in shape. So I would like to see where women have a year to return after giving birth.”
She felt like a shell of her former self. “From a physical standpoint, was my body ready to compete at five months postpartum?” says Humphries. “No, not even close. You're missing that whole core midsection, which in a power- and speed-based sport with g-forces, there is a big component there that I was lacking. Running, sprinting was extremely challenging for me. I was able to do it. But you're not doing it well. You're not performing. You're surviving.”
Armbruster gave up his job as a personal trainer to hit the road with Humphries and their son during the 2024-2025 bobsled World Cup season, which had stops in Germany, Latvia, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, and Lake Placid, N.Y. Humphries was advised—mostly by men, she notes—against breastfeeding during her comeback. “Do I do what's best for my son, because I believe that's giving him breast milk, or do I do what's best for my performance in my career?” she says. “And you don't want to have to give up either. So you're in this torn place all the time.”

Humphries put Aulden first. “He just keeps crying,” she says. “It didn't matter how much I pumped, the boob was the only thing that was going to fix it.” Breastfeeding took its toll on her. “You're exhausted,” she says. “Just the drain on your system. You only have so much battery life in your body every day.” Aulden’s periods of sleep regression also put Humphries in a difficult position. “I have to perform in two or three days, and I'm up every two or three hours, and I'm getting maybe four hours of sleep,” she says. “My competitors are 25, 28 years old, they're having 8, 9, 10 hours of sleep uninterrupted. You feel guilty. And then there's times when I'm at the bobsled track for six or seven hours and I haven't seen my son, and I feel guilty as a mom that I don't get to be with him every second of every day.”
All this strain, on both body and mind, made her finishes—fourth in the two-woman event and eighth in monobob at worlds in March 2025—quite impressive, even if, as a five-time world champion, she didn’t view them that way. “Being nine months postpartum, most people would be ecstatic with that,” says Humphries. “For me, it's hard, because I expected to go out and win. Realistically, I knew I wasn't in the shape to be able to do it.”
But she came into this World Cup season thinking she was on track to peak at the Olympics. Her results show she might be right. Humphries won a pair of two-woman events in December and January, and she won her first monobob as a mom on Jan. 17, in Altenberg, Germany. The next day, she finished second in the two-woman race, with Jasmine Jones, who will be Humphries’ brakewoman in Cortina.
She’s already the only woman with Olympic golds in both the two-woman and the monobob. Becoming the first to win both at the same Games now seems well within reach. “That'll be a perfect mic-drop moment,” says Humphries.
Humphries has already earned a victory: entering these Games with no regrets. She is promising to take plenty of pictures of Aulden in Italy, so they can one day look back on these Games that they shared together. “There's no way I would have ever been able to live with myself if I would have chosen sport over family,” she says. “There's nothing that I would change, regardless of what the result is. I'm going out to try and win double gold. But it is really about the journey this Olympics, more than any other Olympics. It really is about the process and the planning of what it took us over these four years to get to this Games with Aulden. With IVF, with the hormones, with the injections. It's the journey of us becoming a family and less about the results. And I've never had that before.”

Munich Security Conference: Rubio calls on Europe to save the West in alignment with the US

US Secretary of State says America and Europe share roots and a common destiny but warns a decline in economic and cultural terms must be reversed. In a more diplomatic tone, Rubio pointed to a 'climate cult' and mass migration as threats to common prosperity.
America's top diplomat Marco Rubio called on Europe to work with Washington in a civilisational quest to save the West during a speech at the Munich Security Conference.
In a softer tone compared to US Vice President JD Vance a year ago at the same gathering, Rubio reiterated that the West is facing civilisational decline by choice, as a result ill-designed policies stemming from a climate "cult" and mass migration.
In his address on Saturday, he urged Europeans to join a common cause with the United States to lead a new century of prosperity. He said the two sides are historically, culturally and economically intertwined, but must also share principles.
"We believe that Europe must survive," Rubio told the Munich Security Conference. "Ultimately, our destiny is - and will always be - intertwined with yours."
His tone offered a more conciliatory approach after Vice President Vance shocked Europeans last year with a speech in which argued the continent risks becoming a land of censorship, suffocated by excessive regulation and under threat from open borders.
Vance suggested Europe's biggest threat does not come from Russia, but from within.
Rubio did not use the hyperbolic language favoured by the Trump administration, which has referred to Europeans as weak and decaying, but its core message stayed intact. He also framed the challenges ahead as a quest to rescue an entire civilisation from decline.
He lambasted liberal politicians who, he argued, made a "conscious choice" to dismantle the West, its industrial capacity and outsourced critical supply chains to rivals and competitors. "De-industrialisation was not inevitable," Rubio added.
"It was a conscious policy choice, a decades-long economic undertaking that stripped our nations of their wealth, their productive capacity, and their independence. The loss of our supply chain sovereignty...it was a foolish, but voluntary transformation," he said.
The US Secretary of State also alluded to "mass migration" as source of conflict.
"This is not some fringe concern of little consequence. It was and continues to be a crisis, one that is transforming and destabilising societies across the West," he said.
His remarks echoed a controversial US national security review published last year which called on the EU to reverse course on key policies or face "civilisational erasure" as a result. The document also suggested the US would foster ties and work with patriotic parties in the EU fighting the status quo from within, without giving names.
Still, Rubio received a standing ovation from the audience at the Munich Security Conference when he argued the US still cares deeply about the future of Europe and suggested disagreements come from a place of "profound concern" for the continent, which he referred to as the birthplace of a common civilisation.
"We are connected not just economically, not just militarily. We are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally," he added.
Rubio cited Mozart, Dante, Shakespeare, The Beatles and The Rolling Stones.
American leadership under scrutiny
His comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron urged Europeans to act proudly against a campaign to vilify the continent amplified by social media.
"We need a much more positive mindset. There has been a tendency in this place and beyond to overlook Europe and sometimes to criticise it outright," Macron said in speech before the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
In comments that appeared to push back on the US narrative, the French President referred to a "caricatured" vision of Europe, portrayed as weak, fragmented and overregulated continent, preyed by migration looking to "corrupt its precious traditions".
Macron said Europeans should be proud of the union they have built.
Similarly, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz conceded a split in visions between Europe and the United States but argued that US culture wars do not belong in Europe.
"Freedom of speech here ends where the words spoken are directed against human dignity and our basic law. We do not believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade. We stick to climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we're convinced that global challenges can only be solved together," Merz said Friday.

Two hurt after high-speed New Zealand-France crash at Auckland SailGP race
Two sailors treated for serious injuries after Black Foils and DS Team France involved in major collision.
One sailor is in hospital with two broken legs and another was also injured in a high-speed crash between yachts representing New Zealand and France on the first day of the SailGP race in Auckland, New Zealand on Saturday.
The New Zealand team said Louis Sinclair was receiving treatment for compound fractures to both legs. Sinclair, a grinder on board the New Zealand yacht, turns winches to adjust the sails.

“Black Foils grinder Louis Sinclair is in a stable condition in Auckland Hospital after suffering injuries to both legs during the collision with the French during racing today,” the New Zealand team said in a statement. “Sinclair is receiving treatment for compound fractures to both legs but is in a stable condition.”
A sailor from the French team was also injured.
The crash occurred in the third of four SailGP races scheduled on Saturday. As the fleet of 13 boats approached the first gate at speeds of almost 90km/h (56mph), the New Zealand yacht lost control and spun into the path of France.
The French boat rode over the top of the New Zealand boat, causing severe damage to both boats, which were locked together. Racing was abandoned for the day while the injured sailors were ferried to shore and to hospital, and while the damaged boats were recovered.
“I think everyone, both team New Zealand and us, are pretty shocked,” France driver Quentin Delapierre said. “Full support to team New Zealand and my teammates, also. Hopefully, we’ll recover from this.
“Everything happened so quickly, it’s pretty cloudy in my mind. I just tried to do my best to avoid the collision but obviously it happened too quickly. I didn’t have the time to respond and steer the boat. It was a super scary situation.”
Television footage suggested the New Zealand boat lost the use of its rudder, causing it to turn in front of the France boat, which could not avoid the collision.
New Zealand had just returned after a crash with Switzerland in the first event of the season in Perth, Australia, which was won by Britain. The New Zealand driver Peter Burling received demerit points on his super sailing licence for his role in that collision.
In SailGP, teams from 13 nations race identical 50-foot catamarans which rise out of the water on foils and are capable of reaching speeds of 100km/h (60mph).
Two races were completed on Saturday before the crash. Australia won the first and New Zealand won the second. Racing on the second day, Sunday, will start early because of a threat of thunderstorms.

Israel ex-PM says he regrets knowing Epstein after released files detail their long friendship

Barak said he never observed or took part in any inappropriate behaviour, and even though he was aware of the earlier Epstein case, he assumed Epstein had paid his debt to society.
Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has apologised for his yearslong friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that included regular correspondence, multiple visits to the disgraced financier’s Manhattan apartment, and one to his private island.
“I am responsible for all my actions and decisions, and there is definitely room to ask if there wasn’t room for more in-depth judgment on my part and a more thorough examination of what the details really what exactly happened there,” Barak said in an interview.
The former Israeli leader has not been implicated in Epstein’s sexual abuse of underage girls and faces no accusations of wrongdoing.
Speaking in an interview with Israel’s Channel 12 on Thursday, Barak said he regretted having ever known Epstein and apologised to all those “who feel deeply uncomfortable.”
According to the ex-Israeli prime minister, he and his wife and some security guards paid a three-hour visit to Epstein’s home in the US Virgin Islands but saw only Epstein and some maintenance workers there.
Barak said he never observed or took part in any inappropriate behavior. He said he was aware of the earlier Epstein case but assumed he had paid his debt to society.
“Only in 2019, when a reinvestigation of the whole story begins, does the breadth and depth of the man’s heinous crimes become apparent and I cut off relations with him, and everyone cuts off relations with him,” Barak said.
He added it’s likely more information will emerge from the documents in the weeks ahead, but he maintained that he had done nothing illegal or improper.
“I promise you that nothing will be discovered, because there is nothing,” he said.
Barak appears in several documents
Barak is among several political, business and cultural elites found to have maintained long relationships with Epstein, even after his 2008 guilty plea for soliciting prostitution from an underage girl in Florida.
The former Israeli PM, who has previously distanced himself from Epstein, gave the latest interview after millions of pages of documents were released by the US Justice Department in connection with its investigations of Epstein.
Barak and his wife, Nili, have turned up frequently in the documents, showing they stayed in regular contact with Epstein for years, including after he cut a deal with prosecutors in 2008 that resulted in an 18-month prison sentence.
Barak served as prime minister from 1999 to 2001, when Israel and the Palestinians held high-level peace talks before the process collapsed and a Palestinian uprising broke out. He later served as defense minister.
His ties to Epstein came to light seven years ago after Barak announced a political comeback in an unsuccessful bid to topple Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
At the time, US tax records showed Barak received some $2 million in grants for unspecified “research” the previous decade from the Wexner Foundation, a philanthropic organisation that supports Jewish causes. At the time, Epstein was a trustee of the foundation.
Barak downplayed those ties when they surfaced, saying Epstein “didn’t support me or pay me.” However, some documents detail plans for a 2017 stay at Epstein’s New York residence, while others discuss mundane logistics for other visits, meetings and phone calls.
In June 2019, Barak’s wife, Nili, emailed Epstein, saying they delayed their flight to New York by roughly a week. In 2013, Epstein’s assistant, Lesley Groff, emailed Epstein about dinner with Barak, his wife and several business people and celebrities, including Woody Allen.
In 2019 — about a week before Epstein was arrested — an exchange about Barak between Epstein and an unknown person shows Epstein saying he was “dealing with Ehud in Israel.” Making me crazy.”
The documents show that Epstein connected Barak with US President Donald Trump’s former adviser, Steve Bannon, who was seeking to become more involved in Israeli politics. Emails from Epstein to his staff and others in 2018 discussed setting up dinners or meetings between Barak and Bannon.
Bannon has not been implicated in any wrongdoing related to Epstein.
Epstein died by suicide in detention in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal allegations of sexually abusing and trafficking dozens of girls.

Türkiye's Communications Director Burhanettin Duran met with international media representatives in Istanbul at an event held at a hotel in Beyoğlu on Feb. 14.
Türkiye’s Communications Director Burhanettin Duran said Türkiye’s growing profile as a go-to mediator in conflict zones is the result of a “solution-oriented and consistent” foreign policy, not chance.
Duran made the remarks during a meeting with international media representatives in Istanbul, where he also warned that global institutions are weakening at a time of rising uncertainty and overlapping crises.
He said countries are increasingly left to deal with crises on their own, while challenges such as climate change, food security, and the risks of technological transformation add to existing global fault lines.
He urged stronger multilateral solidarity to address what he described as a widening gap between global problems and the system’s capacity to solve them.
Pointing to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s long-running call for “a fairer world,” Duran said journalists play a critical role in documenting events and helping the public see the “global picture.”
On Gaza, Duran said Türkiye considers a solution to the Palestinian issue “vital,” calling for humanitarian access, and a lasting peace.
Referring to the Gaza "genocide," he said Türkiye would continue “results-oriented initiatives” through the “Peace Council” established after a ceasefire.
Duran also said Türkiye supports efforts by Syria’s government to fight terrorism, rebuild, and restore stability across the country, stressing the importance of the “one state, one army” principle for lasting stability.
He cited Türkiye’s ability to keep channels open with both sides in the Russia-Ukraine war and its role in supporting the Black Sea Grain Initiative as examples of Ankara’s crisis diplomacy and also pointed to its involvement in efforts related to Ethiopia-Somalia tensions and the Azerbaijan-Armenia tensions.
Turning to media relations, Duran said his office aims to maintain “symmetrical, transparent, and open” communication with journalists and to counter disinformation with a proactive approach, including regular briefings and media programs.

Are lasers the future of anti-drone warfare?
Repelling mass drone strikes is a hard and expensive task, but lasers might help. Defence companies are in a gold rush to make that happen.
A drone appears on the grainy, gray-scaled image of the thermal camera. This is the type of drone used by groups such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Yemeni Houthis. Suddenly, a blinding whiteness overtakes the image. Seconds later, the wing of the drone snaps off, sending it tumbling down, exploding when it hits the ground.
This is a video shared by the Israeli Ministry of Defence and arms producer Rafael, a hint towards the future of anti-drone warfare. In it, they are demonstrating one of their new weapons: a high-energy laser designed to take down aerial threats such as drones, but also rockets and even artillery shells. It’s called Iron Beam. Israel claims they have shot down several enemy drones with it already.

Laser weapons have been a dream for arms manufacturers and militaries since the invention of the laser in 1960. So far, they have remained a dream. But now they seem to be on the brink of a breakthrough. Technological advances have made lasers more robust. At the same time, the rise of drones increases the need for weapons that can shoot them down cheaply and efficiently.
“Lasers are the next step in air defence systems,” says Iain Boyd, director of the Center for National Security Initiatives at the University of Colorado Boulder, where he works on high-energy lasers in defence projects.
“When you are attacked by thousands of inexpensive drones, you cannot afford to defend yourself with expensive anti-air weapons, such as missiles. Lasers might be a solution.”
This promise is causing a gold rush among defence companies. Independent analyses on the market’s size are lacking, but a flurry of contracts and announcements have recently been made.
The Israeli Iron Beam contract is worth $500m for Rafael and Elbit Systems, another Israeli defence company. The US Navy has contracted Lockheed Martin to supply its ships with defensive high-energy lasers. UK defence firm MBDA was awarded a 316-million-pound ($430m) defence contract at the end of 2025 to deliver their DragonFire laser weapon system by 2027. MBDA is also cooperating with German defence giant Rheinmetall to develop a German system by 2029. France, in turn, took a similar approach, teaming up again with MBDA and a flurry of its own defence players to develop a laser system.
Star Wars
One of the companies benefitting from this gold rush is the Australian Electro-Optical Systems (EOS), led by the German CEO Andreas Schwer. In 2025, they secured a 71-million-euro ($84m) contract with the Netherlands for the development of a laser weapon. In December, another contract, worth $80m, was announced with South Korea.
Their laser technology is a descendant of the United States’s Strategic Defense Initiative programme, colloquially known as Star Wars. In the 1980s, US President Ronald Reagan created the programme to use lasers, fired from space, to shoot down Soviet ballistic missiles.
That grand vision failed. Billions were invested, but in the 1990s, most of the programmes ended. EOS was one of the participants. They used Star Wars’ insights to build lasers that track satellites. But now they are using them for a different goal: shooting down drones.
“Our high-energy laser is a derivative of our Star Wars technology,” says Schwer. “Initially, we developed lasers to track satellites. But when the Houthi rebels used drones to attack Saudi Arabia in 2018, we realised this technology was needed elsewhere.”
Today, they employ 500 people; by the end of next year, that should be 700. If EOS does any large acquisitions, that number might even be even higher, claims Schwer.
For their laser weapons, EOS is aiming to cooperate with local defence companies as a growth strategy. In Europe, for example, they are working together with players such as Helsing, OHB, MSI and KNDS. That way, they can grow without having to invest large amounts of capital. “We team up with local champions,” says Schwer.
Dependency and sovereignty
Particularly in Europe, the market for high-energy lasers is growing. The importance of drone warfare in Ukraine, but also recent cases of drone flights over critical infrastructure in Europe, and Russian drone incursions on the Eastern border of the EU, have caused a surge in demand for anything that can repel mass drone attacks.
“High-energy laser weapons have, supposedly, been just around the corner for a long time now. However, in the last few years we have seen the technology mature and systems actually being deployed,” says James Black, deputy director of the defence and security research group at RAND Europe.
The market is still fragmented, however, with many countries launching their own research projects. “You have different countries investing in sovereign R&D projects, testing and low-scale field tests,” says Black. “We don’t yet have a mass market rollout. We haven’t seen industrial consolidation yet.”
One of the reasons why lasers are so attractive is that they are not dependent on existing supply chains for air-defence weapons. “Countries want sovereign air defence solutions,” says Black. “They want to reduce their dependency on foreign suppliers. For different weapons, such as Patriot missiles, you’re, for example, dependent on the US.”
For many advanced anti-air weapons, the US is currently the dominant player. The companies that will dominate the market for laser weapons might come from a different part of the world, though. “For the US military, the main priority is deterring and defeating China,” says Black. “That affects which weapons US companies develop. China is more advanced than Russia or Iran. Also, the Indo-Pacific is a very large area, with mostly sea. Massed attacks by small drones are much less of a threat there than in Europe.”
Drone swarms
Lasers are becoming viable now, on the one hand, because the technology has simply matured. “Twenty years ago, we were using chemical lasers for these projects,” says Boyd. “They were the only ones that had enough power.”
A laser always has a medium through which the light passes and which amplifies it. Up until recently, for military lasers, the medium of choice was a cocktail of chemicals. These lasers generate a very powerful beam, but they also have downsides, including the volatile chemicals themselves.
In the past few years, however, solid-state lasers have become more powerful. In such lasers, the medium is a solid material, such as optical fibre. These lasers are more robust and easier to handle. “Solid-state lasers are used for all kinds of industrial processes,” says Boyd. “Civilian industries advanced them significantly. That accelerated their use in military applications.”
Technical issues still need to be resolved, however. One of those is collateral damage. A laser beam that misses its target just keeps going straight and could, for example, miss a drone and hit an airliner or satellite.
“Laser beams can also scatter off surfaces and blind people,” says Boyd. “That’s why good targeting systems are so important.”
This became clear this week when the airspace around El Paso, in the US, was closed down unexpectedly by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), leading to chaos at the local airport. The shutdown seems to have been related to a non-scheduled test of an anti-drone laser weapon by the US Customs and Border Protection.
“The El Paso incident strongly illustrates the need for careful use of laser weapons,” says Boyd. “In cluttered civil environments, it is particularly important to have an effective process in place for de-confliction of the region into which a laser is being fired.”
Lasers are also sensitive to the weather; rain or fog reduces their effectiveness significantly. They also generate a lot of heat, which makes them prone to overheating and could make them an easy target on a battlefield. That is why initially, lasers might be used to defend critical infrastructure away from front lines, or be installed on ships.
“We’re not going to be shooting handheld lasers at each other anytime soon,” says Black. “Lasers aren’t a silver bullet. They don’t solve all problems. But they are making concrete advances, and countries are actually putting them in the field. They will, however, need to be integrated in wider anti-air systems, where they will serve beside other weapons.”
In Australia, EOS is working on that. One of their priorities is making their lasers more powerful, and able to handle large swarms of drones. “We want to have more kills per minute,” says Schwer. “That’s why you need more power. Our next step is to have 50 kills per minute. Even with large swarms of drones, nothing will be able to get through.”

'You arrived before things got insane': How moving to Sweden is tougher now
Sweden

"It was a different world," exclaimed our contributor Mandy Pipher yesterday when I told her of my citizenship application back in 2016. It had taken only three months from application before a document confirming me a Swede dropped through my mailbox. "You arrived before things got insane," she sighed (or would have if sighing were possible over a messaging app).
As Mandy wrote in an excellent article detailing the exhausting immigration journey she's been going through, if not insane, it's definitely tougher now. What irks her is that Swedes tend to assume that, for her, it isn't. She's highly educated, comes from Canada, and is married to a Swede. It must be easy, right?
As readers probably know, when it comes to The Local's coverage of migration rules, our journalists very much have skin in the game.
When Sweden's government announced it will tighten citizenship rules on June 6th, National Day, our acting editor, Becky Waterton, gave a similar personal take. Will people like her with pending citizenship applications end up being rejected on the basis of language and citizen tests that do not yet even exist, she asked?
The answer we learned the next day in a statement from Migration Minister Johan Forssell's press spokesperson, is basically, "yes", as you can see Becky in the video below.
To me, at least, that seems pretty insane.
View this post on Instagram
Migration news
The draft citizenship law took up most of our time this week.
We tried to answer readers' questions on the new law as best we could, updating our answers as new information came in. (If you have questions of your own, you can ask them in the comments section to the article).
Becky explained how, in the absence of government citizenship tests, you can demonstrate your knowledge of Swedish language and society so your application won't be rejected after June 6th. It isn't going to be easy.
I outlined why the new rules will make it significantly harder for children to gain Swedish citizenship, with the law effectively abolishing the old, nearly automatic "citizenship via notification" route.
Mandy went through why the new rules will make Swedish citizenship almost impossible for stay-at-home partners to obtain.
We had a huge response to our reader survey on whether the stricter citizenship laws and their retroactive application made them regret coming to Sweden. "I am done with Sweden," wrote Ricardo, a software developer based in Stockholm, in one of the over a hundred responses we received. "I planned a long-term life here based on citizenship and now I see all my plans ruined. I want to live on a place that I am not afraid of the government changing the rules all the time."
The publication of the draft citizenship law knocked teen deportations – the big political story of recent weeks – slightly out of the spotlight. But we kept covering the political machinations.
On Monday, we published an interview with Annika Hirvonen, the immigration spokesperson for the Green Party, whose initiative in the parliament helped make it a mainstream political issue.
Membership+ subscribers can listen to this interview and another interview I did with the Centre Party's immigration spokesperson Niels Paarup-Petersen in our Sweden in Focus Extra podcast.
I listed the various solutions to the problem proposed by the opposition and government parties. You can watch me rush through them in a video here.
Our publishing director James Savage argued in his Politics in Sweden column that the episode was showing that the Swedish public is more pro-migration than most people, and certainly most politicians, think. You can watch him discuss Sweden's tougher migration rules in this video.
If you are affected by the teen deportation, we are looking to speak to people so we can drive through to the Swedish public that this is something that affects highly skilled workers. If this is you, you can tell us about your situation in our survey.
We also had some news on the other big immigration news story, the coming hike to the work permit salary threshold. I obtained the text of the instructions the government gave the Migration Agency in January when asking it to draw up a list of exempted professions. The agency, it said, should "start with the premise that the need for exemptions is limited".
If this all seems too much (and it's a lot) you can hear Becky and James discuss it all in a more digestible format in this week's episode of Sweden in Focus.
What else have we been writing about?
It was one of those weeks where migration news dominated everything, but we still found time to cover some other stuff. A government inquiry gave its proposals on how to make membership of a criminal gang a punishable offence. Sweden's finance minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, warned that "most of the leeway for extra spending" in the four years after the election has already been used up.
Next week, it's the sportlov holiday here in Malmö, so I'll be off from Wednesday. On Sunday I'll be taking to the slopes, dragging my children to hills of Halland to take advantage of the snow.
Oh, and I hope you all have a happy Valentine's Day!

US urges Europe to take lead in NATO conventional defence
United Kingdom

A senior US defence official has called on European NATO members to assume primary responsibility for the conventional defence of Europe, arguing the Alliance must adapt to a changed strategic environment and a growing need for the United States to prioritise threats elsewhere, according to remarks delivered at the NATO Defence Ministerial.
Speaking in Brussels, Under Secretary of War for Policy Elbridge Colby said the world that shaped NATO’s posture following the Cold War “no longer exists”, warning that “power politics has returned” and that large-scale military force is again being used.
Colby said the United States was prioritising defence of the homeland and interests in the Western Hemisphere, while reinforcing deterrence in the Indo-Pacific, particularly the Western Pacific. He added that allies must be prepared for the possibility of opponents acting simultaneously across multiple theatres.
“These realities compel us to think clearly, soberly, and realistically about how we defend ourselves, and how we do so together in a way that is sustainable, sensible, and enduring,” he said.
Colby rejected the suggestion that this shift represented a withdrawal from NATO, describing it instead as a return to the Alliance’s original purpose. He said NATO’s Cold War model involved allies being expected to “pull their weight”, citing burden-sharing debates under multiple US presidents and arguing that the approach helped deter Soviet aggression.
He described the post-Cold War era as a shift into what he called “NATO 2.0”, characterised by reduced European defence spending and a greater focus on operations outside the Alliance’s core area. Colby said this model was no longer “fit for purpose” and called for a “NATO 3.0” approach that more closely resembled the Cold War framework.
“This ‘NATO 3.0’ requires much greater efforts by our allies to step up and assume primary responsibility for the conventional defense of Europe,” he said.
Colby praised commitments made at the 2025 Hague Summit, saying NATO members had begun to recognise that a model in which the United States provided the “overwhelming share of high-end military power” while European allies spent relatively little was no longer sustainable.
He said allies were now moving toward the Hague commitments of 3.5% and 5% of GDP on core and broader defence spending, describing the levels as a “new global standard”.
However, Colby argued that NATO must now turn spending commitments into practical military outputs, including “ready forces, usable munitions, resilient logistics, and integrated command structures”.
“Defense spending levels matter, and there is no substitute for it. But what matters at the end of the day is what those resources produce,” he said.
He also called for greater emphasis on warfighting effectiveness and warned against over-ambitious procurement goals, stating that not every capability could be “gold-plated” and that NATO members would need to make hard choices about readiness and stockpiles.
Colby said the United States would continue to provide extended nuclear deterrence and would still contribute conventional capabilities, but in a “more limited and focused fashion”. He said Washington would be candid about the scale and timeline of change, while continuing to train, exercise and plan alongside allies.
“We will continue to provide the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent,” he said, adding: “We in the Department of War will continue to ready our forces to do our part under Article V with Europe taking the lead for its conventional defense.” Colby said the United States would continue to push for a “rebalancing of roles and burdens” within the Alliance, describing this as necessary to ensure NATO remained credible and sustainable.
He argued the approach was intended to strengthen Europe rather than weaken it, saying the US sought “partnerships, not dependencies”. He added that alliances were strongest when responsibilities were shared in line with power and interests, warning that imbalances could create “structural strain”. Colby said he was encouraged by increased defence spending among several European allies and ongoing reforms to procurement and readiness systems. He also pointed to NATO’s defence planning process becoming more operationally focused.
He concluded by describing a future NATO in which Europe provides the primary conventional defence of the continent, supported by US strategic power, and said the Alliance must be grounded in deterrence and effective defence rather than “symbolism”. “Partnership, by definition, means walking together, each carrying a fair share of the load,” he said.

AU calls for end to ‘extermination’ of Palestinians, decries African wars
African heads of state gather in Ethiopia’s Addis Ababa for the 39th African Union Summit.
The “extermination” of the Palestinian people must end, the chairman of the African Union Commission, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, has said, as dozens of heads of state gather for the regional body’s 39th summit in the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
“In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop,” said Youssouf, who was elected to head the institution a year ago, declared on Saturday.

The annual meeting is expected to focus on ruinous wars and security in the region as well as governance challenges around the world, threats to democracy and climate change, including water sanitation and water‑linked climate shocks.
“International law and international humanitarian law are the basis of the international community,” Youssouf added, as he called for the lifting of the Israeli blockade of humanitarian goods into the besieged Palestinian territory.
Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza has killed at least 72,045 people and wounded 171,686 since October 2023, and continues despite a “ceasefire”.
Youssouf also touched on the multiple conflicts raging in Africa, calling for the “silencing of the guns” across the continent.
“From Sudan to the Sahel, to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), in Somalia and elsewhere, our people continue to pay the heavy price of instability,” Youssouf said.
The summit brings together heads of state from the 55 member states of the African Union over two days.
In his speech at the summit, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised the AU as a “flagship for multilateralism” at a time of global “division and mistrust”.
Guterres also called for a permanent African seat in the UN Security Council, saying its absence is “indefensible”.
“This is 2026, not 1946. Whatever decisions about the African World around the table, Africa must be at the table,” he declared.
This year’s theme is water sanitation.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed highlighted the issue of water conservation on the continent, as he welcomed other leaders to the capital.
“Water is more than just a resource. It is a foundation of development, innovation and stability,” he said. “Here in Ethiopia, we have learned that responsible water management is central to guiding development wisely.”
In Africa, water cuts across interstate disputes, like Egypt and Ethiopia’s fight over the Nile, deadly tensions between farmers and herders in Nigeria over access to the same arable land, antigovernment protests over failed service delivery in Madagascar, and the outbreak of health epidemics in the wake of major floods and droughts.
Al Jazeera’s Haru Mutasa, reporting from Addis Ababa, said that while the issue of water is front and centre at this year’s summit, unresolved questions from last year’s gathering, including the cuts in global aide, continue to fester.
“There seems to be not enough money to the people who are in need,” our correspondent said.
She also added the ongoing deadly war in the DRC, which is causing mass displacement and famine, as well as the brutal, nearly three-year war in Sudan are also high on the summit agenda, as well as the reignited conflict in neighbouring South Sudan.
On Saturday, as the AU summit opened, at least four explosions were heard around the government-aligned Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) base in the city of Dilling in South Kordofan, as drones from the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group targeted the city.
The African continent makes up about a fifth of the global population, with an estimated 1.4 billion people, about 400 million of whom are 15 to 35 years old.
But it is also home to several of the world’s oldest and longest-serving leaders, many criticised as out-of-touch – a paradox that has contributed to an upsurge in military takeovers and other undemocratic means, notably in West African nations, such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Niger, and Guinea-Bissau.
Some observers say the AU Summit will provide an opportunity to align continental priorities with international partners, especially at a time of discussions around a “new world order” stirred by US President Donald Trump, with foreign leaders signalling shifting global alliances and many looking towards China.

Russian subsidiaries of French agribusiness group Sucden support war effort in Ukraine

Russian subsidiaries of French agribusiness group Sucden support war effort in Ukraine
Russian subsidiaries of French agribusiness group Sucden have been accused of directly supporting the Russian Armed Forces between 2023 and 2025.
Source: RFI, a French news public radio station, citing European public service channelArte and Mediapart, an independent nonprofit French investigative online newspaper
Details: The investigation showed that the support included supplies of equipment and materiel to units involved in the war against Ukraine.
The journalists report that several Russian subsidiaries of Sucden (Sucres et denrées), owned by French sugar magnate Serge Varsano, provided the Russian military with equipment for weaving camouflage nets and rubber strips to protect armoured vehicles from drones and vehicles. They also took part in raising funds for frontline needs.
At two of Sucden's large sugar plants in Russia's Lipetsk Oblast, local authorities actively enlist businesses to support the Russian Armed Forces. They are the Yelets Sugar Plant (Agrosnabsakhar) and the Dobrinsky Sugar Plant.
The oblast runs a dedicated programme called Lipetsk Industry for Victory, which is said to include 34 companies, though a list of participants is not publicly available.
In May 2024, Vladimir Serikov, speaker of Lipetsk Oblast Council, said that a number of foreign companies in the oblast supported the so-called "special military operation", the term used by the Russian government to describe the Russo-Ukrainian war.
Arte reported that three subsidiaries linked to Sucden featured among the companies were involved in these activities.
The Yelets Sugar Plant handed Russian forces machines for cutting camouflage strips. The Dobrinsky Sugar Plant supplied rubber for protective conveyor belts at the request of the Russian 283rd Motor Rifle Regiment.
The investigation also established that the agricultural firm Yeletsky, which grows grain, helped volunteers buy mesh fabric for the Russian troops in 2025.
In the city of Kamenka in Penza Oblast, one of the oblast's biggest businesses, Atmis-Sakhar, reportedly manufactures ovens for the Russian military, supplied rubber conveyor belts and opened a camouflage net workshop.
In Russia's Krasnodar Krai, Uspensky Sugar Plant reportedly provided transport with anti-drone coverings for moving military personnel. The Uspensky Agropromsoyuz agricultural company bought anti-drone blankets for fighters from the Russian 810th Naval Infantry Brigade, which took part in the capture of Ukrainian city of Mariupol.
RFI said its journalists linked the companies to the effort by tracking social media posts from Russian volunteer networks, which regularly release messages thanking the plants for their support.
In response to media enquiries, Sucden said it launched an internal review. Its press office said the actions were "local private initiatives" carried out without the knowledge or approval of its Paris headquarters.
The company said the actions of its subsidiaries "contradict the group's rules and practice". It added it has strictly complied with European Union sanctions obligations since 2022.
Sucden was founded in the 1950s and entered the Russian market in the early 1990s as a trader before moving into direct industrial investment in the 2000s.
Mediapart said the group's main production cluster is in Russia, with four plants producing 800,000 tonnes of sugar a year and agricultural businesses growing sugar beet and grain across 250,000 hectares.
Nicolas Sarkozy linked to Sucden
The investigation mentioned former French president Nicolas Sarkozy, who works with the French company as a consultant and is a family friend to Serge Varsano.
Mediapart previously reported on Sarkozy's business and political ties in Russia and on his consultancy contracts with Russian companies.
Mediapart reported back in 2023 that the former French president received two transfers totalling €300,000 shortly before and some time after a speech he gave at a New Year's Eve reception hosted by the Russian Direct Investment Fund in late 2018.
Background:
- German prosecutors arrested five people on suspicion of forming a criminal organisation engaged in the illicit procurement of military equipment for Russian companies.
- Eight sanctioned tankers are travelling through the English Channel despite promises by the UK government to take decisive action against vessels of the shadow fleet, which Moscow has used to circumvent Western restrictions on its energy sector imposed since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
- Russia has obtained Michelin aircraft tyres worth more than US$7 million despite EU sanctions.
- Cars made by German companies were delivered to a sanctioned Russian fertiliser producer, Uralkali, via Uzbekistan.

Belarus Tests Russian Molot Drone Interceptor

19:49:40 KST

The Belarusian military has tested the Russian Molot drone interceptor, which is launched from a hand-held launcher.
In early February, Belarus began testing 59 different systems for combating drones, according to a representative of the country’s Ministry of Defense.
The tests involve detection, suppression, and destruction systems.
“More than 80% of the systems presented in the experiment are Belarusian-made,” the Ministry of Defence said.
The Russian Molot system from Nova Labs was admitted to the tests.
Molot consists of two main parts: a reusable launcher and an interceptor drone.
The launcher is designed as a tube closed at the rear, with two external handles, a stock, and a sight.
In combat position with the UAV installed, its length does not exceed 700–800 mm, and its weight is only a few kilograms. The system does not impose any special requirements on the user.
A UAV with a cylindrical body and a hemispherical nose cone is used as an interceptor.
Inside the body are a homing head, control devices, a warhead, and a battery. Depending on the configuration, the launch weight of the device does not exceed 1.5–2 kg.
Four electric motors with propellers provide flight. The UAV is capable of vertical takeoff, hovering, and horizontal flight.
In flight, the device reaches speeds of up to 50 m/s. The combat radius depends on the type of target: when operating against large aircraft-type drones, it reaches 1 km.
Interception of drones with a diameter of up to 500–700 mm is possible at a distance of 350–400 m, and the operating height is up to 200 m.
The UAV is equipped with an infrared homing head capable of independently tracking the target. It is claimed that the project implements the ‘launch and forget’ principle.
A 500 g high-explosive warhead is provided to destroy the target. The explosion occurs upon contact with the target or when passing it at a minimum distance. Kinetic interception is also possible — the UAV hits the target with a direct hit.
In the new version, the manufacturer claims that the interceptor can hit targets at an altitude of up to 2 km at speeds of up to 200 km/h. It is designed in two versions — portable and stationary.
The portable version features a thermal imaging homing head and 100 mm kinetic ammunition with a speed of up to 265 km/h.
The stationary version is equipped with radio command or laser guidance, has a range of up to 3.5 km, and the projectile speed reaches 360 km/h.
Ukraine also recently unveiled a new interceptor drone, the Saliut, which is already shooting down Shahed-type drones.

Tarique Rahman: From 17-year exile to landslide win in Bangladesh election
Results mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the BNP chief, who left the country in 2008 and returned from London less than two months ago.
Less than two months after returning from 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman has won one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and is set to become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did.
A coalition led by his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a decisive two-thirds majority in the parliamentary election, according to the results published in the official gazette of the Bangladesh Election Commission.

On Saturday, Rahman addressed the country during a press conference, calling for unity and dedicating his sweeping win to those who “sacrificed for democracy”.
“I firmly believe that national unity is a collective strength, while division is a weakness.”
The result is expected to bring stability after months of turmoil following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in 2024, during which security forces killed hundreds on her orders. She has since been sentenced to death in absentia.
Hasina, now in exile in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.
Thursday’s election marked a remarkable reversal of fortune for Rahman, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his arrest during a military-backed caretaker administration’s crackdown on alleged corruption.
The soft-spoken 60-year-old BNP leader returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter, and took over the party’s command as chairman after the death of his mother five days later.
During the election campaign, Rahman pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.
He has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.
Rezaul Karim Rony, a Dhaka-based political analyst, described the BNP’s landslide win as a “victory of a democratic, moderate force”.
“The challenge now is to ensure good governance, law and order, and public safety, and to establish a rights-based state, which was at the heart of the aspirations of the 2024 mass uprising,” he told Al Jazeera.
Rony said the job ahead for Rahman is moving away from cadre-based politics towards a rights-based system that reflects younger generations’ desire for a more inclusive governance.
“The task now is to build a state based on that spirit – ensuring the rule of law, human dignity and employment opportunities,” he said. “The question now is how Tarique Rahman will confront this responsibility.”
The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former President Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agro-products.
After his return, Rahman tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina, and get rid of the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister.
Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.
“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he recently said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”
Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also sentenced to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many. He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.
From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappeared, and offices shuttered.
Since his return, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring “people’s ownership of the state” and rebuilding institutions – a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start.
Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders said he directly oversaw candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely.
He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.
“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”
Reporting from Dhaka, Al Jazeera’s Jonah Hull said since his return, Rahman has become “a pretty ubiquitous figure”, who made “lots of big promises about restoring law and order, rebuilding infrastructure and healthcare”.
“He has made big promises, notably on corruption, especially for a party tainted with corruption itself in the past. Rahman is promising a top-down, no-tolerance approach to corruption, and a new era of clean politics in Bangladesh.”
As he prepared on Saturday to take the reigns of power in the country, Rahman said the new government he will lead faces daunting challenges.
“We have paved the way for the establishment of democracy in the country,” he added.
“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions and destroying law and order.”

Ex-hostage reveals she tried to kill herself in Gaza, says view of protests saved her
Arbel Yehoud and Ariel Cunio detail dire conditions in solitary captivity, decribe how terrorists passed letters between them, allowing for brief communication
Former hostage Arbel Yehoud revealed in an interview broadcast Friday that she attempted to end her life several times while held captive by Palestinian terrorists in Gaza, but ultimately decided not to after her captors showed her video of a protest in Israel where she saw her face on a poster, and she understood that people were fighting for her.
In a separate interview, Yehoud indicated that she had faced sexual assault on an almost daily basis among widespread abuses she suffered while being held alone.
“One of the times, not long before my release, I saw drone footage from Hostages Square [in Tel Aviv]. I saw people holding signs of people I don’t know, and then suddenly I saw signs of people I knew. I saw a sign for Ariel [Cunio] and a sign for me, signs of people from the kibbutz,” Yehoud told Channel 12 news in an interview alongside Cunio.
“From the moment I saw that, I didn’t try to put an end to my own life there.”
Amid the two-year war, tens of thousands of people staged weekly Saturday night protests in Tel Aviv and around the country, demanding that the government reach a deal to bring the hostages home.
“That was the last time I tried,” she continued, noting she attempted to kill herself at least three times while in captivity. “When I saw the drone footage and understood that people who I don’t know are fighting for me as if I were their sister or daughter, I have a duty to return to Ariel and my family, but also to those fighting for me.”
Torn apart
Cunio and Yehoud, self-described “high school sweethearts,” were kidnapped together from their shared home at Kibbutz Nir Oz during the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led invasion of southern Israel that sparked the war.
Yehoud was released after 482 days in captivity during a truce in January 2025, while Cunio was returned as part of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal reached in October.
Cunio recalled the terror of their abduction and being torn apart once they entered Gaza.
“I told her, ‘The most important thing is that we stay together. As long as they don’t separate us, we’ll be okay.’ Half an hour later, that is what happened,” Cunio said. “It happened so fast, there wasn’t even time to say ‘I love you, be strong.'”
“I didn’t manage to tell him bye, I didn’t get to see his eyes,” Yehoud added.
While many of the 251 hostages were held together in small groups by Hamas, both Yehoud and Cunio were held by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which kept them separate and alone.
Cunio described the isolation that he felt during his captivity. “I was completely alone for two years, I never saw a single captive,” he said. “Have you ever wondered if you’ll see the sunrise tomorrow?”
He said that after being captured, he was first taken to a residential building, before being transferred and held in a crawlspace above the ceiling of a store.
“I was there for about three and a half months, hunched over all the time, with mice walking around you, cockroaches, and you sitting on a mattress all day. The windows are closed, the door is closed all day,” he said. “Because of the heat, you don’t even have air to breathe. Even though you’re not underground, you don’t have air. You feel suffocated, the heat is so intense that you sweat 24/7 for months. You’re dirty, your skin turns black, a rash on your body, from head to toe.”
Additionally, because he was held above a busy street, he had to remain quiet at all times, otherwise he would be threatened with being handed over to Hamas and being forced into the tunnels.
Letters and notes
Cunio said that after repeatedly pressing his captors for information on Yehoud, they told him to write a letter, which they ended up passing along to her, leading to a period of a few months in which they were able to correspond.
Yehoud said that she was shocked to receive the first letter, and that her captors told her that Cunio “drove them crazy.”
“It was a lot of writing about the love between us, what was going on with us each day, our conditions, trying to get some sort of picture of what is going on outside,” he said in the interview. “She wrote to me in the last letter that she heard there was a massacre at Nir Oz and that we need to stay strong about what we will discover when we get out, because you don’t know anything. You don’t know if your family is living, who is dead, who was kidnapped.”
However, they weren’t able to keep up the communication. Yehoud described how the letters became shorter, “meaning they became a small note like this: ‘I’m fine, I love you.'” She added she wasn’t allowed to write more than that.
“They told me, ‘No more letters, you don’t ask about him anymore,'” Yehoud continued. “‘We will kill you, we will kill him.’ That’s it.”
She added, “We’re not the same people and we’re still trying to find our new path as a couple.”
Terrified
In a separate interview with The Daily Mail, Yehoud described her harrowing release and her fears that even as she was being set free, she would be captured by other gangs in Gaza.
Yehoud was released as one of seven hostages handed over during a long process in southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, one of the most chaotic handover ceremonies that saw her and Gadi Mozes paraded through a seething mass, including hundreds of masked gunmen.
They were forced to walk through the crowds, with gunmen at their side, from the vehicles that delivered them and, later, to the Red Cross vehicles, in chaotic scenes that prompted outrage from Israel.
“I remember stepping out and seeing that sea of green headbands,” she said. “I was the only woman. My mind was trying to process — am I free? But I’m still surrounded by them? I was terrified, but I knew I had to survive. My thoughts were of Ariel — I had to get back to him.”
Every single day
While speaking with Daily Mail, Yehoud also spoke of the difficulty in being able to speak about her experiences since her release and how she drew inspiration from other former hostages.
Yehoud said she hadn’t been able to watch the stories of other survivors, though that changed when former hostage Romi Gonen revealed in a recent interview that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by terrorists before being transferred underground with other captives.
“It felt different,” she said. “It was hard for me — but in the end, I decided to watch the segment about her. I realized that what Romi describes experiencing once is what I went through almost every single day in captivity.”
In addition, Yehoud says she endured interrogations, forced conversion attempts and starvation.
There is a lot she says she is still unable to talk about.
“Because it was a very long time, and the things I went through, I went through from beginning to end, so they are in a sealed box,” she told Channel 12.

According to him, the United States must maintain sufficient military capabilities in the Middle East to ensure that Tehran does not "come after" Washington. The White House believes that Iran should "never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon," Rubio added.

Ukrainian forces destroyed half of Russia's Pantsir missile systems in 2025 – Ukraine's Security Service
Special Operations Centre Alpha, part of the Security Service of Ukraine (SSU), destroyed half of Russia's Pantsir surface-to-air artillery and missile systems in 2025.
Source: SSU on Facebook
Quote: "Long-range strikes by the SSU's Special Operations Centre Alpha halved the number of Russian Pantsir surface-to-air artillery and missile systems in 2025."
Details: The SSU said the Pantsir is one of Russia's key modern air defence systems. A single system costs between US$15 million and US$20 million. Pantsirs are among the most effective systems in countering Ukraine's long-range drones.
Quote: "That is why the systematic destruction of Pantsir systems has a strategic goal: to break through the enemy's air defence and create corridors to strike targets deep in its rear. This enables Ukraine's defence forces to operate effectively against military bases, warehouses, airfields and other occupier facilities."
More details: The total value of all Russian air defence systems destroyed by the SSU's Special Operations Centre Alpha in 2025 is estimated at about US$4 billion.

Buyers Choose Location Over Size as Bulgarian Housing Prices Rise

The housing market in Bulgaria is undergoing notable shifts, with buyers increasingly prioritizing location and accessibility over sheer size. According to the latest analysis by “ADDRESS Real Estate,” the rising property prices in 2025, which climbed between 15 and 20 percent in major cities like Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, and Burgas, have prompted a more pragmatic approach. Prospective homeowners are now more willing to compromise on square meters to secure convenient infrastructure, a desirable neighborhood, and manageable mortgage conditions.
Looking ahead to 2026, the outlook for price reductions remains limited. Gergana Tenekedzhieva, CEO of “ADDRESS Real Estate,” points out that a significant market correction would require a sudden need for liquidity, which is currently absent. Sellers seeking to part with properties at no profit continue to be a minority, estimated below 8 percent, and even they offer minimal discounts. Data from late 2025 confirms this pattern: while nearly half of transactions involve negotiation, the typical reduction from the asking price ranges only between 2 and 8 percent.
Panel apartments are experiencing particularly high demand, far outstripping the limited supply. Although around 10 percent of buyers express interest in this segment, only 1 percent of the market provides suitable properties, leading to rapid sales, often immediately after the first viewing. These apartments remain a practical choice for families needing larger space on a budget, as a three-bedroom panel flat in a suburban area can cost roughly the same as a two-bedroom in a more central, prestigious neighborhood.
The profile of the modern Bulgarian buyer is also changing, with the average age dropping to around 40 years, even lower in the capital. Southern exposure continues to be a top priority, influencing the choices of more than half of buyers in 2025. The rental market remains relatively steady, with two-bedroom apartments renting for 600 to 700 euros, though potential labor market uncertainties in 2026 may push more individuals toward renting. This could lead to slight increases in rental prices and improved returns for property investors.

Russia denies BRICS seeking to transform into military alliance

19:41:26 KST

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has denied that the BRICS economic bloc sought to transform into a military alliance.
In an interview with the state news agency TASS on Saturday, Ryabkov said BRICS is neither a military alliance nor a collective security organisation with obligations regarding mutual military assistance.
“It was never conceived in that spirit, and there are no plans to transform BRICS in that direction,” Ryabkov said, arguing that the 10-member bloc’s portfolio does not include military exercises or arms control.
Ryabkov also denied a recent naval exercise held in South Africa was a “BRICS event,” and that members that took part did so in their national capacity. He was referring to the “Will for Peace 2026” drills held on January 9-16, which included China, Iran, and Russia.
Asked whether BRICS could protect tankers belonging to members from attacks and ensure their safety, Ryabkov said the bloc has no potential beyond improving logistics and ensuring greater protection from sanctions, and that security must be “ensured by other means.”
Expressing solidarity with Iran
BRICS was formed in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran later joined, expanding the group to 11 members, alongside 10 partner countries.
The Russian deputy foreign minister said the growth of trade between BRICS countries significantly exceeds the global average, “an indication that BRICS, without being some kind of 'magic wand,’ can actually help solve problems."
Ryabkov said BRICS can and should express solidarity with Iran, and that Moscow and Beijing are in contact with the country and working on “ensuring the appropriate political environment” for negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
According to him, the focus now is “on the negotiations Iran is conducting with its partners, on the work Iran is doing indirectly — primarily through Arab intermediaries — with the Americans,” which he believes will continue.
US-Iran indirect talks
The US and Iran held indirect talks in Muscat on February 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program, marking the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June 2025.
Washington has also significantly increased its military footprint in the region as US President Donald Trump warns Iran, which recently faced widespread protests over worsening economic conditions, that it must make a deal.
Uranium enrichment remains a central point of dispute, with the US demanding Iran halt uranium enrichment and transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country.

British warships to patrol Arctic as Starmer pledges Nato loyalty
- Sir Keir Starmer announced at the Munich Security Conference that British warships will patrol the Arctic with the US, Canada, and other Nato allies, a decision prompted by Donald Trump’s previous threats regarding Greenland.
- The Labour leader also revealed plans for Britain to seek "deeper economic integration" with the European Union, aiming to "move closer to the single market" in various sectors, acknowledging this would involve "trade-offs."
- Starmer reaffirmed the UK's commitment to Nato's Article 5, assuring allies that Britain would come to their aid if called upon, directly addressing concerns raised by Donald Trump.
- He stated that the current EU-UK "status quo is not fit for purpose" and remarked that he "ended the week much stronger than I started it" despite domestic political challenges.
- These announcements occurred during a security gathering where US Secretary of State Marco Rubio criticised past Western errors and notably declined to attend a Ukraine meeting, which European observers interpreted as a potential sign of diminishing US interest.

Swiss exhibition explores artistic dialogue between Kirchner and Picasso
In the Swiss mountain town of Davos, works by Pablo Picasso will be shown alongside pieces by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner for the first time. The director of the Kirchner Museum says it is one of the institution’s most ambitious exhibitions to date.

“People often say Picasso’s visual language is so dominant that everything else fades into the background,” the Kirchner Museum’s director, Katharina Beisiegel, told the Keystone‑SDA news agency at a press briefing on Friday. “With this exhibition, we show how striking and how equal this pairing can be.”

Ernst Ludwig Kirchner: a ‘true German artist’ who found peace in Switzerland
Around a hundred paintings, sculptures, drawings and prints by the two artists are on show at the museum. The director and curator stressed that the aim was not to determine which of the two was the greater artist. The idea for the exhibition goes back to a wish Ernst Ludwig Kirchner voiced in 1933, five years before his death, when he said he hoped for an international show “where Picasso and I would be shown side by side”.
Done and dusted? Not quite. It took 93 years for Kirchner’s vision to be realised. Three of those were spent securing the many loans, with works arriving from some of the world’s best‑known Picasso collections in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris and Berlin.
Parallels and contrasts
Only a year separates the two artists. Kirchner was born in Aschaffenburg, Germany, in 1880, and Picasso in Málaga, southern Spain, the following year. Both showed early artistic talent, and their parents encouraged them to pursue it. A selection of their childhood drawings are displayed together in one of the museum’s rooms, where the influence of Impressionism can already be seen in their work.
More
The miracle of Picasso in Basel
As their careers progressed, both artists developed distinctly personal visual languages. “Kirchner became highly expressive early on, working with intense, vibrant colours, while Picasso, during his Cubist period, relied on a far more restrained palette,” Beisiegel explained. After the First World War, their approaches converged again, with both turning to flatter, rounder and more organic forms.
The “Kirchner.Picasso” exhibition, which opens in Davos on Sunday, February 15 and runs until May 3, is also a significant art‑historical undertaking, the director said. “Both artists played a crucial role in the development of modern art and had a profound influence on the generations that followed. And now we’re able to show the full scope of their achievements side by side.”

US secretary calls for renewed transatlantic alliance rooted in sovereignty at Munich Security Conference
Rubio urges Europe, Washington to rebuild Western partnership, stresses Ukraine diplomacy, China dialogue, reform of global institutions
ISTANBUL
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called Saturday for a renewed transatlantic alliance rooted in sovereignty, economic resilience, and shared Western identity, while outlining Washington’s approach to global conflicts and competition with China.
Speaking at the annual gathering of global leaders at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Rubio framed the moment as a turning point for Europe and the US, drawing historical parallels to the Cold War era when the conference began in 1963.
“We gather here today as members of a historic alliance, an alliance that saved and changed the world,” Rubio said, recalling a divided Europe and the existential threats posed by Soviet communism. He warned that post-Cold War optimism had fostered what he described as misguided assumptions about globalization and liberal democracy.
“The euphoria of this triumph led us to a dangerous delusion ... that every nation would now be a liberal democracy,” he said, arguing that excessive reliance on global institutions, free trade policies, and mass migration had weakened Western societies and undermined economic sovereignty.
‘One civilization, Western civilization’
Rubio outlined the foreign policy direction of the Donald Trump administration, emphasizing a strategy centered on national interests, stronger borders, and industrial renewal.
“Under President Trump, the United States of America will once again take on the task of renewal and restoration,” he said, adding that Washington prefers to pursue this vision alongside European allies.
Highlighting shared cultural and historical ties, Rubio described the transatlantic relationship as rooted in “one civilization, Western civilization,” and urged European partners to increase defense capabilities and maintain cultural confidence.
He said alliances must focus not only on military cooperation but also on technological competition, supply chain security, and emerging sectors such as artificial intelligence and space exploration.
“Armies fight for a people. Armies fight for a nation. Armies fight for a way of life,” Rubio said, arguing that the West must clearly define the values it seeks to defend.
‘We don’t know if Russians serious about ending war’
The US secretary also criticized the aspects of the current international system, asserting that global institutions must be reformed to remain effective.
While acknowledging the UN’s potential, he said it had failed to resolve several major crises, citing Gaza, Ukraine, and Iran’s nuclear program as examples where US-led initiatives or military action played decisive roles.
In a question-and-answer session, Rubio addressed the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying negotiations remain uncertain despite some technical-level contacts between Russian and Ukrainian officials.
“We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war,” he said, adding that sanctions and military support for Kyiv continue while Washington tests the possibility of a negotiated settlement that is “just and sustainable.”
On China, Rubio stressed the need for dialogue despite strategic rivalry ahead of a planned summit between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
“It would be geopolitical malpractice to not be in conversations with China,” he said, noting that cooperation is possible where interests align but warning that “nothing that we agree to could come at the expense of our national interests.”
Rubio concluded by urging Europe and the US to reject narratives of Western decline and instead pursue a renewed partnership. “We do not seek to separate but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history,” he said.

Europe must learn from Ukraine, European Commission president says
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said Europe must be ready to use force decisively and preemptively to defend itself and should learn from Ukraine's example.
Source: Ursula von der Leyen speaking at the Munich Security Conference, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Von der Leyen highlighted the need for a new European security strategy, including a new doctrine "to ensure that Europe can defend its own territory, economy, democracy and way of life at all times".
"Because this is ultimately the true meaning of independence," she said.
She held Ukraine up as an example, saying it had shown that "strength and deterrence and ultimately lives depend on industrial capacity".
Quote: "They say in Ukraine, 'you change or die'. We must adopt this mantra too. We need to tear down the rigid wall between the civilian and defence sectors. Europe is a powerhouse for car manufacturing, aerospace and heavy machinery. We should not look at these industries as purely commercial but as core to the defence and the defence value chain."
More details: Another lesson from the battlefield in Ukraine, von der Leyen said, is that dual-use technologies such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, drones and space must be boosted.
Quote: "And with this approach, we can close our capability gaps quickly. Drones, for example, are the most obvious of these examples. They are inflicting around 80% of battlefield damage on both sides in Ukraine. So we are massively investing and speeding up innovation and production in this area."
More details: In this context, she pointed to the new EU Defence Innovation Office in Kyiv, which is "merging European scale with Ukrainian speed and ingenuity".
Quote: "Some ask whether we can afford this. But I say we cannot afford not to."
More details: Von der Leyen also referred to the slow speed of decision-making in Europe and said the EU should rely on qualified majority support rather than unanimity to prevent attempts by individual countries to block measures.
Background:
- On 16 October, the European Commission presented a comprehensive plan to strengthen Europe's defence capabilities, including measures to counter drones and other threats from the air, sea and space, to EU member states.
- It has also been reported that the EU wants to create a drone alliance with Ukraine in early 2026.

Starmer to deploy UK warships to Arctic following Trump’s Greenland threats
The prime minister also used his speech at the Munich Security Conference to underline the UK’s commitment to Nato as he spelled out the ‘urgency’ for a closer UK defence relationship with Europe
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Keir Starmer told Europe it has to be ready to “fight” Russian aggression as he announced the UK would deploy warships and fighter jets to the Arctic later this year.
The move, announced at the Munich Security Conference, will be seen as a bid to appease Donald Trump, after he threatened to annex Greenland, citing security concerns in the region.
But even as the PM hailed what he said would be a demonstration of the trans-Atlantic relationship, US secretary of state Marco Rubio warned the continent’s leaders over their mistakes and said America needed a partner with the “will to survive”.
It came as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky hit out at the US saying his country was being asked to make concessions to Russia “too often" in America-brokered peace talks and Europe was being sidelined.
During an eventful day at the summit:
- Sir Keir rebuked President Trump to “be in no doubt - if called on the UK would come to your aid today”
- The PM said the UK should align more closely with the EU on the economy as well as defence and received a round of applause as he said: “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years anymore”
- He attacked Reform as "pro-Putin" as he accused Farage’s party and the Greens of “division and then capitulation” that would see the “the lamps go out across Europe once again”
- Sir Keir denied that he “narrowly missed” being toppled and said he ended this week “much stronger than I started it, and that's a very good place to be”
Addressing the event on Saturday morning, Sir Keir said leaders must not dither because "Russia has proved its appetite for aggression".
He warned that, even if there was a peace deal for Ukraine, Russia's rearmament “would only accelerate".
"We must answer this threat in full,” he said. "The road ahead is straight and it is clear. We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age.
"We must be able to deter aggression, and, yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight."
Announcing the warships, the prime minister said the US, Canada and other Britain in bolstering security across what is known as the High North.
President Trump has claimed Europe does not do enough to defend Greenland, which is strategically important to the US, from threats by Russia and China.
During his address, Sir Keir also hit out at Mr Trump’s claims that he is unsure if other Nato allies would come to the US’s defence.
One of the alliance’s founding principles, Article 5, is that an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all. It has only been invoked once, after the 9/11 terror attacks in New York.
“Be in no doubt, if called on, the UK would come to your aid today,” he told the president.
As the world approaches the fourth anniversary of the Russian invasion of Ukraine later this month, he said the UK recognised the “urgency” of the need for closer defence ties with the EU.
In a move that will infuriate Brexiteers at home, he said also Britain should move towards “deeper economic integration” with the EU, aiming to “move closer to the single market” in various sectors. He insisted his cabinet was in full agreement as he attempted to brush off the Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar’s bid to oust him from office, saying he "ended the week much stronger than I started it."
His speech came less than an hour after an address by Mr Rubio, who warned Europe that the US did not want to be caretakers of Western “decline”.
He criticised countries he said had not spent enough on defence and too much on welfare, had appeased a climate “cult” to their own economic detriment, had allowed too much immigration and had not defended their history as he hit out at what he said was a “malaise of hopelessness and complacency”.
But Mr Zelensky in turn attacked the US, saying: "The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia.”
And he said he hoped the US would stay involved in the negotiations, and that there would be an opportunity for Europe to play a larger role.
"Europe is practically not present at the table. It's a big mistake to my mind," he said.

Federal agent hospitalized after assault during anti-ICE protest in Los Angeles
Authorities say suspects blended back into student-led march as demonstrations disrupted traffic and damaged property
ISTANBUL
A federal agent was hospitalized after being assaulted during an anti-US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protest in Downtown Los Angeles on Friday, authorities said, as demonstrations linked to a student walkout disrupted traffic and led to property damage.
The Los Angeles Police Department confirmed the incident and wrote on the US social media company X before 1 pm (2100GMT) that “LAFD responding to a Federal Agent who was injured during the incident.”
Police said individuals suspected of attacking the agent rejoined the marching crowd, while some participants allegedly vandalized the Federal Building and threw objects at officers.
Local outlets reported the rally was organized as a student walkout, with aerial footage showing demonstrators carrying American and Mexican flags and holding signs including “Honk if you hate Nazis.”
The injured agent was transported to a hospital, though officials did not disclose the person’s condition or confirm the agency affiliation.
Authorities also said it remains unclear whether any arrests have been made.

‘Armed men and intimidation’: Doctors Without Borders suspends work at Khan Younis hospital

Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, said it has suspended its work at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis after staff reported the presence of armed men inside the facility.
The organization, one of the largest operating in Gaza, confirmed that in recent months its teams and patients saw armed men, some of them masked, in various parts of the hospital compound. MSF stressed that the individuals were not present in areas where its staff were directly operating, but elsewhere in the large complex.
Following what it described as a worsening security situation, MSF said it made the “difficult decision” to halt its activities at Nasser Hospital, currently the largest functioning medical facility in the Gaza Strip. The organization cited concerns about the hospital’s management, the preservation of its neutrality and broader security breaches.
“In recent months at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, patients and MSF staff have seen armed men, some masked, in different areas of the hospital compound,” the organization said in a statement posted on its website. “Since the ceasefire, the situation has worsened, and MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable incidents, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and, most recently, suspected movement of weapons. These events constitute serious security threats to our staff and patients.”
MSF said it had formally raised its concerns with relevant authorities and emphasized that such violations are incompatible with its humanitarian mission.
“Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces free from military presence or activity to ensure safe and impartial delivery of medical care,” the statement said.
The organization added that its concerns are heightened given previous strikes on hospitals during the conflict. It said health facilities have repeatedly been targeted by Israeli forces, resulting in loss of life and damage to infrastructure.
“We call on all armed groups, as well as Israeli forces, to respect medical facilities and ensure the protection of staff and patients,” MSF said.

Clarkson’s Farm star rushed to hospital after chopping off finger with log splitter
Show’s temporary farm manager Harriet Cowan suffered nasty injury in farming incident
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Clarkson’s Farm star Harriet Cowan was rushed to hospital after chopping the end of her finger off in a gruesome accident.
Cowan, who featured on the Prime Video show last year, informed her followers of the news on Friday (13 February), revealing she had “a run in with a log splitter”.
The accident occurred on Monday (9 February) and doctors were able to reattach the finger.
“Sorry I’ve been quiet!” she wrote. “Been a crappy week. Had a run in with a log splitter, chopped the end of my finger off, but a quick surgery they stitched it back on!!”
Cowan was introduced in the latest season of the show, which follows the ups and downs at Jeremy Clarkson’s Diddy Squat farm, as the temporary replacement of farm manager Kaleb Cooper.
The former full-time nurse, who was forced to urge viewers to “be kind” following her appearance on the show, was recruited due to Cooper’s professional commitments elsewhere.
Fans of the show couldn’t help but notice Cooper appeared rather unimpressed with Cowan upon their introduction when he returned to the Oxfordshire location.
Jeremy Clarkson himself pointed out that Cooper needed to be kind to Cowan, telling him: “Right, now, that’s Harriet. Now be nice – behave.”
Cooper then stood watching Cowan in silence as she worked, sarcastically questioning her farming skills, with Clarkson chiding him for his attitude.
However, Cowan assured viewers that she gets on with Cooper – and said that they have even become friends away from the cameras.
During an appearance on BBC Derby, Cowan, who has a big following on TikTok, said: “Kaleb’s amazing. Me and him are so close now. He’s such a good farmer and we got on really well.”
She continued: “He’s another farmer to add to my phone list to ring. Everyone checks in to make sure everyone’s fine.”
Cowan won over audiences with her witty asides and impressive farming knowledge, and many have expressed hope that she will become a permanent team member at the Chipping Norton farm.
In episode one of the latest season, former Top Gear presenter Clarkson gives Cowan a tour of the farm. At one point, he identifies a Neolithic fort, which he explains is “4000 years old”, prompting Cowan to quip: “Nearly as old as you.” She even makes an attempt at trimming Clarkson’s unruly eyebrows.
Clarkson warms to Cowan as the episode goes on, calling her a “star” and praising her farming knowledge. “She’s brilliant,” he tells his farming contractor Charlie Ireland.

Ukraine, IMF ease conditions on new $8.2 billion loan program
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
KYIV, Feb 14 - Ukraine's government and the International Monetary Fund have agreed to ease some conditions, including sensitive tax increases, for a new $8.2 billion lending programme, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said on Saturday.
She said the IMF board was expected to review the programme at its next meeting, noting its approval was crucial for unlocking other international support, including a 90‑billion‑euro ($106.8 billion) EU loan.
As the war with Russia grinds into its fifth year, Ukraine relies on Western financial aid to sustain its defences, keep the economy running, and pay wages and pensions.
After discussions, "the mission has simplified the agreements reached in November" and revised some structural benchmarks, Svyrydenko said, in remarks released by her office on Saturday.
In November, the IMF and Ukraine reached a staff-level agreement on the new four-year program. A key prior action for board approval was raising taxes for individual entrepreneurs.
ECONOMIC SITUATION DETERIORATES DUE TO RUSSIAN STRIKES
In recent months, Ukraine's economic situation has worsened as intensified Russian airstrikes have battered the energy system and infrastructure, cutting power, heat and water for millions in bitterly cold winter temperatures.
Costly energy imports and generator-produced electricity kept Ukrainian businesses running, but many cut working hours and output, prompting a review of economic forecasts.
The central bank lowered its 2026 GDP growth forecast to 1.8% from 2% due to larger-than-expected energy deficits.
Svyrydenko said the most sensitive part of the IMF programme was taxing individual entrepreneurs.
The government agreed to introduce a value-added tax for them, raising the revenue threshold to 4 million hryvnias (85,000 euros) from 1 million hryvnias.
Analysts now expect about 250,000 entrepreneurs to be affected by the increase, instead of over 600,000 in earlier plans.
The government was discussing the changes with lawmakers as it prepared draft legislation with other tax increases, Svyrydenko said. REUTERS

Memo says White House was ‘excellently preserved’ during East Wing demolition for Trump’s ballroom
The White House mansion’s eastern facade appears to have been “excellently preserved” when demolition crews tore down the East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump’s planned ballroom, an administration official said in a memo made public Friday.
Contractors took pains to protect the White House residence during demolition, keeping heavy equipment at a safe distance and removing some pieces by hand, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, wrote to the commission charged with approving plans for Trump’s ballroom. Some sections of the building were stabilized ahead of time, and vibration and crack movement were monitored, he wrote.
The National Capital Planning Commission, which is led by a top Trump aide, had requested more details about the demolition that began with little advance notice last fall. The agency has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.
The East Wing demolition prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment that are typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the ballroom.
The memo documents the history of the East Wing dating back to Thomas Jefferson’s presidency and lays out the White House’s justification for tearing it down, saying it was not feasible to preserve it while meeting Trump’s goals for the project. The completed ballroom will include an improved visitors center for security screening and will lessen the need for road closures during major events, Fisher wrote.
Curators documented and preserved artwork, furniture and other items of historical significance, including “the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, the Porte-cochere columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and other hardware and fixtures,” he wrote.
“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure,” Fisher added.
Engineers are studying whether the West Colonnade, which connects the White House residence to the West Wing offices, can support a second story that would make it more visually symmetrical with plans for a larger East Colonnade connecting to the ballroom, the memo said. No decisions have been made.
The White House also submitted the most detailed renderings of the ballroom published to date. It shows a massive new building that dwarfs the size of the demolished East Wing and matches the height of the historic White House mansion.
The project is scheduled for discussion during a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission.

Zelensky Should Kick the US Out of Peace Negotiations

One of the most absurd phenomena in Russia’s war against Ukraine is the Trump-Witkoff-Kushner attempt to “negotiate peace” between Russia and Ukraine. Everything is wrong. US President Donald Trump is so obviously on Russia’s side. Trump has nothing to offer Ukraine, and Ukraine can only lose.
What does Trump want in Ukraine? Far too many people think that Trump represents the United States of America, when the reality is that he is a mafioso who only represents himself and his family and thinks of how he can make money. If he is loyal to any outside power, it is to Putin, whom he has praised so often for being a “genius,” as when he started the war against Ukraine. Outrageously, Trump has repeatedly accused former President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but never Putin, of having started this war. That should suffice to end any Ukrainian conversation with Trump.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
For those who did not understand his words, Trump stopped all military and financial assistance to Ukraine from January 2025, when he became US president. This was one of his first actions. Ever since, Trump has only put pressure on Ukraine and none on Russia. He invited the wanted war criminal Putin to the United States and received him personally with a red carpet, while he does not even send out the State Department protocol to meet President Zelensky when he arrives in the US. Trump tells us that he supports Russia and he has twice had the US vote against condemnations of Russia’s war in Ukraine in the United Nations.
Merz Pours Cold water on Macron’s Push for Putin Talks
Putin’s main demand appears to be that Ukraine give up the quarter of Donetsk oblast that Ukraine has heroically maintained since 2014. The US seems to do whatever it can to force Ukraine to give in to Putin.
Putin, who has arguably never been democratically elected, insists on new presidential elections in Ukraine, where millions are displaced or have been forced to leave the country because of Putin’s war. Putin’s obvious purpose is to weaken and destabilized Ukraine by forcing it through Trump to hold dubious elections. Tellingly, Trump and Witkoff support Putin’s demands, while not asking for any democratic elections in Russia.
Trump, Witkoff and Kushner seem to want to enlarge their fortunes in cooperation with Russia at the expense of Ukraine. Putin’s financial advisor Kirill Dmitiriev has apparently invented an idea of $12 trillion in US-Russia cooperation, while Russia is merely a $2 trillion economy. Only senile Trump can be dumb or mad enough to take such nonsense seriously, but none of his aides dare to say that the emperor is naked – and mentally deficient. This is both stupidity and attempted larceny.
Ultimately, Trump wants to get the Nobel Peace Prize, which he will of course never get since everything he does runs contrary to democracy, freedom and peace.
If Trump is so interested in “peace” in Ukraine, what is the US prepared to offer Ukraine? Nothing. Trump and the Republicans are not even discussing restarting the Biden administration’s generous financial and military support to Ukraine. The much-publicized US-Ukraine Reconstruction Fund is a minimal PR event with merely $75 million from the US Development Finance Corporation, while the EU just granted Ukraine $105 billion for the next two years. Trump’s USA is only a parasite on Ukraine’s body.
By contrast, Russia would get plenty. If the US forces Ukraine to give up its fortress line in the Donetsk region, Russia would finally gain what it has failed to win in 12 years of war. Putin could claim victory. Russia would gain a more advantageous position for the next round of its war of aggression against Ukraine. Putin wants to develop bilateral business relations with Trump and his billionaire friends, and most of all he wants the US to ease or even end its many sanctions against Russia, which will make it easier for him to attack Ukraine more forcefully.
It is obvious why Trump and Putin are interested in peace negotiations. Fut why would Ukraine play along? The only reason is that Ukrainians are very tired of war. Yet they would obtain nothing. Trump is unable to grant any security guarantees to Ukraine and he is far too unreliable and devious to be trusted. Thus, security guarantees from the US are not a serious topic. We don’t even know if NATO really exists after Putin’s fanboy Trump has taken over the US.
The simple truth is that Ukraine has nothing to gain from further “peace” negotiations with Russia and the US. There will be no real ceasefire, apart from if Russia needs a breathing space to mobilize resources for a worse attack. Ukraine must not give up well-defended territory to Russia. It must not legitimize Russia’s occupation of any Ukrainian territories. A messy semi-democratic election in the midst of the war would be worse than no elections. As long as Trump is US president, the US must unfortunately be seen as an anti-democratic supporter of Putin and Russia’s aggression.
Given that it is so obvious how harmful the current trilateral peace negotiations among Russia, the US and Ukraine are, it is quite obvious what should be done:

US courts have ruled 4,400 times that ICE jailed people illegally. It hasn’t stopped
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - Hundreds of judges around the US have ruled more than 4,400 times since October that US President Donald Trump’s administration is detaining immigrants unlawfully, a Reuters review of court records found.
The decisions amount to a sweeping legal rebuke of Mr Trump’s immigration crackdown. Yet the administration has continued jailing people indefinitely, even after courts ruled the policy was illegal.
“It is appalling that the government insists that this court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” US District Judge Thomas Johnston of West Virginia, an appointee of former president George W. Bush, wrote last week, ordering the release of a Venezuelan detainee in the state.
Most of the rulings centre on the Trump administration’s departure from a nearly three-decade-old interpretation of federal law that immigrants already living in the US could be released on bond while they pursue their cases in immigration court.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the administration is “working to lawfully deliver on President Trump’s mandate to enforce federal immigration law”.
Soaring number of immigrant detainees
Under Mr Trump, the number of people in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention reached about 68,000 in February, up about 75 per cent from when Mr Trump took office in 2025.
A conservative appeals court in New Orleans last week gave the Trump administration a victory in its drive to lock up more immigrants. Just because prior administrations did not fully utilise the law to detain people “does not mean they lacked the authority to do more”, US Circuit Judge Edith Jones wrote in a decision reversing rulings that led to the release of two Mexican men. Both remain free, their lawyer said.
Other appeals courts are set to take up the issue in the coming weeks.
Ms Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said the increase in lawsuits came as “no surprise” – “especially after many activist judges have attempted to thwart President Trump from fulfilling the American people’s mandate for mass deportations”.
The department did not respond to more specific questions about the cases and data findings in this story.
With few other legal paths to freedom, immigrant detainees have filed more than 20,200 federal lawsuits demanding their release since Mr Trump took office, a Reuters review of court dockets found, underscoring the sweeping impact of Mr Trump’s policy change.
In at least 4,421 cases, more than 400 federal judges ruled since the beginning of October that ICE is holding people illegally as it carries out its mass deportation campaign, Reuters found.
Other cases are pending, have been dismissed because the detainee was released, or were transferred to another judicial district, which would force immigrants to file a new case. Reuters was unable to determine how many cases were moved or re-filed.
Mr Joseph Thomas, an 18-year-old high school student from Venezuela, was arrested during a traffic stop in Wisconsin in late December, while riding with his father Elias Thomas on his Walmart delivery route.
The men are asylum seekers who entered the US in August 2023. Both are authorised to work, their lawyer Carrie Peltier said. Ms Peltier said they were stopped for “driving while brown”.
Within a month, judges ordered the release of father and son.
Chief US District Judge Patrick Schiltz – also a Bush appointee – ruled that Mr Joseph Thomas had been detained illegally and ordered his immediate release. In his ruling, he said Mr Thomas was not subject to mandatory detention, and called out a “lack of any evidence that ICE had a warrant when it detained Joseph while he was a passenger in his father’s car”.
US District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee, ruled that Mr Elias Thomas was eligible for a bond hearing.
“This raises an issue of statutory interpretation that courts in this district have repeatedly considered and rejected, and it will be rejected here as well,” the district judge wrote in his order.
Mr Joseph Thomas is now taking classes online, afraid to return to school.
Landslide of lawsuits
Habeas corpus – Latin for “you shall have the body” – emerged in the English courts in the 1300s and is enshrined in the US Constitution. It provides a legal recourse for people the government has detained unlawfully.
Reuters counted habeas lawsuits by gathering the dockets of every publicly filed federal court case over more than two decades from Westlaw, a legal research tool that is a division of Thomson Reuters.
The records, combined with other court filings, offer the most comprehensive view to date of the scale of lawsuits moving through the US justice system and of the defeats for the administration.
Within the span of a few days in January, lawyers filed habeas petitions for Liam Conejo, a five-year-old Ecuadorean boy detained in the driveway of his Minnesota home; a Ukrainian man with a valid temporary humanitarian status who was detained on his way to work as a cable technician; a Salvadoran man married to a US citizen and father of a three-year-old autistic child who is also a US citizen; an Eritrean hospital worker with refugee status who was arrested after letting agents into his apartment complex; and a Venezuelan man who was arrested after dropping off his daughter at school.
None had criminal records.
Diverted lawyers, violated orders
The rush of lawsuits is forcing the US Justice Department offices to divert attorneys who would normally prosecute criminal cases to respond to habeas cases.
Using court dockets, Reuters found more than 700 Justice Department attorneys representing the government in immigration cases. Five of the attorneys each appeared on the dockets of more than 1,000 habeas cases.
Partly as a result of that legal logjam, judges have found that the government has left people locked up even after judges ordered their release.
In a court order issued in January in Minnesota, Judge Schiltz said the government had violated 96 orders in 76 cases. The US Attorney there, Mr Daniel Rosen, said in a filing two days later that the cases had created an “enormous burden” for government attorneys.
Similarly, US District Judge Nusrat Choudhury, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden in New York, wrote in February that ICE violated two “clear and unambiguous orders” by flying a man to New Mexico for detention while falsely claiming he was in New Jersey and could be brought to a court hearing.
Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said the administration “is complying with court orders and fully enforcing federal immigration law”.
“If rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the government’s obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn’t be an ‘overwhelming’ habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,” she said.
Legal hurdles
In New York, advocates have waited outside immigration court to connect detained immigrants with lawyers who can file same-day habeas claims – blocking their rapid transfer to a detention centre in another state.
On Jan 16, US District Judge J. Paul Oetken issued an emergency ruling for an Ecuadorean man who was detained at his court hearing, barring the government from moving him out of New York. On Jan 30, US District Judge Andrew Carter, who, like Judge Oetken, was appointed by Democratic former president Barack Obama, ordered his immediate release.
Still, many immigrants are not able to seek that relief. Some are not aware that they can file a habeas case. Others cannot find affordable lawyers.
Ms Judy Rall, the US citizen wife of a Venezuelan detainee who has spent almost a year at the Bluebonnet detention center in Texas, said she was quoted upwards of US$5,000 (S$6,300) to file a habeas petition, which she could not afford.
She and her husband have a pending immigration case based on their marriage, but the government has declined to release him while the case is being adjudicated. He has no criminal record, but the government has alleged, without providing evidence, that he has links to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
In February, her lawyer offered to take on the habeas case for free.
“Our home burned down, and I had told them I needed him to come help,” she said. “I assume that is the reason.” REUTERS

Rubio tells Europe US wants renewed alliance – but on Trump’s terms

The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has described America as “a child of Europe” and made an emotional but highly conditional offer of a new partnership, insisting the two continents belong together.
In a much-anticipated speech at the annual Munich Security Conference, he said the US was intent on building a new world order, adding “while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe”. The US and Europe, he said “belong together”.
Admitting the Americans may come across as a little direct and urgent, he said this was only because the US was profoundly concerned by the fate of Europe, and knew their destinies were intertwined.
Overall the tone of the speech was greeted with relief by the delegates in the hall, although many pointed out Rubio was not offering a partnership of equals, but an alliance largely framed in Donald Trump’s terms.
In offering the hand of friendship, in sharp contrast to the tone adopted by the US vice president, JD Vance, at the same conference last year, Rubio made clear the US was not shifting on its fundamental approach.
He said the US under Trump did not want a Europe that was weak or shackled by guilt or shame.
He continued: “We in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the west’s managed decline. We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history. What we want is a reinvigorated alliance that recognises that what has ailed our societies is not just a set of bad policies, but a malaise of hopelessness and complacency.”
He also tried to bind Europe into Trump’s ideology by saying Europe and the US had made the same mistakes together, including bowing down to “a climate cult”, expanding welfare states at the expense of national defence, embracing globalisation and “a world without borders in which everyone would be a citizen of the world”.
Gaining control of national borders was not an expression of xenophobia or hate, he said. “It is a fundamental act of national sovereignty. And the failure to do so is not just an abdication of one of our most basic duties owed to our people, it is an urgent threat to the fabric of our societies and the survival of our civilisation itself.”
He said in rebuilding the global order it would not be necessary to dismantle institutions such as the UN but to reform and rebuild them, arguing it had been Trump, not the UN, that was solving crises in Gaza and Ukraine.
“In a perfect world, all of these problems and more would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world. And we cannot continue to allow those who blatantly and openly threaten our citizens and endanger our global stability to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate.
“This is the path that President Trump and the United States has embarked upon. It is the path we ask you here in Europe to join us on.”
Rubio blamed “a foolish but voluntary transformation” of western economies that “left us dependent on others for our needs and dangerously vulnerable to crisis. Mass migration is not, was not, some fringe concern of little consequence. It was and continues to be a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the west.”
Throughout the speech he showered praise on Europe’s history, but in so doing raised questions whether Europe had the capacity to join the US’s rebuilding of the world.
He said little in his speech about Ukraine, after he skipped a meeting with European leaders on Friday night pointing to scheduling issues. But he said he believed the two sides had narrowed the items of difference, while the remaining issues were the hardest ones.

The German diplomat placed a hand on his chest, as if struck by history itself. On the stage at the Munich Security Conference on February 16, 2025, before an audience of ministers, military officials and geopolitical experts, Christoph Heusgen broke down. Tears welled in his eyes as the former diplomatic adviser to chancellor Angela Merkel, and former ambassador to the United Nations, bid farewell.
This conference, sometimes compared to the Cannes Film Festival for the Western diplomatic and military elite, had been under his chairmanship since 2022. But inside the Bayerischer Hof, the Art Deco palace that hosts the event, the audience understood that the head of the conference was also bidding farewell to a world in which Europe and the United States jointly claimed to uphold peace and democracy. "This becomes difficult," said Heusgen, his voice trembling, fearing that Europe might no longer share "a common value base" with its American ally.
Two days earlier, in less than 20 minutes, US Vice President JD Vance stunned Europe, causing a rift in the transatlantic relationship. "The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it's not China, it's not any other external actor. And what I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values – values shared with the United States of America," declared Vance, in a speech filled with fantasies and falsehoods about violations of freedom of expression in Europe.
The audience froze. Their body language, more than their words, revealed the shock that gripped the room as if it had been paralyzed. The floor seemed to give way beneath the feet of these experts, who were used to the restraint typically shown at major summits. "Not acceptable!" choked out Boris Pistorius, the German defense minister, from the front rows.

Drone strikes claim lives in Ukraine and Russia ahead of fresh peace talks
Attacks on Ukraine’s Black Sea port city of Odesa and in the border region of Bryansk have killed two people

- CommentsGo to comments
Drone strikes claimed lives in both Ukraine and Russia on Saturday, casting a grim shadow over the prospect of fresh peace talks scheduled for next week.
An elderly woman was killed when a Russian drone struck a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service confirmed.
Meanwhile, in Russia, a civilian died in a Ukrainian drone attack on a car in the border region of Bryansk, according to regional Governor Alexander Bogomaz. These incidents followed a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian border city of Belgorod the previous day, which killed two people and wounded five, as reported by Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov.
Against this backdrop of escalating hostilities, a new round of US-brokered discussions between envoys from Russia and Ukraine is set to take place in Geneva next week.
The talks, confirmed by officials in Moscow and Kyiv on Friday, will occur just days before the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbour. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated the discussions would be held on Tuesday and Wednesday, a schedule corroborated by Dmytro Lytvyn, communications adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
The negotiations unfold amid relentless fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometre front line, persistent Russian bombardment of Ukrainian civilian areas and its power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on military-related assets within Russian territory.
Previous US-led efforts to find common ground, including two recent rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, have failed to resolve contentious issues such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland, which is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Speaking at the annual Munich Security Conference on Saturday, President Zelenskyy expressed profound gratitude to American and European allies for their provision of air defence systems, which he said protect vital infrastructure like power plants and "save lives." He emphasised the constant threat, stating: "Russian attacks happen almost every night in Ukraine and at least once a week, massive strikes."
He added: "Without you Americans, Europeans, and everyone who stands with us, it would have been very, very difficult to hold on." Mr Zelenskyy reiterated his conviction that security guarantees for Ukraine must precede any peace agreement with Russia. He also noted last week that the United States had set a June deadline for Ukraine and Russia to reach a deal, though previous deadlines given by Donald Trump have largely passed without consequence.

US Congress delegation's participation in MSC cancelled due to partial shutdown in USA - Stefanishyna
The American delegation’s participation in the Munich Security Conference (MSC) has been cancelled due to the freezing of funding for the US Department of Homeland Security, Ukrainian Ambassador to the USA Olha Stefanishyna announced.
"Since midnight on February 14, the work of federal agencies in the United States has been partially suspended due to Congress’ failure to pass the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget," she wrote on Telegram on Saturday morning.
According to Stefanishyna, it oversees more than 20 agencies, including ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), CBP (Customs and Border Protection), and FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency).
Stefanishyna noted that the key consequence of this is the cancellation of the Congressional delegation’s participation in the Munich Security Conference due to regulatory restrictions.
She also stated that the House of Representatives cannot travel on official business until the issue is resolved.
The ambassador added that ICE and CBP are operating as usual, and their funding is already included in US President Donald Trump’s "One, Big, Beautiful Bill" (passed in the summer of 2025).
Stefanishyna added that the Congress will return to work on February 23, but may convene earlier—members have been warned to be ready to vote within eight hours of the Senate’s decision. The president’s annual State of the Union address is scheduled for February 24.

IMF eases conditions for new US$8.1bn Ukraine lending programme
The International Monetary Fund has agreed to drop the prior actions required for a new US$8.1 billion lending programme for Ukraine, removing requirements on VAT for sole traders, duties on parcels, a tax on digital platforms and the retention of the wartime levy.
Source: Ukrainian Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko speaking to journalists, as reported by Suspilne, Ukraine's public broadcaster
Details: Svyrydenko said the new programme is expected to be considered at the next meeting of the IMF's executive board. She said the changes were made following a visit to Kyiv by the Fund's managing director, Kristalina Georgieva. Under the revised agreement with the IMF, all four conditions now need to be completed after the executive board approves the new programme.
Quote: "The most sensitive issues in the IMF programme are taxes on individual entrepreneurs. Details matter. In our work with the IMF, we agreed to raise the VAT threshold for sole traders to UAH 4 million [US$92,800]. This is the maximum threshold for VAT on goods in Europe. This means the changes will not affect two-thirds of sole traders in Ukraine."
More details: Svyrydenko said the government plans to submit one consolidated tax bill to the Verkhovna Rada (Ukrainian parliament) covering digital platforms, parcels, and the retention of the wartime levy after martial law ends.
There will be further discussions with the IMF on when the changes will take effect.
Background:
- On 14 February, Svyrydenko also said that the provision of €90 billion to Ukraine by the EU is linked to the approval of a new four-year IMF programme, which is expected in February.
- It was also reported that the IMF Board of Directors may approve a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme for Ukraine in February, but this will depend primarily on whether Ukraine has fulfilled the previously agreed prior actions.

Scottish broadcaster Edith Bowman has issued a tearful plea for the return of a stolen suitcase containing her grandfather’s ashes. The bag was reportedly taken during a train journey from London Paddington to Kemble, a village in the Cotswolds, on Friday.
The 52-year-old initially took to Instagram stories to express her frustration. In her first video, she stated: "I just got on a train at London Paddington – 9.32 am to Cheltenham and got off at Kemble, and some f***** has stolen my case."
She urged the individual responsible to "return it to the nearest station," adding: "There’s CCTV, so we’re on the case and British Transport Police is being informed."
Ms Bowman’s tone shifted to distress as she realised the profound sentimental value of the suitcase’s contents. Choking back tears in a subsequent post, she revealed: "I’ve just realised what’s in my bag is a jewellery box, and in that jewellery box are some really lovely personal things. In particular, a pinkie ring that’s got my grandad’s ashes in it."
The presenter appealed for anyone who might have seen someone disembarking a train at Didcot Parkway, Reading or Swindon with "an old school case that’s green, dark green with brown straps" to get in touch. She later shared a photo of the distinctive luggage, specifying potential sightings on a GWR train at Reading (09.58), Didcot Parkway (10.11), and Swindon (10.30).
Edith shared a profound bond with ‘Grandad Bowman’, spending weekends at his Fife hotel as her parents worked.
Speaking to The Guardian in 2015 she said: "I adored Grandad Bowman. He looked after me at weekends when Mum and Dad were working, and he’d make me oatcakes smothered with Dairy Lea, and a cup of hot milk, before reading me bedtime stories.”
At seven, Edith's grandfather suffered a stroke, leaving him only able to use one arm. Not expected to survive, he remarkably lived another 27 years.
Edith was present during his final moments, a difficult memory she nonetheless cherishes. "We were at a cousin’s wedding when we got the call to say he’d been taken into hospital. As he lay dying, I collected some pictures and candles to brighten up his room, and played his favourite Al Jolson songs. It was hard, but I’m glad I was there."
Ms Bowman is widely recognised for her work hosting BBC Radio 1 shows from 2003 to 2014. She currently presents the podcast Soundtracking, which launched in 2016.

Ukrainian forces strike Russian landing craft in Crimea
The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces announced this on Facebook, Ukrinform reports.
As part of systematic measures to reduce the offensive potential of the Russian aggressor, Ukrainian units continue to strike important enemy military targets.
It was confirmed that on February 12, near the settlement of Novoozerne in Crimea, a Russian BK-16 transport-landing craft was successfully hit.
Also on February 12, near Hvardiiske in Crimea, an RSP-10 radar station was struck.
Near Prymorsk, in the temporarily occupied part of the Zaporizhzhia region, a communications hub of the Russian invaders was struck the same day.
In addition, on February 13, in the area of Novoekonomichne in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region, an enemy ammunition depot was struck.
Russian losses and the extent of the damage are being clarified.

Europe’s Tax Divide: Bulgaria at 10%, Denmark Tops 60%

Recent data from the Tax Foundation reveal a widening gap in Europe between East and West when it comes to tax rates for top earners in 2026. While progressive taxation is widely used across the continent to promote social equity, the highest marginal rates differ sharply. Bulgaria and Romania stand out with a maximum rate of just 10 percent, while Denmark imposes the steepest rate at 60.5 percent. Across 35 European countries analyzed, the average top rate reaches 38.5 percent, rising to 43.4 percent among OECD members.
The data highlight a cluster of seven countries where the richest face rates above 50 percent. Alongside Denmark, France, Austria, Spain, Belgium, Portugal, and Sweden are in this category, with Slovenia and the Netherlands close behind. In the continent’s largest economies, disparities remain notable: the United Kingdom’s top rate is 45 percent, while France reaches 55.4 percent. Other major states, including Germany, Italy, and Ireland, maintain more moderate levels between 40 and 48 percent.
Central and Eastern Europe, by contrast, largely keeps maximum rates below 25 percent. Beyond Bulgaria and Romania, Hungary, Estonia, and the Czech Republic feature among these low-tax countries, along with non-EU states such as Moldova, Ukraine, and Georgia. Yet, even in this region, change is underway: Estonia recently raised its flat rate to 24 percent, while Slovakia introduced additional tax brackets, pushing its top rate from 25 to 35 percent. These adjustments reflect government efforts to improve revenue collection in a shifting economic landscape.
Experts caution, however, that excessively high marginal rates can backfire by discouraging high earners. Fiscal studies suggest that expanding the tax base among lower-income groups often yields stronger results than sharply increasing top rates. The debate unfolds amid public skepticism: only one in five Europeans in 2025 believe that taxes are fully proportional to accumulated wealth, underlining ongoing tensions between tax policy and public trust.

Peace talks possible only after ceasefire – Poroshenko
Ukrainian MP and leader of the European Solidarity party, Petro Poroshenko, believes that peace talks are possible only after a ceasefire is reached, the political party's website reported on Saturday.
Poroshenko expressed belief that the war can and should be ended this year, but emphasized the need for real security guarantees, in particular, the presence of NATO troops in Ukraine.
"I firmly believe that the strategy of immediately heading towards negotiations on a peace agreement is meaningless. We need to divide this into two stages. Stage one: we need to ensure a ceasefire. We have very effective tools for this, because the first step of the United States and the European Union on secondary sanctions for countries that continue to buy Russian energy resources has shown its effectiveness," he emphasized in a comment to the Polish television channel Slawa TV during the Munich Security Conference.
The politician noted that secondary US and EU sanctions against countries that purchase Russian energy have already led to a drop in oil prices, and the attack on the "shadow fleet" has changed Moscow's position.
"We have two tools, Chancellor Merz said, including during our meeting. The first is sanctions that cut off Putin's ability to finance the war. The second is weapons that enable Ukraine to respond to attacks on civilian infrastructure," the politician clarified.
According to him, the European Union should be a full participant in the negotiations, because it is the one that finances the majority of the arms supply. "Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, but nothing without Europe," Poroshenko concluded.

Hidden killers: Families’ horror after children as young as five die in unexploded mine blasts
Ali Mohammed Al-Abrash was having breakfast while his niece and nephews played around outside - but after they picked up a scrap piece of metal, the unthinkable happened
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Zahraa, Muhammad, Ali and Ibrahim thought they were playing with a harmless piece of scrap metal.
Within minutes, five-year-old Zahraa and six-year-old Muhammad had been killed.
Ali, 3, and Ibrahim, 12, were being rushed to the nearest hospital in northwest Syria, bodies pierced by pieces of shrapnel from an unexploded munition left in their village by forces belonging to deposed dictator Bashar al-Assad.
“We were in complete shock. We didn’t even realise what was happening. We couldn't understand how tragic it was,” recalls their uncle, Ali Mohammed Al-Abrash.
Just six days after the explosion, he spoke to The Independent about the heartache that has rippled through the community of Maardabsa, south of Saraqib.
“The roads, the village, everywhere reminds us of our beloved Zahraa and Muhammad,” he says, a voice strained with emotion as he spoke from the tent in which the family shelters.
With their father abroad, Ali said he was like a father to the two children who brought “joy and happiness to the whole family”.
It is a story all too common in the north, northwest and central regions regions of Syria, ravaged by years of war and littered with thousands of unexploded munitions.
The abandoned weapons pose an ever present threat to civilians even during a period of relative peace.
Since the fall of the Assad regime 14 months ago, around 10 Syrians have been killed by unexploded ordnance each week. Nearly one third of those killed have been children.
The explosion in Maardabsa occurred as Ali was eating breakfast on Friday 6 February. He rushed outside to find all four children lying on the ground and bleeding, two already dead, two with severe shrapnel injuries.
“They were just playing with scraps, pieces of metal,” Ali says. “One of them hit the munition with something. That's how it exploded. They were just playing with it.”
The children had found what is now believed to have been an unexploded cluster munition, a widely-banned weapon which was used by government forces in northwest Syria - and has a detonation failure rate of around 30 per cent.
In late January, Syrians suffered one of the deadliest weeks for mine-related casualties since the Assad regime, according to the latest figures from the UN’s Mine Action Area of Responsibility (MA AoR).
Seventeen people were killed, including seven children, and another 16 were injured, including five children.
This brings the total number of casualties since 8 December 2024 to 1,734, including 633 deaths. Children make up 185 of the deaths and 453 of the injuries, across the 959 incidents.
The majority of the incidents took place on agricultural land, where Syrians are returning to farm the fields they were forced to abandon due to the civil war.
A huge spike was recorded early last year when many Syrians returned for the first time.
But in the coming months numbers could again rise as farmers begin to harvest their crops in spring, explains Simon Jackson, the Syria Programme Manager for The Halo Trust, an organisation with a mission to remove unexploded ordnance from conflict-ridden areas.
“We’re getting back into the prime cultivating period. We’ve seen it in the north west, you can see where farmers have been cultivating their land and suddenly there’s a really defined line where people stop.
“Usually, somewhere along that line, you see the crater of where there’s been an accident,” he says.
Many know the risks, but with a food production crisis in Syria, families are “driven by desperation” to cultivate their land nonetheless.
Children, many who are heavily involved in farming activities, particularly for subsistence level farmers, are under particular risk.
A report in December found that deaths and injuries from landmines and unexploded ordnance around the globe hit a four-year high in 2024, driven by conflicts in Syria and Myanmar.
More than 6,000 incidents were recorded that year, including 1,945 deaths and 4,325 injuries, the highest annual total since 2020, according to the Landmine Monitor 2025 report.
Nearly 90% of victims were civilians, with almost half women and children.

African Union opens summit amid youth anger over ‘old leaders’

As the African Union gathers for its annual summit in Ethiopia to discuss the future of the continent’s some 1.4 billion people, frustration is mounting among young Africans.
Set up to "promote the unity and solidarity of the African States," analysts say the African Union is facing a legitimacy crisis among the continent's youth after failing to meet their expectations. African countries are battling military coups, disputed elections and protests inspired by hardship worsened by foreign aid cuts.
Africa has the youngest population in the world with more than 400 million people aged 15 to 35 years old. But it is also home to several of the world's oldest and longest-serving leaders - a paradox that has contributed to an upsurge in coups.
With a young population set to double by 2050, it is the only rapidly growing region where its people are getting poorer. In different countries and on social media, African youths view the AU as a bloc of old leaders and one which sees their interests as less of a priority.
The organization has missed opportunities to be people-centered and citizen-driven and has instead focused largely on governments and leaders, said Liesl Louw-Vaudran, a senior analyst with the Crisis Group.
"What the youth is really asking and why people are frustrated is because this is not an African Union for citizens. It's not a people-driven African Union," Louw-Vaudran added.
As several African countries held elections for new presidents over the last year, there was a clear pattern of sidelined opposition candidates, disputed results and protests from mostly young voters after incumbents were reelected.
Despite the election outcomes, the AU was often accused of being quick to side with reelected incumbents and slow to call out flawed processes.
As authorities in Uganda shut down the internet and clamped down on the opposition during the East African country's presidential election in January, the African Union Commission issued a statement "commending" the conduct of the poll. A day after, the AU election observer mission issued a preliminary report noting "reports of harassment, intimidation and arrest of opposition leaders, candidates, supporters' media and civic society actors" in the election.
The AU social media post commending the election enraged many youths, with one person retorting: "Dictatorship club has spoken."
One key challenge the AU has battled with over the years is weak enforcement of resolutions, according to Macharia Munene, a professor of history at the United States International University in Nairobi. And that's because "not all members meet their dues or fully accept what is generally decided," he said.
At the 39th African Union Summit being held in Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa on Saturday and Sunday, the theme is water and sanitation. Discussions will feature the continent's response to climate change and humanitarian crises following foreign aid cuts from international partners such as the United States.
Observers say the AU Summit will provide an opportunity to align continental priorities with international partners, especially at a time of discussions around a 'new world order' stirred by U.S. President Donald Trump with foreign leaders signaling shifting global alliances.
Still, critics urge the African Union to look inward by paying closer attention to the continent's most pressing challenges and doing more to hold leaders accountable when they fail to meet expectations.
In Nigeria's capital of Abuja, resident Chima Ekwueme said the African Union does not care about holding leaders accountable, citing Nigeria's deadly security crises and economic hardship despite its rich mineral wealth.
"They are there for their own interests," Ekwueme, 32, said of the AU. "In Nigeria, we have all it takes to put things in order (but) look at how difficult things are and where is the AU."

Rubio Tells Europe It Belongs with US, Calls it to Join Trump’s Fight

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to “revitalise” the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the US on its mission of global “renewal”.
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump’s vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about Washington’s allies, Washington’s top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.

“We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history,” Rubio said. “What we want is a reinvigorated alliance.”
“We want Europe to be strong,” Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US “belong together.”
The United States will be “driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilisation’s past,” he said.
“It is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe,” he said.
He echoed Trump administration’s oft-stated assertion that immigration was a threat, saying that “mass migration” was “a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West.”
“We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilisation and together with us are willing and able to defend it.”
Merz Pours Cold water on Macron’s Push for Putin Talks
“Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy... It will restore to us a clear sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilisational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike.”
- Change in tone -
Rubio’s speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
Aside from the immigration issue, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a “rift” between US and Europe.
US-Europe ties were further strained by the Trump administration’s new National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with “civilisational decline”.
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
- Europe security --
European leaders who have gathered at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences.
Key leaders have pushed the message that this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying that “a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever”.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gather on Saturday that “Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility” for its security and called for closer ties with Britain, saying “10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever.”
British leader Keir Starmer was expected to tell the conference that Europe is “a sleeping giant” and must rely less on the United States for its defence.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that “this is the right time for a strong Europe,” that would be “clear in the support of Ukraine” and “building its own architecture of security”.
- Ukraine war in focus -
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to “get moving” to end the war. “Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move,” the US leader said.
But Rubio said that “We don’t know if the Russians are serious about ending the war.”
Macron said a new framework was needed to deal with “an aggressive Russia” once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
“If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk,” said Merz, but he also charged that “Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously”.

As NATO concerns persist, von der Leyen urges EU to fortify defense clause

MUNICH, Germany — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday told the Munich Security Conference that the EU should get serious about its own mutual defense clause.
Article 42.7 of the EU treaty has been floated as a Plan B for Europe's security, in a world where there is worry about the U.S. commitment to NATO — despite vociferous pushback from the White House.
Like NATO's once-ironclad Article 5, which has been repeatedly undermined by U.S. President Donald Trump, the EU clause obliges countries to provide “aid and assistance by all the means in their power” if another nation in the bloc is attacked.

US courts have ruled 4,400 times that ICE jailed people illegally. It hasn’t stopped
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON - Hundreds of judges around the US have ruled more than 4,400 times since October that US President Donald Trump’s administration is detaining immigrants unlawfully, a Reuters review of court records found.
The decisions amount to a sweeping legal rebuke of Mr Trump’s immigration crackdown. Yet the administration has continued jailing people indefinitely, even after courts ruled the policy was illegal.
“It is appalling that the government insists that this court should redefine or completely disregard the current law as it is clearly written,” US District Judge Thomas Johnston of West Virginia, an appointee of former president George W. Bush, wrote last week, ordering the release of a Venezuelan detainee in the state.
Most of the rulings centre on the Trump administration’s departure from a nearly three-decade-old interpretation of federal law that immigrants already living in the US could be released on bond while they pursue their cases in immigration court.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the administration is “working to lawfully deliver on President Trump’s mandate to enforce federal immigration law”.
Soaring number of immigrant detainees
Under Mr Trump, the number of people in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention reached about 68,000 in February, up about 75 per cent from when Mr Trump took office in 2025.
A conservative appeals court in New Orleans last week gave the Trump administration a victory in its drive to lock up more immigrants. Just because prior administrations did not fully utilise the law to detain people “does not mean they lacked the authority to do more”, US Circuit Judge Edith Jones wrote in a decision reversing rulings that led to the release of two Mexican men. Both remain free, their lawyer said.
Other appeals courts are set to take up the issue in the coming weeks.
Ms Tricia McLaughlin, a Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman, said the increase in lawsuits came as “no surprise” – “especially after many activist judges have attempted to thwart President Trump from fulfilling the American people’s mandate for mass deportations”.
The department did not respond to more specific questions about the cases and data findings in this story.
With few other legal paths to freedom, immigrant detainees have filed more than 20,200 federal lawsuits demanding their release since Mr Trump took office, a Reuters review of court dockets found, underscoring the sweeping impact of Mr Trump’s policy change.
In at least 4,421 cases, more than 400 federal judges ruled since the beginning of October that ICE is holding people illegally as it carries out its mass deportation campaign, Reuters found.
Other cases are pending, have been dismissed because the detainee was released, or were transferred to another judicial district, which would force immigrants to file a new case. Reuters was unable to determine how many cases were moved or re-filed.
Mr Joseph Thomas, an 18-year-old high school student from Venezuela, was arrested during a traffic stop in Wisconsin in late December, while riding with his father Elias Thomas on his Walmart delivery route.
The men are asylum seekers who entered the US in August 2023. Both are authorised to work, their lawyer Carrie Peltier said. Ms Peltier said they were stopped for “driving while brown”.
Within a month, judges ordered the release of father and son.
Chief US District Judge Patrick Schiltz – also a Bush appointee – ruled that Mr Joseph Thomas had been detained illegally and ordered his immediate release. In his ruling, he said Mr Thomas was not subject to mandatory detention, and called out a “lack of any evidence that ICE had a warrant when it detained Joseph while he was a passenger in his father’s car”.
US District Judge Eric Tostrud, a Trump appointee, ruled that Mr Elias Thomas was eligible for a bond hearing.
“This raises an issue of statutory interpretation that courts in this district have repeatedly considered and rejected, and it will be rejected here as well,” the district judge wrote in his order.
Mr Joseph Thomas is now taking classes online, afraid to return to school.
Landslide of lawsuits
Habeas corpus – Latin for “you shall have the body” – emerged in the English courts in the 1300s and is enshrined in the US Constitution. It provides a legal recourse for people the government has detained unlawfully.
Reuters counted habeas lawsuits by gathering the dockets of every publicly filed federal court case over more than two decades from Westlaw, a legal research tool that is a division of Thomson Reuters.
The records, combined with other court filings, offer the most comprehensive view to date of the scale of lawsuits moving through the US justice system and of the defeats for the administration.
Within the span of a few days in January, lawyers filed habeas petitions for Liam Conejo, a five-year-old Ecuadorean boy detained in the driveway of his Minnesota home; a Ukrainian man with a valid temporary humanitarian status who was detained on his way to work as a cable technician; a Salvadoran man married to a US citizen and father of a three-year-old autistic child who is also a US citizen; an Eritrean hospital worker with refugee status who was arrested after letting agents into his apartment complex; and a Venezuelan man who was arrested after dropping off his daughter at school.
None had criminal records.
Diverted lawyers, violated orders
The rush of lawsuits is forcing the US Justice Department offices to divert attorneys who would normally prosecute criminal cases to respond to habeas cases.
Using court dockets, Reuters found more than 700 Justice Department attorneys representing the government in immigration cases. Five of the attorneys each appeared on the dockets of more than 1,000 habeas cases.
Partly as a result of that legal logjam, judges have found that the government has left people locked up even after judges ordered their release.
In a court order issued in January in Minnesota, Judge Schiltz said the government had violated 96 orders in 76 cases. The US Attorney there, Mr Daniel Rosen, said in a filing two days later that the cases had created an “enormous burden” for government attorneys.
Similarly, US District Judge Nusrat Choudhury, an appointee of Democratic former president Joe Biden in New York, wrote in February that ICE violated two “clear and unambiguous orders” by flying a man to New Mexico for detention while falsely claiming he was in New Jersey and could be brought to a court hearing.
Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said the administration “is complying with court orders and fully enforcing federal immigration law”.
“If rogue judges followed the law in adjudicating cases and respected the government’s obligation to properly prepare cases, there wouldn’t be an ‘overwhelming’ habeas caseload or concern over DHS following orders,” she said.
Legal hurdles
In New York, advocates have waited outside immigration court to connect detained immigrants with lawyers who can file same-day habeas claims – blocking their rapid transfer to a detention centre in another state.
On Jan 16, US District Judge J. Paul Oetken issued an emergency ruling for an Ecuadorean man who was detained at his court hearing, barring the government from moving him out of New York. On Jan 30, US District Judge Andrew Carter, who, like Judge Oetken, was appointed by Democratic former president Barack Obama, ordered his immediate release.
Still, many immigrants are not able to seek that relief. Some are not aware that they can file a habeas case. Others cannot find affordable lawyers.
Ms Judy Rall, the US citizen wife of a Venezuelan detainee who has spent almost a year at the Bluebonnet detention center in Texas, said she was quoted upwards of US$5,000 (S$6,300) to file a habeas petition, which she could not afford.
She and her husband have a pending immigration case based on their marriage, but the government has declined to release him while the case is being adjudicated. He has no criminal record, but the government has alleged, without providing evidence, that he has links to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
In February, her lawyer offered to take on the habeas case for free.
“Our home burned down, and I had told them I needed him to come help,” she said. “I assume that is the reason.” REUTERS

France opens five probes into contaminated baby formula
French prosecutors have launched five investigations, including into Swiss food giant Nestlé, after batches of infant milk were found to contain cereulide, a toxin produced by the bacterium Bacillus cereus.

The five investigations, covering dairy products from Nestlé, Lactalis, Danone, Babybio and La Marque en moins, have been handed to the Central Office for Combating Environmental and Public Health Offences (Oclaesp) and the National Veterinary and Plant Health Investigation Brigade (BNEVP), the Paris prosecutor’s office said on Friday.
+ Read about a management meltdown at Nestlé
The proceedings were opened on January 30. Investigators are looking into suspected offences including the mislabelling of products that could pose a risk to human health, failures by manufacturers to launch recall procedures for potentially harmful goods and endangering life by breaching legal safety or due‑diligence obligations.
Complex investigation
“The Paris prosecutor’s office took over the case because of the large number of complaints filed across the country and the technical complexity of the investigation, particularly around regulatory and public‑health issues,” said Public Prosecutor Laure Beccuau.
Further inquiries will continue under the authority of local prosecutors, mainly in Angers, Bordeaux and Blois. Investigators are seeking to determine whether there is a direct link between the consumption of contaminated formula and the deaths or health problems reported in infants.

Foodwatch files tainted baby formula complaint involving Nestlé
The baby formula scandal has been unfolding since mid‑December. After Nestlé issued an initial recall of dozens of batches in around 60 countries, including Switzerland, over concerns about possible traces of cereulide, other manufacturers soon followed. Major producers such as Danone and Lactalis, as well as smaller companies in this rapidly growing market, launched similar recalls across the globe.
In France, three infant deaths have been reported, along with about 15 hospitalisations involving infants who consumed dairy products covered by the recalls. However, no causal link has been confirmed at this stage, and investigations are still under way.
Industry sources say the contamination stems from an oil supplied by a company in China, which is used as an ingredient in milk powder. Cereulide can trigger vomiting and diarrhoea shortly after consumption.

Rubio reiterated the Trump administration's stance that immigration is "destabilising societies" but otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Friday, had deepened a "rift" between the US and Europe.
‘Europe must rely less on US for its defence’
Bruised by Trump's designs on Greenland and his often hostile comments about America's traditional allies, European leaders who have gathered at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences.
Key leaders have pushed the message that this is essential for Europe, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever".
French President Emmanuel Macron told the gathering on Friday that "this is the right time for a strong Europe," that would be "clear in the support of Ukraine" and "building its own architecture of security".
"This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America," he said.
British leader Keir Starmer was expected to tell the conference that Europe is "a sleeping giant" and must rely less on the United States for its defence.
The Trump administration's new National Security Strategy similarly launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent is threatened with "civilisational decline".
On Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz appealed to Washington: "Let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together."
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Russia-Ukraine war in focus
We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war, Rubio said in his speech on Saturday. "They say they are. We're going to continue to test it."
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before the Russia-Ukraine war is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the US leader said.
According to a source within the German government, Merz and Rubio met at the conference on Friday to discuss Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia, and further support for the country — particularly in terms of military aid
They also discussed Europe's role in NATO, and "Rubio praised Germany's steps to strengthen the alliance", the source added.
Rubio: UN playing 'no role' in resolving conflicts
Rubio also said the UN had played "virtually no role" in resolving the conflicts and called for global institutions to be reformed.
"The United Nations still has tremendous potential to be a tool for good in the world," he told the Munich Security Conference.
"But we cannot ignore that, today, on the most pressing matters before us, it has no answers and has played virtually no role. It could not solve the war in Gaza."

Nose for trouble: Italian town seeks ‘odour evaluators’ to sniff out bad smells

An Italian town is seeking a crew of sniffers to identify bad smells in its quest to improve air quality.
Bruno Beltrame, the mayor of Brendola, a small town in the northern province of Vicenza, said he began the recruitment campaign for six “odour evaluators” after complaints about “unpleasant smells” from people living in neighbourhoods close to industrial zones.
The main prerequisite for the role is not to suffer from allergies or respiratory diseases such as asthma. The recruits must have a car and a smartphone, which will be used to record the odour data on a dedicated app.
Led by a firm specialising in odour measurement, they will be trained in how to distinguish between smells, for example those typically emitted from factories or which originate from industrial waste or sewage.
They will then be given the task of going to targeted areas to carry out sensory assessments. If an unsavoury smell is detected, they will spend time sniffing the air before recording their perceptions on the app.
The ultimate goal of the initiative, which is expected to last six months, is to trace the origin of the odours.
“We did a similar investigation about five years ago in an industrial area close to where the bad smells are coming from now,” said Beltrame. “From that, we were able to identify the companies emitting the odours. Now we are broadening the geographical scope to find out if the same companies have resumed the release of bad smells or if there are different ones.”
Vicenza falls within the Po valley, a huge geographical area straddling the provinces around the Veneto region as well as Piedmont, Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna. The Po Valley is among the worst areas in Europe for air pollution.
“We’re at the end of the valley just before the Alpine foothills,” said Beltrame. “So it’s a huge undertaking because these areas are among the most productive, but they’re also the ones at risk of creating pollution.”
He said several province-wide initiatives work continuously to improve air and water quality. “We have a lot of protocols in place, and if businesses break the rules they are heavily fined.”
Brendola is home to about 4,000 people who over the years have become more committed to protecting their environment. Beltrame said: “Whereas previously they might have been a bit careless, today they are more inclined to want to improve their quality of life and surrounding environment. So when they see abandoned waste or smell foul air, they report it. We’re happy because it allows us to promptly intervene in order to prevent potentially worse catastrophes.”
The local authority initially advertised for the jobs, which are paid, before Christmas but there were no takers, “perhaps because it was published so close to the holidays, many might have turned their noses up,” said Beltrame.
But since reposting the advert on Facebook this week, about a dozen people applied. “They were mostly university students who have a few hours to spare around their studies, and they seem very keen.”

‘It still rankles’: the French town living in the shadow of being an ayatollah’s refuge

Every February, members of the Iranian diaspora descend on an abandoned plot of land in an unremarkable street in the French town of Neauphle-le-Château, a 90-minute drive west of Paris.
On the nominated Sunday, a marquee is hastily thrown up and framed photographs of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini hung on the canvas. Green baize is laid on the muddy garden path between posts painted with equal bands of green, white and red, the colours of the Islamic republic’s flag.
They come to remember the supreme leader who, in a chapter of history little known outside France, spent four months in the town in the late 1970s before his triumphant return to Tehran as the leader of the Islamic revolution.
The fact this is commemorated every year in a small town in Île-de-France evokes a deep grievance among local people, and particularly this year. That their home has become synonymous with a regime in Tehran accused of killing thousands, some say tens of thousands, in a continuing crackdown, feels, they say, like a betrayal. Rather than remembering, they would rather forget.
“People prefer not to speak of it. It’s a moment in history that has nothing to do with us,” says Pascal Pagand, who owns the Café des Sports in the town square, the hub of local life.
“I know it still annoys people. They don’t understand why he was given sanctuary here … The town wasn’t asked or consulted. It was imposed; people had no choice. I wasn’t here back then, but those who were here remember it as a difficult time.”
Visitors have been making the annual pilgrimage to Neauphle-le-Château for 47 years. In October 1978, the then French president, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, agreed to allow Khomeini to settle in France after his expulsion from Iraq.
D’Estaing was persuaded that the Shia cleric would be a democratic alternative to the autocratic Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the erratic shah whose regime was in its dying days. The Frenchman also believed Khomenei would reward Paris’s hospitality with lucrative contracts establishing France as a counterweight to US influence in the region.
Photographs and newsreel from the time show Khomeini meditating under an apple tree in the garden of 23 Route de Chevreuse. Inside, his acolytes prepared hundreds of cassette recordings of Khomeini urging Iranians to rise up, tapes that were flown to Tehran to be spread secretly across Iran.
Nowadays there is nothing left of the two-storey house that was destroyed many years ago. Locals believe it was “plastiqué” (blown to bits), either by French secret services or by angry Pahlavi supporters after Khomeini left. The force of the explosion cracked the windows of neighbouring homes, they say.
In France, leftwing intellectuals hailed Khomeini as the new Gandhi, among them Jean-Paul Sartre and Michel Foucault, who would later regret setting up a Khomeini support committee, ignoring Simone de Beauvoir’s warnings that the radical version of Islam he espoused threatened women’s rights.
On 1 February 1979, 15 days after Pahlavi fled into exile, Khomeini flew – first-class on Air France courtesy of the French government – to Tehran. He was greeted by ecstatic crowds and within days had established the theocratic dictatorship that has ruled Iran ever since.
In Neauphle-le-Château, what irks locals is the sense that the town is on the map for the wrong reason. Why can it not be remembered for the novelist and playwright Marguerite Duras who lived and wrote there? Why not for Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge, the Cognac and bitter-orange liqueur, created and produced there until, like Khomeini, it moved elsewhere?
Sitting under a photograph of Duras at a corner table in the Café des Sports, Jean-Claude Cintas, an artist and film-maker, summed up the collective dismay. “Most people here would rather Neauphle-le-Château was known for Marguerite Duras and Grand Marnier,” he said.
Cintas remembers seeing Khomenei on his way to pray and recalls the widespread support for him in France. “At the time, the left was very much for Khomeini and didn’t have a word to say against him,” he said.
“It was only 10 years after May 1968,” he added, referring to the leftwing student-led revolt that almost brought down the French government. “It was an extraordinary era. The shah was basically in the bin and if you were leftwing you were for Khomeini.
“But he was not at all welcome locally. It wasn’t aimed at him personally, because people didn’t know who he was at first; it was because the town was suddenly overrun with journalists and police and it caused chaos.”
Cintas added: “Suddenly every time the town was mentioned, it was in connection with Khomeini. It’s been like it for 47 years now and we feel that’s not what we are about.”
In Tehran, long after Khomenei’s death aged 86 in 1989, Neauphle-le-Château has become part of the city’s geography. The street on which the French embassy sits was changed to rue Neauphle-le-Château.
While most French people over the age of 50 will immediately associate Neauphle-le-Château with Khomeini, the town has been making efforts to bury the memories. Three years ago, during the protests resulting from the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, who had been arrested three days earlier for allegedly breaching the Islamic dress code for women, a commemorative board at the property on Route de Chevreuse bearing Khomeini’s portrait was vandalised. The town hall ordered its removal and decreed there should be no permanent sign marking his stay.
Elisabeth Sandjivy, the mayor of Neauphle, told French media at the time: “I would like the town of Neauphle to no longer be associated with this part of history that has been imposed on it, because it was the government that gave permission for the ayatollah to stay here.”
French media reported that an official request from Tehran to create a museum on the site had been met with a definitive “non”. Attempts by the Guardian to speak to Sandjivy were unsuccessful.
“Locals will tell you they don’t care about the town’s association with the Ayatollah Khomeini and they don’t want to talk about it, but deep down it still rankles,” said Cintas. “It’s not what we want our town to be remembered for.
“Khomeini spent only four months living on the very outskirts of the town, but his stay has thrown a shadow over the entire place especially with what has happened since.
“There is a sense of betrayal: we gave him sanctuary and instead of democracy this is what he did.”

Learn this from Bezos and the Washington Post: with hypercapitalists in charge, your news is not safe  | Jane Martinson

Not long after being made Time magazine’s Person of the Year in 1999, Jeff Bezos told me: “They were not choosing me as much as they were choosing the internet, and me as a symbol.” A quarter of an increasingly dark century later, the Amazon founder is now a symbol of something else: how the ultra-rich can kill the news.
Job cuts in an industry that has struggled financially since the internet came into existence and killed its business model is hardly new, but last week’s brutal cull of hundreds of journalists at the Bezos-owned Washington Post marks a new low. The redundancies that were announced to staff on a video call, the axing of half its foreign bureau (including the war reporter in Ukraine) – not since P&O Ferries have layoffs been handled so badly. Former Post stalwart Paul Farhi described a decision that affected nearly half of the 790-strong workforce as “the biggest one-day wipeout of journalists in a generation”.
Why it happened is still baffling, at least for anyone not inside the head of one of the world’s richest men. Marty Baron, the Post’s former editor, highlighted the owner’s “sickening” efforts to curry favour with Donald Trump in a “case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction”. Slate magazine, owned by the Graham family (previous owners of the Post), accused Bezos of “accelerating the [Post’s] decline on purpose” because of “external economic interests” such as Amazon and Blue Origin, his space business. Perhaps he agreed to savage cuts because it showed he really was the boss, or just because he could. In any case, his ownership of the Washington Post is yet more proof, if needed, that owning a newspaper is not about money; it’s about power and influence. In other words, it’s about politics.
Bezos, with his $266bn fortune, doesn’t need the money that a newspaper might bring in; his interest payouts make the Washington Post’s $100m annual losses look like a rounding error. When he bought the paper in 2013, the age of Obama, Bezos splashed the cash on bonuses for reporters, used one of his private jets to collect reporter Jason Rezaian from an Iranian jail and travelled to Istanbul to make a speech about murdered columnist Jamal Khashoggi. Then, in the first age of Trump, who made no secret of his dislike for a paper known for bringing down corrupt presidents, Amazon lost a $10bn government computing contract. The resulting lawsuit blamed “improper pressure from President Donald J Trump … to harm his perceived political enemy – Jeffrey P Bezos”. (The US Department of Defense defended its selection process, saying there were no external influences.) The ability of Trump to use other means to flood the zone – social media run by himself or his big-tech pals – has made him even more dangerous in his second coming.
Last week’s news was the culmination of a new mood at the Post that started in 2024. Bezos had appointed an outsider for the first time, the British journalist and media executive Will Lewis, to be publisher just as opinion polls started to suggest that Trump would become the 47th US president. In the runup to the election, Bezos pulled the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic presidential rival, on the grounds that endorsements create distrust; and insisted on a more free market-friendly orientation in its opinion pages. The decision led, within days, to almost 250,000 subscribers deserting the paper.
Anyway, all this seems to go to show that uber-wealthy owners in the news industry can’t be trusted to put private interests over the public good. Or, as the award-winning editor Tina Brown says of the Post debacle: “The purpose of having fuck-you money is to say fuck you, but it seems the purpose of fuck-you money is to have more fuck-you money.” And if the pesky newspaper that burnishes your reputation hurts your ability to make fuck-you money? Kill it – or at least let it fade into managed irrelevance.
So what are the alternatives? There has been no shortage of ideas among those who care about the future of journalism. One of my favourites is the suggestion that Bezos’s ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, could pair up with other first wives of big-tech billionaires, such as Melinda French Gates, and use their divorce payouts to support the Post instead of their other philanthropic causes.
A better, though possibly just as unlikely, idea is for Bezos to erect some legal frameworks to protect editorial safeguards. The best guarantees are embedded into a trust-based ownership such as that enjoyed by the Guardian. He could just stick a tiny fraction of his planet-sized fortune into a trust and have nothing to do with it.
The most likely scenario is the most depressing for anyone who cares about freedom of the press. The Post will simply do less and less of the great journalism that has seen it lauded with Pulitzer prizes, until eventually no one thinks of it as the paper of Watergate any more.
The crisis at the Washington Post marks a turning point in this new age of disillusionment, an era in which the excitement of the early web has made way for shame and bewilderment at how much we lose by allowing the rich and powerful to kill the parts of society that make it function better.

AI rattles US investors, while China’s tech stocks hold steady – for now
Investor jitters grow in the US as AI reshapes expectations, but China’s markets have so far reacted with caution rather than panic
Artificial intelligence is already reshaping industries and markets, even though artificial general intelligence (AGI) – a still theoretical form of AI capable of humanlike reasoning across many tasks rather than single specialised functions – has yet to be achieved.
That was the message of a recent essay posted on X by start-up founder Matt Shumer, titled “Something Big Is Happening”. He likened the current moment to the period just before the Covid-19 pandemic, arguing that the disruption driven by AI could prove “much, much bigger”.
The warning has resonated across US tech and investment circles, capping several uneasy weeks in which traditional software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks came under pressure amid concerns that their business models could be undermined in an AI-driven economy.
China, however, has so far appeared relatively insulated from this latest bout of AI-fuelled anxiety.
Even as Chinese AI models continue to narrow the gap with their US counterparts, particularly following a string of major releases over the past week, legacy software stocks in China have largely held steady.
Some AI-adjacent firms have even attracted fresh investor interest. Cultural and content-creation companies, for example, saw share prices rise after ByteDance unveiled its powerful Seedance 2.0 video-generation model, as the industry expects the tool to improve productivity and streamline workflows.

Why do some Swiss dress up as Japanese during carnival?

Why do some Swiss dress up as Japanese during carnival?
There is a carnival group in Schwyz, central Switzerland, called the Japanesen (the Japanese), who sometimes seem a little strange – and not just to the Japanese. They perform open-air plays during the carnival season. The tradition is 170 years old, but it is struggling to survive.
On January 6, Epiphany, a public holiday in Catholic-dominated canton Schwyz, the Japanesen held their “Empire Assembly” in a congress hall near the main square for the 169th time. It is the general assembly of the Schwyz carnival group Japanesengesellschaft (Japanese Society).
“Are you in favour of us performing the 52nd Japanese carnival play in 2028?” asked the president of the society, Karl Schönbächler, known as “Hesonusode”, and the hall erupted in loud, approving applause. In addition to the Japanesen in oriental costume, other carnival groups also welcomed the decision.
In Schwyz, a carnival parade takes place every year on Ash Wednesday, the so-called Nüssler, where masked figures dance in their own unique way. Every four to six years there is also an open-air theatre called the Japanesenspiele (Japanese plays), the roots of which go back to the middle of the 19th century.
Roots in the Swiss Civil War
Back then, the conservative Catholic canton of Schwyz was defeated by the liberal cantons in the Sonderbund War of 1847 and had to contribute to the costs of the war.
To cheer up the defeated people of Schwyz, it was decided to put on an open-air play during the carnival season. In 1857 the satirical play Circus Carnival, with bizarre animals, was performed to great acclaim.
At the same time, a wave of change also swept through the Far East: in Japan, a movement emerged that ended the 200-year isolation of the island nation. Young Switzerland, which was suffering from high tariffs in its neighbouring countries at the time, wanted to benefit from the opportunity and sent a delegation to Japan to negotiate a trade agreement.
Expensive gifts to Japan
The Swiss parliament approved a budget of CHF100,000 for this, around 10% of the federal budget at the time. The aim was to win over the Japanese generals.
A six-person delegation led by watch dealer Aimé Humbert-Droz put together over 200 gifts to demonstrate Switzerland’s industrial and technological strength – from watches and silk fabrics to handicrafts and fire pumps.
However, the people in the agricultural canton of Schwyz were dissatisfied with the high cost of this export promotion. Ambros Eberle, one of the organisers of the open-air play and publisher of the local newspaper, then wrote a play, a biting satire on the federal state.
Biting satire
In the play a Swiss delegation travels to Japan with a mountain of gifts to meet the taikun, the emperor. However, the delegation is treated badly by the tyrannical taikun. The patriotism of the Swiss farmers finally causes the taikun to change his attitude. In the end, he even wishes to become a Swiss citizen.
The premiere of Switzerland in Japan in February 1863 was a huge success and earned the organisers a surplus of CHF2,000. The organisers then founded the Japanese Society and since then have regularly staged Japanesenspiel (Japanese plays) in which the Emperor Hesonusode and his people, the Japanesen, play the leading roles. The plays have been constantly revised and supplemented with current events and satirical elements.
≫In this video, Swiss public broadcaster SRF reported on the rehearsal for the 50th performance of the Japanesenspiel in 2013:
The fantasy world 170 years ago
Although they were called Japanesen, their appearance clearly corresponds neither to the actual Japanese nor to Japanese culture. Their long, thin beards and robes look rather Chinese – at least from today’s perspective.
The Japanesen epitomise the image of the Japanese as the people of Schwyz imagined them 170 years ago. They were created at a time when, despite diplomatic messages, visual information was rare and the distinction between China and Japan or between a shogun and an emperor was unclear to many in Europe. The fact that they are still called by their original name, Japanesen, and not by the modern German word Japaner bears witness to their long history.
Longing for exoticism
“For them, faithfully recreating the Japan of the time was not important,” says Japanese professor Keizo Miyashita, a representative of the Japanesenspiel in Japan. “For people who wanted to release their frustration as quickly as possible, the quickest way was to transform themselves into something as far removed from their everyday reality as possible.”
This longing for the exotic still exists today. “During carnival, it’s fun to see how we can imitate unknown, foreign things,” Karl Schönbächler tells Swissinfo. The architect has in-depth knowledge of Japanese culture and is aware that the Japanesen do not embody authentic Japanese culture.
“It’s a carnival, so you can’t be ‘authentic’. It took me a long time to understand that,” explains Emi Oshikawa, who has lived in Schwyz since 1987. At first, the staging of the Japanesen seemed strange to her and she tried to make up for it by, for example, fetching real Japanese kimonos and showing them to the organisers.
No interest in kimonos
But the Japanesen just nodded, said “yes, that’s right” – and made no effort to correct their appearance. It took over ten years for Oshikawa to realise that “the play is not about conveying authentic Japanese culture”, she says.

2nd Life – Off to Tokyo
So why does the Schwyz open-air theatre continue to insist on the Japanesen? For Peter Steinegger, former Hesonusode, it is not about the appearance of the Japanesen, but about “Tenno as mediator”.
The Swiss Sonderbund War, which marked the beginning of these plays, had divided Switzerland into liberals and conservatives. Steinegger explains that the lines of conflict established back then are still in effect today. There is a constant struggle in Switzerland, “that is the essence of our democracy”.
In the Japanesenspiele, the inhabitants of Schwyz are also affected by the conflict. But in the end, Hesonusode acts as a mediator for the quarrelling Schwyz residents. “His appearance is always extremely honourable. The High Tenno is never criticised or even insulted,” explains Steinegger, former president of the cantonal parliament. In this respect, one can speak of a faithful representation of the Japanese emperor, he says.
On the brink of extinction
The Japanesen have reduced their appearances in recent decades. The ceremonial entry on Epiphany no longer takes place. Neither will the children’s gift-giving with oranges on so-called Dirty Thursday. In 2019 and 2023, the plays were renamed Faschnachtspiel (carnival play), and Hesonusode and the Japanesen became less important.
What happened to the Japanesen? Franz Steinegger, journalist for Der Bote, attributes the decline of the Japanesen to the “normalised relationship between the authorities and ordinary citizens”.
For a long time, the Japanese Society was led by wealthy and influential local dignitaries. Today, where equality is highly valued, this exclusivity has proved fatal. No board could be found for the Japanese Society. The Japanesenspiele were on the verge of extinction.
But in 2016 Toni Dettling, a former federal parliamentarian, initiated comprehensive reforms. He appointed the well-connected Karl Schönbächler as the Society’s president, Hesonusode, and entrusted the script to Roger Bürgler, a young playwright from Schwyz. The two were to transform the origins of the Society into an open-air theatre during the carnival.
“The break with tradition in the play was also somewhat tactical,” says Bürgler, explaining why he had significantly reduced the Japanesen factor. The Japanesen were “effectively dead”, he says. To rekindle interest, a lot of singing, dancing and light shows were added, as well as satirical elements.

This strategy was successful: the new carnival piece was well received and “we’re closer to the audience again”, says Franz Steinegger.
But the Japanesen are not completely extinct. Bürgler, who is also working on the script for 2028, wants “the Japanesen to come back a little”.
And the President of the Japanese Society, Karl Schönbächler, says: “Tradition is not the worship of ashes, but the passing on of fire”.

In Munich, Rubio urges transatlantic unity but lashes Europe on migration
Rubio’s speech was more conciliatory than Vice President JD Vance’s speech last year – though US-EU tensions remain.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio addressed European leaders at the Munich Security Conference in a speech seen as more conciliatory by the American side than previous years.
Rubio on Saturday said the United States and Europe “belong together”, adding: “We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive.”

The US under President Donald Trump wants to lead global “renewal and restoration … and that while we are prepared if necessary to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe”, he said.
Rubio’s speech on Saturday was seen as more conciliatory than remarks made by US Vice President JD Vance last year, who used his appearance at the event to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
Despite the softer tone, Rubio still criticised Europe on migration. He warned of “civilisational erasure” caused by mass migration and said it’s “destabilising” the West – a line that has been frequently repeated by US officials, including the president.
Other divisions remain between the once-ironclad allies. European leaders remain bruised by Trump’s desire to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO-member Denmark.
European leaders have used the conference as an opportunity to pledge to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences. Leaders said this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying “a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever”.
“This is the right time for a strong Europe,” said French President Emmanuel Macron, who stressed on Friday the continent is “clear in the support of Ukraine” and “building its own architecture of security”.
“This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America,” the French leader said.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the conference that Europe “must be ready to fight to do whatever it takes to protect our people, our values and our way of life”, and added the continent should focus on decreasing “some dependencies” and focus on creating a “more European NATO”.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz acknowledged a “rift” opened up between Europe and the US, prompted by culture wars, but issued an appeal to Washington: “Let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together.
“In the era of great power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” said the conservative leader, who has ramped up defence spending in the top European Union economy.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she’s “very much reassured” by Rubio’s speech, reiterating a “strong Europe” is the goal.
However, some were more cautious about Rubio’s stance on European immigration.
“I am not sure that Europeans see the announced civilisational decline, supposedly caused mainly by migration and deindustrialisation, as a core uniting interest. For most Europeans, the common interest is security,” said Gabrielius Landsbergis, former foreign minister of NATO member Lithuania.
“This was not a departure from the general position of the [Trump] administration. It was simply delivered in more polite terms,” he said on X.
Russia’s full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, addressed the meeting on Saturday.
No Russian officials have been invited, but Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China delivered a key speech.
A US official said Rubio will meet with Zelenskyy at the conference. US officials have worked for months to try to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, with little success.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Zelenskyy to “get moving” to end the war. “Russia wants to make a deal… He has to move,” the US leader said.
At the conference, the US secretary of state also touched on issues outside Europe.
On China, he said the US owes it to the world to manage its relations with China, even when the national interests of the two superpowers do not align.
Speaking about Iran, he said Trump’s preference is to reach a deal with Tehran, but said that’s “very hard to do”.

Trump says regime change in Iran could be ‘best thing’

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday embraced a potential regime change in Iran, saying a “tremendous power” will soon be in the Middle East, as a second aircraft carrier headed to the region.
Trump's military moves and tough talk comes even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators. The source said Witkoff and Kushner will also meet officials from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday in Geneva in the U.S. drive to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen." He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said "there are people."
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking," Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. "In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We've been going on for a long time."
Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country's ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people.
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.
Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the U.S. amasses forces in the Middle East. The U.S. targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in strikes last year.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the "dust." He added: "If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left."
U.S. officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the United States' newest and the world's largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it... if we need it, we'll have it ready."
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the U.S. military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering "illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere."
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased U.S. military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

Israeli forces have raided the village of Al-Mughayyir, north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa, which added that Israeli forces assaulted several residents during the assault.
Breadcrumb
US President Donald Trump has said that a change of government in Iran would be "the best thing," amid reports the US military is preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations.
Trump's comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran's government, and came as he pushes on Washington's foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."
Reuters has reported that the US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if Trump orders an attack.
Citing two US officials, Reuters said that this would raise the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran and could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Israeli forces have raided the village of Al-Mughayyir, north of Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa, which added that Israeli forces assaulted several residents during the assault.
President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu agreed at a White House meeting on Wednesday that the US would work to reduce Iran's oil exports to China, Axios reported, citing two US officials briefed on the issue.
"We agreed that we will go full force with maximum pressure against Iran, for example, regarding Iranian oil sales to China," Axios reported on Saturday, quoting a senior US official.
China accounts for more than 80 percent of Iran's oil exports. Any reduction in that trade would mean lower oil revenue for Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held nuclear talks through Omani mediators last week in an effort to revive diplomacy, after the US president positioned a naval flotilla in the region as the American military prepares for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran.
A Palestinian NGO has denounced what it called an Israeli act of revenge after a video showed far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir overseeing the abuse of detainees in a military prison.
Just days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Ben Gvir held a tour of Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, Israel's Channel 7 reported.
In footage filmed on Friday and broadcast by the channel, around 20 police officers are seen storming a hallway leading to prison cells, brandishing their weapons and firing stun grenades.
They then pull five detainees from their cells, their hands tied behind their backs, forcing them face-down onto the floor.
The operation took place as a bill proposing the death penalty for Palestinian prisoners convicted of terrorism awaited a final vote in the Israeli parliament.
"This is all part of ongoing displays meant to take revenge on Palestinian detainees," Abdallah al-Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoners' Club, told AFP on Saturday.
"Everything Ben Gvir and the far-right government are doing affects not only the Palestinian people and prisoners in detention camps - it also impacts the global legal and human rights system," he added.
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.
The planning under way this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over time.
Associates of Israeli President Isaac Herzog have described US President Donald Trump's pressure for granting a pardon to Benjamin Netanyahu as "crossing a line", according to Haaretz.
Netanyahu has sought a pardon from Herzog over corruption trials that are currently underway.
Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians shepards in Masafer Yatta, south of Hebron, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees has said conditions on the ground contradict repeated attacks from Israeli politicians seeking to dismantle the organisation.
Philippe Lazzarini told Al Jazeera that shutting down the UNRWA would deprive thousands of Palestinians of essential daily services.
“UNRWA is under a lot of pressure. We have been under a lot of political attacks; there are a number of politicians in Israel who want to get rid of the agency,” he said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Lazzarini said there is no alternative body capable of meeting the scale of need among Palestinians after two years of Israel’s war on Gaza.
“The reality is completely different. We have 12,000 staff, we have the workforce, the expertise, the community trust to provide daily critical services,” he said.
Israel has repeatedly accused UNRWA of being lenient towards, or complicit with, Palestinian armed groups, without providing verifiable evidence.
The agency has strongly rejected these allegations, stressing that disciplinary action is taken against any staff member found to be involved in wrongdoing.
Switzerland said Saturday that Oman would host talks between the United States and Iran in Geneva next week, with Washington pushing Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
"Switzerland stands ready at all times to offer its good offices to facilitate dialogue between the United States and Iran," a Swiss foreign ministry spokesman told AFP news agency.
On February 6, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi held talks in Oman with US envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner.
The talks were indirect, with the Omanis acting as mediators.
Trump has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear programme, which US forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, ratcheting up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Gideon Sa'ar is expected to represent Israel at a meeting of the Board of Peace, which is due to take place in Washington later this week.
According to Haaretz, the meeting is set to focus on plans for the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, citing a source familiar with the discussions.
A man was shot dead in the northern city of Nazareth on Saturday, according to Israeli police.
Police said the victim has not yet been identified and confirmed that an investigation is under way. Officers are searching for suspects as part of a probe into the killing, which comes amid a wider surge in violent crime.
The Palestinian Ministry of Health said hospitals in the Gaza Strip received the bodies of two Palestinians over the past 48 hours, after they were recovered from beneath the rubble.
In its daily statistical report, the ministry said a further 15 people were treated for injuries caused by ongoing Israeli attacks. It added that a number of victims remain trapped under debris or lying in the streets, as ambulance and civil defence crews have been unable to reach them.
The ministry said that since the ceasefire took effect on 11 October, at least 591 Palestinians have been killed, with 1,598 injured and 726 bodies recovered.
According to cumulative figures since the start of the war on 7 October 2023, the total number of Palestinians killed has risen to 72,051, while 171,706 others have been wounded.
Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy said Friday she was withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that he wanted to "stay out of politics" after being asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement that she was "shocked and disgusted" by Wenders' response to a question on Gaza at a press conference on Thursday. "With deep regret, I must say that I will not be attending the Berlinale," she said.
Roy, whose novel "The God of Small Things" won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.
However, she said that the "unconscionable" statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider.
"To hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping," she said.
When asked about Germany's support for Israel at the press conference on Thursday, Wenders said: "We cannot really enter the field of politics", describing filmmakers as "the counterweight to politics".
In her statement, Roy described Israel's actions in Gaza as "a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel".
"If the greatest film makers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them," she said.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule.
Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society.
University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000.
Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.

US Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has said Washington should reconsider its unconditional military support for Israel, pointing to the scale of civilian deaths in Gaza Strip.
In an interview with Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Ocasio-Cortez was asked whether a future Democratic presidential candidate in 2028 should reassess US military assistance to Israel.
She said: "The idea of completely unconditional aid no matter what one does doesn't make sense. I think it enabled a genocide in Gaza and we have thousands of women and children dead – that was completely avoidable.
Ocasio-Cortez added: "So I believe that enforcement of our own laws through the Leahy Laws, which requires conditioning aid in any circumstance when you see gross human rights violations, is appropriate."
About 200,000 people joined a demonstration against the Iranian government in Munich on Saturday, police said, as world leaders gathered nearby for a security conference.
The protesters rallied on Munich's Theresienwiese fairgrounds, denouncing the leadership of Iran's Islamic Republic following the deadly repression of nationwide protests in January.
Some waved flags with a lion and a sun against horizontal green, white and red stripes, the emblem of the monarchy overthrown in 1979.
Human rights groups have reported that thousands of protesters have been killed in Iran.
Rallies calling for international action against Tehran are also planned in Toronto and Los Angeles on Saturday.
The exiled son of the former shah of Iran, Reza Pahlavi, spoke at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday and called on US President Donald Trump to "help" the Iranian people.
Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since his father was overthrown in the 1979 revolution, urged an outside "humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed" in Iran.
The Theresienwiese, which hosts the huge annual Oktoberfest folk gathering, is located less than three kilometres (1.8 miles) from the security conference venue.
Last week, an estimated 10,000 people gathered in Berlin in response to a call from the MEK, an exiled opposition group considered "terrorist" by Tehran.
The U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said on Saturday that it conducted 10 strikes against more than 30 Islamic State targets in Syria between February 3 and February 12.
The U.S. struck ISIS infrastructure and weapons storage targets, it said.
Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas called on Saturday for the removal of "all obstacles" he said Israel has imposed on implementing phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.
"We emphasise the need to lift all obstacles imposed by the Israeli occupation on the implementation of the provisions related to the second phase of the agreement," Abbas said, in a speech read by his prime minister Mohammed Mustafa at an African Union summit in Ethiopia.
This included the work of a technocratic committee established to oversee the daily governance of Gaza, he added.
Removal of the obstacles was needed to "ensure continuity of services, coordinate humanitarian efforts and enable a swift recovery", the president said.
Abbas accused Israel of "continuing to violate" the ceasefire agreement with Palestinian militant group Hamas that took effect in October and was backed by the United States.
"From the announcement of the ceasefire until today, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed (in Gaza), which threatens the durability of the truce and the full implementation of its second phase," he added.
Israeli forces shelled several areas of Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, according to reports.
Israeli artillery targeted neighbourhoods in the city, TNA’s Arabic-language sister site Al-Araby Al-Jadeed reported.
The exiled son of Iran's last shah called on US President Donald Trump on Saturday to help the Iranian people and said it was "time to end the Islamic republic".
"To President Trump... The Iranian people heard you say help is on the way, and they have faith in you. Help them," the US-based Reza Pahlavi told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.
Trump had said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
He had earlier threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests in Iran that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
Pahlavi, who has not returned to Iran since before the 1979 Islamic revolution that ousted the monarchy, said in Munich: "It is time to end the Islamic republic."
"This is the demand echoing from the bloodshed of my compatriots who are not asking us to fix the regime but to help them bury it," he added.
The United Arab Emirates and the United States have each committed more than $1 billion to Donald Trump’s proposed Gaza Peace Council, according to officials cited by The New York Times.
The pledges, reported by the New York Times, signal significant financial backing from Washington and Abu Dhabi for the initiative, which is being presented as part of Trump’s plans for post-war governance and reconstruction in Gaza.
More than 100 prominent figures from the arts and entertainment world have signed an open letter supporting UN rapporteur Francesca Albanese, amid pro-Israel pressure for her to step down over comments critical of Israel’s genocidal conduct during the war on Gaza.
Calls for Albanese’s resignation have come from France and Germany, following remarks last weekend in which she described a “common enemy of humanity” and accused “most of the world” and the media of enabling Israel’s actions in Gaza.
The letter, organised by the Artists for Palestine group, is backed by figures including actors Mark Ruffalo and Javier Bardem, Nobel Prize–winning author Annie Ernaux, and British musician Annie Lennox.
The signatories state that they “offer our full support to Francesca Albanese, a defender of human rights and therefore also of the Palestinian people’s right to exist”.
The letter concludes: “There are infinitely more of us, in every corner of the Earth, who want force no longer to be the law. Who know what the word ‘law’ truly means.”
Other figures backing Albanese include actresses Rosa Salazar and Asia Argento, filmmakers Yorgos Lanthimos and Kaouther Ben Hania, as well as Latin music artist Residente.
The "extermination" of the Palestinian people must end, the chairman of the African Union Commission Mahmoud Ali Youssouf said on Saturday as he launched the organisation's 39th summit.
"In the Middle East, Palestine and the suffering of its people also challenge our consciences. The extermination of this people must stop," said Youssouf, who was elected to head the institution a year ago.
That attack resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to Israel figures.
Since then, at least 71,667 Palestinians have been killed in the small coastal territory by Israel's retaliatory military campaign, according to Gaza's health ministry.
He also touched on the multiple conflicts raging in Africa.
"From Sudan to the Sahel, to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in Somalia and elsewhere, our people continue to pay the heavy price of instability," Youssouf said.
The summit brings together heads of state from the 55 member states of the African Union over two days.
This year's theme is water sanitation.
The top diplomat overseeing the US-brokered ceasefire deal in Gaza said Friday that continued violations of the agreement pose major obstacles to the Palestinian committee expected to oversee postwar governance and reconstruction.
Nickolay Mladenov, who serves as high representative for Gaza for the US-established Board of Peace, spoke during a panel discussion at the Munich Security Conference. The international board, established by U.S. President Donald Trump, is set to meet next week.
The transitional committee, made up of Palestinian administrators, has met in Egypt but has not yet entered Gaza. Mladenov said it won't be able to do its work unless Hamas, the group that has governed Gaza since 2007, hands over institutional control.
He also called for more aid and improved security.
The agreement calls for Hamas to lay down its arms and for an international security force to be deployed, but there has been no visible progress on either. Israel has continued to carry out strikes in response to what it says are violations of the truce.
Palestinian fighters have also attacked Israeli forces.
“We need to make sure that what is happening now with the violations of the ceasefire stops,” Mladenov said. “We’re only embarrassing the committee and ultimately making it ineffective.”
Mladenov didn't lay out a specific timeline but said “all of this needs to move very fast.”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan on Friday, the ministry said.
The two ministers discussed the situation around Iran and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, it said.
Two sets of diplomatic negotiations, on Ukraine and Iran, are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters news agency on Friday.
A US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, the source said. Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.

African Union: youth anger mounts over corruption, lack of accountability
Africa has the youngest population in the world, with more than 400 million people aged 15 to 35 years old – set to double by 2050
Africa’s top regional body is hosting its annual summit in Ethiopia this weekend to discuss the future of the continent of some 1.4 billion people, as the organisation faces widespread discontent.
Set up to “promote the unity and solidarity of the African States,” analysts say the African Union faces a legitimacy crisis among youth for failing to meet their expectations. Meanwhile, several African countries battle military coups, disputed elections and protests inspired by economic hardship worsened by foreign aid cuts.
‘A bloc of old leaders’
Africa has the youngest population in the world, with more than 400 million people aged 15 to 35 years old. But it is also home to several of the oldest and longest-serving leaders – a paradox that has contributed to an upsurge in coups.
With a young population set to double by 2050, it is the only rapidly growing region where its people are getting poorer. Many African youths express on social media how they view the AU as ‘a bloc of old leaders’, which sees their interests as less of a priority.
The organisation has missed opportunities to be people-centred and citizen-driven and has instead focused largely on governments and leaders, said Liesl Louw-Vaudran, a senior analyst with the Crisis Group.
“What the youth is really asking and why people are frustrated is because this is not an African Union for citizens. It’s not a people-driven African Union,” Louw-Vaudran added.

Paratroopers, guards undergo fitness tests as army inspection in Belarus continues

BORISOV, 14 February (BelTA) – The snap inspection of the Armed Forces ordered by the Belarusian president continues. On 14 February, at the 72nd joint training center for warrant officers and junior specialists, soldiers from the 103rd Vitebsk Airborne Brigade and the 120th Separate Guards Mechanized Brigade are undergoing fitness tests, BelTA has learned.
“We continue to take part in the inspection conducted by order of the Belarusian president. According to the plan, today the servicemen are performing a 5km forced march with weapons. The personnel are ready, they know the task, understand it, and are capable of carrying it out. I am confident in my subordinates. Afterwards, we will continue undergoing fitness tests. Tomorrow, the servicemen will do pull-ups on the bar. The soldiers will complete the inspection with control exercises in weapons training,” Commander of the 103rd Vitebsk Airborne Brigade Vladimir Safonov told journalists.
The brigade commander also pointed out that the personnel of the inspected units are constantly on alert. “Therefore, there is nothing special for them during this inspection. They are doing their job, showing the skills they mastered before the inspection. Moreover, more than half of the time, the servicemen are in the field, performing various tasks,” he emphasized.
Among those taking part in the forced march was Dmitry Tsyngalev, a serviceman of the 103rd Vitebsk Airborne Brigade. “It was not easy, especially on the second and third laps. But our commander supported us, the guys did not give up, did not stop. The weather was not a problem,” he noted.
Commander of the Special Operations Forces of the Belarusian Armed Forces Aleksandr Ilyukevich pointed out that he was satisfied with the actions of the servicemen. “The main thing is that the soldiers have the aspiration, the desire to show results, there are no indifferent people. I am satisfied with the results. Of course, weather conditions and temperature changes make it more challenging. But a paratrooper isn’t afraid of frost or rain, it only gives them a boost,” Aleksandr Ilyukevich stressed.
Also on 14 February, soldiers of the 120th Separate Guards Mechanized Brigade were passing pull-up standards on the bar. “The combat readiness check for us began with a 50km march. Four hours on the road in vehicles, everything went perfectly, the soldiers were very pleased, they coped with the bad weather conditions. Afterwards, we conducted shooting drills with small arms and combat vehicles. Today we are doing pull-ups. Tomorrow we have a 5km run with weapons. We systematically have tests, both in shooting and fitness. So, this is not new for us,” deputy company commander for ideological training Ilya Grishchenko said.
Alongside the men, female servicemen also underwent fitness tests. “We were passing the standard for sit-ups from a lying position. For my age group, 36 repetitions were required, I did 52. I tried not to let my comrades down, because everyone is worried, everyone wants to pass as best as possible, because in the battalion we are one family,” senior assistant to the chief of staff for personnel and unit strength Tatyana Kuderko said.
The large-scale inspection of the Armed Forces on the instructions of the head of state began on 16 January. The commander-in-chief is personally monitoring its progress. A new system has been implemented that allows the president to directly place military units on combat readiness, circumventing the Ministry of Defense and the General Staff. The main aim of these inspections is to gain an objective assessment. This is precisely why they are carried out without prior notice.

A Photo, No Words: Trump's aircraft Carrier post sparks speculation

18:53:19 KST

ALBAWABA - On Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump posted a picture of an aircraft carrier on his Truth Social platform without any caption or explanation. This led to speculation about when and why he did it.
Trump said Washington would send a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if talks with Iran fail. This post came after that. When reporters asked Trump about the possible deployment of the USS Gerald R. Ford, he said that the ship would be needed "if we're not able to make a deal."
He also said that if the talks go well, both carriers will leave quickly, which shows that the military buildup is directly related to how well the talks are going.
Mixed Messages About Diplomacy
Later, when he spoke at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Trump sounded less sure about the talks and said that "the best thing that could happen" might be regime change in Iran. He said that decades of talks with Tehran had not made much progress and had cost lives.
Trump has said that the US won't use military force against Iran if the country agrees to a deal over its nuclear program. "We have to make a deal, or else it will be very painful," he told reporters. He stressed that he would rather find a diplomatic solution, but that other options are still on the table.
Military Presence in the Area
The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group is leading the way as the United States strengthens its military presence in the Middle East. There were talks between Washington and Tehran in Oman not too long ago, but no date has been set for another round.
Iran says that talks should only be about its nuclear program and not about its ballistic missile activities or alliances in the region.
As tensions rise and fall between diplomacy and deterrence, Trump's unexplained post has added another layer of mystery to an already unstable time in world politics.

Rubio: We do not know whether Russia is serious about ending war
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
Rubio noted that the issues that need to be resolved to end this war have been narrowed. However, the bad news is that "they've been narrowed to the hardest questions to answer and work remains to be done in that front."
"We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war – they say they are – and under what terms they were willing to do it and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine upon that Russia will always agree to. But we're going to continue to test it," Rubio said.
He stressed that other steps are being taken to put pressure on Russia to end the war. In particular, the United States has imposed additional sanctions on Russian oil, and in U.S. talks with India, commitments were obtained to halt further purchases of Russian oil. On the other hand, the PURL program continues: U.S. weapons are being sold to support Ukraine's war effort.
"So all these continue. Nothing has stopped. […] What we can't answer – but we're going to continue to test – is whether there is an outcome that Ukraine can live with and that Russia will accept," Rubio said.
He described as "progress" the fact that, for the first time in many years, at least at the technical level, military officials from both sides met last week. He added that there will be further meetings, including next Tuesday, "although it may not be the same group of people."
"We're going to continue to do everything we can to play this role of bringing this war to the end. I don't think anybody in this room would be against a negotiated settlement to this war so long as the conditions are just and sustainable. And that's what we aim to achieve and we're going to continue to try to achieve it even as all these other things continue to happen on the sanctions front and so forth," Rubio concluded.

Marco Rubio stresses intertwined destiny of US and Europe at security conference
- Marco Rubio, US Secretary of State, addressed the Munich Security Conference, stressing the intertwined destiny of the United States and Europe, in contrast to a previous critical speech by JD Vance.
- Rubio criticised past Western mistakes, labelling the “rules-based global order” a 'dangerous delusion' and stating that the UN has failed on pressing global matters.
- He emphasised that the US expects seriousness and reciprocity from European allies, while acknowledging shared responsibility for past errors and the need to rebuild.
- Rubio's absence from a meeting of Ukraine's allies at the conference raised concerns among Europeans about US commitment to the conflict.
- Sir Keir Starmer is expected to call for increased European defence spending and closer ties with the EU, arguing against reliance on America and warning against inward-looking policies.

Shadowlands review: Sanitised production can’t capture the darker realities of mortality
Hugh Bonneville brings plenty of affable charm to his role as the ‘Narnia’ author CS Lewis, but it’s an unstintingly mild-mannered performance in a deeply joyless play
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
At the end of CS Lewis’s classic Narnia series [spoiler alert], the children find out that they’ve died in the real world – and that the magical land they’ve been having such wonderful adventures in is actually a version of heaven, where they’ll live for ever. If you find that idea at all disconcerting or mawkish, then don’t dream of setting foot in the heavily moralistic, intensely sentimental world of film-turned-play Shadowlands. It opens with a gown-clad Lewis sermonising that real life is a shadowy land compared with the golden rewards after. Then, it shows him testing his faith to its limits, when his late-blooming love affair takes a tragic turn.
Television’s favourite nicely brought up Englishman Hugh Bonneville (Downton Abbey, Paddington) brings plenty of affable charm to this devout, emotionally repressed character, but neither this sanitised production nor his unstintingly mild-mannered performance can capture the darker realities of grief, sex and mortality.
The real CS Lewis had a personal life that was a lot more complicated and colourful than his sermons. Despite preaching about the joys of marriage, he cohabited with a woman (and her young daughter) for decades, and scholars who’ve scrutinised his diaries reckon it’s pretty clear they were lovers. Here, writer William Nicholson brushes this awkward biographical reality under the carpet. Instead, he paints Lewis as a lonely little boy in a tweed-suited, middle-aged gentleman’s body. When he meets married American poet Joy Davidman (the vivacious Maggie Siff), she’s portrayed as the first female interloper to enter his bachelor pad – and when they finally tie the knot, she must tenderly reassure him that he can still kneel down to say his prayers in his PJs, unmolested.
Still, if you can resist the temptation to be cynical, these early scenes are pretty charming. Siff captures all the gauche impulsivity of a woman who set sail from New York just to take tea with her literary idol, and who carries her poems inside her like an unexploded bomb, to be defused carefully in a controlled environment. She’s a dangerous addition to Lewis’s staid social set: learned men who cluster in his book-lined house like black-gowned crows, pecking away at dusty matters of literature and theology. Timothy Watson stays just the right side of panto villain as the meanest of them, Sir Christopher, who sees women as unreasoning creatures to be avoided at all costs. Needless to say, Lewis disagrees.
He bonds with Joy over poetry: “Desire is a baby” and it must be fed, they tell each other, quoting 16th-century poet Sir Philip Sidney as justification for their increasingly modern relationship. They take tea, and she slips her way into his life, awkwardly third-wheeled by the brother he lives with. Then, tragedy forces this couple out of their shadows.
Rachel Kavanaugh’s production injects little notes of magic – a forest beyond the bookshelves, softly falling snow – that help suggest the imaginative landscapes that Joy and Lewis tread together. But there’s still something deeply joyless about this play’s reluctance to show the couple actually being happy together before they descend into a world of hospitals and misery. It’s as though the knowledge that Joy is a scandalously divorced woman (and thus ineligible for traditional Christian marriage) means that Nicholson can only justify depicting their love when the character is at death’s door.
The bleaker second act swaps flirtation for a heavily romanticised depiction of Joy’s suffering, complete with melodramatic cries of agony and much-discussed crises of faith. There are audiences who’ll lap it all up as an emotive alternative to a church sermon, but they deserve better. Real life is much more complicated than the fridge magnet quote-worthy moralising that fills this play’s later scenes, and an author with the imaginative power to turn God into a friendly lion would have understood that.

The United States will continue efforts to achieve a peaceful settlement to Russia’s war against Ukraine and to find a negotiated solution that would satisfy all parties, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday.
He said something they can’t answer, but we will continue to test, is whether there is an outcome that Ukraine can live with and that Russia will accept. And he also added that up until now, that had been elusive.

Russia denies BRICS seeks to transform into a military alliance
‘It was never conceived in that spirit,’ deputy foreign minister tells state media
ISTANBUL
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov on Saturday denied that the BRICS economic bloc sought to transform into a military alliance.
In an interview with the state news agency TASS, Ryabkov said BRICS is neither a military alliance nor a collective security organization with obligations regarding mutual military assistance.
“It was never conceived in that spirit, and there are no plans to transform BRICS in that direction,” Ryabkov said, arguing that the 11-member bloc’s portfolio does not include military exercises or arms control.
Ryabkov also denied a recent naval exercise held in South Africa was a “BRICS event,” and that members that took part did so in their national capacity. He was referring to the “Will for Peace 2026” drills held on Jan. 9-16, which included China, Iran, and Russia.
Asked whether BRICS could protect tankers belonging to members from attacks and ensure their safety, Ryabkov said the bloc has no potential beyond improving logistics and ensuring greater protection from sanctions, and that security must be “ensured by other means.”
BRICS was formed in 2009 by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, with South Africa joining in 2010. Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Indonesia, and Iran later joined, expanding the group to 11 members, alongside 10 partner countries.
The Russian deputy foreign minister said the growth of trade between BRICS countries significantly exceeds the global average, “an indication that BRICS, without being some kind of 'magic wand,’ can actually help solve problems."
Ryabkov said BRICS can and should express solidarity with Iran, and that Moscow and Beijing are in contact with the country and working on “ensuring the appropriate political environment” for negotiations between Tehran and Washington.
According to him, the focus now is “on the negotiations Iran is conducting with its partners, on the work Iran is doing indirectly — primarily through Arab intermediaries — with the Americans,” which he believes will continue.
The US and Iran held indirect talks in Muscat on Feb. 6 with Omani mediation to discuss Tehran’s nuclear program, marking the end of a roughly eight-month suspension after the US launched strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities during the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June 2025.
Washington has also significantly increased its military footprint in the region as US President Donald Trump warns Iran, which recently faced widespread protests over worsening economic conditions, that it must make a deal.
Uranium enrichment remains a central point of dispute, with the US demanding Iran halt uranium enrichment and transfer highly enriched uranium out of the country.
The US has also sought to include Iran’s missile program and its support for armed groups in the region in the negotiations, but Tehran has repeatedly said it would not negotiate issues beyond its nuclear program.

European countries discuss possible seizure of tankers from Russia' shadow fleet

European countries discuss possible seizure of tankers from Russia' shadow fleet
UK Defence Secretary John Healey has met with his counterparts from the Baltic and Nordic countries to discuss the possible seizure of oil tankers linked to Russia's shadow fleet.
Source: Bloomberg, citing a source familiar with the matter, as reported by European Pravda
Details: Bloomberg's source reported that the Joint Expeditionary Force – a group of 10 countries with shared interests in the North Atlantic and the Baltic Sea – met on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
The meeting underscores a growing willingness among European allies to step up efforts to reduce the revenues that fund Russia's war against Ukraine, Bloomberg said.
"The atmosphere and the understanding was that we need to be more proactive. The message is that the countries who give flags to the shadow fleet vessels need to know that there are measures that can be taken by other countries," Estonian Defence Minister Hanno Pevkur said in an interview after joining the meeting.
Further discussions are needed before any decision is taken, Pevkur noted.
However, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said that some members remain cautious, fearing escalation.
According to sources, Healey was joined at the meeting by Richard Knighton, Chief of the UK Defence Staff, who presented options, including joint seizure operations.
This would allow the Joint Expeditionary Force to build on US interceptions of tankers sailing to and from Venezuela.
The source added that it remains unclear to what extent the United States would be involved in the UK-led efforts, though some coordination is likely.
The detention of vessels linked to Russia has caused concern in Moscow, and Russian officials have privately demanded that the US halt such actions, the source said.
Background:
- On 9 January, the United States seized the tanker Olina in the Caribbean Sea amid intensified efforts by Washington to restrict exports of Venezuelan oil.
- On 7 January. US forces took control of two tankers, including the Russian-flagged vessel Bella 1 (Marinera), which they had pursued for more than two weeks.
- At the end of January, a group of 14 European countries issued a public warning to Russian shadow fleet tankers operating in the Baltic and North seas.

'We don't always agree with what she says': UN Chief Guterres distances himself from Albanese

UN Secretary-General António Guterres distanced himself from UN Special Rapporteur Francesca Albanese after several member states criticized her speech at the 17th Al Jazeera Forum in Doha last weekend.
“We’ve always believed that the institution of special rapporteurs, while being completely separate from the secretary-general, is an important part of the international human rights architecture. We don’t always agree with what they say, and that includes Ms. Albanese,” Guterres’ spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric, said.
Dujarric added that Guterres’ office “doesn’t agree with much of what she says, and wouldn’t use the language that she uses to describe the situation in the region.”
Albanese ignited rebukes from an array of world leaders when she suggested that Israel was “a common enemy” for all.
“Instead of stopping Israel, most of the world has armed” it, she said, adding that the international community has given the Jewish state “political sheltering and economic and financial support.”
“We who do not control large amounts of financial capital, algorithms, and weapons – we now see that we as humanity have a common enemy,” Albanese continued.
When questioned further regarding Albanese’s comments during the Al Jazeera Forum, Dujarric said, “I’m not here to defend what she says or criticize what she says, right? She has a right, as a special rapporteur, to speak within her mandate. People have a right to criticize her. People have a right to support her.”
He went on to say that if someone was unsatisfied with Albanese’s work, there were mechanisms to address it, citing France’s request to remove Albanese from her post.
Dujarric refused to comment on whether Guterres had listened to Albanese’s speech, telling reporters, “You should ask him instead.”
Albanese under heavy fire for antisemitic speech
Italy and Austria supported France’s calls to oust Albanese from her position as a UN special rapporteur, citing her speech during the forum, which representatives of Hamas and Iran attended.
The vice president of the Council of Ministers of Italy, Antonio Tajani, wrote on X/Twitter that Albanese’s comments do not reflect the Italian government’s position.
“Her behaviors, statements, and initiatives are not appropriate for the position she holds within a body of peace and guarantee, such as the United Nations,” he wrote.
Austria’s Federal Minister for European and International Affairs, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, said that Albanese branded Israel an “enemy of humanity."
She slammed the UN special rapporteur for using language that “undermines the impartiality and highest standards that the role of a UN representative requires.”
France, meanwhile, will demand Albanese’s resignation during the United Nations Human Rights Council session set for February 23, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot announced during a parliamentary meeting this past week.
Albanese’s comments, Barrot said, “target not the Israeli government, whose policies can be criticized, but Israel as a people and as a nation, which is absolutely unacceptable.”
In response to the accusations leveled against her, she blamed her critics for not condemning Israel with the same conviction, as she put it.
She said her words were misinterpreted and taken out of context.
Releasing the full video of her statement to support her stance, Albanese said, the common enemy of humanity is the broader system she blames for Israel’s actions, not the country itself, per se.

'US freed captives from barbarians in Gaza': Rubio calls out UN's inability to solve conflicts

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called out the United Nations’ inability to solve world conflicts, including liberating the former Gaza hostages from Hamas captivity and striking Iran’s nuclear program, and asked for the organization to be reformed on Saturday.
Rubio spoke at the 2026 Munich Security Conference, noting that “it was US leadership who freed captives from barbarians [in Gaza], and brought about a fragile truce.”
He also cited the 12-day war with Iran last June, saying that the UN was “powerless to constrain the nuclear program of radical Shia clerics of Tehran.”
“That required 14 bombs dropped with precision by American B-2 bombers,” Rubio explained. He also pointed out the US government’s role in both the Ukraine-Russia war negotiations and the capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro.
“We cannot allow those who blatantly threaten our citizens, and endanger our global stability, to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate,” he added.
Iran can't be allowed to have nuclear weapons
In dialogue with Bloomberg, Rubio also talked about the risk of Iran getting nuclear weapons. “That poses a threat not just to the United States, but also to Europe, to world security, and to the region. There’s no doubt about it,” he said.
He also explained that the US has sufficient firepower in the region to ensure that the regime doesn’t “make a mistake and come after us, and trigger something larger.”
He said that, even if US President Donald Trump said his preference was to reach a deal with Iran, it would be very hard to do so.
“And that’s what we’re trying to do right now, and Steve Witkoff and Jared [Kushner] have some meetings lined up fairly soon,” he added.
Rubio says United States and Europe 'belong together'
Rubio also gave a robust message of unity with Europe, saying Washington’s destiny was intertwined with Europe and that it had no intention of abandoning the Transatlantic alliance.
The keynote speech was a stark change from 2025, when Vice President JD Vance, speaking from the same stage, launched an attack on European leaders, accusing them of censoring free speech and failing to control immigration.
“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the Transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe,” Rubio said.

Chinese FM: Doors open for dialogue in Ukraine
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, speaking on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, said that "the door to dialogue in Ukraine is open, and all parties should strive to reach a comprehensive and lasting peace agreement and address the root causes of the conflict."
"The door to dialogue on the ‘Ukrainian crisis’ [Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine] has finally opened. All interested parties must seize this opportunity to reach a comprehensive, lasting, and binding peace agreement, address the root causes of the conflict, and ensure lasting peace and stability in Europe," he said.
According to the Chinese Foreign Minister, "Europe should not watch this from the sidelines. It was here in Munich last year, when cooperation with Russia began, that Europe seemed to remain a bystander. And I said then that since the conflict erupted here in Europe, Europe has every right to participate in the negotiations at the appropriate time," he noted.
"I said that Europe shouldn’t be on the menu, but at the table. Now we see that Europe has found the courage to negotiate with Russia. This is good, and we support it," Wang Yi emphasized.
At the same time, he stated that "China is not a party directly involved in the conflict. We do not have the final say. We are only facilitating peace negotiations."
As previously reported, Wang Yi met with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Munich.

Budget standoff over immigration shuts down US Department of Homeland Security

Budget standoff over immigration shuts down US Department of Homeland Security
A prolonged impasse between US lawmakers over immigration enforcement ensnared the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in a partial government shutdown on Saturday, with Democrats in Congress vowing to withhold funding until major changes are enacted in the wake of two fatal shootings by federal immigration agents in Minneapolis.
The Department of Homeland Security entered a partial shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fight over funding the agency overseeing much of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.
Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.
At the center of the budget dispute is the department's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents killed two US citizens amid sweeping raids and mass protests in Minneapolis.
Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.
In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.
Watch moreFacial recognition: ICE agents use app to scan US citizens and immigrants
"Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday.
"Dramatic changes are needed," Jeffries told a news conference. "Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government."
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that "Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons."
But while DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in last year's government spending bill.
Senator John Fetterman pushed against his fellow Democrats, saying: "This shutdown literally has zero impact on ICE."
The primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters.
The Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait times and cancelled flights.
Negotiations stalled
The shutdown would be the third of Trump's second term, including a record 43-day government closure last October and November.
The government just reopened from a smaller, four-day partial shutdown earlier this month, also over DHS funding.
Even if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the body's 100 members to advance the budget bill, meaning several Democrats would need to get on board.
In response to the Democrats' demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate over immigration enforcement policy.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune called it "an extremely serious offer", but warned Democrats are "never going to get their full wish list".
Some concessions were made during the previous shutdown amid Democratic pressure and national outcry after federal agents shot and killed Renée Good, a mother of three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse who worked with military veterans, in Minneapolis last month.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents in the city would wear body cameras "effective immediately" in a move that would be later "expanded nationwide".
The Senate went into recess for a week starting Thursday, but senators could be called back to Washington in case of a rapid leap in negotiations.
For the moment, however, talks between the White House and Democrats appear to be at a standstill.

As sub-zero cold grips the region, animals are guided into Budakli’s thermal baths near Güroymak, using the naturally heated water to remove barn dirt, ease physical stress and protect dairy output.
Every ten days, breeders walk them several kilometres for the soak, often spending hours guiding the herd through snow. Steam rises around dark silhouettes, drawing photographers to the valley below Nemrut volcano.
Locals say the routine helps wounds heal and keeps animals calm through winter, turning the springs into a simple, open-air spa.
Fed by geothermal heat from the Nemrut volcano, the Budakli Thermal Springs draw rainwater deep underground, where it warms inside fractured volcanic rock before resurfacing naturally at close to 40°C.

- A Lidl employee, Julian Oxborough, was dismissed from his job after drinking a 17p bottle of water without paying for it at the Wincanton store on 19 July 2024.
- Mr Oxborough, who had worked for Lidl for over a decade, claimed he was dehydrated and forgot to pay for the water, describing his dismissal as "a huge overreaction".
- Lidl's area manager, Karina Moon, found his explanations inconsistent and noted he had four days after the incident to report it but failed to do so.
- The company maintained a zero-tolerance policy on consuming unpaid stock, stating it was essential for their operations and that rules must be followed by everyone.
- An Employment Tribunal in Southampton upheld Lidl's decision, rejecting Mr Oxborough's claim for unfair dismissal.

Quantum Systems Unveils Previously Unknown Jet UAV

During a visit by a Ukrainian delegation to Quantum Frontline Industries, the first joint Ukrainian-German drone manufacturing enterprise, German company Quantum Systems unveiled a previously unknown jet UAV.
A video of the visit, which included footage of the new UAV, was published by Ukrinform.
According to the Office of the President, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky began his visit to Munich with a meeting with the management and employees of the first joint Ukrainian-German enterprise, Quantum Frontline Industries, which manufactures drones for the Armed Forces of Ukraine. German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius also took part in the meeting.
The head of state was shown the production lines and tested the first strike drone manufactured there. The technology for the production of drones is Ukrainian. They claim that they are equipped with artificial intelligence and have already proven their effectiveness on the front lines.
During the delegation’s visit, the German company Quantum Systems, one of the founders of the joint venture, also presented its line of drones. Among them, journalists filmed a previously unknown jet UAV.
No additional information about the characteristics or purpose of this drone is currently available. Judging by its appearance, it can be assumed that this is a middle strike attack drone with a relatively small warhead. Another possible use could be as a jet interceptor drone.
Given the appearance of the model presented, as well as the fact that it has not been publicly reported on before, it is likely that this UAV is still in the development stage.
As a reminder, in December 2025, the German company Quantum Systems and the Ukrainian drone manufacturer Frontline Robotics announced the creation of a joint venture, Quantum Frontline Industries.
The new company plans to scale up the production of Ukrainian defense solutions using German automation expertise.
The new line will produce the Zoom and Linza drones developed by Frontline Robotics. All systems manufactured in Germany will be supplied to the Ukrainian military in quantities determined by the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine. In a comment to Militarnyi, Frontline said it plans to produce more than 10,000 drones per year.

‘Bangladesh will be better’: BNP victory puts nation at crossroads
The victorious Bangladesh Nationalist Party supporters are jubilant, but analysts warn of challenges ahead.
As rickshaw puller Anwar Pagla turned into the road leading to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s (BNP) office in Gulshan, Dhaka, on the afternoon after the parliamentary election, a small commotion stirred. His rickshaw had a Bangladeshi flag fixed to one side of the hood and the BNP’s flag to the other. Pagla is an ardent supporter.
“They call me mad because I consider this party everything in my life. But it doesn’t matter. We have won and Bangladesh will now be better,” he told Al Jazeera.

Nearly two decades after it last governed, the BNP returned to power after a landslide victory in Thursday’s parliamentary election.
The Election Commission published the gazette of the members of parliament elected, a final official seal on the election process, on Saturday. The centre-right BNP’s alliance secured 212 of the 300 seats. The alliance led by its main rival, the Jamaat-e-Islami – Bangladesh’s largest religion-based party – secured 77.
Those elections came a year and a half after a nationwide protest movement ousted the country’s former leadership and saw 1,400 people killed in the streets. Bangladesh has been led by a caretaker government since Sheikh Hasina, who led the crackdown, fled the country.
The BNP’s Tarique Rahman, set to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister, greeted supporters on Friday, saying he was “grateful for the love” they had shown him. He promised throughout BNP’s campaign to restore democracy in Bangladesh.
Mahdi Amin, BNP’s election steering committee spokesperson, said Rahman pledged that, as prime minister, he would safeguard the rights and freedoms of citizens.
Thursday’s vote passed largely peacefully, and, despite alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications” during the vote count, Jamaat accepted the outcome of the election on Saturday.
BNP had recently lost its former chairperson, Khaleda Zia – Tarique Rahman’s mother and a two-time prime minister – who died on December 30.
Khaleda Zia had led the party to power in 1991 and again in 2001. Two decades later, her son has returned the BNP to government.
At the party’s Gulshan office that afternoon, BNP activist Kamal Hossain stood among a jubilant crowd. Visibly emotional, he reflected on what he described as years of repression.
“For so long, I felt the regime of Sheikh Hasina would never go,” he said. Referring to the July 2024 uprising that forced her to flee, he added: “Now people have given us this mandate. We have taken back Bangladesh.”
Hossain said the new government’s immediate priorities should be job creation and curbing inflation.
“Prices have been hurting us, and there are too many unemployed young people. The government must address this immediately,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, remained unusually quiet on Friday.
The calm was largely by design: the BNP chose not to hold victory processions.
The Jamaat head office in the capital’s Moghbazar also appeared subdued on Friday. A few supporters around the head office expressed disappointment.
“There has been engineering in the counting process, and the media has been biased against the Jamaat alliance,” said Abdus Salam, a supporter near the office. He argued that a fair process would have yielded more seats.
Others, like Germany-based Jamaat supporter Muaz Abdullah, said Jamaat’s defeat was a failure of organisation.
“In many constituencies, Jamaat didn’t run a good election campaign. They didn’t even have proper polling agents in several places,” he said.
Though the BNP and Jamaat were allies for years, they faced each other as rivals in this election. The campaign period saw sporadic violence and months of divisive online rhetoric.
Sujan Mia, a BNP activist outside the party office, struck a conciliatory tone. “We do not want enmity. We should focus on building the nation,” he said.
Rezaul Karim Rony, editor of Joban Magazine and a political analyst who closely followed the BNP’s campaign, said the party’s victory is likely to allay concerns of a lurch to the right in Bangladesh.
“Through this election, people have, in a sense, freed the country’s politics from that risk,” he argued.
However, Rony cautioned that the real test begins now.
“The challenge is to ensure good governance, law and order, and public safety – and to establish a rights-based state,” he said, describing those goals as being at the “heart of the aspirations of the 2024 mass uprising.”
Michael Kugelman, senior fellow for South Asia at the Atlantic Council, said a BNP victory represents “a blow to the politics of change that have galvanised Bangladesh since the 2024 mass uprising”.
“The BNP, dynastic and long saddled with corruption allegations, reflects the principles that the Gen Z protesters rejected,” he said.
The party will now face pressure from both the public and the opposition to push beyond old political habits, Kugelman added.
“If the new government falls back on repressive or retributive politics, reform advocates will be disappointed and democratisation efforts will be set back,” he said.
The outcome might be the least disruptive for the region as a whole.
Pakistan might have preferred a Jamaat win, given the party’s historical affinity for Islamabad. But Pakistan has also had strong relations with the BNP, Kugelman pointed out, as has China.
And “India much prefers the BNP to Jamaat,” he added, noting that the BNP is no longer in alliance with Jamaat, which New Delhi believes takes positions contrary to its interests.
Back at the BNP’s office in Dhaka, however, geopolitics felt distant.
Shamsud Doha, a party leader, had brought his two grandchildren to share the moment.
“Nothing matches this feeling,” he said. “We have long suffered under autocratic rule. Now it is our time to build the nation.”

As the 39th summit of the African Union opened in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa, the chair of the African Union Commission, Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, used his opening address to denounce what he described as the “extermination” of the Palestinian people, while António Guterres spoke to African leaders on Saturday, renewing his appeal for the continent to gain permanent representation on the United Nations Security Council; although this year’s official theme focuses on access to water and sanitation, ongoing conflicts across the continent—particularly in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo—have already pushed security to the forefront of discussions, as our correspondent Tom Canetti reports from Addis Ababa.

Rubio casts US, the ‘child of Europe’, as critical friend to allies

- Secretary Rubio called the US "child of Europe" at Munich, seeking unity. Some welcomed his tone, but concrete commitments were questioned.
- European leaders expressed anxiety over US unpredictability, particularly regarding Ukraine concessions and Trump's criticisms of NATO allies.
- At the conference, five European allies accused Russia of killing Alexei Navalny with poison, a claim his widow supported with proof.

MUNICH – Secretary of State Marco Rubio cast the United States as the “child of Europe” in a message of unity on Feb 14, offering some reassurance as well as levelling more criticism at allies after a year of turmoil in transatlantic relations.
Mr Rubio was addressing the annual Munich Security Conference, where Europe’s leading powers have tried to project their own independence and strength while straining to keep a long-time alliance with the US under President Donald Trump alive.
The speech delivered a degree of respite to European countries who fear being left in the lurch on anything from the war in Ukraine to international trade ructions in a rapidly shifting global order.
But it was short on concrete commitments and made no mention of Russia, raising questions about whether Mr Rubio’s tone, more emollient than that of Vice-President J.D. Vance at the same event a year ago, would change the underlying dynamics.
“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the Western Hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe,” Mr Rubio said.
“For the United States and Europe, we belong together,” he said in the speech, which drew a standing ovation at the end.
While European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was “very much reassured” by the speech and German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul called Mr Rubio a “true partner”, others struck a more cautious tone.
“I am not sure that Europeans see the announced civilisational decline, supposedly caused mainly by migration and deindustrialisation, as a core uniting interest. For most Europeans, the common interest is security,” said Mr Gabrielius Landsbergis, former foreign minister of NATO member Lithuania.
“This was not a departure from the general position of the (Trump) administration. It was simply delivered in more polite terms,” he said on X.
One particular area of anxiety is Ukraine, where allies have long worried about Mr Trump and Russia’s Vladimir Putin trying to ram through a deal on Moscow’s terms and force Kyiv to cede land to end Europe’s deadliest conflict since World War II.
On Feb 14, five European allies accused Russia of killing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny using venom from poison dart frogs
The findings, attributed to analyses of samples taken from Navalny’s body, were released while Navalny’s widow Yulia Navalnaya was attending the Munich conference. “I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof,” she said on social media.
US-brokered peace talks resume next week in Geneva after a sustained bombardment of Ukrainian cities during one of the coldest winters in years killed civilians and left hundreds of thousands of people without power and water.
President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed hope at the conference
“The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine, not Russia,” Mr Zelensky said.
Rubio hits out at West’s ‘managed decline’
The Munich conference of top security leaders has been dominated this year by how countries are scrambling to adjust to a year of confrontations with Mr Trump on issues from tariffs to his threat to wrest Greenland
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said the transatlantic alliance depended on the predictability and reliability of the US.
“Questioning the territorial integrity and sovereignty of a NATO member state. Excluding European allies from negotiations that are crucial to the security on the continent. All this damages our alliance and strengthens our adversaries,” he said.
A 2025 address by Mr Vance,
While praising Europe’s cultural achievements from the artist Michelangelo to the poet William Shakespeare, Mr Rubio also touched on themes that have raised hackles, including criticism of mass migration and zealous action on climate change.
“We do not want our allies to be weak, because that makes us weaker,” he said.
“For we in America have no interest in being polite and orderly caretakers of the West’s managed decline. We do not seek to separate but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilization in human history.”
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said he could see why Mr Rubio’s appeal to a common legacy had drawn applause.
“Is it going to change our strategy? Of course not. Because, you know, what we’re hearing today, we heard already in the past,” Mr Barrot said. REUTERS

China to scrap tariffs for most of Africa from May: Xi
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BEIJING – Beijing’s scrapping of tariffs for all but one African country will start on May 1, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Feb 14, according to state media.
China already has a zero-tariff policy for imports from 33 African countries,
China is Africa’s largest trading partner and a key backer of major infrastructure projects in the region through its vast “Belt and Road” initiative.
From May 1, zero tariffs will apply to all African countries except Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
China claims the democratic island as its own, and does not rule out using force to take it.
Many African countries are increasingly looking to China and other trading partners since US President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs worldwide in 2025.
Mr Xi said the zero-tariff deal “will undoubtedly provide new opportunities for African development”, announcing the date as leaders across the continent gathered in Ethiopia for the annual African Union summit. AFP

Secretary of State Rubio insists US and Europe 'belong together'

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, February 14, saying that Washington wanted to "revitalize" the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the United States on its mission of global "renewal." Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly reassuring tone as he addressed a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about Washington's allies.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalize an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said. "What we want is a reinvigorated alliance." "We want Europe to be strong. We believe that Europe must survive," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US "belong together."
The US will be "driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilization's past," he said. "And while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe."
He echoed the Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration was a threat, saying that "mass migration" was "a crisis which is transforming and destabilizing societies all across the West."
"We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilisation and together with us are willing and able to defend it."
"Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy... It will restore to us a clear sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilizational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike."
Change in tone
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
Aside from the immigration issue, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a "rift" between US and Europe.
US-Europe ties were further strained by the Trump administration's new National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with "civilizational decline."
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
European security
European leaders who have gathered at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses.
Key leaders have pushed the message that this is essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia, with NATO chief Mark Rutte saying that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever."
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security and called for closer ties with Britain, saying "10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever."
French President Emmanuel Macron told the gathering on Friday that "this is the right time for a strong Europe," that would be "clear in the support of Ukraine" and "building its own architecture of security." "This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America," he said.
British leader Keir Starmer was expected to tell the conference that Europe is "a sleeping giant" and must rely less on the United States for its defense.
Ukraine war in focus
Merz on Friday had appealed to Washington: "Let's repair and revive transatlantic trust together." The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defense and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth grueling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited. At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the US leader said. "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war," Rubio said in his speech on Saturday.
A German government source said Merz and Rubio met at the conference Friday and discussed "Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid." They also discussed Europe's role in NATO and "Rubio praised Germany's steps to strengthen the alliance," the source added.
Macron said a new framework was needed to deal with "an aggressive Russia" once the fighting in Ukraine ends. Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky said he feared "a new cold war" between Europe and Russia in the coming decade, making reopening dialogue with Moscow essential. "If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," said Merz, but he also charged that "Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously."

UK, EU consider seizing Russian shadow fleet vessels – Bloomberg
That is according to Bloomberg, citing its own sources, Ukrinform reports.
According to the article, British Defense Secretary John Healey met with counterparts from Baltic and Nordic nations to discuss seizing oil tankers linked to Russia's shadow fleet.
The meeting of the Joint Expeditionary Force, a group of ten nations with a shared commitment to the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea, took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to one of the participants and people familiar with the matter.
Healey was joined at the meeting by the head of Britain’s military, Richard Knighton, who presented options including joint seizure operations, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private deliberations.
"The atmosphere and the understanding was that we need to be more proactive," Estonia's Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said in an interview after joining the gathering. "The message is that the countries who give flags to the shadow fleet vessels need to know that there are measures that can be taken by other countries."
For his part, Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said in a separate interview that some members remain cautious given a "fear of escalation."
With such a move, the Joint Expeditionary Force would build on U.S. interdiction of tankers moving to and from Venezuela – sometimes with the help of allies – in the wake of President Nicolas Maduro’s capture. Several of those vessels have had ties to Russia.
It's unclear to what extent the U.S. would be involved in the UK-led effort but there would likely be some coordination, according to one of the people familiar with the matter. The interdictions of the Russia-linked vessels have prompted concern in Moscow, with Russian officials privately demanding that the U.S. stop, the person said.
The shadow fleet is a group of about 1,500 tankers that use false flags to appear legitimate without having to comply with regulations. More than 600 tankers have been sanctioned by some combination of the EU, the UK and the U.S. for their links to Russia.
On January 7, the UK helped the U.S. seize the oil tanker Marinera, which was sailing under a Russian flag, following a days-long chase after it left the Caribbean Sea. France’s navy boarded an oil tanker coming from Russia into the Mediterranean Sea on January 22.

Eurozone Posts €164.6 Billion Trade Surplus in 2025 Despite Global Challenges

Romania Targets Eurozone Entry in 3-4 Years Despite Entering Recession
Romania aims to join the eurozone within three to four years, but recent economic data show the country has slipped into a technical recession.
The eurozone closed 2025 with a strong trade surplus, though slightly lower than the previous year. Preliminary figures from Eurostat show that in December 2025, the currency bloc recorded a goods trade surplus of €12.6 billion, down from €13.9 billion in the same month of 2024, yet up from November 2025. Exports to non-euro countries rose by 3.4 percent to €234 billion, while imports grew faster, by 4.2 percent, reaching €221.3 billion.
A closer look at sector performance explains the annual dip in the surplus. Chemicals and related products saw their balance fall from €20.2 billion to €16.5 billion, while machinery, vehicles, and other manufactured goods also recorded declines. In contrast, the energy sector improved significantly, with its deficit narrowing from €24.5 billion to €19.1 billion, providing some stability to the overall trade figures.
For the full year, the eurozone posted a total trade surplus of €164.6 billion, slightly below 2024. Annual exports expanded by 2.4 percent, exceeding €2.9 trillion, while imports rose by 2.7 percent. Trade within the euro area itself increased as well, surpassing €2.6 trillion. Across the broader European Union, the year ended with a positive balance of €133.5 billion, supported by intra-EU trade of more than €4.1 trillion, up 2.6 percent.
Seasonally adjusted data for December indicate modest monthly growth, with exports up 1.1 percent compared to November. However, exports to countries outside the eurozone slipped by 0.7 percent in the last quarter, highlighting the resilience of internal markets amid global economic pressures. Overall, intra-eurozone trade remains a key stabilizing factor, while external demand faces headwinds, particularly in major industrial sectors.
Recent data from the Tax Foundation reveal a widening gap in Europe between East and West when it comes to tax rates for top earners in 2026.

Medical activities halted at Gaza hospital after reports of gunmen, suspected weapons transfers
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, has halted “non-critical” medical activities at a major hospital in southern Gaza, following reports from patients and its own staff of armed men inside the facility and concerns over the movement of weapons within it.
MSF’s statement appeared to mark the first time that an international humanitarian group in Gaza has publicly reported the presence of armed men in a hospital or the possible use of such a facility for moving weapons.
The Geneva-based medical charity said non-essential operations at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis were suspended on Jan 20 over concerns with the “management of the structure, the safeguarding of its neutrality and security breaches”.
In recent months, patients and personnel had “seen armed men, some masked”, in areas of the hospital compound, MSF said.
The Hamas-run Interior Ministry said in a statement that it was committed to preventing any armed presence inside hospitals, and that legal action would be taken against violators. It suggested that armed members of certain Gazan families had recently entered hospitals, but did not identify those involved.
‘Unacceptable acts’ reported, including weapons movements
Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October
Since the ceasefire, “MSF teams have reported a pattern of unacceptable acts, including the presence of armed men, intimidation, arbitrary arrests of patients and a recent situation of suspicion of movement of weapons”, it said.
According to Gaza’s Health Ministry, more than 590 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops
MSF disclosed the Nasser Hospital suspension in a “frequently asked questions” section on its website about its work in Gaza, last updated on Feb 11.
The armed men had been seen in areas of the hospital compound where MSF does not carry out activities, but their presence, along with suspected weapons transfers, posed serious security risks to patients and personnel, MSF said.
An MSF representative told Reuters the organisation continued to support some critical services at Nasser Hospital, including inpatient and surgical care for certain patients requiring life-saving treatment.
‘Hospitals must remain neutral spaces’
MSF said it had expressed concern to the relevant authorities, without detailing to whom the reports were submitted.
“Hospitals must remain neutral, civilian spaces, free from military presence or activity, to ensure the safe and impartial delivery of medical care,” MSF said.
Israel in January ordered MSF and 30 other international organisations to stop their work in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank if they did not meet new rules, including sharing details about their staff.
MSF on Jan 30 said it would not submit a staff list to Israel after failing to receive assurances over their safety.
Parts of tunnel network found under hospitals
The Israeli military says it has targeted hospitals during the war because Hamas fighters were operating inside them, and parts of Hamas’ tunnel network have been found running beneath medical facilities. The Palestinian Islamist group denies using hospitals for military purposes.
Some Israeli hostages, taken during Hamas’ Oct 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel that ignited the war, have said they were held at Nasser Hospital, the largest in southern Gaza.
Hospitals are protected sites under international law. Both attacking hospitals and their use for military purposes are typically considered a breach of law.
Although medical facilities can lose their protected status under certain conditions, rights groups say Israel has not shown sufficient evidence in many cases to justify its attacks on them during the war. REUTERS

Minister: Belarus and China have unique opportunities to deepen cultural ties

Ruslan Chernetsky
MINSK, 14 February (BelTA) – Belarus highly values its long-standing strategic partnership with China, Belarusian Culture Minister Ruslan Chernetsky said while speaking at a concert during the Happy Spring Festival 2026 event at the Minsk’s Palace of Culture of Trade Unions on 13 February, BelTA has learned.
The minister noted that the event is a vivid confirmation of the strength of the cultural bridges connecting Belarus and China. He emphasized that the Republic of Belarus highly values its long-standing strategic partnership with the People’s Republic of China, built on the principles of mutual respect, equality, and consideration of mutual interests.
“It is worth noting that our mutually beneficial cooperation is primarily built on the trust and friendship between the leaders of our countries: Belarusian President Aleksandr Lukashenko and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Our countries have built a robust architecture of interaction, encompassing fruitful cooperation in all key areas,” the minister said.
Ruslan Chernetsky pointed to the dynamically developing cultural ties between the two countries. “To date, a solid and multi-level foundation for comprehensive cultural cooperation has been formed between our states. We have a full range of necessary conditions – from the regulatory and legal framework enshrined in intergovernmental and interdepartmental agreements to a developed network of informal contacts, friendly and personal ties. All this creates unique opportunities to further deepen cultural dialogue and strengthening mutual understanding between our peoples,” the minister believes.
“Our artistic groups actively and permanently tour China. For example, just last year, the Bolshoi Theatre of Opera and Ballet successfully gave concerts in 12 Chinese cities, and the National Theatre of Belarusian Drama staged seven performances in Shanghai,” he added.
Ruslan Chernetsky also said that landmark exhibitions are held in museums of Belarus and China, emphasizing the strong cultural connection between our peoples. For instance, Shanghai hosted the exhibition titled as With the Blood of the Heart about Belarusian frontline writers, while in Minsk, the National Historical Museum displayed the unique exhibition The Thread of Fate. Belarus – China, which for the first time featured postcards and photographs of Northern China from private collections, as well as gifts from Chinese delegations and a collection of numismatic and banknote items from the funds of the National Historical Museum of Belarus.
According to the minister, the development of cinematic dialogue between Belarus and China deserves special attention.
“Chinese masters of screen art have long and firmly secured a worthy place in the program of the Minsk international film festival Listapad. A particular milestone was the second Chinese Cinema Day held within the festival’s framework. This event is certainly acquiring the status of a good tradition, enriching the festival’s palette with genuine masterpieces of Chinese cinematography and strengthening the cultural bridges between our countries. In turn, Belarusian cinema is confidently gaining recognition in China. A vivid confirmation of this is the success of the film The Black Castle by the national film studio Belarusfilm, which was awarded a prestigious prize for best production design at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Film Festival in Chongqing,” the head of the ministry stated.
Furthermore, the minister noted that nearly one thousand Chinese students are studying in Belarusian cultural institutions.
“Various educational programs are being implemented with Chinese partners, and summer schools are organized to introduce Belarusian culture. Every student, every joint project, every cultural meeting lays the foundation for a long-term partnership based on mutual respect and a sincere interest in each other’s spiritual values,” the Belarusian culture minister summarized.

DHS says ICE agents may have lied about Minnesota shooting, placed on leave
Video review raises questions over sworn testimony after Venezuelan immigrant shot during enforcement operation
ISTANBUL
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Friday that two federal immigration agents involved in the Jan. 14 shooting of a Venezuelan immigrant in Minneapolis appear to have provided false sworn testimony.
NPR reported that DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the officers were placed on administrative leave after a joint review by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the Justice Department examined video evidence that indicated “untruthful statements” may have been made.
“The men and women of ICE are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and are held to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical conduct,” McLaughlin said. “Violations of this sacred sworn oath will not be tolerated.”
The incident involved Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who was shot in the leg during what DHS initially described as a self-defense response after agents were “ambushed and attacked” during a targeted traffic stop.
However, eyewitness accounts, including testimony from his partner, Indriany Mendoza Camacho, disputed that version of events. “I'm a witness, I saw everything, and my partner never grabbed anything to hit him or anything like that,” she told Minnesota Public Radio.
Federal prosecutors on Thursday dropped charges against Sosa-Celis and another Venezuelan man previously accused of assaulting officers, while DHS said the agents could face dismissal or criminal prosecution depending on the outcome of the investigation.
The shooting occurred during Operation Metro Surge, a large-scale immigration enforcement campaign launched in December that deployed roughly 3,000 federal agents across Minnesota.
The Trump administration announced the operation’s end this week after more than 4,000 arrests, according to White House border czar Tom Homan, as federal authorities continue to investigate multiple fatal incidents linked to the crackdown.

Virginia Supreme Court clears path for redistricting referendum amid national map battle
Voters will decide in April 21 special election whether lawmakers can redraw congressional districts through 2030, as legal challenges continue and partisan tensions rise ahead of US midterms
ISTANBUL
Virginia’s Supreme Court has cleared the way for a spring referendum on congressional redistricting, intensifying a broader national struggle over electoral maps ahead of the US midterm elections, according to a report.
The Washington Times reported on Friday that the court allowed the April 21 special election to proceed while legal challenges continue, meaning voters could decide whether to grant Virginia’s legislature authority to redraw districts through 2030, temporarily overriding the bipartisan commission created by a 2020 constitutional amendment.
Early voting is set to begin on March 6.
‘Virginians will have final say’
Democratic lawmakers have framed the proposal as a response to Republican-led mid-decade redistricting efforts in states such as Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Missouri, moves encouraged by President Donald Trump to help Republicans protect their narrow US House majority.
GOP-led Texas was among the first to revise maps, prompting countermeasures from Democratic-led states, including California.
Supporters welcomed the court’s decision.
“Today’s order is a huge win for Virginia voters,” Dan Gottlieb, spokesperson for Virginians for Fair Elections, said in a statement. “The Court made it clear that nothing in this case stops the April 21 referendum from moving forward and that Virginians will have the final say.”
Opponents argue the initiative reverses bipartisan reforms designed to remove politicians from the map-drawing process.
A coalition, including former Virginia governor and US senator George Allen, urged voters to reject the measure, warning: “Thanks to the strong recent vote of the people, Virginia has much better standards of fairness than this. We must stand above these sorts of political election-rigging schemes.”
The legality of the process remains under review by the state’s highest court, leaving open the possibility that the ballot measure could be invalidated even after votes are cast.

Rubio: We don't know whether Russia is serious about ending war, but we'll see
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the United States does not know how serious Russia is about the negotiations to settle its war against Ukraine but will continue to test this.
Source: Rubio speaking at the Munich Security Conference (MSC), responding to a question from MSC Chair Wolfgang Ischinger, as reported by European Pravda
Details: In the context of the negotiations to resolve Russia's war against Ukraine, Rubio noted that the range of issues to be resolved has narrowed, but he said the hardest questions to answer remain.
Quote: "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war – they say they are – and under what terms they are willing to do it, and whether we can find terms that are acceptable to Ukraine that Russia will always agree to. However, we're going to continue to test it."
Details: Rubio believes the US has made progress in the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia.
"I don't think anybody in this room would be against a negotiated settlement to this war, so long as the conditions are just and sustainable. And that's what we aim to achieve, but we're going to continue to try to achieve it even as all these other things continue to happen on the sanctions front and so forth," Rubio noted.
Background:
- A new round of talks between Ukraine, the US and Russia will take place in Geneva on 17-18 February.
- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told journalists that the US has proposed ending Russia's war against Ukraine by the summer, as later it will have another priority – the congressional elections.
- US President Donald Trump has stated that Zelenskyy has to "move" and reach a deal to end the war.

Ben Gvir's Ofer prison visit sparks widespread backlash

ALBAWABA - The visit of Israel's National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir to Ofer Prison near Ramallah has elicited a significant amount of online backlash. This was due to the dissemination of videos that depicted the harsh treatment of Palestinian detainees during the inspection, which was described by activists.
Ben-Gvir and the chief of the Israeli Prison Service toured the facility on Friday, according to Israeli media reports, just days before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan began. Prisoner cabins were examined during the visit.
It appeared that Israeli forces were employing tear gas and stun grenades inside prison sections, while simultaneously pointing weapons toward detainees inside their cells, according to footage shared on social media. The scenarios elicited strong reactions from activists and rights advocates, who condemned the ongoing abuse that they perceived within Israeli detention facilities.
Ben-Gvir reportedly cautioned prisoners against any unrest during Ramadan and defended the changes that were instituted under his leadership during the visit. He declared that prisons had evolved into "real prisons and not hotels," a reference to the more stringent conditions that had been implemented since his election.
Reaction on Social Media
The videos rapidly acquired popularity on the internet, prompting a debate among human rights advocates and commentators. Numerous individuals contended that the footage did not reveal novel practices; rather, it underscored the systematic maltreatment that Palestinian detainees endure, which includes punitive measures, beatings, and deteriorating living conditions.
According to certain critics, the minister's presence within the prison indicated a hardline political posture that was intended to bolster his public image. Others emphasized the international community's inconsistent responses, observing that certain detainee cases receive increased global attention, while allegations of maltreatment against Palestinian prisoners receive less scrutiny.
Expanded Context
The incident occurred in the wake of the announcement of the death of detainee medic Hatem Rayan, who was purportedly apprehended at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza while conducting humanitarian work. The conditions within Israeli prisons were once again the subject of attention following his death.
International intervention and accountability have been advocated for by rights organizations. A report was published in January 2026 by the Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem, which alleged that there were pervasive abuses occurring in Israeli prisons and detention centers. The organization characterized the system as one that encompassed severe restrictions on detainees, medical neglect, and physical and psychological maltreatment.
According to the report, between October 2023 and December 2025, a minimum of 84 Palestinian prisoners perished while in custody. Other human rights organizations have provided figures that are more substantial. According to data from the Israeli prison authorities as of September 2025, over 10,800 Palestinians, including minors and women, were detained in Israeli prisons.
Activists continue to advocate for increased international supervision of prison conditions, particularly in anticipation of Ramadan, when concerns regarding restrictions and treatment frequently escalate, as tensions remain elevated.

Canadian Prime Minister and opposition leader join hands in poignant moment at mass shooting vigil
Mark Carney named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also ‘deserve to be mourned’

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The prime minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned.”
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure.”
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in — know that we will still be here,” Carney said.
A crowd of hundreds attended the vigil. Some held photos of loved ones they lost.
Carney said the community has always been defined by people caring for each other.
“And when the unimaginable happened on Tuesday, you were there again. First responders at the school within two minutes. Teachers shielding their children,” he said.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace.” Canada’s political leaders flew from Ottawa together.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said the students of the school won’t ever have to return to the building if they don’t want to.
“I will promise that not one of you will ever be forced to go back to that school. We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school,” Eby said.
Authorities on Thursday identified those killed at the school as Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit and Ticaria Lampert, all age 12, as well as 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield and assistant teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
McDonald said from the time the suspect encountered police there were no further injuries to students at the school.
Four guns were seized, two from the family home and two from the school, he said.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.
School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.

Jamaat-led bloc accepts Bangladesh polls outcome, will act as main opposition
Election Commission releases names of newly elected lawmakers, date of swearing-in yet to be announced
DHAKA, Bangladesh
Bangladesh's Jamaat-e-Islami party-led alliance on Saturday accepted the results of Thursday’s general election after claiming some irregularities in the ballot counting process.
In the election, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured 209 parliamentary seats, a two-thirds majority, while its close contender Jamaat won 68 seats.
The BNP-led alliance won 212 seats in total, whereas the Jamaat-led bloc won a total of 77 seats, with the remaining seats obtained by other parties and independent candidates.
Jamaat's chief Shafiqur Rahman said in a post on US social media platform Facebook early Saturday that his party and alliance accepted the overall election results.
“We recognize the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law,” he added.
We will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account while contributing constructively to national progress,” he noted.
He, however, alleged that some faced intimidation and harassment simply for exercising their democratic right.
Earlier, on Friday night, their alliance at a news conference alleged that there were some irregularities in the vote counting process as dozens of candidates won the competition in a tough competition and with a low margin.
One person was killed in post-election violence on Friday.
Meanwhile, interim government head Muhammad Yunus, in an official statement on Saturday, congratulated BNP chairperson Tarique Rahman on the landslide victory of his party under his leadership.
“This clear verdict of the people in the historic process of democratic transition will be a very important milestone in the country's constitutional and democratic continuity and institutional stability,” said Yunus.
Election Commission releases names of new MPs
Meanwhile, the Election Commission early Saturday published the official gazette notification, releasing the names of the newly elected lawmakers in 297 constituencies.
The voting in 299 of the 300-seat parliament was held on Thursday. The election in a constituency has been suspended due to the death of a candidate before the election.
More than 127.6 million people were eligible to cast ballots, and the country recorded a voter turnout of 59.44%, up from 41.8% in the January 2024 elections. Those polls were boycotted by the BNP-Jamaat opposition under ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government.
The date of the oath-taking ceremony, however, has not yet been announced by the government.
Earlier, law adviser Asif Nazrul said that due to the absence of the speaker or deputy speaker of the last parliament, the oath-taking ceremony of the new lawmakers will be administered by a "presidential nominee."
He also said that if no one takes the oath within three days of being elected, then the chief election commissioner can administer the oath.
The commission also officially published the referendum results on constitutional reforms. Votes in favor exceeded 60%, with a voter turnout of 59.44%.
Meanwhile, the EU Election Observation Mission vising Dhaka on Saturday at news conference termed Thursday's general elections as credible and a pivotal step toward restoring democracy and rule of law in Bangladesh.
“The electoral legal framework largely accords with international standards, while the Bangladesh Election Commission worked independently and transparently, maintaining stakeholders’ confidence and lending integrity to the polls,” Ivars Ijabs, a member of the European Parliament and the chief observer of the mission, said.

The Carmelitas street parade brought crowds into Santa Teresa on Friday, following a steep route beneath the Carmelite Convent of Santa Teresa overlooking Rio de Janeiro. Accompanied by samba bands, revellers moved uphill through the historic district, marking one of the first major street events of the carnival season.
Organisers scheduled a second, smaller procession for Saturday morning, aimed at local residents before larger blocos take over the city in the days ahead.
The Carmelitas group takes its name from the nearby Convento de Santa Teresa and a local tale of a nun who once slipped out to join the party. To help her blend in, dancers wear habits and march beside a giant doll dressed the same.
Started in the 1990s by locals inspired by gatherings at Parque das Ruínas, Carmelitas now draws thousands.

The US military said three suspected narco-terrorists were killed Friday when it carried out a strike in the Caribbean on a vessel allegedly tied to designated terror organizations and narcotics trafficking.
“On Feb. 13, at the direction of #SOUTHCOM commander Gen. Francis L. Donovan, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted a lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations,” US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) said on US social media company X.
It added that the intelligence confirmed the vessel was “transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.”
It said no US military forces were harmed in the operation.

Bulgaria’s Unemployment Hits Historic Low of 3.2% at Year-End 2025

Bulgaria closed 2025 with the unemployment rate hitting a historic low of 3.2 percent, according to the latest data from the National Statistical Institute. This marks a 0.6-point decline compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, when unemployment stood at 3.8 percent, and continues the steady downward trend from the start of the year, when the rate was near 4 percent.
While the number of job seekers fell sharply, the employment rate for the population aged 15–64 remained stable at 70.7 percent, unchanged from the previous year. Economic activity for the same age group, however, showed a slight dip to 73.1 percent, down 0.5 points from Q4 2024, suggesting a modest contraction in the overall labor force.
By the end of 2025, the total number of unemployed in Bulgaria was 95,700. Men accounted for a majority, with 53,800 unemployed, equating to a 3.4 percent rate, while women numbered 41,900, with an unemployment rate of 3 percent. These figures highlight the growing demand for workers in the economy and the challenges companies face in filling positions amid nearly full employment.

‘Carnage of concern and upset’: Women’s Institute groups close after transgender ban
Unknown

18:00:49 KST

At least 12 Women’s Institute (WI) groups are closing or considering closure after the organisation barred transgender women from membership.
Members say more groups are likely to close, and that the federation’s decision has opened up a toxic, traditionalist culture that will deter younger women from joining.
Branches said they felt forced to shut after the National Federation of Women’s Institutes (NFWI) confirmed that, from April, membership will be restricted to those registered female at birth. Several plan to relaunch as independent social groups.
The WI is one of the UK’s largest voluntary organisations, with thousands of local branches and about 180,000 members nationwide.
Emma Hawley, chair of Social Lites WI in Urmston, Greater Manchester – a group with nearly 140 members that has run for 13 years – said her entire committee has decided to step down.
“None of the other members want to take our places – many immediately said they weren’t even going to renew their membership,” she said.
“We’re all heartbroken. I’ve put 13 years into running this amazing group but I can’t, ethically or morally, be a member of something that excludes transgender women,” she said.
Seven Hills WI in Sheffield will also close after the current board decided to step down and no other members came forward.
Clementine Dexter, vice-president of Seven Hills WI, said the group received about 220 abusive online comments after posting that they were closing. “Out of 250 comments, there were just 30 that were supportive,” she said. “The rest were really abusive and awful.
“The NFWI’s decision has emboldened certain members to speak their minds and I think the federation has a serious issue as a result,” she said. “It’s going to struggle even more than it already does to attract younger members, and the more conservative members are going to be more emboldened to stick to what feels like a toxic culture.”
Dexter said she had met Melissa Green, NFWI chief executive. “We asked how this would be policed and were told that gender at birth would be included in the list of questions determining eligibility for membership,” she said. “Members have to reapply every year and that just feels really nasty. I can’t be a member of an organisation that does that.”
Even branches continuing under the new WI rules said they are facing practical fallout. Some have lost venues; others report speakers cancelling bookings.
Sophie Hossack, president of Ladies of the Lock WI in Kentish Town, London, said the venue they have used for nearly a decade has refused future bookings because of the policy.
“They said they did not feel comfortable renting their room to us because they are a trans-inclusive space,” she said.
Nora Salmon’s Hackney Wicked Women group – Hackney Wick’s WI – will also close next month. She said the NFWI’s decision had created “a carnage of concern and upset” and that groups had received little support.
“We were blindsided by their decision,” she said. “The lack of guidance and consultation has left us feeling betrayed. When we contacted them to say we’d lost members and were closing, the only response we got was, ‘We’re sorry to hear that’.”
The NFWI’s decision followed a 2025 UK supreme court judgment which held that the legal definition of a woman under the Equality Act 2010 refers to biological sex.
After reviewing the ruling, the NFWI announced it could no longer lawfully offer transgender women formal membership if it wished to continue operating as a women’s charity.
In its statement, the organisation said it was acting with “utmost regret and sadness”, adding it would create alternative “sisterhood groups” open to all. Approached for this article, the NFWI declined further comment.
Salmon said the move cut against the WI’s traditions. “The WI has alway been an incredibly grassroots organisation where every member has a say in how it’s run. But all that has been taken entirely out of our hands.”
Hawley agreed the decision ran counter to the WI’s prior ethos: “We pay our fees to be part of a collective but although we’ve asked for a consultation, that doesn’t seem to be planned,” she said.
For some branches, the implications of the ruling have actually worsened concerns rather than easing them.
Jules Mortimore of Wells Angels, a 125-member WI group in Tunbridge Wells that also plans to close, pointed out the ruling means transgender men could join WI groups.
“That is likely to be far more confronting and alarming for women than a trans woman,” she said.
“The fact that we also haven’t been contacted about this and given any guidance about what to tell our members or how to handle it suggests the WI just haven’t thought any of this through properly at all,” she added.
She said a WhatsApp network of about a dozen branches discussing closure is growing, with confusion and uncertainty driving increasing numbers of committees to consider leaving the NFWI.
Despite the upheaval, however, many departing members say they remain attached to the community spirit that defined their groups, and intend to preserve it outside the official structure.
“We’re going to reopen as an independent community group and we’re really positive about that,” said Mortimore.
For Hawley, the aim is continuity rather than rupture. “We’ve been through so much together and given each other so much support,” she said. “We just want to carry on doing that.”

Swiss becomes first woman to head chemical weapons body
Swiss ambassador Sabrina Dallafior will take the helm of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) as global tensions and technological developments threaten to undermine progress in eliminating stockpiles of chemical weapons.
After 25 years as a Swiss diplomat, Sabrina Dallafior is taking over as director-general of the OPCWExternal link in July, after more than a decade in which men, women and children from Syria to Ukraine and Britain to Malaysia have been increasingly targeted with often indiscriminate use of deadly toxins.
She will have to deal with risks of proliferation from rogue states and terror groups gaining access to technologies such as drones and artificial intelligence (AI).
That’s on top of weakening support for the international agencies that contained conflict after the Second World War as the United States, China and Russia jostle for global influence.
A previous three-year stint as ambassador to the UN-linked Conference on Disarmament in Geneva would provide essential experience for the job, the Swiss government said.
“Her selection from a pool of qualified candidates highlights Ambassador Dallafior’s merit, and her recognised expertise in arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation,” Jonas Montani, a foreign ministry spokesperson, told Swissinfo.

What was the chemical weapons agency set up to do?
The OPCW was created in 1997 to oversee implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, adopted in Paris four years earlier. It banned development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of chemical weapons.
The Convention has been ratified by 193 nations, with only North Korea, Egypt and South Sudan not signing, and Israel signing without ratifying, a requirement for the treaty to become legally binding.
The organisation, while not a United Nations agency, works closely with the UN and conducts round-the-clock inspections at weapons destruction sites, investigates suspected attacks and can send inspectors or experts to any signatory country.

The body was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 for helping eliminate stockpiles, partly because of its work during the Syrian civil war in which thousands of civilians have been killed in repeated attacks by its government, as well as by jihadist terrorists.

What’s the background of the new director general?
Born in the northern Swiss city of Basel, Dallafior studied Eastern European history and Russian studies before joining the diplomatic service in 2000.
Her career has taken her from the Swiss missions to the European Union and NATO military alliance in Brussels to senior roles in Bern focused on multilateral security policy. Before her latest appointment, she was Switzerland’s ambassador to Finland.
“I will accord the highest importance to upholding the norm against chemical weapons,” she said in the statementExternal link announcing her appointment, adding that its “long-term sustainability” must be ensured by investigating all credible allegations.
The appointment of Dallafior to the head of a major international organisation represents a success for Swiss diplomacy.
Filling such positions with Swiss politicians or diplomats is a strategic objective of the foreign ministry, aimed at safeguarding Swiss interests and enabling Switzerland to help shape international policy.
In addition, Switzerland is home to the Spiez Laboratory,External link a world-leading specialist institution that is part of the network of OPCW-designated laboratories.
What attacks has the agency worked on and what has it achieved?
Syria was the most prominent location of chemical weapons attacks during the 2010s as President Bashar al-Assad, supported by Russia, clung to power following so-called Arab Spring protests that spread across the Middle East and North Africa.
Even after Assad’s ousting in 2024, more than 100 chemical weapons sites were believed to remain in the country, much higher than prior estimates, the OPCW saidExternal link last year.
Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, both Moscow and Kyiv have repeatedly accused each other of using chemical weapons.
At Ukraine’s request, the OPCW provided technical and protective assistance and confirmed the use of banned chemical substances on the battlefield in reports released in 2024 and 2025.
The organisation has also been involved in probes into high-profile political poisonings, including the Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny with the nerve agent Novichok in 2020 and an attack on former spy Sergei SkripalExternal link and his daughter in the UK in 2018. Britain and independent investigators produced evidence of the involvement of Russian military intelligence in the assassination attempt, which Moscow denied.
After the Skripal case, and despite opposition from Russia, OPCW member countries agreed to expand the agency’s mandateExternal link to allow it to document responsibility for use of chemical weapons. Previously inspectors were only permitted to investigate suspected attacks, and identify toxins, without saying who carried them out.
Perhaps the organisation’s greatest success to date was its announcementExternal link in 2023 that it had verified the destruction of all the world’s “declared” chemical stockpiles, or those that member nations had admitted to holding.

How is the chemical weapons ban being undermined?
Despite such achievements, accusations remain that countries are still using banned substances against foreign enemies, as well as their own populations.
Authorities in Georgia used a First World War-era poison against protestors in the capital, Tbilisi, the BBC reportedExternal link in December, citing a peer-reviewed study accepted for publication by Toxicology Reports, an international journal.
The government of Iran is also among those accused of using toxins, according to a reportExternal link by the Chemical Weapons Convention Coalition, a network of NGOs that partnersExternal link with the OPCW to support treaty objectives.
The regime has used live munitions against mass protests in recent months, with state television saying more than 3,000 have died. Others estimate the figure at as much as ten times higherExternal link.
While Dallafior has stressed that protecting the norm against use of chemical weapons is her top priority, institutions such as Britain’s Ministry of DefenceExternal link and InterpolExternal link have warned that it is at risk of being eroded.
“The taboo against chemicals weapons use has been degraded in the past decade,” Natasha Hall, a senior associate for the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a researchExternal link report in October 2024 after interviewing US and allied government officials, members of the OPCW and other experts in the field. “Actors would likely choose a gradual approach to test the limits of international condemnation,” she said.
“Escalating tensions between the United States and Russia, coupled with fractures in the international community, challenge existing mechanisms for chemicals weapons control and accountability,” Hall added in the report for the Washington thinktank.
A further threat comes from the spread of advanced computing, drone technology and so-called dual-use chemicals that can be utilised for civilian or military purposes.
The OPCW’s current director-general, Fernando Arias, saidExternal link in November that the body was increasingly focused on how to ensure that technological advances reinforced rather than undermined its verification efforts and oversight of the weapons convention.
“Emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and the evolution of dual-use chemicals, are further complicating detection and enforcement,” said Jonas Montani at the Swiss foreign ministry. “All of this is taking place against a backdrop of growing geopolitical tensions, where trust between states is weakening and collective security mechanisms are being put to the test.”

‘Dehydrated’ Lidl worker sacked for drinking 17p bottle of water
Julian Oxborough worked at the supermarket for more than a decade and subsequently had his claim for unfair dismissal rejected by a tribunal
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
A Lidl employee was dismissed from his job after drinking a 17p bottle of water because he felt "dehydrated" while working at the checkout, an employment tribunal has heard.
Julian Oxborough, who had served Lidl for more than a decade at its Wincanton store, subsequently had his claim for unfair dismissal rejected by the tribunal.
The incident unfolded on 19 July 2024, when Mr Oxborough was serving a customer who wished to purchase a bottle of water taken from a multipack, which lacked a barcode. The customer exchanged it for a barcoded bottle, leaving the original at the till. Later that day, Mr Oxborough drank from the discarded bottle and used it to top up his own drink as he continued to serve customers.
The following day, a store manager discovered the bottle near the checkout and suspected a breach of company policy. A review of CCTV footage led to Mr Oxborough being invited to a meeting and suspended pending an investigation into allegations of gross misconduct.
During the inquiry, Mr Oxborough explained he was experiencing dehydration during his shift and was concerned about his health, noting he had made his personal squash drink too strong to consume. He stated he believed the multipack bottle could be written off, having observed single bottles of water in the canteen without receipts.
When questioned about payment, he admitted: "No, I think I may have forgot or can’t actually remember taking it." He further claimed he was in a rush at the end of his shift and forgot to have the item written off, asserting he had no intention of being dishonest, though he acknowledged it was wrong afterwards. Mr Oxborough described his subsequent dismissal as "a huge overreaction".
However, area manager Karina Moon, who oversaw the disciplinary process, told the hearing that Mr Oxborough had provided inconsistent explanations regarding his intent to purchase or write off the water. She also questioned why he had not opted for tap water instead. Ms Moon highlighted that Mr Oxborough had four days after the incident to come forward but failed to do so. She concluded that he was aware of the correct procedures and that there was no assurance his behaviour would not be repeated, leaving no suitable alternative to summary dismissal for gross misconduct.
At the tribunal, Mr Oxborough reiterated his lack of dishonest intent, attributing his actions to being tired, stressed, hot, thirsty, unwell, worried about contracting Covid from his partner, and in a hurry to catch a bus at the end of his shift.
An Employment Tribunal in Southampton later upheld Lidl’s decision, with Employment Judge Yallop dismissing Mr Oxborough’s claims, including unfair dismissal.
A spokesperson for Lidl commented: "We would never take the decision to dismiss a long-serving colleague lightly, and the tribunal has upheld that our actions were fair and followed a thorough process. As a retailer, maintaining a consistent zero-tolerance approach to the consumption of unpaid stock is essential to our operations and ensures that clear rules are followed by everyone across the business."

More than 1000 people charged in first year of domestic violence choking laws

More than 1000 people charged in first year of domestic violence choking laws
More than 1000 people were charged with non-fatal choking, strangling or suffocating their partners or family members in the year after landmark new offences were introduced in Victoria.
The data analysed by the Crime Statistics Agency paints a grim picture revealing more than 230 of those perpetrators were repeat offenders and some were charged more than five times in a year for choking or strangling their partner.
The first offence of strangulation in Victoria carries a five-year maximum sentence and does not require physical proof of injury.
New data from the Crime Statistics Agency shows that in the first 12 months of the law’s operation, between October 2024 and September last year, police charged 996 people with this crime.
A further breakdown of the data shows that in 166 cases, the perpetrator was a repeat offender and in the most extreme cases they were charged with this offence more than five times.
About 130 offenders were charged with this offence twice and 23 offenders were charged three times.
Seven offenders were charged with the crime more than five times.
The second, more serious, offence of non-fatal strangulation intentionally causing injury carries a maximum sentence of 10 years behind bars and requires more evidence to prove.
For this offence, 131 people were charged during the first year. A breakdown of those offenders shows 72 were repeat perpetrators and four were charged more than five times with choking their partners or family members.
In total, 1312 criminal charges of non-fatal strangulation were laid by police under the two new criminal offences, created to increase the rate of convictions against domestic violence abusers and take the onus off victim-survivors to prove they were choked unconscious.
The new offences came after sweeping reforms were announced by the state government following the murder of Victorian woman Joy Rowley, who was strangled to death by James Martin Mulhall at her home in Rye in 2011.
A subsequent coronial inquest heard police failed Rowley at least eight times after she sought help when Mulhall choked her to the point of unconsciousness in the months leading up to her murder.
The inquest identified the urgent need for new legislation in Victoria that directly addressed non-fatal strangulation in domestic violence cases.
Last year, this masthead revealed that since the non-fatal strangulation law came into effect in October 2024, 172 criminal charges of the new offences had been finalised and perpetrators sentenced in magistrates’ courts up to August. One charge of non-fatal strangulation was also finalised in the Children’s Court.
Melbourne University law professor Heather Douglas, a renowned family violence researcher who has been tracking how strangulation laws are working across Australia, said the sheer numbers of charges laid in Victoria was a positive sign.
“It is a very strong uptake given it is the first year of the laws, and shows that police are comfortable using it,” she said.
Douglas said that historically, perpetrators would be charged with offences such as assault or intentionally causing injury, but the new law more accurately reflected the seriousness of the crime, including the risk it posed of future homicide.
Mounting research suggests a person who survives non-fatal strangulation by a current or former partner was seven times more likely to be seriously injured or murdered by that person.
One study found the likelihood of homicide leapt by 800 per cent if their partner or former partner attempted to strangle them.
Douglas warned that securing convictions for the strangulation and choking charges remained difficult.
She said research indicated that in Queensland, for example, about half of strangulation charges fall over during the court process, often due to a lack of forensic evidence.
In a world first, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne is hoping to change this. A team of experts at the institute will soon begin using a dedicated, state government-funded MRI scanner to help police investigate internal injuries to gather forensic evidence for non-fatal strangulation victims
Professor Kate Fitz-Gibbon, an international research leader in the area of family violence at Monash University, said the criminal charges alone were not the full story.
“We need ongoing monitoring of how these matters progress through the courts, including sentencing outcomes and whether victim-survivors feel safer, are supported through the process and have access to the services needed to support them to recover from the abuse experience,” she said.
“These laws must be accompanied by sustained investment in early intervention and prevention efforts so that we are not only responding after harm has occurred, and we are working to reduce the prevalence of acts of non-fatal strangulation.”
Christine Mathieson, interim chief executive for Safe and Equal, Victoria’s peak body for specialist family violence services, said that while the number of charges laid in the first year of these laws was promising, charges do not necessarily result in convictions.
To curb the scourge of domestic abuse, Mathieson said the government must prioritise responses from all parts of the community and service system, including upskilling workforces such as frontline specialist family violence workers.
The roll-out of the laws came as experts warn the practice of strangulation during sex has become so widespread that more than half of Australian young people have used it.
Doctors and researchers warn that understanding of the dangers is so lacking that even those who consent to it are not aware of the grave risks, which include death within minutes, brain injury and stroke.

After two year of war, Palestinians scramble to salvage Gaza’s history

After two year of war, Palestinians scramble to salvage Gaza’s history
Palestinians fear destruction and damage to mosques, churches and archaeological sites threatens to erase centuries of history; recovery efforts face obstacles under ceasefire
Muneer Elbaz remembers the joy of visiting the Great Omari Mosque in Gaza with his family, praying at a site where people have worshipped over centuries as empires came and went.
“These were the best days,” Elbaz said, as he recalled promenading through the lively markets around the mosque before the Israel-Hamas war. “This place transports us from one era to another.”
Today, much of the mosque stands in ruins — like most of Gaza — after being hit by Israeli strikes in the two-year war muffled by an uncertain ceasefire. The sight of the rubble brings to mind “a tree that had been uprooted from the land,” said Elbaz, a Palestinian heritage consultant involved with recovery work at the site.
Gone too is some of the heritage of a land with a rich history going back to ancient times. The mosque was built on a site where a Byzantine church had stood, and changed hands and even religions as one invader followed another.
Israel’s military offensive in Gaza, launched in response to the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attacks that killed approximately 1,200 people and took 251 hostages, has killed over 72,000 Palestinians, according to the territory’s Hamas-run Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Israel Defense Forces believes the Hamas toll to be largely accurate, a senior Israeli military official said last month.
IDF officials have previously said that the combatant-to-civilian death ratio remained relatively the same throughout the war, with two to three civilians killed for every dead terror operative. Israel has said it seeks to minimize civilian fatalities and stresses that Hamas uses Gaza’s civilians as human shields, fighting from civilian areas, including homes, hospitals, schools, and mosques.
With major military operations halted, Palestinians are gaining a clearer picture of the destruction. Some organizations are trying to save what they can at historical sites, even as full-scale restoration — and the broader reconstruction of the territory — face major obstacles.
Dozens of sites were damaged
The UN cultural agency, UNESCO, in an ongoing assessment based on satellite images, says it has verified damage to at least 150 sites since the start of the war. They include 14 religious sites, 115 buildings of historical or artistic interest, nine monuments and eight archaeological sites.
“These sites were an important element that solidifies the presence of the Palestinian people on this land and that represents the continuity of their cultural identity,” said Issam Juha, co-director of the Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation, based in the West Bank.
“They want to erase the Palestinian identity and Palestinian heritage and … to remove any connection that keeps the Palestinian society clinging to this land,” he charged, referring to Israel.
The IDF has repeatedly accused Hamas of concealing military assets beneath or near heritage sites, as well as other civilian structures, including mosques, schools, and hospitals.
Hamas has fought from within hospitals and from tunnels under hospitals throughout the war, and periodically hid some of the hostages kidnapped from Israel on October 7, 2023, inside them, according to the IDF and the released hostages themselves.
International law generally prohibits targeting hospitals during wartime, but hospitals can lose this protection if they are used for military purposes.
The military has published evidence showing that the terror group maintained tunnels and command centers under major hospitals in the Strip. The group’s top commander, Mohammed Sinwar, was killed in a strike targeting a tunnel that runs under a hospital in southern Gaza.
Internal Hamas documents declassified by the IDF also show that the terror group has long exploited medical facilities in the territory for military purposes.
The Centre for Cultural Heritage Preservation is doing urgent rescue work at the badly damaged Pasha Palace, which housed centuries-old artifacts, many of which appear to have been looted, Juha said. Among the missing items are an Ottoman-era Quranic manuscript, jewelry from the medieval Mamluk era and a Roman-era sarcophagus from which only some fragments have been recovered, according to Hamouda al-Dohdar, an expert working at the site.
The Israeli military said it struck “a Hamas military compound and an anti-tank missile array” at the site. It said its forces struck a “terror tunnel” at the Omari mosque. It did not provide evidence in either case.
Amir Abu al-Omrain, an official with Gaza’s endowments ministry, part of the Hamas-run government, denied the allegation about the mosque.
UNESCO does not have a mandate to assign responsibility for the damage it assesses.
An independent commission established by the UN’s Human Rights Council said it was not aware of any evidence of a tunnel shaft in the mosque. Noting the Israeli allegations about the mosque, it said that even the presence of a “legitimate military objective … would not have justified the resulting damage.” Israel has previously accused the commission of widespread bias and antisemitism.
The centuries-old Saint Porphyrius Orthodox church complex, which had been sheltering displaced Palestinians, was also hit in an Israeli attack early in the war, causing deaths and injuries. The military said it had targeted a nearby Hamas command center. UNESCO said the church complex was moderately damaged.
Some of Gaza’s heritage sites appear to have been spared. UNESCO said it has found no evidence of damage at the Saint Hilarion Monastery, dating to the 4th century.
Under international law, cultural property should not be targeted or used for military purposes.
The Israeli military says it takes the sensitivity of cultural and religious sites into account, aims to minimize damage to civilian infrastructure and adheres to international law.
A rich history
Artifacts and accounts stretching back thousands of years testify to Gaza’s long history of commerce and conflict. Egypt’s pharaohs sent chariots through the low-lying coastal strip in their wars with the Hittites in modern-day Turkey. Traders in Gaza did brisk business with the ancient Greeks.
The Omari mosque, named for Islam’s second caliph, was initially built in the seventh century. Centuries later, the Crusaders converted it into a cathedral, and it went back to being a mosque after they were expelled, said Stephennie Mulder, associate professor of Islamic art at the University of Texas at Austin.
The mosque was damaged during World War I, when the British shelled Gaza in their campaign against the Ottoman Turks, and was later rebuilt.
“The building itself told the story of Gaza’s past as a crossroads of trade, armies, empires, and religious traditions,” said Mulder. “For many Gazans, the Omari mosque stood as a beloved symbol of multiplicity, resilience and persistence.”
More than stones
Mohammad Shareef, 62, remembers attending prayers at the mosque with his father when he was a child, and studying for exams in its quiet confines. Years later, he would bring his own children there. He wept when it was hit.
“We were raised in it and around it, and there’s no stone here that we haven’t stepped on,” he said. “For the people of Gaza, this is their history.”
The loss will feel particularly acute during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which begins later this month. Before the war, thousands converged on the mosque for Ramadan prayers amid a festive atmosphere. This year, a large tented structure has been erected.
In recent days, workers have been filling wheelbarrows in the shadow of a damaged minaret.
Hosni Almazloum, an engineer working at the site, said the mosque’s prayer hall ceiling had collapsed and columns had crumbled. He said it could be rebuilt, if construction supplies are allowed in. For now, teams have been focused on recovery and preventing further damage, sifting through and storing stones.
The US-brokered ceasefire agreement, which halted most of the fighting in October, gives no timeline for Gaza’s reconstruction, which may prove impossible if Israel and Egypt maintain the blockade imposed on the territory when Hamas seized power in 2007 from the Palestinian Authority.
Many historic sites suffered from neglect before the war. The blockade and previous Israel-Hamas wars, along with a lack of resources and urban sprawl, posed challenges. Hamas-run authorities have leveled parts of what archaeologists believe was a Bronze Age settlement to make way for construction projects.
Elbaz says that before the ceasefire, grief was a luxury he couldn’t afford — his family was just trying to survive.
“What would you begin to cry over?” he asked. “The historic mosques or your home or your history or your children’s schools or the streets?”
Now, as he processes the war’s toll, he sometimes weeps, away from the eyes of his children.
“Gaza is our mother,” he said. “We have memories everywhere — in this tree, this flower, this garden and this mosque. Yes, we cry over every part of Gaza.”

EU to provide Ukraine with €90 billion after IMF programme approval
The provision of €90 billion to Ukraine by the EU is linked to the approval of a new four-year IMF programme, which is expected in February.
Source: Ukraine's Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko, while speaking to journalists, as reported by Ukrinform
Quote from Svyrydenko: "The International Monetary Fund plans to consider the next programme of support for Ukraine by the end of February. This decision will determine whether we receive €90 billion in assistance from the European Union in April, as planned."
Details: However, Svyrydenko expressed confidence in a positive decision on Ukraine by the IMF.
As for the EU loan, it is intended for 2026-2027.
"This year we expect €60 billion, of which €15 billion should go to budget support and €45 billion to the procurement of weapons and equipment. Next year the distribution will be €15 billion and €15 billion," Svyrydenko said.
She added that Finance Minister Serhii Marchenko and Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov are currently preparing monthly estimates of Ukraine's financial needs in order to agree the tranches.
After these calculations are finalised, they will be submitted to partners, allowing financing to begin as early as April.
Background:
- Earlier, Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko stated during a question-and-answer session with the government that the Cabinet of Ministers will not submit a bill in February to introduce VAT for sole proprietors.
- It was also reported that the Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund may approve a new four-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme for Ukraine in February, but this will depend primarily on Ukraine fulfilling agreed prior actions.
- After meeting with IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, Ukraine's Prime Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said the discussion focused on preparations for approving the next IMF support programme, which is crucial for maintaining Ukraine's macro-financial stability.

Zelenskyy says questions remain for allies over security guarantees for Ukraine
Zelenskyy says questions remain for allies over security guarantees for Ukraine
KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy thanked his international allies for their support but suggested there was still questions remaining over the future security guarantees for his country.
Speaking at the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Zelenskyy repeatedly thanked American and European allies for helping Ukraine by providing air defense systems that protect infrastructure like power plants and “save lives.”
Previous U.S.-led efforts to find consensus on ending the war, most recently two rounds of talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, have failed to resolve difficult issues, such as the future of Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland that is largely occupied by Russian forces.
Later with reporters, Zelenskyy questioned how the concept of a free trade zone — proposed by the U.S. — would work in the Donbas region which Russia insists Kyiv must give up in order to get peace.
He also said the Americans want peace as quickly as possible and that U.S. team wants to sign all the agreements on Ukraine at the same time whereas Ukraine wants guarantees over the country’s future security signed first.
European nations, including the U.K. and France, have already said they will commit troops to Ukraine to guarantee its future security. The U.S. is also expected to be involved and discussions are currently ongoing about the nature of America’s support.
Russian officials are opposed to any foreign troop presence in Ukraine, Zelenskyy suggested, because Russian President Vladimir Putin wants to have the opportunity to attack Ukraine again.
Zelenskyy also said he was surprised that Moscow had replaced the head of its negotiating team before another round of U.S.-brokered talks and suggested the move was deliberately aimed at delaying negotiations.
The talks take place against a backdrop of continued fighting along the roughly 1,250-kilometer (750-mile) front line, relentless Russian bombardment of civilian areas of Ukraine and the country’s power grid, and Kyiv’s almost daily long-range drone attacks on war-related assets on Russian soil.
During negotiations, Russian officials have insisted Ukraine give up more territory in the east of the country to end the war. But Zelenskyy told The Associated Press that it was “a little bit crazy” to suggest Ukraine withdraw from its own territory or exchange it.
Thousands of Ukrainians have been killed defending the country’s Donbas region, he said, pointing out that 200,000 people also live there and it would not be acceptable to effectively hand them over to Russia.
Zelenskyy also questioned how the concept of a free economic zone would work.
“Imagine,” he said, if foreign soldiers patrolled the zone and Putin provoked them and they left. In that case, he said, there could be a “big occupation” of Ukraine and a lot of losses.
If Putin is given any opportunity for victory “we don’t know what he will do next,” Zelenskyy said.
Such a model, Zelenskyy told the AP, would have “big risks” for Ukraine and for any country which committed to guaranteeing Ukraine’s security. But he said he was ready to discuss it as it could be important as a compromise in exchange for securing support to reconstruct Ukraine.
During negotiations, Moscow has to accept monitoring of a ceasefire and return some 7,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war in exchange for more than 4,000 Russian prisoners held by Ukraine, Zelenskyy said.
Earlier on Saturday, drone strikes killed one person in Ukraine and another in Russia, Ukrainian officials said, ahead of fresh talks next week in Geneva aimed at ending the war.
An elderly woman died when a Russian drone hit a residential building in the Black Sea port city of Odesa, Ukraine’s State Emergency Service said.
In Russia, a civilian was killed in a Ukrainian drone strike on a car in the border region of Bryansk, regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz said.
Russia-installed authorities said a Ukrainian airstrike on a village Saturday wounded 15 people in Ukraine’s partially occupied Luhansk region.
The attacks came a day after a Ukrainian missile strike on the Russian border city of Belgorod killed two people and wounded five, according to regional Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov.

Rubio’s speech to European allies takes a softer tone but sticks to Trump’s firm stance
Rubio’s speech to European allies takes a softer tone but sticks to Trump’s firm stance
MUNICH (AP) — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio offered a reassuring message to America’s allies on Saturday, striking a less aggressive but still firm tone about the administration’s intent to reshape the trans-Atlantic alliance and push its priorities after more than a year of President Donald Trump’s often-hostile rhetoric toward traditional allies.
Reminding his audience at the annual Munich Security Conference about America’s centuries-long roots in Europe, Rubio said the United States would remain forever tied to the continent even as it pushes for changes in the relationship and the institutions that have been the bulwark of the post-World War II world order.
Rubio addressed the conference a year after Vice President JD Vance stunned the same audience with a harsh critique of European values. A series of Trump administration statements and moves targeting allies followed, including Trump’s short-lived threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a bid to secure U.S. control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark.
On Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz had opened this year’s gathering by calling for the U.S. and Europe to “repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together,” saying that even the U.S. isn’t powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order no longer exists. But he and other European officials made clear that they will stand by their values, including their approach to free speech, climate change and free trade.
‘A child of Europe’
While offering a calmer and more reassuring tone, Rubio made clear that the Trump administration is sticking to its guns on policy. He denounced “a climate cult” and “an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies.”
Rubio argued that the “euphoria” of the Western victory in the Cold War led to a “dangerous delusion that we had entered ‘the end of history,’ that every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood ... and that we would now live in a world without borders where everyone became a citizen of the world.”
“We made these mistakes together and now together we owe it to our people to face those facts and to move forward to rebuild,” Rubio said.
“This is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel,” he said. “This is why President Trump demands seriousness and reciprocity from our friends here in Europe.”
Rubio said that an end of the trans-Atlantic era “is neither our goal nor our wish,” adding that “our home may be in the Western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
He acknowledged that “we have bled and died side-by-side on battlefields from Kapyong to Kandahar,” a contrast with disparaging remarks by Trump about NATO allies’ troops in Afghanistan that drew an outcry. “And I’m here today to make it clear that America is charting the path for a new century of prosperity. and that once again, we want to do it together with you, our cherished allies and our oldest friends.”
U.S. officials accompanying Rubio said his message was much the same as Vance’s last year but was intended to have a softer landing on the audience, which they acknowledged had recoiled at much of Trump’s rhetoric over the past year.
Europeans reassured but not complacent
The president of the European Union’s executive commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Rubio’s speech was “very reassuring” but noted that “in the administration, some have a harsher tone on these topics.”
In her speech to the conference, she stressed that “Europe must become more independent,” including on defense. She insisted on Europe’s “digital sovereignty” — its approach to hate speech on social media.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that “we shouldn’t get in the warm bath of complacency. He said the U.K. must reforge closer ties with Europe to help the continent “stand on our own two feet” in its own defense, and said there needs to be investment that “moves us from overdependence to interdependence.”
Hanno Pevkur, the defense minister of EU and NATO member Estonia, said it was “quite a bold statement to say that America is ‘a child of Europe’.”
“It was a good speech, needed here today, but that doesn’t mean that we can rest on pillows now,” he told The Associated Press. “So still a lot of work has to be done.”
Rubio didn’t mention Greenland. After last month’s escalation over Trump’s designs on the Arctic island, the U.S., Denmark and Greenland started technical talks on an Arctic security deal.
The Secretary of State met briefly in Munich on Friday with the Danish and Greenlandic leaders, a meeting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen described as constructive.
But Frederiksen suggested Saturday that although the dispute has cooled, she remains wary. Asked whether the crisis has passed, she replied: “No, unfortunately not. I think the desire from the U.S. president is exactly the same. He is very serious about this theme.”
Asked whether she can put a price on Greenland, she responded “of course not,” adding that “we have to respect sovereign states ... and we have to respect people’s right for self-determination. And the Greenlandic people have been very clear, they don’t want to become Americans.”

‘My ketamine addiction got me locked up in Japan – it isn’t the innocent party drug people think it is’
Izabel Rose said her five-month detention abroad was ‘traumatic’ but helped her overcome a dangerous ketamine addiction. She told Nicole Wootton-Cane she doesn’t want others to make the same mistakes she did

In the early hours of April 12 last year, nine Japanese police officers quietly gathered outside a hotel room in Osaka. Inside and oblivious, 26-year-old Briton Izabel Rose was suffering the effects of a nasty hangover following a night out. Eventually, in need of the communal bathroom, Ms Rose opened the door – and the officers descended.
Days prior, Ms Rose had messaged a friend in the UK asking them to send her the class B drug ketamine. She had left London at the start of the month in the depths of her addiction to the drug, and hoped her travels would be an opportunity for her to get away from her usual environment.
But almost as soon as she arrived, she found herself trying to source the illegal substance. Eventually, unable to find it elsewhere, she paid the friend £150 for 7g (0.25oz) of ketamine, which was sent to her in the post, concealed inside a birthday card. But the package was intercepted at the border, and shortly after, Ms Rose was arrested in her hotel room.
It was the start of what would become a five-month stint in a Japanese detention centre after she admitted to the importation of drugs.
Speaking to The Independent, she said the experience is “the most traumatic thing that ever happened to me”, but she is sharing her story in hopes of raising awareness of what she called a “crisis” of ketamine addiction.
‘A slippery slope’
Ms Rose first remembers being introduced to ketamine at university. She said she didn’t actually enjoy the drug the first time she took it, as it made her unwell, but it quickly became a frequent part of her life after moving in with a friend who was a “regular” user.
She said she went from using the drug occasionally as part of the London rave scene to daily within a matter of months, describing how, eventually, the housemates would often take ketamine while watching a film on weekday evenings.
“That turned into me buying my own, and then that turned into me using on my own,” she said.
“My usage went from partying to daily very quickly, and it was a very slippery slope.”
Her body also began to suffer the consequences of her ketamine use. She began to get abdominal cramps known as “K cramps”, which even drove her to visit A&E.
She had begun to recognise she was going down a “dark path” but said she was “in denial” over her addiction.
“I wanted to stop, and I couldn't stop,” she said.
In April 2025, she decided to take a trip to Japan – somewhere she had always wanted to travel – in the hope that time away from London would also help her get away from the temptation of taking the drug.
‘My intention was never to import’
But before she had even passed through customs in Japan, Ms Rose said she was on her phone trying to source drugs.
“Addiction doesn't understand geography, and the voice in my head took over, and within half an hour of landing,” she confessed.
She messaged a friend who she believed may be able to find her a dealer on the ground, saying her “intention was never to import”. Instead, the friend suggested they mail her the ketamine in the post.
“Right there and then, I decided to send them the money,” she said. “The next day, they had gone to the post office and put the ketamine in a birthday card and sent it to me in the post.”
A week later, Ms Rose was arrested at her hotel in Osaka.
‘My life flashed in front of my eyes’
Ms Rose said she initially “naively” believed she might be able to talk her way out of trouble.
Despite Japan’s strict drug laws, she had also purchased marijuana while in the country and decided to hand this over to investigators in the hopes it would placate them.
“They very quickly said, well, that's not why we're here – my stomach dropped and my life flashed before my eyes.”
Over the next few days, she was questioned by investigators, who had seized her phone. After meeting with a lawyer, she decided to admit to importing ketamine into the country.
Ms Rose was then taken to Osaka Detention Centre, where she stayed for five months.
‘It’s the most traumatic thing that ever happened to me’
She described the first two months of her detention as the hardest as she grappled with withdrawing from ketamine alongside coming to terms with her situation.
“There were moments where I was crying and so emotional,” she said. “Ketamine numbs your feelings so much that when you come off it, they all come rushing back.”
She added that the experience was “very lonely and isolated”, with most of her days spent alone with her thoughts.
But despite these challenges, Ms Rose said she was able to use the experience to form a routine of exercise, meditation, reading about addiction, and journaling.
“At first it was hard, it was a shock to the system, but having no phone and just time to reflect and journal really was beneficial for me,” she said.
After five isolated months spent almost exclusively in her small cell, Ms Rose was given a suspended sentence, meaning she could go free but would be locked up again if she committed any offence in Japan.
‘This is a crisis’
Ms Rose is now back in the UK and in recovery.
She is bravely sharing her story on TikTok on her account to raise awareness of the dangers of ketamine addiction.
“I think there's such a stigma on what an addict looks like, but they are just normal people,” she said. “Ketamine addiction is a real crisis and we need to look at helping people in the best way possible.”
Recent government data published in December 2025 found the number of children aged 17 and under reporting problems with ketamine had doubled between 2021 and 2024. For under 17s in treatment, ketamine is the fourth most-used drug after cannabis, alcohol and nicotine.
Grace Willsher, head of young people’s services in the north at drug and alcohol support charity WithYou, said the number of young people being supported for ketamine use across its services has more than doubled in the past five years.
She told The Independent the charity is “concerned that the risks associated with ketamine aren’t well understood”, adding its easy availability and low cost mean many see it as a “party drug” and an alternative to alcohol.
But she warned that in a “very short period of time”, ketamine can cause “permanent damage” to the body.
“This includes really horrible effects like bladder problems, changes in mental health, and memory, and damage to your nose, liver and kidneys,” she said.
WithYou aims to encourage young people to seek early advice and support around drug and alcohol use, helping to prevent harm before problems escalate.
Ms Willsher encouraged anyone worried about themselves or someone they know to reach out for support.

‘Police got my son’s ethnicity wrong twice – I blame them for why he’s still missing seven years later’

‘Police got my son’s ethnicity wrong twice – I blame them for why he’s still missing seven years later’
‘I used to have to go down to the police station every single day about my son, crying.’ Parents open up to Tara Cobham about trauma of not feeling listened to by police
- Bookmark
The worst thing a parent can go through had already happened to Christine Durand. Her son Steven was missing, and she had no idea if he was even alive.
But what the mother, who is now 70, didn’t realise was that things were about to get worse over the coming months and years.
“I just feel like they’ve not cared at all, like I've been left on the shelf,” she told The Independent. “I used to have to go down to the police station every single day about my son, crying. They let me down on many occasions.”
Steven, then aged 31, was meant to be travelling from his sister’s flat to his home in Preston on 19 October 2018, the day he disappeared. He had lost his phone, so all he had on him was his bus fare.
After Ms Durand reported Steven as missing, Lancashire Constabulary put out public appeals for the 31-year-old, whom Ms Durand said was known to officers as he suffered from mental health issues. But they misidentified his ethnicity twice by describing him as white when he is mixed race.
“Everything I asked the police to do, they did the opposite,” Ms Durand said, citing moments such as the police breaking down the door of Steven’s flat when she had told them she had a spare key.
“I think the police are racist – I think they didn’t care about my son because he was mixed race.”
The retiree, from Leyland, believes that her son, “The kindest person you could meet,” could have been found if the police had handled the investigation better.
A lower proportion of missing Black (31 per cent) and Asian (35 per cent) people are found by police compared to white (39 per cent) people, according to research by charity Missing People.
The report also found that Black and Asian children are more likely to be missing for longer periods of time than white children. One in five of all missing incidents related to Black children were for longer than 48 hours, compared to 14 per cent for Asian and 13 per cent for white.
Missing People has now launched its new SafeCall service, a national lifeline designed to support the 72,000 children who go missing in the UK every year. The Independent reached its £165,000 fundraising target last month, enabling the creation of the free, confidential, round-the-clock service.
Evidence Joel’s experience echoes that of Ms Durand.
Ms Joel’s son Richard Okorogheye, then aged 19, went missing from Ladbroke Grove, London, on 22 March 2021. Ms Joel, 43, said she reported Richard, who had sickle cell syndrome, as missing to police the following day, telling them he was away from home without his medication.
But the 43-year-old claimed officers did not treat her concerns with urgency and described the investigation as a “disaster”, alleging she was told, “Don’t worry, he’ll come back home,” and even, “If you can’t find your son, how do you expect us to?”
Richard was found dead in Epping Forest, London, on 5 April 2021.
Ms Joel believes her son might have been found alive if the investigation had been handled properly. “I felt the whole thing was governed by discrimination and racism,” the nurse said. “Every day I have to go through this agony in my heart knowing something maybe could’ve been done, but nothing was done. I remember having sleepless nights, walking barefoot from my house to Ladbroke Grove police station, crying, begging them to look for my child.”
The Metropolitan Police did apologise to Ms Joel for providing a level of service “not at a level the public would expect of us”, but it did not acknowledge any discriminatory treatment. An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation identified several failures by police and described the level of service that Ms Joel received as “unacceptable”, but it found that “the evidence did not indicate that any delay in upgrading Richard’s risk level was due to his or Ms Joel’s race”.
In Ms Durand’s case, she made a complaint and an internal investigation by Lancashire Constabulary found there was “insufficient evidence” that Steven had been discriminated against on the basis of his race or mental health. The force declined to comment on this.
The force also disputed her claims about the door being broken down, but the IOPC upheld Ms Durand’s allegation after a review of her complaint. It added the constabulary apologised for misidentifying his ethnicity.
Josie Allan, head of policy and partnerships at Missing People, said the charity has heard from multiple families who have felt discriminated against because of their race.
Explaining why investigations might be coming to competing conclusions, she said “underlying systemic bias” will be affecting police responses, but its “insidious” nature makes it difficult to pinpoint.
“There are inherent issues in being able to identify discrimination in the complaints process,” she said. “We know that data shows there are disparities for Black missing people, so there’s a gap between the evidence about the disparities and the acknowledgement of them... The data and the sheer amount of families who are raising concerns should be raising very serious concerns within policing that there is a pattern.”
She noted the IOPC has recently revised its guidance in efforts to improve the “problematic” handling of discrimination complaints.
In 2021, the Home Affairs Select Committee’s ‘Macpherson: 20 Years on Inquiry’ suggested police services had largely failed to overcome issues and perceptions of institutional racism following the initial inquiry into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which found consistent evidence of the “over-policing” and “under-protection” of Black, Asian and minority ethnic communities.
Speaking of Steven’s case, a spokesperson for Lancashire Constabulary said: “We’ve carried out extensive enquiries in relation to CCTV, telephony, searches of open land and waterways, enquiries with associates, witnesses, health agencies and financial checks and numerous media appeals, prior to the decision to archive the investigation.”
The force said that “difficult” decisions such as archiving a case sometimes have to be made, but “any new information will be fully investigated”.
A Met Police spokesperson said: “When Richard went missing in 2021, hundreds of officers worked tirelessly over 15 days as part of the extensive search, which also included specialist search teams, dogs and horses and colleagues from Essex Police before his body was sadly found.”
They said the force accepted all of the IOPC’s recommendations from its 2022 investigation, and “have made a significant number of changes to the way we respond from the moment a person is reported missing”.
“This includes putting more emphasis on engaging with the person who reports someone missing, so we can better understand the risks they face,” they added.

Gisele Pelicot ‘overwhelmed’ by personal letter of support from Queen
The Queen commended the rape survivor’s ‘extraordinary dignity and courage’

French rape survivor Gisele Pelicot has said she is “overwhelmed” after receiving a personal letter of support from Queen Camilla following her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot’s conviction.
The Queen, a longtime campaigner against domestic violence and sexual abuse, commended Ms Pelicot’s “extraordinary dignity and courage” in the correspondence.
Ms Pelicot’s former husband was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drugging and raping her, and for allowing other men to assault her while she was unconscious. The horrific abuse spanned nearly a decade.
He had recruited other men in an online chatroom to rape her while she was unconscious; following a trial that took place in Avignon, 47 of them were found guilty of rape, two were found guilty of attempted rape, and two were found guilty of sexual assault. They were jailed for a total of 428 years.
Extracts from Ms Pelicot’s book, A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides, written with journalist Judith Perrignon and published by French newspaper Le Monde, explain how her then husband was summoned by police after a supermarket security guard caught him secretly filming up women’s skirts.
The 73-year-old bravely waived her right to anonymity, asserting that the shame should fall on her abusers, not on her.
In the letter, Queen Camilla told Ms Pelicot: “I very much wanted to write to express my heartfelt admiration for the courage, grace and dignity with which you have faced the horrific crimes committed against you.”
Speaking to the BBC’s Newsnight, Ms Pelicot described the letter as an “honour”, adding: “I was overwhelmed that the Queen could send me this letter. Although my words touched the whole world, I wasn’t expecting a letter from the Court of England. I felt moved and very honoured that she had become aware of what had happened to me. I am grateful to her.”
Camilla has dedicated her royal charity work to supporting victims of sexual assault. Last year, she praised the “brilliant” efforts of health workers and staff at a specialist centre in Exeter, which she officially opened.
The Queen has previously championed the idea of providing free toiletries to those who have been attacked, an initiative that has recently been revived. In an ITV documentary, she vowed to “keep trying” to end domestic violence “until I am able to no more”.
Rape Crisis offers support for those affected by rape and sexual abuse.

Bulgaria’s Q4 GDP Growth Slows to 2.9 Percent Amid Rising Imports

In the final quarter of 2025, Bulgaria’s economy showed signs of slowing, with gross domestic product (GDP) rising by 2.9 percent year-on-year, down from 3.1 percent in the same period of 2024. Seasonally adjusted data from the National Statistical Institute (NSI) also indicate that GDP growth on a quarterly basis reached 0.8 percent in Q3 2025, matching the previous year’s figure. Early in 2025, GDP had expanded by 3.1 percent year-on-year in Q1, with a quarterly rise of 0.6 percent.
Examining annual changes, gross value added in Q4 2025 grew by 2 percent. Household final consumption rose 7.2 percent, while gross fixed capital formation expanded by 10.1 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. In contrast, exports of goods and services declined slightly by 0.1 percent, and imports climbed 9.5 percent, contributing to a negative foreign trade balance.
Quarterly figures show that gross value added increased by 0.4 percent in Q4. The NSI’s preliminary estimates attribute this growth to a 2.1 percent rise in gross fixed capital formation and a 1.3 percent increase in final consumption compared to the previous quarter.
Measured in current prices, Bulgaria’s GDP for Q4 2025 reached 65.352 billion leva (around 33.4 billion euros), while gross value added totaled 56.589 billion leva (28.9 billion euros). Final consumption remains the largest component of GDP, accounting for 81.4 percent, while gross capital formation represents 24.7 percent. The data underline that although domestic demand continues to drive growth, slowing exports and rising imports are weighing on the overall economic expansion.

On February 13, Kim Jong Un visited the construction site of the Memorial Hall of Military Feats in Foreign Military Operations.
This was reported by the publication Rodong Sinmun.
The North Korean dictator personally inspected the progress of the work, examined the sculptural panels, and gave instructions on the final design of the facility. The authorities involved units of the Korean People’s Army in the construction.
Pyongyang began actively transferring its units to Russia in October 2024. Initially, special forces of the 11th Corps of the Korean People’s Army, known as the ‘Storm Corps’ trained at training grounds in the Far East.
North Korea officially confirmed the deployment of its armed forces on April 28, 2025, citing the strategic partnership agreement with the Russian Federation.
According to South Korean and Western intelligence, the total number of North Korean troops in Russia has reached 15,000. Most of the forces are stationed in the Kursk region.
As of February 2026, North Korean troop losses in killed and wounded amount to approximately 6,000. Most of the soldiers were killed during counteroffensives in the Kursk region.

Writing for survival: Gaza author dares to hope against the odds

Writing for survival: Gaza author dares to hope against the odds
Palestinian author Safaa Al-Nabaheen has kept working in Gaza through Israeli attacks, the loss of loved ones and food shortages. She has won fellowships, residencies and admission in Western universities. But the bureaucracy of occupation keeps her tied, against her will, in the besieged enclave. And the lessons she taught in creative workshops are proving to be a challenge.
It started out small, very small, in a vacant lot next to her house in Al-Zawayda, a once sleepy, agricultural town not far from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. That’s where Palestinian author Safaa Al-Nabaheen decided to hold a workshop for children to help them build stories, dream, and let their imaginations soar above the death and destruction around them.
In early 2024, just months after Israel launched its latest war following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Gaza’s population was already on the move. The Israeli army had started issuing evacuation orders, sparking a process that would displace 1.9 million out of Gaza’s 2.2 million population by the end of the year.
Towns and cities in central and southern Gaza were starting to flood with refugees from the north, the death toll was rising and as despair spiralled with every bombardment, Nabaheen came up with an idea.
“As a writer and novelist, I could offer training workshops for children and adolescents on the art of short-story writing, teaching them how to channel their inner worlds through narrative,” said the 31-year-old Palestinian author.
But when she started to put her plan into action, she had a revelation. “In my first session with them, I discovered that some of them had aged 20 years,” she recounted. “When I asked a child about his childhood or his dreams, his only answer was that his concern today was filling water containers, gathering firewood for his mother to cook whatever food was left, and praying it wouldn’t rain so their tents wouldn't drown.”
Not one to give up, Nabaheen persevered with her programme – and gradually, the kids started to respond. “It was a very simple beginning; our gatherings cost nothing more than my voice, some ideas for entertainment, and inventing new games for them. It was a very small tent at the edge of the land, where children sat on mats with a mountain of hope in their hearts,” she explained.
More than a year later, Nabaheen is confronting her own “mountain”, but it’s of despair, not hope. On October 13, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire at a summit in Egypt attended by leaders from around 30 countries. Against a banner proclaiming, “Peace in the Middle East”, the US president signed “The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity” and called it “a tremendous day for peace in the Middle East”.
Last month, US special envoy Steve Witkoff announced the start of the second phase of the ceasefire deal. But while emergency supplies have kept famine at bay in Gaza, the death toll from Israeli fire keeps mounting. Earlier this week, the Gaza health ministry said 586 Palestinians were killed since the start of the ceasefire, bringing the war’s cumulative toll to more than 72,000.
For Nabaheen, the ceasefire has changed nothing. “It is a lie. In reality, the war has not stopped. It has only stopped in the media to quiet public opinion,” she maintained. “The [Israeli] strikes continue. We are living in an unprecedented state of chaos. There has been a slight breakthrough regarding food and water, but the general situation remains dire.”

Israel still does not allow foreign journalists independent access into Gaza. Communication with the outside world remains a challenge with frequent internet cuts. FRANCE 24’s interviews with Nabaheen were conducted via emails, messages and calls. During one interview on a messaging app, a massive blast went off seemingly close to her bedroom. Nabaheen flinched momentarily, looked toward the window and insisted on continuing.
The drive to get her story – and herself – out of Gaza keeps her going these days. But with every mountain of hardship, river of loss and valley of despair, the journey just keeps getting harder. From bombardments to bureaucracy, the challenges have at times seemed insurmountable. Through it all, she has kept working – and writing for survival.
Expanding networks outside, a loss at home
From a “simple” start in early 2024, Nabaheen’s workshops, which she called The Creative Refuge Project, began to grow, attracting more children as Gaza’s schools remained close.
“In the beginning, the sessions focused on psychological support and recreation. Then, I began integrating them into the world of dreams – teaching them how to express everything they feel through writing. I started implementing small activities, such as performing a radio news broadcast, a short theatrical play, reading folk stories that inspire expression, or forming a choir for our old Palestinian songs. I then started announcing my small camp via Facebook,” she said.
As the project grew, Nabaheen started looking for sponsors and applying for international funding. She was managing the project alone and needed help, which was difficult to secure since the war was at its peak.
Then tragedy struck her family.
Her brother, Mohammed, was killed on July 13, 2024, in an Israeli drone strike while collecting wood outdoors.
“Losing my brother was not easy,” said Nabaheen, using an understatement to keep her emotions in check. “I tried to keep myself busy at the time, doing my university studies despite the impossible circumstances, via the internet – which was rarely available.”
Horror from the sea
After halting The Creative Refuge Project for six months following Mohammed’s death, things started picking up again. The Goethe-Institut, a German NGO, had expressed interest in funding her little programme, and Nabaheen was busy doing the paperwork to make it happen.
By September 2024, the carnage in Gaza was unfolding at a ferocious pace, with the death toll surging past 40,000. Daily headlines noted Israeli attacks in Khan Younis, Gaza City, Rafah, Deir al-Balah, Mawasi, Jabaliya … names of cities, towns and camps that would become familiar to international audiences.
But the outside world back then was still unaware of the extent of Israel’s use of quadcopters and drones to spy and kill in every corner of the besieged enclave. Gazans though did not have that luxury.
On September 15, 2024, the horror came home from the sea for Nabaheen.
That night, her second brother, Saeb, had gone fishing. A father of three young children, Saeb had ignored the family’s warning that “the sea is dangerous”.
The UN would confirm their prognosis the next year, when a report noted that Israel’s “systematic” attacks had killed 200 civilian fishers as of December 2024. They were targeted “generally without warning, while fishing using paddling boats posing no discernible threats” to the Israeli Naval Forces, the UN concluded.
Despite the family’s pleas, Saeb took to “the dangerous sea” in a desperate bid to provide for his kids as the economic situation deteriorated, prices soared and food stocks plummeted.
While he was fishing, an Israeli quadcopter spotted and pursued Saeb, explained his sister. “It chased him in the water, and as he tried to swim away, it fired bullets everywhere into his body. He tried to flee,” she said, adding that the quadcopter continued to follow Saeb as he ran to the shore and then headed towards a main street. “People were shouting to him that his death was inevitable and to recite the Shahada [the Islamic creed], as they saw his blood gushing from every part of him. Then, another aircraft pursued him and targeted his head with a projectile. He fell to the ground, stained with the sand of the sea … he once told me, "I am a son of the sea; if I leave it, I die,”… yet the sea did not care for him,” she said sadly.
Warm tent in ‘beautiful colours’
The day Saeb died also happened to be the day that Nabaheen signed a contract with the Goethe-Institut for her workshop project – and it was during her university final exams.
“Despite the impossible situation, I was determined to complete both my studies and my project simultaneously. Five days later, I went to work at the camp. I built a large tent decorated with the most beautiful colours and pictures. With the funding, I had some resources, so I prepared a warm tent that embraced them all,” she recounted.
There were 50 children, aged eight to 15, in the project. With her new funding, Nabaheen enlarged the programmes, adding theatre rehearsals and stagings. “In truth, I was suffering from the pangs of loss as one suffers labour pains … I had no choice but to immerse myself in them and my studies,” she confessed.
The project lasted three months, with meetings three days a week. On the final day, “we all collapsed in tears,” she said. “There I was, falling apart and weeping just like them. The project used to occupy me completely.”
By that time, most of the kids in her workshop started returning to their homes in northern Gaza. Without projects to plan, organise and occupy her days, Nabaheen once again turned to writing.
Her first novel in Arabic was published in 2021 and received an award in Lebanon before the war. She took up writing again, working on her second novel, “The Mystery of the Forgotten Girl”, also in Arabic, with a mission: to “intentionally” avoid writing about the war “because I wasn't ready to face the bitter reality”.
She has since written her third novel, “Disowned”, which was published in Egypt and recently showcased at the Cairo International Book Fair. A collection of poems, “When Ash Blossoms”, followed, and she has finished her fourth novel, “Letters Not Yet Delivered”.
Admitted in the West, blocked in Gaza
Writing has long been a coping mechanism and resilience booster for Nabaheen. The difficulty, for the young Palestinian writer though, are the forces beyond her control.
For the past few months, Nabaheen has been trying to leave Gaza to pursue a life of the mind, free of the terrors of everyday life in the besieged enclave. But the process has trapped her in a cycle of hope followed by crashing bureaucratic despair.
An Italian university forwarded her application for a writer’s residency to a foundation. But then she received no response. An international fund for artists and cultural actors at risk supported her “incredibly”. But during the final selection, “they rejected me the moment they realised I was from Gaza,” Nabaheen recounted.
She managed to get a conditional admission into a UK university for the next semester, but the conditions included funding and tests, which in turn require a visa. A writing fellowship at a US university came through, once again with help from a few US-based writers. But the process is going nowhere since the US government does not evacuate Palestinians.
On February 2, the Rafah crossing partially opened under the US-brokered ceasefire deal to chaotic scenes. Around 20,000 Gazans need urgent medical treatment abroad, but on the first day, Israel allowed just five patients to leave. Earlier this week, Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which is charged with overseeing day-to-day affairs in Gaza, told Egyptian media that the situation at Rafah was starting to improve.
While emergency medical patients struggle to make it out, Gazans who have admission into Western schools and institutions, are painfully aware that they are not on the priority list. As deadlines for the next semester loom, they are watching seats and scholarships slip away.

For Nabaheen, it’s been a heartbreaking process. “I cannot find the words to describe the scale of injustice and frustration I am enduring,” she said helplessly. After spending years working with Gaza’s children to help them dream of a future beyond the pressing worries of survival, her own lessons are proving to be a challenge.
But she is not one to give up. “I’m not losing hope. I will never lose hope, actually,” she said. “I knows that there are so many people stuck in so many difficult places like Gaza. I’ll keep going on. Writing is my way to go forward.”

Canada’s Carney, opposition leader hold hands during school shooting vigil
School shootings are rare in Canada, and the government has responded to previous mass shootings with strict gun control measures.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Pierre Poilievre, leader of the opposition Conservative Party, joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The Prime Minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned”.
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure”.
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in – know that we will still be here,” Carney said.

How ‘Zionist’ became a safe word for hate

Opinion
How ‘Zionist’ became a safe word for hate
At protests against Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s visit to Australia, some demonstrators directed their anger not only at Israel’s policies but at “Zionists” themselves – accusing them of malign influence in the media and government. At other recent rallies, Zionism has been equated to Nazism and terrorism.
Victor Klemperer, a Jewish academic who survived Nazi Germany, warned that words can act like tiny doses of arsenic – swallowed unnoticed, accumulating slowly, until their poison takes hold. His insight was not about shouted slogans, but about respectable language that can normalise contempt. “Zionist” has entered this territory over the past two years.
In the wake of the Bondi attack, I was involved in a public campaign for a federal royal commission into antisemitism. My role prompted a message from someone I have known for more than 20 years. Had I been paid by Israel for my advocacy, he asked. It was an offensive question. The answer was no.
What followed was more revealing. “Zionists have always been morally bankrupt with a superiority complex,” he told me.
I asked him two simple questions. Did he believe the state of Israel should continue to exist? Yes. Did he believe it should exist as a Jewish state, provided Jews, Christians, Muslims and others were given equal rights? Yes.
By the standard definition, he qualified as a Zionist. He either did not understand the term – or he was deliberately repurposing it.
That exchange mattered not because it was especially aggressive, but because it was ordinary. It was delivered calmly, with moral certainty, and without any sense of contradiction. It revealed something that has become increasingly common: the use of the word “Zionist” not to describe a belief, but to impugn a target.
Zionism, properly understood, is not complicated. It is the belief that the Jewish people have the right to self-determination in their ancestral homeland. In practical terms, it is the idea that Israel should exist as a Jewish state. In Australia, Zionism has long been openly supported by mainstream leaders from across the political spectrum as a legitimate expression of Jewish self-determination.
Zionism does not dictate borders. It does not prescribe military policy. It does not require allegiance to any government, leader or political party. It does not exclude any race or religion from Israeli citizenship. It does not preclude criticism of Israel and nor does it demand support for all actions taken by the Israeli state. Expansionism is not intrinsic to it, and nor does it require opposition to a two-state solution. To be clear, criticism of Israel that is similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.
Like any national movement, Zionism contains a wide spectrum of political views. Many Zionists oppose Israel’s current government. Many Israelis have protested against it for years. Some of the fiercest critics of Israeli policy are Israeli citizens, who nonetheless consider themselves proudly Zionist.
This clarity matters because once a word’s meaning is hijacked, it becomes available for misuse – or abuse.
In recent years, “Zionist” has increasingly been deployed as an insult. The term Zionist is no longer used to identify an idea, but it is spat to assign blame. “Zionists” are held responsible for a wide range of evils, often without definition or limitation. In many instances, “Zionist” is used synonymously with “Jew”, while maintaining just enough ambiguity to deny that Jews are being targeted at all. So why does this substitution occur?
Because openly targeting Jews is no longer socially acceptable. “Zionist” becomes the workaround – broad enough to encompass most Jews, yet elastic enough to provide moral cover. It allows hostility to be expressed while preserving plausible deniability.
We are repeatedly told that hostility toward “Zionists” is merely political critique. But if that were true, the criticism would be of policy. Instead, “Zionists” are accused of supremacy, immorality, or inherent evil. That is not political criticism. It is collective character assassination.
This matters because Zionism is not an abstract ideology for most Jews. It is bound up with history, vulnerability and survival. For many Jews – including those deeply critical of Israel – Zionism represents the belief that Jews should not again be stateless, dependent on the goodwill of others for protection. To insist that “anti-Zionism has nothing to do with Jews” while knowing that the overwhelming majority of Jews identify in some way with Zionism is disingenuous.
At best, it ignores how the word is actually used. At worst, the ambiguity is used intentionally as cover. This is why the definitional battle matters. Hijacking the meaning of Zionism allows hatred to masquerade as politics. The federal royal commission into antisemitism must grapple with these subtleties if it is to understand Jew hatred in Australia.
Existing legal frameworks are poorly equipped to deal with language that is technically deniable yet socially corrosive. They miss the cumulative effect of rhetoric that repeatedly singles out a group under a different name.
If the commission is to be meaningful, it must confront this linguistic sleight of hand directly. It must be willing to ask whether “Zionist” has become a socially acceptable stand-in for “Jew” – a way to legitimise hostility while denying responsibility for its impact. Because when words are repurposed to disguise prejudice, history suggests the damage rarely stops with words.
Danny Berkovic is a Sydney businessman and an organiser of the bondiresponse.com petition, which pushed the Albanese government to announce a royal commission into antisemitism.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. BRICS is aware of the risks of pressure from Washington and will develop an alternative to any system the US could dismantle "with the push of a button," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.
"I don’t think anyone is underestimating the risks associated with the US policy of sanctions and tariff pressure. But it doesn’t mean that everyone is ready to succumb to pressure, or in effect, a diktat. BRICS was established to create, if you will, an alternative for anything that could be shut down with the push of a button, as we’ve already seen," the diplomat said.
"What’s important is that we are looking for and finding solutions to the challenges created by this new hostile international environment for our work," the diplomat added. "Both within BRICS and in cooperation with those who are interested, but not part of BRICS, using the resources BRICS offers. This includes partner states and other countries," Ryabkov said.
"Digital methods and systems are at the forefront here. And, of course, national currencies and conducting all transactions in those currencies," the deputy foreign minister explained.

Prime Minister Carney and Canada’s main opposition leader hold hands during school shooting vigil
VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The prime minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned.”
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure.”
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in — know that we will still be here,” Carney said.
A crowd of hundreds attended the vigil. Some held photos of loved ones they lost.
Carney said the community has always been defined by people caring for each other.
“And when the unimaginable happened on Tuesday, you were there again. First responders at the school within two minutes. Teachers shielding their children,” he said.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace.” Canada’s political leaders flew from Ottawa together.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said the students of the school won’t ever have to return to the building if they don’t want to.
“I will promise that not one of you will ever be forced to go back to that school. We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school,” Eby said.
Authorities on Thursday identified those killed at the school as Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit and Ticaria Lampert, all age 12, as well as 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield and assistant teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
McDonald said from the time the suspect encountered police there were no further injuries to students at the school.
Four guns were seized, two from the family home and two from the school, he said.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.
School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.

4 Palestinians injured by Israeli army gunfire across Gaza Strip despite ceasefire
At least 591 Palestinians killed, over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since ceasefire
- Israeli media says troops targeted fighters emerging from tunnel in Beit Hanoun
GAZA CITY, Palestine
Four Palestinians were injured on Saturday by Israeli army gunfire across the Gaza Strip amid daily Israeli violations of the ceasefire agreement in effect since last October.
A young girl and an elderly man were wounded by Israeli gunfire east of the southern city of Khan Younis, a medical source told Anadolu.
Another young girl was shot in the head by Israeli army gunfire in the Netzarim area in the central Gaza Strip, a medical source said.
In a separate incident, the medical source said a 60-year-old man was shot in the foot by Israeli army gunfire in the Al-Mughraqa area south of Gaza City.
Eyewitnesses said Israeli forces opened heavy, indiscriminate fire east of the city before carrying out large-scale demolitions of several residential buildings in the area.
They added that Israeli troops also fired indiscriminately in eastern areas of the Bureij refugee camp and the Zeitoun neighborhood.
In a related development, witnesses said Israeli fighter jets carried out several airstrikes on Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip and east of Gaza City.
In the northern Gaza Strip, witnesses told Anadolu that Israeli warplanes and artillery struck the Sheikh Zayed area east of Beit Lahia amid heavy gunfire from military helicopters overhead.
Residents also reported hearing explosions in multiple locations across northern Gaza, including areas under Israeli military control.
The so-called “Yellow Line” separates areas of Israeli military deployment, which account for about 53% of the Gaza Strip’s eastern territory, from western areas where Palestinians are permitted to move.
Israeli forces identified five fighters exiting a tunnel shaft in the Beit Hanoun area, Israel’s Channel 12 reported, citing its military correspondent.
The report said troops targeted them, adding that preliminary assessments indicated four were killed, while operations at the site were ongoing.
No details were provided about the identity of the fighters or the group they allegedly belonged to. The Israeli military did not issue a statement on the reported incident.
The Oct. 10 ceasefire agreement ended Israel’s two-year war that began on Oct. 8, 2023. Palestinian authorities say the conflict killed more than 72,000 Palestinians, wounded over 171,000 others, and caused widespread destruction affecting 90% of civilian infrastructure. The UN estimates reconstruction costs at approximately $70 billion.
At least 591 Palestinians have been killed and over 1,578 others injured in Israeli attacks since the ceasefire, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.

Two Philippine senators named ‘co-perpetrators’ in Duterte ICC case
Former Philippine justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II also among eight current, past officials named in complaint.
Two sitting Philippine senators have been identified as “co-perpetrators” in former president Rodrigo Duterte‘s crimes against humanity trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC), documents released by prosecutors show.
Senators Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa and Christopher “Bong” Go are among eight current and former officials named in a document dated February 13 and posted to the court’s website late on Friday.

Duterte was arrested in the Philippines’ capital, Manila, in March 2025, and was swiftly flown to the Netherlands, where he has been held in ICC custody at The Hague. The 80-year-old insists his arrest was unlawful.
ICC prosecutors have charged him with three counts of crimes against humanity, alleging his involvement in at least 76 murders as part of his “war on drugs”.
“Duterte and his co-perpetrators shared a common plan or agreement to ‘neutralise’ alleged criminals in the Philippines [including those perceived or alleged to be associated with drug use, sale or production] through violent crimes including murder,” the prosecution document reads.
Dela Rosa, the former national police chief and enforcer of Duterte’s drug war, has previously said he believed he faced potential arrest and has been in hiding for months.
Go, re-elected in May in a landslide victory, was a key lieutenant of Duterte during both the latter’s terms as mayor of southern Davao City and as president from 2016 to 2022.
A representative of Dela Rosa said they had not yet seen the document. Go has yet to comment on the latest development.
It was not immediately clear if any of the men named in the prosecution document would face charges in court.
In a statement posted on Facebook, Kristina Conti, lawyer of several of the deceased victims’ families, noted that it’s the first time “significant details” were disclosed by the ICC to the public.
She said the inclusion of several high-ranking officials under Duterte showed that the deadly drug war under his presidency “was crafted not only to ensure implementation, but to ensure impunity”.
“The involvement of those in the investigating units, which should have acted as the killings happen, is material to the plan. This also emphasizes that the ‘war on drugs’ began in Davao,” Conti said.
Duterte is facing a four-day “confirmation of charges” hearing from February 23, in which judges will decide whether the prosecution’s allegations are strong enough to proceed to trial.
Judges have rejected arguments that the 80-year-old, who was arrested in March last year and transferred to the Netherlands the same day, was unfit to stand trial.
Go and Dela Rosa have been named as co-perpetrators in acts that took place during Duterte’s tenures as Davao mayor and president.
Former Philippine justice secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II, who served as a lawyer for Duterte in cases involving the so-called “Davao Death Squad”, is also among the eight men named.
Ross Tugade, an ICC-accredited lawyer from the Philippines, said in a post on Facebook that the inclusion of the names of former Duterte officials indicates “that the ICC has evidence” to show a “criminal structure” in the commission of the alleged crimes.
The first of three counts against Duterte concerns his alleged involvement as a co-perpetrator in 19 murders carried out between 2013 and 2016 while he was mayor of Davao City.
The second relates to 14 murders of so-called “High Value Targets” in 2016 and 2017 when Duterte was president.
The third charge covers 43 murders committed during “clearance” operations of lower-level alleged drug users or pushers.
These took place across the Philippines between 2016 and 2018, the prosecution alleged.
The ICC also on Friday allowed the addition of 500 more complainants against Duterte in the trial.

Public urged to take ‘extra care’ as heavy snow and ice sweeps UK
Saturday is set to be a cold but sunny day for most of the country, as a yellow warning for ice remains for certain places
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Yellow weather warnings for heavy snow and ice remain in effect across much of the UK, with forecasters urging the public to exercise “extra care” on roads. An ongoing flood risk also prompts continued vigilance from authorities.
Saturday is set to be a cold, sunny day for most, as Arctic maritime air sweeps across the nation, according to the Met Office. A yellow warning for ice covers Wales and central and southern England, active from Friday evening until Saturday morning. Icy surfaces could lead to difficult travel conditions and potential “some injuries” from slips and falls.
Further north, parts of northeast England and northern Scotland are under a snow and ice warning, which began on Friday afternoon and lasts until Saturday morning. Another yellow warning for snow and ice, stretching from Derby to Scotland, will take effect on Saturday evening through to Sunday morning.
The Met Office anticipates snow in these areas could be “heavy at times”, leading to “some disruption to travel”. Accumulations of “1-3cm (of snow) will be possible at low levels, with 3-7cm possible above about 150m elevation, and perhaps 10-15cm above 400m”. Northern Ireland also faces an ice warning until Saturday morning.
Met Office chief forecaster Rebekah Hicks warned: “Snow is likely ahead of the rain across northern England and Scotland and could reach lower levels at times on Saturday night into Sunday. The snow will gradually turn to rain as the front moves east across the country on Sunday.
“The rain may be heavy at times and it will be windy in coastal areas. Additional warnings may be required. We encourage the public to keep up to date with the latest forecasts and any warnings that may be issued.”
Meanwhile, the Environment Agency has called for continued “vigilance” due to persistent flood risks, with 75 flood warnings and 151 flood alerts currently active. Jonathan Day, flood duty manager, stated: “With another band of rain on its way, we need the public to remain vigilant to the risk of flooding.
“So far, more than 24,000 homes and businesses have been protected but sadly around 330 have suffered flooding, and our thoughts are with those communities affected.
“Our teams will continue to do all they can to support local people, with pumps, temporary barriers and by clearing waterways to ensure flood water can drain away.”
Floods minister Emma Hardy added: “Flooding is devastating and my thoughts are with the people affected, and I urge residents to follow local advice over the next few days to ensure they stay safe.”

Iranian judiciary announces conditional release of several detained political activists
Latest wave of arrests comes weeks after protests in Iran that began peacefully over economic grievances but later turned violent
ISTANBUL
Iran’s judiciary said Saturday several political activists, detained in recent weeks, have been conditionally released on bail pending the continuation of legal proceedings.
In a statement carried by Mehr News Agency, the judiciary said the releases came following the completion of initial investigations and after the detainees received formal warnings regarding “the nature of their actions and conduct.”
The statement said the individuals were freed “on an appropriate bail order and on a conditional basis” until judicial proceedings are concluded.
The judiciary added that in other cases involving detainees who had already received final court rulings, judicial sentences have been enforced, and those individuals are currently serving their prison terms.
No further details were provided regarding the number of activists released.
The latest wave of arrests comes weeks after protests in Iran that began peacefully over economic grievances but later turned violent, resulting in more than 3,000 deaths, according to official figures.
Iranian authorities accused the US and Israel of backing what they described as “rioting” and “terrorism.”

US pressure on Greenland is ‘totally unacceptable’, says Danish PM – as it happened
Mette Frederiksen tells Munich Security Conference that Denmark is willing to work with the US, but ‘there are, of course, things that you cannot compromise on’
Pressure on Greenland is 'totally unacceptable,' Danish PM says
Frederiksen gets asked (again) if Trump is still interested in acquiring Greenland, and she confirms that “unfortunately, the desire is the same”.
She says “it is something we, of course, talk a lot about”, and she adds that “the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable”.
“We are talking about threats, but as you Jens-Frederik often say, the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone, so that pressure is unacceptable,” she says.
She says Denmark is willing to work with the US, but “there are, of course, things that you cannot compromise on” including the respect of other state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
She says Denmark will not compromise on that, but suggests there are other points that can be discussed, including a revision of the 1951 defence agreement with the US, which she syas offers a “very easy” way for the US to “have a stronger footprint in Greenland”.
“We don’t think it’s over. We now have a working group, we will try to see if we can find a solution, and … we will do whatever we can, but of course there are red lines that will not be crossed,” she says.
The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, has sought to reassure European leaders that ending the transatlantic era is “not out goal nor our wish,” but urged them to leave behind the postwar “delusions” on trade (9:07), deindustrialisation, green policies and mass migration (9:10, 9:16).
Rubio insisted that “Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel” as they “care deeply about Europe” (9:13), as he says the US “do not want our allies to be weak, because that makes us weaker” (9:20).
He said the US was intent on building a new world order, adding “while we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe”.
Earlier today,
Ukraine wants security guarantees for a minimum of 20 years from the US before it can sign a peace deal with dignity, Volodymyr Zelenskyy said ahead of talks next week with Russia and the US.
In an earlier speech, he said that “none of our people chose to be heroes” (12:28) as he described the everyday life under Russian attacks (12:11), urged Europe to “stand up to Russia” (12:36) and warned against any half-baked deal with Russia saying it would be an “illusion” to think it would stop Putin from attacking again in the future (12:40).
Later in the evening, Zelenskyy held bilateral talks with US secretary of state Marco Rubio (20:52) and spoke on the phone with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner (21:15).
Meanwhile,
The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said there was an urgent need for a closer UK defence relationship with Europe (10:42, 10:56), so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup and economic revival (10:46), insisting “we are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more” (10:33).
Starmer said “the new normal” required Europe to “take primary responsibility for its own defence” (10:37), as “the solidity of peace” was “softening” amid “warning signs” from Russia (10:31).
Separately,
The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, condemned “totally unacceptable” pressure on Greenland amid continuing US interest in taking over the semi-autonomous territory (19:07).
The Greenlandic prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, said it was “outrageous” to see the Greenlanders threatened by a Nato ally (19:12), as he warned about setting a broader precedent in international relations.
Their comments came a day after they held a brief meeting with the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on the sidelines of the conference.
Finally,
Late Russian opposition leader and anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny was poisoned by Russia with a deadly toxic found in the skin of Ecuador dart frogs, “highly likely” leading to his death, the UK Foreign Office said (14:06).
The disclosure came at the same conference at which the news of his passing broke two years ago (14:28).
And the quote of the day award today goes to Poland’s Radosław Sikorski for his answer on a question on how Poland and Nato would respond to a Russian attack on its territory (17:07).

Zelenskyy spoke with US envoys Witkoff, Kushner ahead of next round of talks
As expected (18:00), Zelenskyy also spoke with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, ahead of next week’s trilateral talks in Gevena.
In a short statement, he said they “discusses some developments following the meetings in Abu Dhabi,” but noted that “not everything can be disclosed over the phone.”
He also debriefed them on his meeting with Rubio, and thanked again for the US support for Ukraine.
Zelenskyy spoke with Rubio discussing Russian attacks, diplomatic peace process
More importantly, before coming to the dinner, Zelenskyy also met with the US secretary of state Marco Rubio.
In a brief statement on Telegram, the Ukrainian president said he informed Rubio “about the situation on the frontline, ongoing Russian attacks, and the consequences of the [Russian] attacks on the energy system”.
He said the pair also “discussed in detail the diplomatic process and trilateral meetings” including the upcoming meeting in Geneva next week.
It’s a pretty standard statement; let’s see what, if anything, we are going to get from the US side.
At the award event, Zelenskyy delivered a short, courteous speech, thanking several European leaders by first name for their support, and saying the Ukrainian people – on whose behalf he collected the award – will know them well and remember their support.
He’s not staying for the dinner, though – seems that he’s not done with the government business for tonight.
Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy is at the Munich Residence, where he is due to receive the Ewald von Kleist Award for 2026 shortly.
In a brief statement to the press, standing alongside Bavaria’s Markus Söder and the MSC chair Wolfgang Ischinger as well as Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk, he thanks Germany for its continuing support, saying it is now the largest donor of help to the wartorn country.
He also says that he was glad to visit the joint German-Ukrainian drone production facility yesterday, where he received the first produced drone. He says it is “already on the battlefield”.
Poland’s Tusk, who will deliver laudatory remarks at the ceremony later, said that “for Ukraine, there is no prize, even Nobel peace prize is not enough” for what it suffered during the Russian aggression.
He adds:
“Some say that Ukraine should be grateful for everything. The truth is, exactly the opposite: the rest of us should be grateful to you.”
Europe needs to be able to respond to several crises simultaneously, Danish PM says
In a pretty stark warning, Denmark’s Frederiksen says that Europe radically needs to step up its ability “to tackle more crises at the same time, because the old world is not coming back.”
“Forget about tackling one crisis [at a time]. We have to be able to tackle all of them at the same time,” she says.
“I’m sorry to say, I think it’s a part of the strategy from different parts of the world right now to throw as many conflicts as many discussions, as many tweets, as many messages as possible on the table at the same time, so everybody is running around like a chicken without head,” she says.
That’s why Europe needs to find out to approach these issues in a more strategic way, she says.
US threats on Greenland 'damage' Nato, Germany's Pistorius says
German defence minister Boris Pistorius joins in condemnations of US aggressive policy towards Greenland, as he says:
“[That] the biggest ally of the [Nato] alliance threatens and questions the territorial sovereignty and integrity of another ally – this is incredible and damages the alliance … which has been the most successful alliance in the history of mankind.”
'Outrageous' to see Greenlandic people feel unsafe because of ally's behaviour, Greenlandic PM says
Greenlandic prime minister Nielsen says picks up the issue of pressure on the Greenlandic people.
“If I think about my people, we are so proud. We live in a harsh environment, we are resilient, we live in a land where nobody was able to live for many, many, many years. There’s a reason why we are the ones left,” he says to some laughs in the room.
He says there is a broader principle at stake here, about whether it is legitimate to make other territories “a puzzle in a big game” of global powers.
“What would prevent, if they did that, the US, Russia and China to split up the world in three big blocks? … it’s outrageous,” he says.
He picks up on Frederiksen’s comments:
“The paradox is that the Greenlandic people have never felt threatened, and [now] the first time they feel unsafe for real, [it is] … with an ally talked about acquiring them, buying them and so on. It’s outrageous,” he says.
Pressure on Greenland is 'totally unacceptable,' Danish PM says
Frederiksen gets asked (again) if Trump is still interested in acquiring Greenland, and she confirms that “unfortunately, the desire is the same”.
She says “it is something we, of course, talk a lot about”, and she adds that “the pressure on Greenland is totally unacceptable”.
“We are talking about threats, but as you Jens-Frederik often say, the people of Greenland have never been threatened before by anyone, so that pressure is unacceptable,” she says.
She says Denmark is willing to work with the US, but “there are, of course, things that you cannot compromise on” including the respect of other state’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.
She says Denmark will not compromise on that, but suggests there are other points that can be discussed, including a revision of the 1951 defence agreement with the US, which she syas offers a “very easy” way for the US to “have a stronger footprint in Greenland”.
“We don’t think it’s over. We now have a working group, we will try to see if we can find a solution, and … we will do whatever we can, but of course there are red lines that will not be crossed,” she says.
Packed room for early evening session on Arctic security
Jakub Krupa
in Munich
In the meantime, an early evening panel on Arctic security is now under way over at the Bayerischer Hof – and the room is absolutely packed.
Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen says it’s not usual to see so much interest in the region’s security.
But she is “very satisfied that Nato is now working [on] security in the Arctic region in a more structured way,” and wants to see a “permanent presence” in the Arctic region, including in and around Greenland.
She says that as climate change progresses, there will be need to monitor more closely what Russia and China “will do around Greenland,” but stresses “we are not there yet” – in a clear rebuke to Trump’s (repeated) claims on this issue.
Greenlandic prime minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen strikes a similar tone, as he said that the talks about Russian and Chinese activity is premature.
“But we are not naive and we see the longer perspective when our routes in the north west and the northeast … [when] they they melt, there might be more traffic,” he says.
But he says allies are aligned, as Nato steps up its activity in the region through the new Arctic sentry mission.
I am now at the Munich Residence, where Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy will receive the Munich Security Conference’s Ewald von Kleist Award for 2026 later tonight.
Poland’s prime minister Donald Tusk will deliver laudatory remarks.
Getting into this beautiful building – the seat of government and residence of the Bavarian dukes, electors and kings from 1508 to 1918, as its website says – requires passing several security checkpoints, but it’s only understandable given numerous other senior officials are also expected to be in attendance.
I will bring you the key lines from this evening’s speeches, but there is still some time to go before then.
Zelenskyy 'still in conflict with US about lot of final aspects of deal' – Guardian's Patrick Wintour on Ukraine talks
Jakub Krupa
in Munich
Zelenskyy’s comments show how much still needs to be resolved before an agreement on ending the Russian invasion on Ukraine can be agreed.
Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour told me that it appears that “he is still in conflict with the Americans about a lot of the final aspects of the deal”.
Looking ahead to next week’s Geneva talks, Wintour said:
“I don’t think there’s going to be any short-term progress. I don’t think Vladimir Putin feels he’s under enough pressure at the moment.”
Russia changing its chief negotiator ahead of Geneva talks could be delaying tactic, Zelenskyy says
Separately, Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelenskyy has given a press briefing on the margins of the main conference in the last hour.
He said he was due to meet with the US secretary of state Marco Rubio today, and hold a phone call with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner later tonight, with his chief negotiator and former defence minister Rustem Umerov talking to them “several times a day”. Zelenskyy also met with a delegation of US senators earlier today.
He stressed it was important to engage with the US through all possible channels to ensure no one can say that Ukrainians were stalling the talks.
Zelenskyy also spoke about his expectations for the Geneva negotiations next week, saying he was surprised to hear about Russia’s decision to change the head of its delegation after the first two rounds.
He said he saw this as a potential move to delay decisions, but counted on Americans to continue talks and not let Russia force them to reopen previously resolved issues.
He also confirmed he was still seeking a political commitment to allow Ukraine into the European Union, ideally by 2027, as part of the security guarantees.
“We have to be ready, to prepare everything … technically, Ukraine has to be ready in 2027, but the date of accession depends on all these dialogues with 27 member states,” he said.
Zelenskyy was also asked if he worried he could also get poisoned by Russia, after the earlier report about Alexei Navalny
“I can’t think about Vladimir Putin and his poison ambitions, if he has them. I try not to think about it; otherwise it’s all I think about,” the said.
'A conditional offer to cooperate with Europe' – Guardian's Patrick Wintour on EU-US relations after Rubio's speech
Jakub Krupa
in Munich
If you are looking for a quick summary of events so far, I caught up with our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour who is also here at the Munich Security Conference to get his thoughts on what the events of the last 48 hours mean for the transatlantic relationship.
Poland’s Sikorski gets asked about what would Poland’s response be if Russia crossed the border and invaded its territory.
He gives this rather entertaining answer:
“We joined Nato for common defence.
If they cross the border, start killing Nato citizens, Polish citizens, we would expect the North Atlantic Council to meet and to activate the contingency plan, and after that, the plan is very easy: we win, they lose.”
US Democratic senator Elissa Slotkin – also on the panel, in a rather awkward position of having to comment on the US policies she disagrees with – says she is “very concerned” about the 2026 US midterm elections in November.
“He [Trump] is telling us what he wants to do. He is laying it out for us, and is up to the Americans to believe him, right? That, just like in 2020, he said, If I don’t win, then it wasn’t a free and fair election. He is repeating the playbook now, threatening to put uniformed federal agents around polling locations. I mean, he’s telling us the playbook.”
She says “the question is what are we going to do as Americans to defend our democracy that we helped invent.”

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told the Munich Security Conference that it would be “geopolitical malpractice” not to talk to China, as he pledged that Washington would carefully manage its differences with Beijing.
“Because we’re two large countries with huge global interests, our national interests will often not align,” Rubio told the event in a keynote address on Saturday morning.
“We owe it to the world to try to manage those as best we can, obviously avoiding conflict, both economic and worse … but no one is under any illusion that bilateral relations will have fundamental changes.”

Rubio’s remarks – ahead of US President Donald Trump’s expected trip to Beijing in April – were a continuation of his government’s softer rhetoric towards Beijing, even as he tried to rally the US’ allies against unnamed common challenges to Western civilisation.
“We have to have a relationship with China, and many of the countries represented here today are going to have to have a relationship with China, always understanding that nothing that we agree to could come at the expense of our national interest,” Rubio said.

He added that the “goal of diplomacy is to try to navigate those times in which our national interests come into conflict with one another, always hoping to do it peacefully”.

Trump: "Peace Through Strength" as Iran tensions escalate

17:12:44 KST

ALBAWABA - President Donald Trump of the United States has said that regime change in Iran could be a good thing. He has also said that the U.S. would not use military force against Iran if a "proper agreement" is reached. His comments come at a time when reports say the U.S. military is making backup plans for long-term operations in case diplomacy fails.
Trump spoke at a military base in North Carolina and said that he had thought a deal with Iran was possible in the past, but that Tehran's approach to nuclear talks was difficult. He said that showing strength and maybe even putting more pressure on the other side might be necessary to reach a peaceful solution. He stressed that deterrence could ultimately decide the outcome.
Earlier, Trump said that the world's largest aircraft carrier would be ready to go in case talks fell through. He also talked about the U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites last June, which showed that Washington is ready to act if necessary.
The White House correspondent for Al Jazeera says that these comments are the first time Trump has openly suggested regime change as a possible goal. For weeks, he has been publicly supporting a diplomatic path that he calls "peace through strength."
Military Readiness and Risks to Diplomacy
Two U.S. officials told Reuters that the Pentagon is getting ready for the possibility of military operations against Iran that could last for weeks if the president gives the order. The officials, who asked not to be named, said that making such plans is very risky for the fragile diplomatic process that is currently going on.
The USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, which is currently in the Caribbean, will go to the Middle East to support the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group that is already there, according to reports from U.S. media outlets like The New York Times. More U.S. naval ships, such as eight Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, are stationed in the Arabian Sea, eastern Mediterranean, and Red Sea.
What Tehran Says and What It Won't Do
Iranian officials say that the US and Israel are making up reasons to get involved and change the government. Tehran has said that it will respond strongly to any military attack, even if it is small. Iranian leaders still say that any deal that limits the country's nuclear activities must also include relief from sanctions.
Washington, on the other hand, wants Iran to completely stop enriching uranium and send its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to another country. The U.S. government has also tried to expand talks to include Iran's missile program and its alliances with armed groups in the region. Tehran has turned down these offers many times.
Ali Shamkhani, who is in charge of Iran's Supreme National Defense Council, said that Iran's defense system was a "red line" that could not be crossed. He said that the country's armed forces are still on high alert and that any mistake would have serious consequences. He did, however, say that talks could go forward if they were held on realistic terms and didn't make too many demands.
He went on to say that diplomatic efforts are meant to ease tensions and strengthen the political track, even though military deployments show that pressure is growing in the area.

Change in power in Iran ‘would be the best thing that could happen’, Trump says

The remarks came shortly after Trump confirmed that he was sending a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East and after he spoke with troops at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
US President Donald Trump said Friday that a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen” as his administration weighs whether to take military action against Tehran.
The remarks came shortly after Trump confirmed earlier on Friday that he was sending a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East and after he spoke with troops at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina.
“It seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters when asked about pressing for the ouster of the Islamic clerical rule in Iran. “For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking.”
Although Trump has stated in recent weeks that further reducing Iran's nuclear program is his top objective, he implied on Friday that this is just one of many concessions the United States requires from Iran.
During his trip to Washington this week to meet with Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been insistent that any agreement include measures to stop Iran's support of proxy organisations like Hamas and Hezbollah and to neutralise its ballistic missile development.
“If we do it, that would be the least of the mission,” Trump said of targeting Tehran’s nuclear program, which suffered significant setbacks in US military strikes last year.
Another round of talks planned
Trump's remarks supporting the possible overthrow of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also come weeks after Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the administration's recent attempt to remove Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from office was not nearly as complicated as a possible change of power in Iran.
During a Senate hearing last month, Rubio stated that "you're talking about a regime that's in place for a very long time" when discussing Iran.
“So that’s going to require a lot of careful thinking, if that eventuality ever presents itself,” Rubio said.
Trump said the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, is being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Mideast to join other warships and military assets the US has built up in the region.
Trump had suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was planned for this week, but those negotiations didn’t materialize as one of Tehran’s top security officials visited Oman and Qatar and exchanged messages with US intermediaries.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Trump told reporters about the second carrier. He added, “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
With the Middle East still reeling from the Israel-Hamas battle in the Gaza Strip, Gulf Arab countries have already cautioned that any attack may escalate into another regional confrontation.
Iranians are also starting to observe 40-day mourning rituals in remembrance of the thousands of people who were slain during Tehran's brutal suppression of statewide demonstrations last month, which will increase internal pressure on the heavily sanctioned Islamic Republic.
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but experts say before the June war, Tehran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.

European debate over nuclear weapons gains pace
Sweden

2026-02-14
09:11:12 CET
17:11:12 KST

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told the Munich Security Conference (MSC) that he had "held confidential talks with the French president about European nuclear deterrence".
And Prime Minister Keir Starmer of Britain, Europe's other nuclear power along with France, said it was "enhancing our nuclear cooperation with France".
The UK's nuclear deterrent already protects NATO members, and Starmer said "any adversary must know that in a crisis they could be confronted by our combined strength" alongside France.
Still, while the United States and Russia have thousands of nuclear warheads each, the combined French and British arsenal is in the hundreds.
Discussion of nuclear armament has long been viewed as taboo in many other European countries -- but Russian aggression and worries about US commitment have forced the issue into mainstream European politics.
In a report assessing "Europe's nuclear options" published for the MSC, experts warned that the relatively small nuclear arsenals of France and the United Kingdom might not be enough to face down Russia without US support.
"Europeans can no longer outsource their thinking about nuclear deterrence to the United States," the group of 11 experts warn in the paper, which calls on Europe to "urgently confront a new nuclear reality" in the face of "Russia's nuclear-backed revisionism".
Many European officials are convinced that Moscow's territorial ambitions will not be confined to Ukraine, and that other European countries -- including even NATO members -- could face some sort of attack.
US President Donald Trump's disdainful comments about NATO and his highly transactional approach to foreign relations, meanwhile, have Washington's European allies questioning whether they can risk relying on US protection.
'Complacency has ended'
The MSC report lays out five nuclear options for Europe, but cautions that none are good and that there is "no low-cost or risk-free way out of Europe's nuclear predicament".
"The era in which Europe could afford strategic complacency has ended," the authors write.
"However uncomfortable the debate may be, the new security environment requires European policymakers to confront the role of nuclear weapons in the defence of the continent directly and without delay -– and to invest the resources needed to do so competently."
The five options are: Continue to rely on American deterrence; strengthen the role of British and French nuclear weapons in a European deterrent; jointly develop European nuclear weapons as a deterrent; increase the number of European countries with their own nuclear arsenals; or expand European conventional military power to present a more intimidating non-nuclear deterrent.
Sticking with the status quo, and relying on America's unmatched military might, remains "the most credible and feasible option" in the short term, according to the authors.
"We have nuclear deterrence already" within the NATO framework "which is working, which has plans with capabilities and doctrines," Estonian Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna told AFP.
Merz declared that European NATO allies need to remain united while building up a European nuclear deterrence, stressing that "we will not allow different security zones to emerge in Europe".
Macron's speech
The capability gap between the United States and Russia on the one hand, and the much small French and British arsenals on the other, is currently so large that very few believe Europeans can assume full responsibility for deterrence in the short term.
"If there's going to be some kind of bigger European investments in France or the UK's nuclear deterrence, that's only a good thing," Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen recently told AFP.
But he quickly added: "If you're talking about to compensate US nuclear deterrence, that's not realistic at this point."
Still, experts welcomed the increasingly serious political debate on an issue that has long worried military planners.
"That's very positive, but now we need action," Heloise Fayet of the French Institute of International Relations (Ifri), a contributor to the MSC report, told AFP.
The report notes that both France and Britain would face a range of challenges in growing their arsenals and extending nuclear protection across Europe, from hefty costs to tricky questions about who holds final authority to launch the warheads.
Britain's nuclear weapons also currently depend heavily on US technology, meaning for the moment there is "no sustainable future for a UK nuclear deterrent without US collaboration," the experts note.
French President Emmanuel Macron, who has previously raised the possibility of extending France's nuclear umbrella across Europe, is scheduled to deliver a major speech on French nuclear doctrine at the end of February.
Macron said in Munich he was considering a doctrine that could include "special cooperation, joint exercises, and shared security interests with certain key countries".
"This speech by Macron will be very important," said Fayet. "It has generated enormous expectations in Europe."

With the Liberals' first female leader, Sussan Ley, dumped after less than a year at the helm, experts say the party has done little to shake its perceived "women problem".
But senior party figures insist gender had nothing to do with Ley's removal, instead blaming dire polling and looming electoral oblivion.
Ley became the Liberal Party’s first female leader in its 80-year history after the Coalition’s landslide defeat at the May 2025 election. A moderate, she narrowly defeated conservative frontbencher Angus Taylor 29 votes to 25.
Nine months later, she was ousted and replaced by Taylor, who secured a decisive 34 to 17 victory after several of Ley’s key backers switched sides.
On Friday morning, before Ley was ousted, Northern Territory Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price said any attempt to frame a leadership change around gender would amount to "identity politics".
"Frankly, Australians can see through this nonsense. Leadership is not about gender — it is about competence," she said on social media.
She pointed to the Coalition’s primary vote falling from about 31 per cent at the election to 18 per cent in recent polling, arguing the party was "bleeding votes to One Nation".
Victorian senator and key Liberal power-broker James Paterson was among the first to publicly back Taylor’s leadership bid, also pointing to recent opinion polls.
"Political leaders are judged on their performance, not their gender," he said.
'A classic case of the glass cliff'
While Ley's detractors rejected the idea that the leadership spill reflected a broader issue for women, some experts argued her removal risked reinforcing long-standing concerns among female voters.
Michelle Ryan, director of the Global Institute for Women's Leadership at the Australian National University, told SBS News Ley's elevation was a "classic case of the glass cliff".
Ryan was among the first researchers to coin the term that describes women being promoted during times of crisis, when the risk of failure is high.
"Coming in after the worst electoral performance in history ... the fact that she's now been pushed out after such a short time sort of illustrates the precarity," she said.
The day she was elected Liberal leader, Ley said she didn't accept that she was facing a "glass cliff", saying her agenda was broader than gender.
Tony Barry, a former senior Liberal staffer and now director of RedBridge Group, which conducts polling and political research, said the party faced an entrenched perception problem around gender.
"The problem for the Liberal Party is there's an existing prejudice amongst voters," he said.
"They do have a women problem, whether that's real and whether that's fair or not, that is the perception.
"The events of the last week are at risk of reinforcing that."
He said Labor did not have the same issue despite Julia Gillard being knifed as leader because the party had a high representation of female MPs.
Dr Blair Williams, a politics lecturer at the University of NSW Canberra, said the Liberals' gender problem was threefold: Under-representation in parliament, declining support among female voters and what she described as a "toxic blokey culture".
She said accusations of bullying and sexual assault over the past decade had contributed to a culture many women viewed as unwelcoming.
"Young women, Gen Z, Millennials, they are not voting for the Liberals," she said.
"It's a competition between Labor and the Greens at this point for those votes. You really do see a pretty dire scenario if they don't get their act together when it comes to women."
Women under-represented in Liberal ranks
Despite setting targets more than a decade ago for equal gender representation by 2025, both the Liberals and their Coalition partner, the Nationals, have fallen short.
Women make up just 33 per cent of Liberal MPs. Among the Nationals, a little over a quarter of MPs are female. Neither party has adopted gender quotas.
By contrast, Labor reached 50 per cent female representation in 2022. After its landslide victory at last year’s election, its caucus rose to 56 per cent women, and 12 of its 23 cabinet portfolios were held by women.
Labor introduced a 35 per cent quota for female MPs in 1994, later moving to a "40:40:20" model requiring no fewer than 40 per cent of seats be held by men or women, with the remaining 20 per cent open to either gender.
In June last year, Taylor said a "crusade" was needed to involve more women in the Liberal party, but he remained opposed to gender quotas, arguing they "subvert democratic processes".
"I think there are better ways of achieving this … mentoring, recruitment, support is the way to make sure you have talented people," he told ABC Radio National.
Professor Catharine Lumby, an expert in media and gender studies at the University of Sydney, said quotas could be implemented while still setting "high bars for achievement".
"Those two things can coexist," she told SBS News.
"The fact that there's a resistance to quotas tells you there's a deep-seated cultural issue in the Liberal Party."
University of NSW Canberra's Blair Williams said the Liberal Party needed a clear policy platform that spoke to women if it wanted to attract support, noting its proposal to end work-from-home for public servants, which it took to the last election and was later dumped, was particularly unappealing.
"It's not just about who your leader is, it's about what does the party actually stand for ... how can they actually relate to a changing generation of Australians and especially Australian women?" she said.
Barry said all political parties benefited from diversity.
"Putting mostly Gen X white men around a table doesn't bring about diversity of opinion and viewpoints, and that's a dangerous thing for any political party," he said.
"It means that you're representing a small base as opposed to the majority."

UK government's 'own goal': anti-extremism game character becomes protest symbol

What began as a government-backed effort to steer young Britons away from right-wing extremism has turned into an unexpected protest symbol against the government itself.
Last week, women wearing purple wigs gathered in London’s Parliament Square to protest illegal immigration and sexual crimes committed by migrants. The demonstration was not unusual in Britain’s current political climate — except for one detail. The protesters were dressed as “Amelia,” a fictional character from an online video game funded by the British Home Office.
The game, “Pathways,” was launched in 2023 with support from the Home Office’s Prevent program, which aims to counter radicalization among youth. Developed by the East Riding of Yorkshire Council and Hull City Council, the interactive platform was designed to help players recognize and respond to extremist content online, particularly narratives associated with the far right.
On the game’s website, it is described as an “interactive learning experience about extremism, radicalization and prevention,” encouraging users to consider how to react to online content and understand the consequences of certain actions.
In the storyline, players control a white teenage character named Charlie, who is encouraged to avoid what the game defines as right-wing extremist ideology. This includes attending protests against the “erosion of British values,” searching for immigration statistics online and sharing videos claiming that “the government is betraying white Britons” and that citizens must “take back control of our country.”
Amelia appears early in the narrative as a college student and political activist involved in right-wing groups. She urges Charlie to join anti-immigration protests and defend “traditional British values.” If players consistently choose the “wrong” options, Charlie may ultimately be referred to the government’s Prevent program over terrorism concerns.
From villain to viral icon
Nearly three years after its release, “Pathways” resurfaced on social media, where critics argued that the activities labeled “extremist” were often mainstream political views and disproportionately targeted white British youth. The backlash transformed Amelia from a cautionary antagonist into a viral symbol of defiance.
Supporters began sharing AI-generated images depicting Amelia as a heroic figure: leading medieval knights into battle, flying above the British Parliament as a superhero, replacing the central figure in Norman Rockwell’s “Freedom of Speech,” or portrayed as the Lady of the Lake presenting King Arthur with Excalibur.
In one widely circulated video, Amelia warns popular British fictional characters — including Harry Potter, members of Monty Python and Paddington Bear — about the dangers of radical Islam. In another, she appears as a British “Power Ranger,” rescuing a girl from a Muslim man. A parody “bad ending” video imagines Charlie and Amelia marrying and having “four white children,” presented as an intentionally provocative twist on the game’s messaging.
The character’s popularity reached a new peak when protesters from the Women’s Safety Initiative appeared in Parliament Square dressed as Amelia, chanting “We are all Amelia.”
The group said it was protesting what it described as sexual crimes committed by illegal migrants and accused the government of sacrificing women’s safety. “We are tired of our safety being sacrificed for the comfort of migrant men,” the organization wrote on X.
One protester invoked the UK’s grooming gang scandals, claiming that “mass immigration has harmed the personal safety of too many women in Britain.”
Government response and broader tensions
The Home Office rejected criticism of the game, stating that the Prevent program has diverted nearly 6,000 individuals from violent ideologies and that such projects are tailored to address local threats.
The controversy comes amid broader political tensions over immigration and national identity. Since Labour returned to power under Prime Minister Keir Starmer, critics argue that the government has failed to curb illegal crossings via the English Channel, while providing migrants with housing and access to services.
At the same time, Britain’s High Court ruled this week that the designation of the activist group Palestine Action as a terrorist organization was unlawful, describing the decision by then-Home Secretary Yvette Cooper as disproportionate. The ruling paves the way for the anti-Israel group to continue operating, though the ban remains in place pending the government’s appeal.
Palestine Action was designated a terrorist organization last July after a series of break-ins and acts of vandalism, including an August 2024 intrusion into an Elbit Systems facility near Bristol, where activists armed with hammers and axes damaged property and clashed with police, and a June 2025 break-in at RAF Brize Norton, where red paint was sprayed on two refueling aircraft.
Following the court’s decision, London’s Metropolitan Police acknowledged that there may be “some confusion” among the public and said officers would no longer arrest individuals solely for association with the group while gathering further evidence.
Against this backdrop, the rise of a fictional video game character as a protest icon underscores the depth of Britain’s culture wars. What was intended as an educational tool to counter extremism has instead become, in the words of one critic, “a spectacular own goal” for the government.

How many non-local students are going to Hong Kong universities since quota rise?
‘We will not rule out reviewing the quota if there is such a need, and the universities’ supporting facilities are ready,’ minister says
Hong Kong public universities had more than 20,000 non-local undergraduate students in the second academic year since the government doubled quotas, a 17 per cent year-on-year increase, as the education minister promised to review the threshold.
The Education University of Hong Kong (EdU) saw the sharpest increase in non-local undergraduate students under the policy, jumping by 90 per cent over three academic years, followed by Baptist University.
Starting in the 2024-25 academic year, the government doubled non-local student admission quotas at public universities to the equivalent of 40 per cent of the number of local students. Authorities plan to raise the threshold to 50 per cent in 2026-27.
Secretary for Education Christine Choi Yuk-lin on Saturday told the media that some universities had nearly reached their quotas for this year, underlining the fast pace of development.
“We will keep an eye on the situation. We will not rule out reviewing the quota if there is such a need, and the universities’ supporting facilities are ready,” she said.
Choi said that a supply of about 5,000 hostel places could be increased under a scheme to accommodate more non-local students by allowing private developers or operators to convert commercial buildings into student hostels.

Eat like an Olympian: what athletes need to eat during the Games and how nutrition helps performance

During the Winter Olympic Games, thousands of athletes have breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the facilities. What are they eating, and what role does nutrition play in the competition?
At the heart of the 2026 Winter Olympic Games’ experience is the food, which, for high-performance athletes, is not only a way of discovering the rich Italian cuisine but also provides fuel for the competition.
Every day, more than 10,000 meals are prepared across the different villages and facilities.
According to the organisation of the games, in the Milan Olympic Village alone, the kitchens serve around 3,000 eggs and approximately 450 kilograms of pasta daily.
In the 24-hour canteens, athletes can find balanced meals to help fight jet lag and help with training, high-protein diets for cross-country skiiers, lighter ones for bobsleighers, and options for vegans, celiacs, and religious traditions, according to the Italian Minstry for Infrastructure and Transport.
"Food as energy, but also as a universal language and a tool for inclusion: in villages like the one in Cortina, everything revolves around one principle,” reads a press release from the Ministry.
“Those arriving from the other side of the world will be able to eat as if they were at home, without compromising their preparation or recovery,” it added.
Routine is vital
Nutrition is key for professional athletes, even more so during intense periods of activity such as competing in the Olympic Games.
“People don’t realise how much their body needs,” Olivia Morgan, dietitian and sports nutrition expert at Mass General Brigham in Boston, told Euronews Health.
She stressed that the core to athlete nutrition is to make sure the energy intake matches the demands of their performance, especially during intense periods.
Morgan, who has experience working with Olympic athletes, noted the importance of making sure that nutrition still fits amid the travel, the new environment, the change in routine, and heightened emotions.
“Making sure, as always, that we're hitting our intervals throughout the day and keeping to things that we know we enjoy and that work really well for our body and enjoying the really fun things afterwards,” she added.
Special characteristics of winter sports
These days in Italy, we can witness sports from nordic skiing, to figure skating and biathlon. Winter sports have their own specificities and demands, which is the same as when it comes to food.
“If we're looking at more of the Nordic sports, the demands of the training, a lot of times, exceed potentially competition times”, Kelly Drager, lead performance dietitian at the Canada Sport Institute Alberta, working with the country’s Olympic athletes, told Euronews Health.
She added that winter athletes often train voluminously and have very intense periods during the summer months as preparation.
Even with the special circumstances under which winter athletes compete, Drager said, things are changing and weather, even in winter is less and less extreme.
Another aspect to consider for winter athletes is that they are usually travelling and competing during the peak of respiratory viruses such as influenza.
Carbs, carbs, carbs
Italy is world-renowned for its pasta and pizza, which, during the games, may be athletes’ closest allies.
“I think protein has been a major focus in society right now, but really, for athletes, carbohydrates are kind of the king,” Morgan said.
According to her, many have the misconception that protein is more important for athletes than carbohydrates, and emphasise it more in their diet.
“What happens is we just get a ton of protein and not enough carbs, we're not really able to utilize all of that protein for its designated purpose”, she added.
Italian style is at the heart of the menus, the organisers have said, with pasta and pizza at the center of the carbohydrate stations.
Together with local cold cuts, cheeses, fruits, and desserts, they aim to give the athletes an “authentic taste of Italy.”
The importance of “boring balance”
For Morgan, at the core of good nutrition are the basics: five pieces of fruit or vegetables a day, balanced meals, and the occasional cheeky treat – all while maintaining a regular schedule.
“We need to eat balanced meals consistently throughout the day, and it's boring nutrition; nobody wants to listen to it. They want to follow a fancy diet. They want to take a fancy supplement. But the real roots of nutrition are in that boring balance,” Morgan added.
She explained that, especially for athletes, who demand so much from their bodies, even the smallest misses in these basics tend to have bigger consequences.
Yet, food is not only fuel, nutrition experts warn. There has to be enjoyment, satisfaction, and a good relationship with the body.
“The body is not just a machine and food is just not a means to an end”, Drager said, adding that at her work in Canada, individual preferences and cultural variances also play a key role in nutrition.

‘The time of monsters’: everyone is quoting Gramsci – but what did he actually say?
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

08:00:47 UTC
17:00:47 KST

At a time when geopolitical certainties of old are crumbling away, it has become the go-to quote to make sense of the current moment in all its seeming senselessness. “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters” is a line attributed to the former Italian Communist party leader Antonio Gramsci.
Over the last two months alone, it has been quoted – and often mangled – by a rightwing Belgian prime minister, a leftwing British political leader, an Irish central banker and in the title of the most recent BBC Reith lecture, given by the author Rutger Bregman.
“We can’t let the monsters win,” influencers earnestly warn their followers on Instagram; on LinkedIn, business consultants post graphs that visualise the “Gramsci gap” and its relevance to corporate strategy.
The only problem is, Gramsci never said or wrote such a thing. Or at least not in the snappy wording that has made it go viral.
“The time of monsters” powerfully sums up the repulsion and disbelief many people feel about the news in 2026 – whether it’s emanating from the White House, the Epstein files or the battlefields of Ukraine. It evokes Goya’s famous etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters as much as contemporary pop culture.
“It has an apocalyptical feel, like when the Demogorgon appears at the end of Stranger Things,” said Peter Thomas, a historian of political thought and a Gramsci expert at Brunel University of London.
But in the notebooks that Gramsci filled with his thoughts on political theory, philosophy and linguistics after being imprisoned by the Italian fascist government in November 1926, there is no mention of monsters. In the original Italian, he wrote: “In questo interregno si verificano i fenomeni morbosi più svariati.”
The most widely used translation of the Prison Notebooks, by the British academics Quintin Hoare and Geoffrey Nowell Smith in 1971, renders this as: “In this interregnum a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.” Not quite so pithy.
An alternative 1996 edition by Joseph Buttigieg, the late father of the former US transport secretary Pete Buttigieg, talks of morbid “phenomena” instead of “symptoms”. Still, no mention of monsters.
The first recorded English use of “time of monsters” in connection with Gramsci is in a 2010 article in the New Left Review by the Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek titled A Permanent Economic Emergency. In this context, the quote lends poetic gravitas to the challenge that the eurozone’s banking crisis posed to the left.
However, when approached about why he had chosen to poetically refashion the original Italian, Žižek insisted the monsters were not his. “I DON’T REMEMBER anything about it, but I am sure that I took the word from somewhere else,” he told the Guardian in an email.
In fact, a French version of the same phrase predates the moment it was popularised by Žižek in English. “Dans ce clair-obscur surgissent les monstres,” the French economist and urbanist Gustave Massiah wrote in a 2003 essay – “in this twilight monsters arise”. The phrase “dans cet interrègne surgissent les monstres” was used in the pages of Le Monde as early as 1996.
While the exact origin of Gramsci’s monsters remains elusive, there are wider reasons why the Italian intellectual’s ideas remain so potent today. Published in 1947, years after Gramsci’s death, the Prison Notebooks were written during concentrated periods in which the communist thinker was allowed pen and paper in his cell. “They distill a lot of things Gramsci had on his mind, so they are incredibly precise, at least for an Italian,”said Silvio Pons, the president of Rome’s Gramsci institute.
The notebooks did not go truly global until after the cold war, with translations into more than 40 languages, but their central idea has proven electric for activists for much longer.
“When Gramsci wrote the Prison Notebooks, he was trying to make sense of why there hadn’t been a socialist or communist revolution in Italy before the fascist takeover,” said Marzia Maccaferri, a political historian at Queen Mary University in London. “And the key concept to emerge from that thought process is his theory of hegemony: that the ruling class can rule not only through coercion, but also through the intersection of popular and high culture, through intellectual and civil society.”
In continental Europe, this cultural turn inspired many of the student revolutionaries of 1968, while in Britain it provided a theoretical framework that Marxist sociologists such as Stuart Hall applied to Thatcherism in the 1980s.
As early as the 1970s, however, Gramsci’s ideas were co-opted by the chief thinker of France’s Nouvelle Droite, or “new right”, Alain de Benoist. The attempt to centre far-right politics on cultural rather than racial identities can be seen in the former Trump strategist Steve Bannon’s dictum that “all politics is downstream of culture”, and in many of the key figures of the contemporary European far right.
The Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán’s master’s thesis applied Gramci’s ideas to Poland’s Solidarność (Solidarity) movement; in Italy, Giorgia Meloni’s culture minister recently published a book called Gramsci è vivo (Gramsci is Alive).
The “time of monsters” quote may have captured the minds of politicians and thinkers of today but many feel it strips Gramsci of the activist zeal that he embodied for previous generations.
“Monsters are something exceptional, an inverted miracle that comes out of nowhere with no real explanation,” Thomas said. “It’s a metaphor that shuts off the possibility of trying to think through what is occurring. We get outraged or shocked at the monstrosity of these Trumpian figures, rather than trying to work out what produced it.”
Before his imprisonment, Gramsci spent two formative years in revolutionary Russia, where he is said to have witnessed proof that a new world, in spite of its struggles, could eventually be reborn.
“It was almost inconceivable for him that whatever temporary setbacks he would have to suffer, we wouldn’t eventually arrive at a victory,” Thomas said. “We probably find it a little bit harder to think like that.”

Great Barrier Reef calling: Chinese tourists make Australia a Lunar New Year hotspot
Bookings projected to surge on new flights, flexible itineraries and ease of payment
Industry insiders said the lure of wine, seafood, nature and flexible small-group itineraries was driving interest in the island country.
Australia is projected to attract “the most travellers from China” during the break, with bookings likely to more than double over last year’s total, according to Trip.com’s 2026 Lunar New Year travel forecast.
The report highlighted natural wonders such as the Great Barrier Reef and the outback’s landscapes as among the most appealing attractions.
Total trip spending from China, Australia’s top market, reached A$12.3 billion (US$8.7 billion) for the year ending in September 2025, according to Tourism Australia, a government promotional agency.
Nick Henderson, Tourism Australia’s regional general manager for Greater China, pointed to wine tours, Melbourne’s cafe culture and the Sydney Fish Market as top attractions.

Obama turns media into tool of left-wing propaganda — Russian envoy

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Former US President Barack Obama (2009-2017) and his team turned traditional media into a propaganda machine, Russian special presidential envoy for investment and economic cooperation with foreign countries and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) CEO, Kirill Dmitriev, said.
"Obama and his team carefully shaped legacy media into a leftist propaganda machine that ‘surprisingly’ always protects Obama," he wrote on X, commenting on a post about the connections of former White House Counsel to Obama Kathryn Ruemmler with US financier Jeffrey Epstein. According to the post, they exchanged more than 11,000 emails, but this information was suppressed.
"Are any corrections possible to this fake narrative machine that silences anything that does not fit the narrative? What and who controls the machine?" Dmitriev concluded.
Epstein was detained by New York State law enforcement on July 6, 2019. The prosecutor’s office said there was evidence that in 2002-2005 he organized visits to his home in Manhattan by dozens of underage girls, the youngest of whom was 14 years old. Epstein’s friends and acquaintances included a large number of current and retired officials not only from the United States, but also from many other countries, major entrepreneurs and show business stars.
The criminal prosecution of the financier was terminated after his suicide in a prison cell in August 2019. Notably, Epstein’s acquaintances included the 42nd US President Bill Clinton and the current President Donald Trump, as well as the brother of British King Charles III, ex-Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.

Public fury as China mental hospitals recruit people to impersonate patients in insurance scam
‘Healthy’ so-called patients lured into psychiatric facilities with promise of long, cheap stay; receive little treatment, face ‘beatings’
A number of psychiatric hospitals in central China have been exposed over a scam in which they lure healthy people to become patients in a bid to defraud the public medical insurance scheme.
According to an undercover report by the Beijing News, most of the patients in such privately run psychiatric institutions in Xiangyang, Hubei province, do not show any abnormal behaviour and receive little treatment.
The healthy individuals told the newspaper that they stayed there because of a “free hospitalisation, free living costs” promise on offer.
In China, patients have to bear a percentage of their medical bills; public insurance covers the rest.
After they are admitted, they become cash cows for the hospital because the institutions use their personal information and fabricate medical treatments to swindle funds from the medical insurance scheme, the report said.

Britain’s most-loved car goes electric as Everrati plans iconic Mini revival
Exclusive: Original Mini to be reborn as a £155,000 electric car by British specialist Everrati
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
In a Valentine’s Day exclusive, The Independent can reveal that Britain’s most-loved car is set for an electric rebirth. Oxfordshire-based car specialist Everrati has confirmed plans to build a zero-emissions version of the original Mini. The 1960s classic is widely regarded as Britain’s best-loved and most iconic car. Made famous by Twiggy and The Beatles, it was etched into motorsport folklore by Monte Carlo Rally winner Paddy Hopkirk.
For Everrati founder Justin Lunny, the Mini is more than just another model in the company’s growing portfolio of electrified classics. “I think it’s one of the most emotionally important cars ever built,” he told me. “We’ve all got a Mini memory.”
The project began, perhaps surprisingly, with a request from overseas. Lunny says Everrati was approached by the family office of a Middle Eastern prince who wanted a bespoke electric Mini inspired by high-end restomod projects of the past. “He loved what we do and he said, ‘could you do this for us?’” Lunny explained. That one-off commission quickly evolved into something more strategic.
“We then looked at it and said, actually, as an entry-level Everrati, it’s a great car. It’s a car people absolutely love. It’s one that to many people is a very emotional car.”
Everrati’s approach to the Mini makeover mirrors that used on its electric Porsche 911, Mercedes-Benz Pagoda and Land Rover models.
Each donor Mini will be stripped back to a bare shell, restored and rebuilt with a bespoke electric powertrain, with many of the specialist parts that go into the other Everrati models finding their way into the Mini, too.
Lunny insists the ethos is preservation rather than reinvention. “The whole point of it is not to ruin these cars. It’s about respecting them and actually creating something that is going to be fun, engaging, and used for generations to come as well.”
The Mini’s compact dimensions dictate modest battery packaging, with a targeted range of around 110 to 120 miles – meaning the car will be aimed squarely at urban use rather than motorway touring, exactly as the original was. Charging is currently via a 7kW AC system, designed primarily for overnight home charging.
Crucially, Lunny says the car will look like “just a beautifully restored Mini”. Everrati avoids cutting or structurally altering original body shells wherever possible and does not tamper with chassis architecture. Suspension and braking are subtly upgraded to cope with the electric drivetrain, but the visual integrity remains intact. “You don’t need to do anything with it,” Lunny said. “People love it for what it is.”
Everrati Mini prices start at £155,000, plus the donor car and local taxes. That places the Mini well below Everrati’s average vehicle price, which over the past 12 months has been just under half a million US dollars (£367,000) before those taxes and donor car costs. The Mini is therefore positioned as the most more accessible entry point into the brand, albeit at £155,000.
Everrati itself was founded after Lunny exited a technology business and – as a lifelong car enthusiast – he began questioning how classic motoring could coexist with environmental concerns. He recalls his daughter, then seven or eight, worrying about climate change. At the same time, he was inspired by the electric Jaguar E-type Zero revealed at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s royal wedding in Windsor. “The goal was always to create the world’s most iconic electric cars,” said Lunny.
That ambition has since expanded beyond retail conversions. Around 70 per cent of Everrati’s cars are now delivered to US clients, and the company has developed a separate “Powered by Everrati” division that’s set to supply turnkey electric powertrains to low-volume manufacturers.
The Everrati engineering team includes former McLaren, Bentley, Jaguar Land Rover, Rimac and Formula One engineers, while each vehicle undergoes a full re-engineering process that goes well beyond replacing engine and gearbox. Weight distribution, centre of gravity, dial design, switchgear, air conditioning and software calibration are all considered. “We don’t just convert a car,” Lunny said.
In some cases, that process can be extensive. A forthcoming electric Lamborghini LM002 project for a Middle Eastern client involves detailed 3D scanning and a complete rethink of the vehicle architecture. Yet Everrati is selective. The company has declined requests to electrify certain historically significant models unless damaged examples could be sourced. “We said no, it’s too important a car,” Lunny recalled of one proposal.
Inside, discreet modernisation is allowed. Apple CarPlay, upgraded audio systems and heating are integrated but hidden behind period-correct fascia designs, while heated seats can also be added.
While Everrati sees itself as proudly British, expansion into North America is on the horizon, with plans for a Southern California facility to serve its largest market and support business-to-business opportunities.
For now, though, it is the Mini – small, cheeky and unmistakably British – that takes centre stage. More than six decades after Sir Alec Issigonis created a packaging revolution on four wheels, and after celebrities and rally heroes cemented its place in the nation’s affections, the original Mini is preparing for a new electrified chapter.

Away from the headlines, microplastics field grapples with tricky questions
The year was 1966. The Soviets landed on the moon, the Beatles were more popular than Jesus, and plastic was still a miracle.
On the golden sands of Hawaii, Karl Kenyon and Eugene Kridler began the long unwinding of that view.
That year, hundreds of native Laysan albatrosses had died, their remains scattered across the sand. Kenyon and Kridler surveyed their stomaches. There, among the leftover squid, they found plastic. Lots of plastic. Caps, bags, fragments of toys.
In the ’60s, perhaps 10 million tonnes of plastic a year was produced globally. By 2010, that number was past 300 million and growing.
Plastic is strong, and over the intervening decades scientists discovered it breaks down but rarely vanishes completely. In 2004, researchers studying archived plankton discovered microscopic plastics – microplastics, they called them – alongside the tiny creatures as far back as the ’60s. Every decade, concentrations increased.
Microplastics are everywhere, from the deep sea to the Arctic, from plankton to apex predators, in dirt and at the summit of Mount Everest and up in the atmosphere.
“The quantities of plastics we’re talking about are vast. Beyond any normal exposure to anything we would expect,” says Professor David Hamilton, the director of the Australian Rivers Institute who has studied microplastics in Australia’s waterways.
And now, in a series of papers that have attracted global headlines, scientists have started finding them inside us. Headlines warn the “Human Brain May Contain as Much as a Spoon’s Worth of Microplastics”, or that we are consuming “the equivalent of a credit card worth of plastic every week”.
It is tempting to panic. But a survey of microplastics researchers reveals a more nuanced picture. Many are concerned about the health impacts, but they are also concerned about the rigour of the science.
“They are not very robust findings at all, to be blunt,” says Oliver Jones, a professor of analytical chemistry at RMIT, who has published on measuring microplastics. “Some of it is biologically implausible. There’s no way you eat a credit card of plastic a week. Or a plastic spoon in your brain.”
Let’s start with a study that appears to closely link microplastics with bad health outcomes.
In 2024, researchers looked at 304 patients undergoing surgery to clear the plaque out of clogged arteries in the neck. In 150 of those patients, the researchers found polyethylene in the plaque; some also had polyvinyl chloride. Those with plastic-contaminated plaques were 4.5 times more likely to have a stroke or die.
But if microplastics are everywhere, it means they are in hospitals. They are in surgeries. The devices used to do delicate work inside the arteries are often coated in plastic, which is known to shed. How much plastic in the study was from the environment, and how much was accidental contamination?
“There are plastics everywhere, essentially. That’s a challenge in keeping your blank measurements clean,” says Professor Kevin Thomas, the director of the Queensland Alliance for Environmental Health Sciences who studies ways to measure microplastics.
Counting large plastics – like fragments in the belly of an albatross – can be done manually. But the microplastics scientists are now trying to study are so small, measured in nanometres, they are beginning to reach the absolute limits of detection.
“Hypothetically, they are the ones we should be worried about, because they have the ability to cross the gut-blood barrier, or the air-blood barrier if we breathe them in,” says Thomas. But as particles get smaller, detection gets dramatically harder. “This is where I think we have maybe underestimated the challenge.”
Many of these detections rely, for now, on an approach called pyrolysis-gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry.
Scientists start with a sample of plastic, which is placed in a furnace. The heat vaporises the sample, before the mass-spectrometer tries to identify each molecule.
Unfortunately polyethylene, the world’s most commonly produced plastic, just so happens to break down after pyrolysis into compounds that are identical to the compounds you get after breaking down human fat.
Recall the suggestion we may have as much as a plastic spoon’s worth of plastic in our brains. The brain also happens to be about 60 per cent fat, higher than any other organ.
“If you have any residual fat in your sample, it can produce the same triplet of hydrocarbons,” says Thomas. “For samples that are high fat, even the most robust filtration measure may not eliminate all the fat.”
Let’s assume, for a moment, microplastics are penetrating our bodies. What are they doing to us?
A 2025 review led by Dr Nicholas Chartres, senior research fellow at the University of Sydney, found harms to reproductive, respiratory and digestive health, with a possible link to colon and gut cancer.
“Unless we turn the tap off now and we ban all single-use, non-essential plastic … we are going to have one of the great human crises in the next 20 or 30 years,” Chartres told this masthead.
But the field is nascent. Looking at those three areas, the review found 28 animal studies to include, and just three human studies (one from Iran, another from Turkey) covering 163 people.
If we aren’t confident of the exact levels of microplastic exposure, it is harder to make sense of the animal data. Some studies use concentrations of microplastics “higher than anything you’d be exposed to unless you went and ground up a bunch of plastic and breathed in the dust,” says Hayden Gillings, a PhD candidate in nanoplastics and health at Flinders University. “It’s definitely something that needs to be taken with a grain of salt.”
And how do we disentangle any signal of microplastic-harms from all the other negative effects from environmental exposures we face every day, like air pollution or junk food?
“It’s really tricky to measure what people are exposed to, and then to link that to health effects, because people are exposed to lots of stuff. If someone gets liver disease, is that because they were exposed to a lot of plastic, or because they drank a lot of alcohol?” says Oliver Jones. “I don’t think we can say with any certainty what the health impacts are.”
The study of microplastics is a new field, behaving in the way new fields do: first comes excitement, then comes scepticism. The challenge now is rigour. Most experts who spoke to this masthead were confident the problems with measurement could, eventually, be surmounted.
The question for now is: how worried should we be, and what should we do?
“Do you want to wait a few more decades to see if these things made from oil or gas and 16,000 chemicals harm us?” Chartres asks. Mark Green, an associate professor in reproductive biology at the University of Melbourne, agrees. “We are better to have a precautionary approach, than to wait 20 or 50 years time for damaging evidence.”
Even Kevin Thomas, whose work has raised important questions about the accuracy of microplastic measurements, tries to minimise his exposure. He does not use plastic containers or a plastic chopping board.
“You are definitely being exposed to plastics. The key thing we’re trying to find out in the work we do here is, of that proportion of plastics, what happens to them when we inhale them,” he says. “That’s where the uncertainty is at the moment.”

Starmer has grasped what his predecessors would not – that Britain is better off in Europe than with the US
The prime minister has shown that the UK needs to stand with the friends it needs – not an American ally that doesn’t need Britain, writes world affairs editor Sam Kiley from Kyiv

Keir Starmer is announcing a pivot away from America and towards Europe in the most radical shift in British foreign policy for decades – re-setting the UK’s place in a world that will diminish America’s power.
There will be consternation in some quarters of the nation’s armed forces, particularly the Special Forces, but ending the junior partner status of Britain under the US puts an end to the fantasy of the Special Relationship.
The PM has grasped a barbed wire nettle many of his predecessors could not even see when he stands up at the Munich Security Conference to say: “There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history – and it is today’s reality too.”
He has insisted the US remains an indispensable ally. But he is now insisting that America is no longer the only ally and recognising that Washington is not even a reliable friend.
It has been a long time coming. But it has not always been the case.
Until the end of the Cold War, Britain and the US had a more equal partnership. It was underpinned by the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship with Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the US and UK, but London showed fierce independence.
The UK stayed out of the Vietnam War. The US gave little to no support to Britain’s recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982.
When the US led a multinational UN-sanctioned mission to end warlordism and mass starvation in Somalia in 1992, France, Turkey, Morocco, Pakistan and numerous other nations joined a mission of noble intent. But not Britain.
In those days, it was recognised by a British defence attache in Washington, a major general, that the “special relationship is special to us but not to the Americans”.
“They’re polite and courtly and always seem to listen. Then they close the door behind us when we’ve gone and ignore what we said. It made us feel important but we mattered little to them,” he said before the UK joined the US in the ill-fated war in Iraq and the two-decade fiasco of Afghanistan.
In taking Britain into the Iraq war, the UK became a sub-unit of the US military and in the decade of the so called war on terror that followed, that status was cemented by under-funding and over reliance on the equipment known as “enablers” – the satellite imagery, air transport and refuelling, and the logistics chains that the US leads the world in providing.
Then, last year, 80 years of assumptions about the UK’s future defences were upended by the Trump administration when the junior relationship was downgraded.
Writing on Substack this week, Tom Tugendhat, a Tory backbencher and former chair of the defence select committee (and former front-line intelligence officer) said: “British defence policy rested on four pillars. The assumption of automatic American support. The credibility of Nato as a guaranteed security provider. The stability of long-term defence planning. And the political consensus that defence could remain a secondary concern. Within the first fifty days of Donald Trump’s return to the White House, all four were effectively dismantled.”
Britain’s Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service, each (officially) comprising four squadrons of Tier 1 “operators”, are the only units with which the UK and US are on parity. The Americans have about the same number of their most highly trained soldiers.
For the last 25 years, they have worked hand in glove. Britain’s military reputation with the US has largely rested on this relationship; even though the UK lacked the specialist equipment and aircraft their cousins could call on, they enjoyed access to the very best kit through that relationship.
Elsewhere, the UK has fared less well from the relationship. In Iraq, American and Iraqi troops had to bail the British out of a disastrous campaign in Basra and the south of the country. In Helmand, embattled British-led troops in southern Afghanistan were again bailed out by a 30,000-person surge by US Marines.
For the Americans, it has been good to have the British along. Frontline soldiers deeply appreciated the panache and bravery of the UK’s fighting men and women. But they were never militarily necessary.
The British army, now around 72,000, is less than half the size of the US Marine Corps, 172,000. Active service personnel in the whole of the British armed forces are less than the marines can field – and on top of that, the marines have their own jets, transport, artillery and ships. They can operate with far greater direct punch and autonomy than the British. There are more of them, they have better equipment, and they’re all from the same unit.
The threat to the UK is from Russia. So it makes sense to concentrate military efforts and improve military capacity in Europe, and with European forces.
“We are not the Britain of the Brexit years anymore. Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward - we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen,” the prime minister said.
“I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well.”
He is right to argue that Europe and the UK need to invest in their own arms manufacturing capability and wean themselves off American-made equipment. A rapid end to duplication across the continent will be essential for the region to better cope with the autonomy that Trump is thrusting upon it with his threats against Greenland and his general contempt for Nato.
Britain’s Royal Navy is the most powerful in Europe, with two aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, with the total tonnage of vessels greater than the German, French and Italian Navies combined. France has more people in her forces, around 200,000, and a larger army, but the UK has more specialised units focused on fast deployment.
Poland’s forces are fast-growing, with around 215,000 on active service, and it is arming at a staggering pace. Turkey is Nato’s second largest force of about 440,000 after the US (1.3 million).
But in more directly working in Europe and as a European nation, the UK’s forces will have the opportunity to be the first among equals in cooperating over defending against a real and present danger in the Kremlin, and dealing with Moscow’s grey, or hybrid, war that’s already being fought across Europe.
They’ll be joined, no doubt, by Ukraine’s 800,000-plus battle-hardened veterans and Kyiv’s fast-growing military-industrial sector.
“We want to bring our leadership in defence, tech and AI together with Europe – to multiply our strengths and build a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production,” Sir Keir said.
Trump has insisted that is what he wants to see. But when it starts to happen, an independent Europe will leave America much enfeebled.

Teaching Jewish happiness after October 7: An educator's fresh approach to Jewish pride
Unknown

VIENNA – How can we teach happiness in a post-October 7 world? And how can we focus Jewish education on pride, success, and victory, rather than trauma and oppression?
These are some of the key questions facing Jewish leaders, educators, and parents today.
Research suggests post-traumatic stress disorder has risen sharply since the October 7 attack, with a significant number of adult and adolescent Israelis showing symptoms of post-trauma. Though figures in the Diaspora are less precise, the rise in antisemitism and the increasing isolation of Jewish communities have led many Diaspora Jews to experience similar trauma.
However, some experts believe focusing on positivity and happiness may be the most effective approach to trauma and Jewish growth.
One of these experts is Dr. Tal Ben-Shahar, an Israeli professor and writer in the areas of positive psychology and leadership. Ben-Shahar has taught happiness studies at Columbia University, and now runs fully accredited MA and PhD programs in happiness studies with Centenary University.
'The first secret to happiness'
“My answer is that there are three secrets to happiness,” Ben-Shahar told The Jerusalem Post at the Yael Foundation conference in Vienna. “The first secret to happiness is reality. The second secret to happiness is reality. Third secret, reality.”
This, he explained, means focusing on our successes. “That’s part of reality that has largely been ignored, whether it’s by the Jewish community or whether it’s by the psychology tradition, the 20th-century psychology that mostly focuses on psychopathology. And positive psychology says let’s focus on what works, let’s focus on the positive.”
Within the Jewish community, and especially within Jewish education, there is often a focus on the traumatic past – the Holocaust, pogroms, expulsions. While Ben-Shahar said it is important to learn about past suffering, he stressed it is also important to learn about the amazing history that we have and the accomplishments.
“Just focusing on the suffering is unhealthy. It’s as unhealthy as, within a relationship, a couple only talking about their problems. Again, with good intentions, because we want to fix them. But if you only talk about problems, you live your problems. And you become them.”
Take Israel, for example. Israel is a country that faces threats from multiple fronts and has a deeply traumatic past, but it is also the Start-Up Nation. And it is also consistently ranked as one of the happiest countries in the world.
“Why is Israel one of the happiest countries in the world? Despite all of our challenges? The main reason is because of relationships. It’s a real focus in Israel, whether it’s on Shabbat, dinner with your family. And that explains why Israel is among the happiest countries in the world. And that also explains why Israelis are so resilient.
“And secondly: giving, generosity. Whether it’s charity, whether it’s helping someone in need, whether it’s just listening to someone. Of course, when we help other people, we are also helping ourselves. We become happier and we become more resilient and more likely to experience post-traumatic growth.”
Researchers estimate that roughly half to two-thirds of people who experience a traumatic event also experience post-traumatic growth. Post-traumatic growth is a positive psychological transformation that can occur after struggling with highly challenging, traumatic life experiences. It involves profound shifts in perspective such as deeper appreciation for life, enhanced relationships, and increased personal strength.
Ben-Shahar referenced a favorite phrase of his by Eknath Easwaran, an Indian-born meditation teacher and professor of English.
“He says we become what we meditate on. We become what we talk about. We become what we repeatedly say. So, again, I’m not saying ignore the Holocaust, just like we shouldn’t ignore October 7. But there are also amazing things that are happening.
Jewish pride
“They say about Gandhi that the most important thing he did for India was that he made India proud of itself. We need to learn Jewish pride, Israeli pride, because we do have a lot to be proud of.”
Jewish pride and how to spark it in the next generations were at the heart of Ben-Shahar’s discussion with the Post. He explained that part of invoking pride comes from making Judaism relevant for Jewish children.
“If I tell children Shabbat is important and it’s also in the Torah, it’s one thing; many kids will be persuaded by that. However, if you say: listen to this research showing that if you take a day off during the week you’ll not just be happier, you’ll be healthier and more successful overall, more children may be encouraged to keep the Sabbath.
“Or if you tell them you should say Modeh Ani in the morning, that’s one thing. If you tell them that if you express gratitude in a regular way you’ll be happier, healthier, and more successful, that’s another layer.”
He provided the example of the research of Martin Seligman, the founder of the field of positive psychology and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
He said Seligman asks teachers and parents two questions. “‘What would you most want for your children?’ The parents tell him they want their child to be happy, or they want their child to have good relationships, or they want their child to be resilient or healthy. And Seligman adds these to a list. Then he asks them a second question: ‘What are children learning in school?’ And he makes a list of math, language, geography, history, biology, and so on.”
What becomes clear is that there is almost no overlap between the two lists.
“It’s unfortunate, especially today given the fact that we have a science of happiness. So we know how to teach happiness. We know how to help children and adults be more resilient, have better relationships, and become happier. Why aren’t schools focusing on that as well? Why aren’t schools in Israel or Jewish schools around the world connecting between our tradition and what the science of happiness has to offer?”
Ben-Shahar also advocates for more physical exercise, something which he says is essential for emotional well-being.
“It’s important for physical well-being and for psychological well-being. I absolutely think it’s lacking in schools. Schools teach math, but they don’t have enough funding for PE. Children who exercise regularly will also sit down to do science better. They’ll be less distracted. One of the best ways to deal with ADHD is through movement. One of the best ways to enhance creativity and innovation is by cultivating healthy relationships. They’re connected.
“Children now spend unprecedented amounts of time on smartphones, a trend increasingly linked to anxiety and depression. One of the dangers of the phone generation is that children have more exposure to hatred, antisemitism, and potentially traumatic content. While antisemitism isn’t new, it’s taken a different form in the digital age.”
Do children have the tools and facilities to be able to deal with that?
“I don’t think so,” said Ben-Shahar. “One of the reasons why we founded The David Project [his public diplomacy organization] all those years ago was because Jewish schools or Jewish children and adults were not receiving the tools to be able to deal with attacks against Israel. When I was teaching, I used to say we need to learn to go on the offensive without being offensive.
“So we shouldn’t just passively receive all the lies and distortions that are being promoted in the media worldwide and certainly in social media worldwide. We need to stand up for Israel and fight.”
Ben-Shahar lamented how some Jewish students – predominantly those who do not go to Jewish schools – not only do not care about Israel, but some are opposed to the very existence of a Jewish state.
“We need to teach our children to not just stand up for Israel, not just understand why we have a right to this land, but why this is also a moral and righteous cause. To stand for Israel and to put Israel at the epicenter of good versus evil. It’s our goal to be that candle in a dark room.”
Ben-Shahar thinks that, both Israel and in the Diaspora, there has to be much more focus on the “Jewish” in “Jewish education.” He noted that, in Israel, children who do not go to Jewish religious school, get “very, very little” Jewish education. “In fact, there is also antagonism towards it.
“In the Diaspora we need to continue with Jewish education, to connect it to their daily life, so [we continue] this bridge between modern research and ancient wisdom.
“We need to learn Jewish pride, Israeli pride,” he said, “because we have a lot to be proud of.”

Traditional date of the first difference of opinion between Shammai and Hillel, the last of the zugot (“pairs”) who led the Jewish people after the Great Assembly. Each school had its mass following, contradictory decisions were handed down (in general, Beit Shammai was stricter than Beit Hillel), and divergent customs were adopted.
Nevertheless, the followers of each school, with a few rare exceptions, continued to treat each other with mutual respect, trust, and affection, and the disagreements were “for the sake of heaven.”
Feb. 27, 1928

Israel’s High Court of Justice ruled that the government must recognize conversions by the Reform and Masorti (Conservative) movements in Israel for the purposes of citizenship, ending a 15-year legal saga. (In 1988, the High Court had ruled that non-Orthodox conversions performed outside of Israel must be recognized; but it did not extend that recognition to non-Orthodox conversions performed in Israel itself.)
March 2, 1859
Birthday of Shalom Aleichem (Solomon Rabinovitz), writer/playwright born in Ukraine, known as the “Yiddish Mark Twain,” whose stories were made into the musical hit Fiddler on the Roof.
The humor and pathos with which he portrayed the simple lives of the shtetl were unmatched by any other Yiddish writer. Upon his death in 1916, some 200,000 people, many of them immigrants from the shtetl, followed his funeral cortège from Manhattan to his burial site in Queens. “No matter how bad things get, you got to go on living, even if it kills you,” he wrote.
Adar 14: 3405 (356 BCE)
Jews throughout the Persian Empire were victorious in their battles against Haman’s antisemitic mobs seeking to kill them, an event we commemorate today with the Purim holiday. We read the megillah (Scroll of Esther), dress up in costumes, and joyously celebrate how the Jews of Persia narrowly escaped real genocide, thanks to the bravery of Esther and Mordechai.

March 10, 1951
In Iraq, a law was passed freezing the assets of all Jews who had left the country and not returned. An estimated $200 million (equivalent to over $2 billion in 2020) worth of property belonging to more than 123,000 Jews who had been forced to flee from Iraq during 1948-1951 was taken over by the state and never returned.

Birthday of Albert Einstein, the greatest theoretical physicist of the 20th century, one of history’s most brilliant and original scientists, and Time Magazine’s Person of the Century. He postulated particles of light called photons, a concept that inspired the quantum theory and earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics.
He discovered the Theory of Relativity and formulated the equation E=MC2, which pioneered the atomic age.
In 1939, when he learned that Germany was working on an atomic bomb, he spearheaded the Manhattan Project. After WW II however, he headed a committee of scientists urging a ban on nuclear bombs. Esteemed for his wit, modesty, and integrity, in 1952 he was offered the presidency of Israel as successor to Chaim Weizmann, but he declined.
March 15, 1860
Birthday of Waldemar Mordechai Haffkine, Russian-born bacteriologist who developed the first effective vaccine against cholera (inoculating himself first!) and the serum therapy against the plague, in the process saving countless lives. The Haffkine Institute in Bombay, which he headed, is still one of the leading infectious disease clinics in India.
Adar 27, 3174 (587 BCE)
King Tzidkiyahu (Zedekiah), the last king of the royal house of David to reign in the Holy Land, died in Babylonia. He had ruled for 11 years, rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, was captured, and languished in the royal dungeon in Babylonia until Nebuchadnezzar’s son and successor freed him. Tzidkiyahu died shortly thereafter.
March 17, 1992

Minneapolis left to decide future of streetside memorials to 2 people killed by federal officers
Minneapolis left to decide future of streetside memorials to 2 people killed by federal officers
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — As the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota winds down, Minneapolis will need to decide how to manage makeshift memorial sites for two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents last month.
Piles of flowers, signs and artwork swiftly formed to commemorate the lives of Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the locations where they were fatally shot. The memorials are the site of candlelight vigils and musical performances and draw a regular stream of visitors.
The public grieving spots echo the community-driven memorial to George Floyd, who was murdered in 2020 by a police officer less than one mile (1.61 kilometers) from Good’s killing. It took the city more than five years to figure out how to officially memorialize the site of George Floyd Square, and construction is set to begin this year.
Now, the city has two more high-profile memorials to manage.
A memorial for Good sprung up within hours of her Jan. 7 killing on a Minneapolis street.
And before the smell of tear gas used by federal agents had dissipated on the day of Pretti’s killing on Jan. 24, Minneapolis protesters were already using branches, police tape and candles to mark the space. Later, people placed crosses, stuffed animals, American flags and images of Pretti.
Minnesota resident Karel Hoffmann said that while she remained outraged with Good and Pretti’s killings, the memorials represented community solidarity.
“This is so unfair, the trauma, for everyone, is too much,” Hoffmann said as she visited Pretti’s memorial recently. “We’re all in this together. And I’m really glad they have this here so everybody can come and be together.”
Lynn Elrod, a nurse, visited Pretti’s memorial last month and added her own offering: a plastic evergreen tree with red hearts and portraits of him and Good.
“I printed both of their pictures and put those on there again, just to signify the love that we have for both of them, really, and their contributions to the community and supporting their neighbors,” Elrod said.
The residential street where Good died remains open, but orange traffic cones offer a narrow walkway for those paying their respects, and a small band of volunteers watches over the mound of flowers, artwork and handwritten signs that has amassed between the sidewalk and the street.
Around the Pretti memorial along a commercial district known as “ Eat Street,” traffic lanes have been temporarily shifted and parking is closed off, said Jess Olstad, a spokesperson for the city of Minneapolis.
“The City’s top priority is to give our community space to grieve and heal,” Olstad said. “This both ensures emergency vehicles can get through the area and protects those who gather or visit the memorial.”
Olstad added that the city is “actively working on next steps, including continued community engagement regarding both memorials.”
Ally Peters, a spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, said last week that it was “too early” to comment on whether the memorials would be made permanent.

Iranian security use dragnet spanning the entire country to arrest protesters
Iranian security use dragnet spanning the entire country to arrest protesters
CAIRO (AP) — The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.
The women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Nazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.
Held for weeks with no contact
The protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.
Security forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.
Since then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.
The Nakhii sisters, 25-year-old Nyusha and 37-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.
Other people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.
Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.
Authorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters’ relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.
In past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.
“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.
Signs of defiance continue
Despite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.
The Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”
It also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.
A national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.
A spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.
“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”
Bar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.
Anger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.
The Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.
Iran’s theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”

Hamas to discuss demilitarization, NCAG with Egyptian mediators in Cairo - report

Hamas plans to discuss disarmament and its disapproval of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) appointments during upcoming talks with mediators in Egypt, a source with knowledge of the matter told Sky News Arabia on Thursday.
The Hamas delegation intends to present demilitarization-related proposals to its Egyptian counterpart, including one that suggests that the terrorist group would pause the use of all weapons until a full withdrawal of the Israeli military from the Gaza Strip is complete, the source told Sky News Arabia.
Another idea set to be proposed is that Hamas may surrender “heavy weapons,” including its remaining missiles and rockets, and maps of its intricate underground terror tunnel network, in exchange for permission to retain light weapons, such as guns.
Earlier, on Tuesday, the New York Times published a report claiming that an initial draft of the United States plan for demilitarizing the terrorist group included allowing Hamas to keep small arms, citing officials familiar with the draft.
National Committee for the Administration of Gaza's role in disarmament
The Cairo meeting is part of a larger set of negotiations intended to work out the logistics for implementing US President Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, which included the establishment of a Palestinian technocratic body set to take over governance of the enclave.
According to Sky News Arabia’s source, Hamas additionally intends to advocate for the integration of its terrorists into “the future administration of the Gaza Strip” during the Cairo talks.
The NCAG, according to US-set demilitarization principles, will oversee and verify the disarmament of terrorist groups in Gaza, including Hamas, with one goal being to ensure that all arms maintained by individuals are registered with and approved by the NCAG.
Hamas involvement in the NCAG may result in the terrorist organization maintaining some amount of power in the Gaza Strip or reducing the effectiveness of disarmament efforts.
According to the Sky News Arabia source, Hamas officials objected to the appointment of Sami Nasman to oversee security under the NCAG.
Gaza-native Nasman, a former Palestinian Authority general, was accused by Hamas of “instigating chaos” in 2007 after he moved to the West Bank following clashes between the PA and Hamas.
Hamas officials believe that Nasman’s appointment “could provoke retaliatory reactions,” Sky News Arabia quoted their source as saying.

Greenland trains new generation for mining future amid resource doubts

At the Greenland School of Minerals and Petroleum, a dozen students in hi-vis vests and helmets are out for the day learning to operate bulldozers, dump trucks, excavators and other equipment.
The Greenlandic government is counting on this generation to help fulfil its dream of a lucrative mining future for the vast Arctic territory coveted by US President Donald Trump.
Founded in 2008, the school, based in Sisimiut in the southwest of the island, offers students from across Greenland a three-year post-secondary vocational training.
Apart from their practical classes, the students, aged 18 to 35, also learn the basics of geology, rock mechanics, maths and English.
Teacher Kim Heilmann keeps a watchful eye on his students as they learn to manoeuvre the heavy equipment.
"I want them to know it's possible to mine in Greenland if you do it the right way," he said. "But mostly the challenge is to make them motivated about mining," he added.
The remote location of Greenland's two operational mines, and the ensuing isolation, puts many people off, the school's director Emilie Olsen Skjelsager said.
A Danish autonomous territory, Greenland gained control over its raw materials and minerals in 2009.
The local government relies heavily on Danish subsidies to complement its revenues from fishing, and is hoping that mining and tourism will bring it financial independence in the future so that it can someday cut ties with Denmark.
"The school was created because there is hope for more activities in mining, but also to have more skilled workers in Greenland for heavy machine operating and drilling and blasting, and exploration services," Olsen Skjelsager said.
By the end of their studies, some of the students — "a small number, maybe up to five" — will go on to work in the mines.
The rest will work on construction sites.
Lack of skills
Greenland is home to 57,000 people, and has historically relied on foreign workers to develop mining projects due to a lack of local know-how.
"We have some good people that can go out mining and blasting and drilling and all that kind of stuff," explained Deputy Minister of Minerals Resources, Jorgen T Hammeken-Holm.
"But if you have a production facility close to the mining facility, then you need some technical skills in these processing facilities," he said.
"There is a lack of educated people to do that."
Going forward, geologists, engineers and economists will be needed, especially as Greenland's traditional livelihoods of hunting and fishing are expected to gradually die out as professions.
The students' tuition is paid by the Greenland government, which also gives them a monthly stipend of around $800.
Inside the school, a glass case displays some of the minerals that lie — or are believed to lie — under Greenland, including cryolite, anorthosite and eudialyte, which contains rare earth elements essential to the green and digital transitions.
"New mine sites have been searched (for) all over Greenland," said Angerla Berthelsen, a 30-year-old student who hopes to find a job in the mining sector one day.
There are "lots of possibilities" in Greenland, he said, sounding an optimistic note.
Doubts over deposits
But questions remain about Greenland's actual resources, with the existence and size of the deposits still to be confirmed.
According to the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), Greenland is home to 24 of the 34 critical raw materials identified by the EU as essential for the green and digital transitions.
"A large variety of geological terrains exists, which have been formed by many different processes. As a result, Greenland has several types of metals, minerals and gemstones," it says in a document on its website.
"However, only in a few cases have the occurrences been thoroughly quantified, which is a prerequisite for classifying them as actual deposits," it stressed.
Deputy minister Hammeken-Holm said it was "more or less a guess" for now. "Nobody knows actually."
In addition, the island — with its harsh Arctic climate and no roads connecting its towns — currently doesn't have the infrastructure needed for large-scale mining.
There are currently only two operational mines on the island — one gold mine in the south, and one for anorthosite, a rock containing titanium, on the west coast.

Munich Security Conference: Rubio to give speech as leaders gather

Catch up on what happened during the second day of the 2026 edition of the Munich Security Conference where Marco Rubio, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ursula von der Leyen, Keir Starmer and many more leaders took to the stage.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Saturday told the European Union from the Munich Security Conference that Ukraine "needs a date" for its accession and aims to be ready to join in 2027, in response to a Euronews question.
"We need a date," he said during a press conference. "The date of accession depends on all these talks with partners but, and I don’t want to be disrespectful to the United States and Europe, we need a date because otherwise Russia will try to block us - directly or through maybe other countries."
"Ukraine has to be technically ready to join 2027, my government, the parliament, the institutions."
The other big draw of the day in Munich was US Secretary of State Marco Rubio who said in his eagerly-anticipated speech that Washington wants to "revitalise" its relationship with Europe and that the two blocs should fix what he described as a "broken" status quo together.
But he still stuck to US government lines that the rules-based international order birthed after WWII infringed on sovereignty, and led to mass migration which in turn destabilised Western countries.
Plenty more world leaders took to the stage, including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. Scroll down below to catch up on what they said.

Live ended
That's wrap from us!
Our live coverage from the Munich Security Conference is coming to an end and what a wild ride this has been!
What were the key messages?
- From Europe, leaders were keen to stress that they have heard the US and they have started the work to step up and take more of the responsibility for defending the Old Continent;
- From Volodymyr Zelenskyy, it was that Europe should be at the peace talks and further tighten the noose around Russia's economy;
- From the US, it was that the Western 'civilisation' is coming under attack and that both sides of the Atlantic should work together to save it.
We will have further coverage from the conference tomorrow, including a wrap piece on what you must absolutely remember from this year's conference, so watch out for that. If you simply cannot wait for it, scroll back for a blow-by-blow of the day's event. Yesterday's as-it-happened blog can be found here.
Enjoy your evening!
Frederiksen on Russia's 'Imperial ambitions'
Danish Leader Mette Frederiksen has rounded off the Q&A comparing Russia's ambitions in the Arctic to Russia's war in Ukraine.
"It's about Russia's imperial dreams, and the same goes for the Arctic region. This is not about the Arctic region, it's about Russia's imperial dreams. The hybrid war against Europe that is going on every day has to be tackled at the same time as the war in Ukraine and the Arctic."
"There are two very important lessons learned. As Europeans, you cannot build your strategy on what other people are doing. So was there like a European moment this January? Yes, there was. And now our obligation is to transform that Greenlandic European moment into a European strategy," she concludes.

Nielsen: 'The pressure on us is unacceptable'
Greenland's Prime Minister has addressed Trump's claims on the island, striking both a humourous and dramatic tone.
"I don't think its an elephant in the room anymore. He's pretty transparent and has been for fourteen months," he says on Trump's demands on the island. The US President has repeatedly said that he needs Greenland for US national security and offered to buy the island.
"If I think about my people, we are so proud. We live in a harsh environment. We are resilient. We live in a land where nobody were able to live for many, many, many years. There's a reason why we are the ones left," he says to laughter in the audience.
"This is not only about Greenland. Imagine a NATO country acquiring, taking, threatening an ally. Where would the world stand if that happened? ..It's outrageous."
Asked about the trilateral talks currently ongoing between Greenland, Denmark and the US, and whether he sees their outcome as successful Jens-Frederik Nielsen said: "we need to take the right step and the first right step is to have a dialogue between us."
"But we cannot lower our shoulder. The desire to control or to have Greeland is there but I think we are taking the right step," he also said. He also said he acknwoledges the "big issue" for the US is security.
On that, he said, Greenland is ready to do its part and is "committed to be part of the alliance".
Canada launched procurement for more Arctic capabilities years ago - Anand
Since the start of the war in Ukraine, Russia has moved some of its infrastructure further north, Canada's Foreign Minister just said, calling for more cooperation in the Arctic in both capabilities and diplomacy.
Anita Anand said that given that 40% of Canada's land mass "interfaces with the Arctic", the country has not waited until today to invest and has over the past few years, invested in infrastructure and launched procurement for over-the-horizon radars, icebreakers, for the modernisation of NORAD (the North American Aerospace Defence Command) to boost aerial surveillance.
"We need to all acknowledge the changing global threat environment and the importance of supporting each other, collaborating with each other in terms of our capabilities in the Arctic and our diplomacy in the Arctic," she said.
The Greenlandic perspective: Nielsen prepared to 'take greater responsibility' for island's security
We are now turning back to a panel titled "Spotlight on Arctic Security" featuring Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, Greenlandic leader Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Canada's Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand, among others.
Nielsen says the island has experienced peace and low tension for many years, but that it recognises there are no longer any low-tension regions in the world.
He said Greenland is prepared to take greater responsibility for surveillance and security in its region and work closely with Denmark on these issues.
"It's very important for me to say that the ... NATO alliance is something that we are truly committed on as Greenlanders," he concludes.
Sikorski on Poland's response if Russia invaded
Poland's Sikorski ends the panel with his response if Russia invaded Polish territory.
"If they cross the border, start killing Nato citizens, Polish citizens, we would expect the North Atlantic Council to meet and to activate the contingency plan, and after that, the plan is very easy: we win, they lose.”
Ukraine 'needs a date' for EU accession, plans for 2027 - Zelenskyy
Volodymyr Zelenskyy just said in response to a Euronews question that Ukraine "needs a date" for its accession to the European Union and that he aims to be ready to join in 2027.
"We need a date," he said during a press conference. "The date of accession depends on all these talks with partners but, and I don’t want to be disrespectful to the United States and Europe, we need a date because otherwise Russia will try to block us - directly or through maybe other countries."
"Ukraine has to be technically ready to join 2027, my government, the parliament, the institutions.
Sikorski: Stakes are 'incredibly high'
Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski has reminded the panel about the stakes of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
"Because the stakes are incredibly high. It’s not just the future of Ukraine, it’s not just the security of the eastern flank — it is about the place of Europe in the future distribution of power in the world. In other words, who will be the third leg of global power: China, the United States, and Russia, or the European Union? Don’t ask me which I would prefer," he says.
"And to my mind, President Donald Trump is not wrong when he says that in this more brutal world, you need to show your cards. The United States would give itself more cards to pressure Putin into a deal by, for example, delivering Tomahawks to Ukrainians. That decision was apparently quite close a couple of months ago," he continues.
Europe deserves a seat at the table because it's paying for Ukraine's defence: Polish FM
Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski just said that Europe deserves a seat at the negotiating table because, unlike the US, it is paying for Ukraine's security.
"American outlay for the war last year was close to zero," Sikorski said while taking part in the "Holding the Line: Defending Europe and Supporting Ukraine" panel.
"We are buying American weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. There is no package in the US Congress and there isn't even the prospect of a package. If we are paying, if this is affecting our security, not just Ukraine's, then we deserve the seat at the table because the outcome of this war will affect us," he said.
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda also said Europe should have a seat at the table but that it's being kept away because Russia doesn't want that and "Washington lets that happen".
"We can’t push ourselves at the negotiation table when Putin is not willing to talk with us and Washington is willing to let that happen," he said. The next best thing Europe can do, he added, is to reiterate all the time that it will continue supporting Ukraine.
'Whole districts' have no water, no heating, no electricity - Ukrainian Deputy PM
Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister for European and Euro-Atlantic Integration Taras Kachka is taking part in the "Holding the Line: Defending Europe and Supporting Ukraine" panel where he opened by talking about the dire energy situation in the war-torn country.
"We will repair our energy till the moment we will have stocks for equipment," he said, adding that "Russia attempts to destroy the energy system to the level it is not repairable".
He said that a lot of people throughout Ukraine have no heating, electricity or water amidst sub-zero temperatures.
"Life in Kyiv, if you want to have a hot tea, you have to wake up at 3am when you have electricity," he said, noting though that elsewhere there are "whole districts where you have nothing at all".
He urged partners to give missiles that can be used with the various air defence systems Ukraine has - including Patriots, SAMP-T, and IRIS-T - saying that if they have enough stocks "we'd be able to intercept" Russian missiles aimed at energy infrastructure.
The ball is in Putin's court, Pistorius says, as he claims NATO is changing for the better
Germany’s Defence Minister Boris Pistorius says “the ball is in Putin’s court” over Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
According to him, NATO is becoming “more European so that it can remain transatlantic.” He adds that US funding for the alliance was always meant to be an exception, never the norm.
Europeans, he says, have done “too little to support precious order — when we dwelled on our weakness, when we complained, when we criticised each other for inaction.”
“The reality today is very different. Combined European armies outnumber any other army in the world. We are spending much more on defence than ever before. Our defence industry produces top-tier equipment. We are taking our future into our own hands in the areas of joint capability development and procurement financing.”
He also says Germany’s and Europe’s defence policy needs to be more effective, better coordinated, and more visible in society.
For Pistorius, debates over Greenland have shown “we are capable.”
Starmer sets 'high ambition' for future EU-UK partnership
Keir Starmer and Ursula von der Leyen, who shared the stage in Munich earlier, have also held a meeting on the sidelines of the conference.
During this bilateral, the British premier "shared his high ambition for the future UK-EU partnership," according to a readout from Downing Street.
"He set out his desire for further integration across the economy, defence and technology" with both leaders committing "to take forward further work ahead of the next UK-EU summit," the statement also read.
"They also agreed to double down on the existing negotiations to agree a food and drink deal which could lower prices, an emissions trading scheme which could lower bills, and a youth experience scheme to give our young people more opportunities to work and travel abroad."
In a post on X, the European Commission chief said "it is natural that we work together to protect our people and common interests".
"We had a successful summit last year - let's keep the momentum and deliver at the next one," she added.

Stubb: NATO presence in the Arctic is a 'silver lining'
Finland's President Alexander Stubb says that a stronger NATO presence in the Arctic and stronger Arctic security would be a "silver lining" over Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in the region.
"At the moment, the most significant security grouping in the Arctic consists of Finland, Sweden, and Norway, and we are very focused on that cooperation. To give you one concrete example: next week there will be an Arctic training exercise involving 25,000 NATO troops, including 5,000 from the United States, in northern Norway and northern Finland," he says.
"We are not doing this merely as a show of force. We are actively preparing for different scenarios." He continues, "If you ask me how serious the danger is, I do not believe Russia will test the resolve of Article 5. That is precisely why deterrence exists. It is also why a country like Finland has one of the largest militaries on NATO’s eastern flank, alongside Turkey, Poland, and Ukraine."

G7 foreign ministers reaffirm support for Ukraine on MSC sidelines
Foreign ministers from the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, the US - and EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas met today on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
They used the opportunity to reaffirm their "unwavering support" for Ukraine as the fourth anniversary of the start of Russia's invasion approaches.
"Particular attention was paid to how the G7 will continue to support the Ukrainian energy sector, which faces direct Russian attacks," they said in a statement.
They also discussed other major crises including Gaza, Iran, Venezuela, the Indo-Pacific, Sudan and Haiti.
Trump's 'desire' on Greenland still 'exactly the same' - Denmark's Frederiksen
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen just told the Munich Security Conference that Donald Trump is still keen to take control of the sprawling Arctic island.
"The desire from the US President is exactly the same," she said. "We disagree as a kingdom and by the way Europe disagrees."
Trump first issued the threat to forcefully seize Greenland last month, sparking fears of a conflict between NATO allies which would effectively spell the end of the 77-year-old military alliance. An agreement on a "framework for the future" of Greeland was agreed between Trump and NATO chief Mark Rutte on the sidelines of the Davos forum.
Trilateral talks between Denmark, Greenland and the US have been ongoing since.
Frederiksen conceded however that allies need to do more collectively to boost security in the High North.
Sánchez opposes nuclear
Back to the conference, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has made a case against nuclear rearmament.
Remember, both French leader Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer hinted they would be opening talks for a common European nuclear deterrence.
"Seventy years ago, our parents and grandparents came to the conclusion that nuclear deterrence was a far too costly and risky way of avoiding conflict between nations. Too costly because it demanded colossal public investments, and too dangerous because on several occasions, technical or human errors came close to triggering a full-scale nuclear war between the West and the former Soviet Union," Sánchez says.
"After a few decades, our predecessors realized that the risks posed by nuclear deterrence far outweighed its contributions to peace. They realized that a system that requires zero mistakes and constant correction to avoid total destruction is not a guarantee, it's a gamble."
Navalny killed with epibatidine, five European countries say
Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was poisoned by the Kremlin with a lethal toxin derived from the skin of poison dart frogs, five European countries said Saturday.
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said analysis of samples from Navalny, who died two years ago, “have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” It is a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America that is not found naturally in Russia, they said.
The countries said in a joint statement that “Russia had the means, motive and opportunity to administer this poison.” They said they were reporting Russia to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for a breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention.
"We know now that Vladimir Putin is prepared to use chemical weapons against his own people to stay in power," French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X. "France pays tribute to this opposition figure, killed for his fight for a free and democratic Russia."
Navalny, who was Putin's fiercest critic, died in February last year while serving a 19-year sentence in an Arctic penal colony that he believed to be politically motivated.
Il y a deux ans, Alexeï Navalny décédait des suites d’un empoisonnement lié à un des agents neurotoxiques les plus mortels. Nous savons désormais que Vladimir Poutine est prêt à utiliser l’arme chimique contre son propre peuple pour se maintenir au pouvoir. La France rend hommage…

On the sidelines: Ukraine House hosts lunch featuring leaders and disqualified Olympian
On the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, a Ukrainian lunch hosted by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation took place at the Ukraine House, featuring a panel packed with European leaders — among them Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Czech President Petr Pavel.
Disqualified Ukrainian skeleton pilot Vladyslav Heraskevych also attended, holding the helmet that got him barred from this year’s Winter Olympics in Milan. He was met with a standing ovation.
“If we want peace for Ukraine, and peace for Europe, we should stay united,” a Ukrainian soldier told the panel and attendees, addressing the room.
EU Commissioner for Enlargement Marta Kos added that Ukraine has brought “many positive” things to Europe, responding to a question about whether Ukraine could become a member of the European Union by 2027.
Based on the current methodology, Ukraine joining by January 2027 is “not possible,” she said, but added: “We cannot wait anymore, and we’re already discussing this.”
Putin 'must be held accountable,' Navalnaya says
Alexei Nalvany's widow, Yulia Navalnaya, has just posted a statement on social media about the new discovery published by five European countries on her husband's death.
"I was certain from the first day that my husband had been poisoned, but now there is proof: Putin killed Alexei with chemical weapon. I am grateful to the European states for the meticulous work they carried out over two years and for uncovering the truth. Vladimir Putin is a murderer. He must be held accountable for all his crimes."
The posion in question, epibatidine, "can be found on the skin of the Ecuadorian dart frog. It causes paralysis, respiratory arrest, and a painful death," she says.

What else to expect from Zelenskyy today
His keynote speech might be behind him, but there's still plenty left on Volodymyr Zelenskyy's agenda.
He will hold a press event at 16.20 CET and will receive the Ewald von Kleist Prize on behalf of the Ukrainian people at 19.40 CET.
The prize is "in deep recognition of their courage, sacrifice, and unwavering will to defend the freedom of Ukraine and the freedom of all Europe, and in remembrance of the many who lost their lives or were injured," according to a release.
Other events on his agenda today included bilateral meetings with NATO chief Mark Rutte, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, as well as meetings with a bipartisan delegation of US senators, and investment companies.
Five European nations say Russian opposition figure Navalny was poisoned, blame Kremlin
The foreign ministries of the UK, France, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands said Saturday that analysis of samples from Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, who died two years ago, “have conclusively confirmed the presence of epibatidine.” It is a toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America.
The countries said that “only the Russian state had the combined means, motive and disregard for international law” to carry out the attack.
Navalny crusaded against corruption and the Kremlin, becoming a fierce critic and one of President Vladimir Putin's biggest challengers. He died in an Arctic penal colony in February 2024. His widow, Yulia Navalnaya, said last year that two independent labs found her husband was poisoned before his death. Russian officials have denied wrongdoing.
Yulia Navalnaya, human rights activist and wife of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, gives a press statement on the death and circumstances of her husband's death on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Munich, Germany, Saturday Feb. 14, 2026.
Zelenskyy: 'We can't save lives by saying thank you'
Zelenksyy is asked about his predictions for the upcoming year and he replies his immediate concern is "tomorrow."
"We can't save lives by saying thank you," he adds, concluding Ukraine needs strong security guarantees to keep it safe in the event of the conflict endings.
He also touches on Ukraine's EU accession. The Ukrainian leader has called for a fixed deadline in Kyiv's accession into the EU, forcing the executive to rethink its long-standing merit-based enlargement policies. Zelenskyy says he will continue to push for Kyiv's accession.
Rutte pushes back
NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has pushed back strongly on the notion there are "historical reasons" for Russia to invade Ukraine. "There was absolutely no reason whatsoever for the Russians to invade Ukraine," he says.
"Not in 2014 with Crimea, not the full scale onslaught on Ukraine starting late February 2022. So this is absolutely, absolutely not true. Then when it comes to security guarantees, the first thing which is crucial is for NATO, that NATO came back together."
"In the last couple of days, there has been a huge shift in mindset within NATO, where the Europeans are now taking more of a leadership role in NATO, where the Europeans take more responsibility for their own defence," he says.
He goes on to defend US President Donald Trump's role in the peace process, calling a 6 January meeting in Paris "successful."
"If we agree that only the American president was able to break the deadlock with Putin, I think it was only him because he is the leader of the mightiest nation on earth, a quarter of the world economy, the mightiest military on earth. He did that in February. He broke the deadlock."

Give us a two-month ceasefire and we'll hold elections - Zelenskyy
The Ukrainian president said that his country "is ready" to proceed with organising elections but only if a two-month ceasefire is respected.
Organising elections under bombardment is simply too difficult, Zekenskyy said. "I don’t know who has experience. We don’t have it."
"Give us a ceasefire, President Trump can do it," Zelenskyy said. "Our parliament can change the law and we will go to elections" if the US and Russia need electiosn to be held in Ukraine.
In a jibe at Moscow, Zelenskyy said he would be happy to hold a ceasefire in order for free elections to be held in Russia.
Europe not being at negotiating table is 'a big mistake' - Zelenskyy
Zelenskyy just said that Europe not being at the negotiating table is "a big mistake".
"We Ukrainians are trying to bring Europe fully into the process," Zelenskyy said, to ensure that Europe's interests and voice are taken into account, and because "peace can only be built on clear security guarantees", which Europe is expected to bear the brunt of.
Ukraine will take part in another round of peace talks with the US and Russia next week, which the Ukrainian president said would hopefully be "serious" and "helpful". He noted however that often it appears that the different sides "are talking about completely different things".
"The Americans often return to the topic of concessions and too often those concessions are discussed only in the context of Ukraine," he said.
"Ukraine will do everything to make these negotiations successful. We have invested in this process," he also said, adding that he is in "constant contact" with the American team.
"Ukraine wants the result of all these efforts to be real security, and bring peace, real peace."
Zelenskyy criticises Hungary's Viktor Orbán
Zelenskyy has praised Ukraine and the Ukrainian people for being key to stopping Russian aggression and securing the freedom of Poland, Moldova and Romania.
He takes a public swipe at Hungarian leader Viktor Orbán, who has repeatedly blocked and criticised the EU's ongoing support for Ukraine.
"Even one Viktor can think about how to grow his belly, not how to grow his army to stop Russian tanks from returning to the streets of Budapest,” he says.
Zelenskyy calls on EU to do more to clamp down on Russia's shadow fleet
The Ukrainian President has now thanked the EU for the €90 billion loan to finance Ukraine's military and financial needs for the coming two years.
He described it as a "serious guarantee of Ukraine financial stability" but called for more measures to ensure the Kremlin's revenues run dry.
"Let’s not close our eyes to the problem, Zelenskyy said. "Russia still has accomplice regimes", he added, citing North Korea, as well as companies that allow it to circumvent sanctions, citing China.
"Putin still has guarantees of financial stability," he noted, taking aim at the shadow fleet of oil tankers Moscow uses to continue to sell oil despite Western sanctions.
The Ukrainian president said he has discussed the issue with his European counterparts including Macron and von der Leyen, in order to update the European legislation so that these tankers can not only be detained but also blocked and confiscated.
"Without oil money, Putin would not have money for this war," he said.
Zelenskyy has turned his attention onto Iran.
He says although Ukraine doesn't share a border with Iran or have conflict with the Iranian regime, it continues to sell drones to Russia.
"When they have time, they only kill more. They must be stopped immediately."
Shahed drones can now fly at different altitudes, act as 'mother drone' - Zelenskyy
Ukraine's Zelenskyy has just done a recap of the attacks Ukraine came under in January, saying it had to defence itself against "6,000 attack drones, most of them were Shahed drones" as well as "150+ Russian missiles of different types" and glide bombs.
The Iranian-designed Shahed drone, Zelenskyy explained, has evolved tremendously since the beginning of the war nearly four years ago, when "they could be shut down easily".
Now Shahed drones have a jet engine, enabling them to fly at different altitudes and they can be guided by an operator in real time, Zelenskyy said, citing the use of Elon Musk's Starlink, and they "can carry other drones, acting as a mother drone".
"The longer the war continues, the more resources the aggressor receives," Zelenskyy said
Zelenskyy thanks European leaders for giving Ukraine air defence systems. These "save lives," he says.
He name checks the NATO Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (PURL) initiative, which ensures the delivery of air defence interceptors to block Russian attacks.
Zelenskyy has arrived, and he's "setting the scene" before joining a discussion with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Parliament President Roberta Metsola.
He begins by thanking people — Rutte gets a specific thank you for his support for Ukraine.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy to take the stage
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is about to deliver a speech. Stay with us as we bring you the most important parts.
VDL tackles Rutte on 'Dream on' comment
Von der Leyen has now gone on the attack on two fronts.
She took aim at Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of the NATO military alliance, who recently told the European Parliament that Europe can "dream on" if it thinks it can defend itself without the US.
"I would like to tell him, my dear friend, there is not only status quo goes on or division and disruption. There's a lot in between," she said, adding that this would be beneficial to both Europe and the US.
"There is much more in between and an independent Europe means let’s develop our strength without constantly leaning on someone else."
On another matter, it was the US in her crosshairs.
"I want to very clear: our digital sovereignty is our digital sovereignty" and the EU "will not flinch where this is concerned," she said.

'I was very much reassured' by Rubio's speech - von der Leyen
Asked what she thought of the speech delivered earlier by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the European Commission chief said she was "very much reassured".
She described Rubio as "a good friend, a strong ally" and that she understands that "in the (US) administration some have a harsher tone on this topic, but the Secretary of State was very clear: we want a strong Europe in the alliance and this is what we are working for intensively in the EU
Starmer: Change in EU-UK relations is of 'some urgency'
Starmer says the need to restart the UK's relationship with the EU a decade on from the UK's referendum is of "some urgency" in the context of the Ukraine war.
“This is of some urgency, because I think that on defence and security, until Ukraine conflict we didn’t really wake up the reality that we’re facing,” he says.
Starmer opens door to selective alignment with EU single market
Starmer has gone on to suggest the UK needs to work more closely with the EU, including looking at moving closer to the bloc's single market in selected sectors.
The UK wants deeper cooperation on defence technology and AI to "drive greater coherence and coordination across Europe." He singled out Germany, France, Italy and Poland alongside Norway, Canada and Turkey.
He also picks up on Macron's comments from yesterday about a common European nuclear deterrence.
“For decades, the United Kingdom has been the only nuclear power in Europe to commit its deterrent to protect all Nato members."
"Any adversary must know that in a crisis, they could be confronted by our combined strength,” he said.
'We are not the Britain of the Brexit years anymore,' Starmer says
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has delivered a message of unity between the UK and Europe, telling the audience that the "Brexit years" are over and that the UK will work primarily with Europe to ensure security.
"In a dangerous world, we would not take control by turning inward; we would not take control by turning inward; we would surrender it and I won't let that happen."
Starmer has been seeing rapprochement between London and Brussels since he took office, with talks on deeper trade, customs and defence accelerating on the 10th anniversary of the referendum that thrust the UK's role in the European Union into turmoil.

EU must use qualified majority and partnerships with third countries for its defence - VDL
But the head of the EU executive also stressed that in order to truly be ready to be in position to defend itself, the EU "must make decisions faster".
"And this may mean relying on the result of a qualified majority rather than unanimity. We do not need to change the Treaty for this. We need to use the one we have," Ursula von der Leyen said.
She also called for the bloc to be "creative", notably through partnership with other partners, citing the UK-led Joint Expeditionary Force and the Coalition of the Willing for Ukraine.
"What we need to do now, is formalise the ad hoc beginnings of new security collaborations. This starts by working of course with our closest partners, like the UK, Norway, Iceland or Canada," she said.
"We want to increase our offer to many of these vital partners. This means, in this acutely volatile time, Europe and in particular the UK should come closer together – on security, on economy or on defending our democracies."
Europe's mutual defence clause must be brought 'to life' - VDL
Ursula von der Leyen is now talking defence saying Europe is "delivering" with spending in Europe up by nearly 80% since before the war in Ukraine.
"By 2028, defence investment in Europe is even projected to exceed the amount the US spent on such equipment last year. This is a true European awakening," she added.
But Europe must go beyond just spending, the Commission chief said, and "no taboo can go unchallenged".
"I believe the time has come to bring Europe’s mutual defence clause to life. Mutual defence is not optional for the EU. It is an obligation within our own Treaty – Article 42(7). For good reason. It is our collective commitment to stand by each other in case of aggression. Or in simple terms, one for all and all for one.
"This is Europe’s meaning. But this commitment only carries weight if it is built on trust and capability," she said.
'Europe must become more independent' - Ursula von der Leyen
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has now taken to the stage, starting with a simple message: "Europe must become more independent – there is no other choice."
"The European way of life – our democratic foundation and the trust of our citizens – is being challenged in new ways. On everything from territories to tariffs or tech regulations," she said, in a thinly-veiled reference to the US, but also citing Russia's ongoing aggression against Ukraine.
This independence must be wide-ranging and cover areas including "Defence and energy. Economy and trade. Raw materials and digital tech," she said
"Some may say the word ‘independence’ runs counter to our transatlantic bond. But the opposite is true. An independent Europe is a strong Europe. And a strong Europe makes for a stronger transatlantic alliance," she also said.
Rubio on Ukraine
Onto a Q&A, Rubio answers a question on Ukraine.
The Secretary of State skipped an informal meeting on the conflict yesterday which was attended by multiple European leaders.
According to Rubio, the issues between Russia and Ukraine have "narrowed" but "the hardest questions to answer" remain. He pushes back on the idea Moscow is not interested in negotiations.
The US and Europe should continue to take steps to pressure Russia into negotiations, Rubio says, insisting the US has "made progress" in talks.

US wants to 'fix' the status quo, Rubio says
Rubio goes on to offer a brief message of reassurance for European allies, insisting the US does not want to "separate" but to "revitalise" an old friendship.
“In a time of headlines heralding the end of the transatlantic era, let it be known and clear to all that this is neither our goal nor our wish, because for us Americans, our home may be in the western hemisphere, but we will always be a child of Europe.”
He also references NATO troops, saying the US has "bled and died side by side." As a reminder, US President Donald Trump sparked anger in January when he undermined the role of NATO troops in Afghanistan, claiming they "stayed a little off the frontlines."
Rubio: Decline is a choice
Rubio has evoked a parallel between what he says was "decline" rejected after 1945 and should be rejected now as well.
“We do not want our allies to be weak, because that makes us weaker. We want allies who can defend themselves, so that no adversary will ever be tempted to test our collective strength. This is why we do not want our allies to be shackled by guilt and shame."
"We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilization, and who, together with us, are willing and able to defend it, and this is why we do not want allies to rationalise the broken status quo rather than reckon with what is necessary to fix it."
UN needs urgent reform, Rubio says
According to Rubio, international organisation such as the UN need to be rebuilt and urgently reformed.
The UN, he says, has proven itself "powerless" during key wars in Gaza and Ukraine.
“In a perfect world, all of these problems and more would be solved by diplomats and strongly worded resolutions. But we do not live in a perfect world, and we cannot continue to allow those who blatantly and openly threaten our citizens and endanger our global stability to shield themselves behind abstractions of international law which they themselves routinely violate.”
Rubio: US 'cares deeply' about Europe
Marco Rubio has dedicated some of his speech to underline the close links between Europe and the US, such as "“shared history, Christian faith, culture, heritage, language, ancestry and past sacrifices.”
He lists a number of famous Europeans such as Mozart, Shakespeare and The Beatles as reasons why Europe is special.
He goes on to say, "So this is why we Americans may sometimes come off as a little direct and urgent in our counsel. … The reason why, my friends, is because we care deeply."
"We care deeply about your future and ours, and if at times we disagree, our disagreements come from our profound sense of concern about a Europe with which we are connected, not just economically, not just militarily, we are connected spiritually and we are connected culturally.”
Snap analysis: Rubio's speech
Marco Rubio was supposed to be a nicer, more polite version of J.D. Vance. But so far, his Munich speech reiterates the same points made by the US vice president last year.
In his speech, he is lambasting the outsourcing sovereignty to multinational institutions, a “climate cult” impoverishing people and mass immigration that is a threat to the cohesion of society.
Post-war delusion made by Europe and US, Rubio says
In a speech heavy on history, Rubio continues with explaining that Europe and the US created a "post-war delusion."
“We increasingly outsourced our sovereignty to international institutions, while many nations invested in massive welfare states at the cost of maintaining the ability to defend themselves,” he says, whilst calling a "dogmatic vision of free and unfettered trade," a delusion.
“In a pursuit of a world without borders, we opened our doors to an unprecedented wave of mass migration that threatens the cohesion of our societies, the continuity of our culture and the future of our people,” Rubio says.
Rubio has started his speech referencing the history of the Munich Security Conference.
“We gather here today as members of a historic alliance, an alliance that saved and changed the world. When this conference began in 1963 it was in a nation, actually, it was on a continent that was divided against itself. The line between communism and freedom ran through the heart of Germany."
“At that time, victory was far from certain, but we were driven by a common purpose. We were unified not just by what we were fighting against, we were unified by what we were fighting for,” Rubio says.
“The euphoria of this triumph led us to a dangerous delusion that we entered ‘the end of history’ and every nation would now be a liberal democracy, that the ties formed by trade and by commerce alone would now replace nationhood, that the rules based global order, an overused term, would now replace the national interest, and that we would now live in a world without borders, where everyone became a citizen of the world.”
"This was a foolish idea."
Rubio is speaking
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has taken the floor. Stay tuned.
Rubio skips Berlin Format talks on Ukraine in Munich

Good morning
Good morning and welcome to our live blog on the second day of talks between the world's top security leaders.
Here's a quick recap of what stood out yesterday:
- Germany's Chancellor Merz delivered a dramatic speech which set the tone for the next three days. In it, he said the world order as it has stood for decades "no longer exists" and that a new world order of "power politics" puts even the strongest nations in danger. He dubbed the tension between the EU and the US an "inconvenient truth", said there was a "divide" between the continents and that "freedom could no longer be taken for granted" against the ongoing threat from Moscow.
- Elsewhere, US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz and the EU's Foreign Policy Chief Kaja Kallas sparred on spending with Waltz noting that continued payments for international organisations, such as the UN, have become hard to justify to US voters. Kallas told Waltz that "when America goes to wars, then a lot of us go with you, and we lose our people on the way. You also need us."
- Finally, French President Emmanuel Macron praised Europe in a speech that set out a positive view of what the continent could achieve. He mentioned planning "coexistence" with Russia, a new European nuclear sharing programme and pushed back on the notion that Europe was over-regulating its social media platforms.
First up is US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is set to deliver a speech one year after Vice President J.D.Vance stunned the same conference with a blistering attack on European countries. Stay tuned —we'll deliver the main lines as we get them.

India reports first Nipah death of latest outbreak but says no new cases detected
Nurse, 25, was one of two confirmed cases in South Asian country
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
India reported its first death of the latest Nipah virus outbreak after a 25-year-old nurse in West Bengal state died in hospital, authorities said.
The woman, who had been receiving treatment in the critical care unit of a hospital in Barasat area, developed complications, including a secondary lung infection, and suffered a cardiac arrest, health officials said.
She was one of two confirmed cases in the eastern state. The second patient, a 27-year-old male nurse from the same hospital, has since recovered and been discharged.
The cases prompted extensive contact tracing, with some 200 people placed under monitoring, according to the federal health ministry. State health officials said all identified contacts tested negative and no further infections were detected.
The death in India came days after the WHO confirmed a woman had died of Nipah in neighbouring Bangladesh.
The patient, in her 40s, developed symptoms consistent with Nipah on 21 January such as fever and headaches followed by hyper-salivation, disorientation and convulsion.
The woman, who reportedly had no travel history but had consumed raw date palm sap, died a week later and was confirmed to be infected with the virus, according to local authorities. All 35 persons who had contact with the patient tested negative for the virus but continued to be monitored, they added.
No further cases have been detected to date, according to the WHO.
Nipah is a zoonotic virus, meaning that it can spread from animals to humans. Fruit bats are deemed the primary natural host, although transmission can also occur through contaminated food or close contact with an infected person.
The virus can cause fever, headaches and respiratory symptoms in its early stages. In more severe cases it can lead to encephalitis – inflammation of the brain – and respiratory failure. According to the WHO, the fatality rate ranges from 40 to 75 per cent, depending on the circumstances and the quality of care.
There is no approved vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for Nipah. Care is largely supportive and focused on managing complications.
The latest Nipah outbreak has prompted precautionary measures beyond India. Several Asian nations have introduced health screenings at airports while the UK Health Security Agency has advised travellers to affected areas to seek medical advice if symptoms develop after returning.
The WHO last week reiterated its assessment that the risk of international spread remained low.
Nipah outbreaks have occurred periodically in Bangladesh and India over the past two decades, most frequently in the southern state of Kerala. While the virus is regarded as highly dangerous because of its severity, experts say that sustained human-to-human transmission has historically been limited.
Health authorities in West Bengal have said surveillance remains active, but no new cases have emerged since the initial cluster was identified in December.

Freed hostage Arbel Yehoud: I tried to end my life several times in captivity until I saw people fighting for me in protests

Captivity survivor Arbel Yehoud said that she tried to end her life several times while held by terror organizations in the Gaza Strip in an interview on Friday.
"One time, not long before my release, I saw drone footage from the so-called Hostage Square. I saw people holding signs of people I didn't know, and suddenly I saw signs of people I did know. Ariel's [Yehoud's partner, who was also a hostage at the time] and mine, of people from the kibbutz. And the moment I saw that – I didn't try to end my life. When I saw drone footage and understood that people I didn't know were fighting for me and struggling for me, I realized I had a commitment to return to those who were fighting for me," Yehoud recounted in an interview on Channel 12 News.
Yehoud said in the interview that she suppressed what she went through in captivity until released hostage Romi Gonen gave her testimony on Channel 12's investigative television program Uvda in December. Gonen then testified that she had experienced four instances of sexual harassment in Hamas captivity by different men, and said that when she met other female captives, she realized she had been in the worst situation.
"I identified with a lot of what she said there," Yehoud said. "In terms of the gap she felt when she met the girls in the tunnel," referring to Gonen's encounter with other female hostages and her realization that her experience in captivity had been far worse than others. "But even after I saw the horrors Romi went through, the gap remains. The things I went through, I went through from beginning to end. So they are in a closed, closed suitcase," Yehoud said.
Arbel's partner, Ariel Cunio, said that after several days in captivity during which he demanded information from Arbel, the captors offered him to write her a letter, and subsequently they exchanged notes for several months. Yehoud testified that "there were really difficult letters." The two said that at a certain point, they were no longer allowed to write to each other.
"They told me, 'No more letters. We will kill you and we will kill him.'"
"When you're alone in captivity, you talk to yourself a billion times a day. It's exhausting," she said. Cunio said there were times he asked his captors to kill him. "There were times I said, 'Come on, shoot me in the head.' I would tell my captors, 'Just kill me already.'"
Arbel Yehoud and Ariel Cunio were abducted from their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. Before the abduction, they traveled in Central America, and upon their return, they began planning their wedding.
Arbel was released as part of a deal in January 2025, after 482 days in captivity. Ariel Cunio was released in a deal in October 2025, after 738 days in captivity.

Europe deserves a place at the negotiating table over peace in Ukraine due to its financial contribution to Kyiv’s defense, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski has said.
“We are spending real money, whereas the U.S. is actually making money on this war,” Sikorski said, referring to Europe’s purchase of U.S. weaponry.

In his comments on Friday to the Bloomberg news agency on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, he added: “That gives us the right to have a voice in the arrangements and the outcomes.”
“It’s getting a little strange,” he said. “We pay for the war and we don’t even always have the full information.”
Trilateral talks
The latest push by the U.S. to secure peace in Ukraine has seen trilateral talks between officials from Washington, Moscow and Kyiv but with no involvement of European delegates.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said earlier in February that the Trump administration aims to bring the war to an end by June.
U.S. President Donald Trump doubled down on that position on Friday, telling journalists that Russia is ready to strike a deal and that Zelenskyy risks missing the chance for peace.
“Russia wants to make a deal, and Zelensky’s going to have to get moving,” Trump said at the White House. “Otherwise he’s going to miss a great opportunity. He has to move.”
Merz Pours Cold water on Macron’s Push for Putin Talks
Air defense
Britain’s defense minister, John Healy, on Thursday announced an allied pledge of a further €30 billion to bolster Ukraine’s air defenses following a spate of devastating attacks on its energy infrastructure.
Sikorski said Europe had already spent more than €200 billion on aid to Ukraine and had pledged another €90 billion, enough to cover its defense needs for two more years.
‘No peace without Europeans’
France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, echoed Sikorski’s sentiment in Munich on Friday, saying there could be no peace in Ukraine without Europe’s involvement.
“No peace without the Europeans,” he said in a speech to the conference. “I want to be very clear: you can negotiate without the Europeans, if you prefer, but it will not bring a peace at the table.”
He said this was why Paris had set up a direct line of communication with Moscow, to prevent Europe being a mere “spectator” in the evolving global security architecture.
“Europe must become a geopolitical power,” he said.

Widespread arrests roil Iran weeks after security forces crushed protests
Reports emerging from Iran say authorities continue to examine surveillance footage from nationwide demonstrations, identifying those who took part and detaining thousands
CAIRO (AP) — The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.
The women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Nazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.
Held for weeks with no contact
The protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.
Security forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hardline cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.
Since then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.
The Nakhii sisters, 37-year-old Nyusha and 25-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.
Other people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.
Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.
Authorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters’ relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.
In past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.
“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.
Signs of defiance continue
Despite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.
The Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”
It also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.
A national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.
A spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.
“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”
Bar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.
Anger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.
The Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the US could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.
Iran’s theocracy has faced down protests and US threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”

Europe Calls for US Reset at Security Talks

European leaders called Friday for a reset in relations with the United States as they met at a top security conference where US President Donald Trump’s potshots at traditional transatlantic ties loomed large.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged “a new transatlantic partnership” and French President Emmanuel Macron called for “a strong Europe” as more than 60 leaders gathered for the annual Munich Security Conference.

Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meanwhile tell the conference Saturday that Europe is “a sleeping giant” and must rely less on the United States for its defence, his office said in a preview of his remarks.
This year’s conference comes at a time of strained ties between Europe and the United States, after Trump threatened to take over Greenland and criticised “decaying” and “weak” European nations.
Russia’s war against Ukraine, set to enter its fifth year this month, is high on the agenda, alongside efforts by European NATO members to raise their defence budgets, in line with Trump’s demands, out of concern that Moscow could seek to expand into their territory.
European leaders at the gathering defended their security commitments and the NATO alliance, which Trump’s rhetoric has rattled.
“Being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” Merz said.
Trump’s Trading of Ukraine
“In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone.”
- ‘Greater European autonomy’ -
The gathering comes a year after US Vice President JD Vance used the conference’s stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking allies on the continent.
Macron emphatically defended Europe in his speech, saying “everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us”.
Starmer’s office said his speech would call for “a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived on Friday, is also due to speak at the gathering on Saturday, as is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, organisers said.
A German government source said Merz and Rubio had met at the conference and discussed “Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid”.
They also discussed Iran and NATO, and “Rubio praised Germany’s steps to strengthen the alliance,” the source added.
Rubio also met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
They agreed to strengthen cooperation, and Wang told Rubio that “dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and win-win outcomes are better than zero-sum games”, according to Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Rubio held a 15-minute meeting with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland about the future sovereignty of the Arctic island. Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen called the talks “constructive”.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
- Ukraine discussions -
Merz, Macron and the leaders of the European Union, Canada and NATO met with Zelensky on Friday for talks on Ukraine.
A US official said Rubio did not attend those talks due to a packed schedule, but was “engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings” in Munich.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said he discussed ending the Russian invasion with Wang, whose country is a close partner of Moscow.
Wang told Sybiga that Beijing was “willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid”, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Macron, meanwhile, said a new framework was needed to deal with “an aggressive Russia” once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
“If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk,” said Merz. “But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously.”
Zelensky, urged by Trump to “get moving” on a deal to end the war, visited a drone factory near Munich with German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius before meeting with European leaders.
“It’s good to have strong partnership with Americans... but I think that Europe... needs (an) independent defence industry, very strong,” he said.
NATO’s Secretary General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the conference that Europe was “stepping up... taking more of a leadership role within NATO” and “taking more care of its own defence”.
“A strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever,” Rutte said.

What to know about the investigation into Nancy Guthrie's disappearance and the search for clues
Law enforcement agents have been gathering more potential evidence as the search for “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie’s mother heads into its third week

Law enforcement agents have been gathering more potential evidence as the search for “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie 's mother heads into its third week.
Nancy Guthrie, 84, was last seen at her Arizona home on Jan. 31 and was reported missing the following day. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.
Authorities have expressed concern about Nancy Guthrie’s health because she needs vital daily medicine. She is said to have a pacemaker and have dealt with high blood pressure and heart issues, according to sheriff’s dispatcher audio on broadcastify.com.
Here's what to know about her disappearance and the intense search to find her:
Video of masked man
The Federal Bureau of Investigation released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door in Tucson the night she vanished. A porch camera recorded video of a person with a backpack who was wearing a ski mask, long pants, jacket and gloves.
On Thursday, the FBI called the person a suspect. It described him as a man about 5 feet, 9 inches tall with a medium build. The agency said he was carrying a 25-liter “Ozark Trail Hiker Pack” backpack.
Investigators initially said there was no surveillance video available since Guthrie didn’t have an active subscription to the doorbell camera company. But digital forensics experts kept working to find images in back-end software that might have been lost, corrupted or inaccessible.
Studying DNA
Investigators collected DNA from Guthrie’s property which doesn’t belong to Guthrie or those in close contact with her, the Pima County Sheriff's Department said. Investigators are working to identify who it belongs to.
Evidence requiring forensic analysis is being sent to the same out-of-state lab that has been used since the beginning of the case, the department said.
Investigators found several gloves, the nearest about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home, and submitted them for lab analysis, the sheriff’s department said. It did not specify what type of gloves.
The sheriff stressed his department is working closely with the FBI.
Sorting through tips
The Pima County sheriff and the FBI announced phone numbers and a website to offer tips. Several hundred detectives and agents have been assigned to the case, the sheriff’s department said.
The FBI said it has collected more than 13,000 tips since Feb. 1, the day Guthrie was reported missing. The sheriff’s department, meanwhile, said it has taken at least 18,000 calls.
The sheriff’s department has not said whether any tips have advanced the investigation.
Intensive searches
Late Friday night, law enforcement sealed off a road about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from Guthrie’s home as part of their investigation. A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock.
The sheriff’s department said the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but declined to detail specifics.
On Tuesday, sheriff deputies detained a person for questioning during a traffic stop south of Tucson. Authorities didn’t say what led them to stop the man but confirmed he was released.
The same day, deputies and FBI agents conducted a court-authorized search in Rio Rico, about an hour's drive south of the city.
Family pleas
Savannah Guthrie, her sister and her brother have shared on social media multiple video messages to their mother’s purported captor.
The family’s Instagram videos have shifted in tone from impassioned pleas to whoever may have their mom, saying they want to talk and are even willing to pay a ransom, to bleaker and more desperate requests for the public’s help.
The latest video on Thursday was simply a home video of their mother and a promise to “never give up on her.”
A quiet neighborhood
Nancy Guthrie lived alone in the upscale Catalina Foothills neighborhood, where houses are spaced far apart and set back from the street by long driveways, gates and dense desert vegetation.
Savannah Guthrie grew up in Tucson, graduated from the University of Arizona and once worked at a television station in the city, where her parents settled in the 1970s. She joined “Today” in 2011.
In a video, she described her mother as a “loving woman of goodness and light.”

An overnight Russian drone strike on Odesa set a residential building on fire and killed a woman inside, the governor of the southern Ukrainian region said on Saturday morning.
Russian forces attacked the area with strike drones, hitting a one-story private home in the city. The impact damaged the roof and sparked a fire, which emergency crews quickly extinguished. During search and rescue operations, responders later discovered the body of a woman beneath the rubble.

Odesa Regional Military Administration head Oleh Kiper confirmed the fatality, saying the victim was killed as a result of the drone strike. Odesa Military Administration chief Serhii Lysak added that the woman was born in 1950 and was found trapped under the debris of the destroyed house.
Beyond the completely ruined home, the blast wave shattered windows in neighboring buildings and damaged nearby outbuildings and private residences, authorities said.
Ukraine’s State Emergency Service reported that a psychologist was deployed at the scene to provide support to residents who found themselves at the epicenter of the attack and to those who lost a loved one.
Northeast of the Black Sea port region, a barrage on Zaporizhzhia region in the past 24 hours killed at least one person and wounded three others, regional military chief Ivan Fedorov said.
“Over the last 24 hours, the invaders carried out 655 strikes on 41 settlements in the Zaporizhzhia region,” he said.
Zelensky Says All Ukraine Power Plants Damaged but Energy System Still Functions
The latest deadly attacks come as US and European leaders, diplomats and defence chiefs gather for a high-powered summit in Munich, with how to end the war in Ukraine top of mind.

Maxim Krippa, owner of the Parus business center and the Ukraine hotel in Kyiv city center, is acquiring Graal LLC through his investment fund Ars Capital. The company holds development rights for a strategic land plot near Khreshchatyk Street in the heart of the city center.
According to Forbes, Graal LLC was previously owned by Kyiv developer Igor Nikonov (founder of KAN Development). KAN Development’s press service confirmed its exit from the project, while City Capital Group declined to comment.

On Feb. 12, the Antimonopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMCU) granted the fund permission to gain sole control over the developer Graal LLC.
As reported by Forbes, the project involves building a multifunctional complex named “Stolychnyi” on six land plots totaling 0.86 hectares (2.1 acres). The complex will feature a total area of over 44,140 square meters (475,120 sq ft), including 219 apartments, offices, and retail premises. The building also includes a multi-level underground parking facility.
In a written response to Forbes, the Ars Capital press service stated that the goal of the acquisition is to transform a long-frozen development site into a modern and functional space, and to “align the area with a unified aesthetic standard for European Square.” The location is next to the Dnipro Hotel, which was officially purchased in 2020 by Alexander Kokhanovsky, founder of the NAVI esports team – the key asset owned by Krippa.

Africa’s exclusion from UN Security Council ‘indefensible,’ Guterres tells AU summit
Leaders also spotlight water security as key to peace, climate resilience, development
ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia
UN chief Antonio Guterres told African leaders on Saturday that the continent’s lack of permanent representation on the UN Security Council is “indefensible,” urging long-delayed global reforms as the African Union opened its annual summit.
“This is 2026 – not 1946,” he said, adding that whenever global decisions affecting Africa are made, “Africa must be at the table.”
Guterres also called for urgent action to end conflicts across the continent, including an immediate ceasefire in Sudan and renewed commitments to halt fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
At the same time, leaders placed strong emphasis on water security, the official theme of this year’s summit, warning that climate pressures and resource scarcity are increasingly linked to instability.
Outgoing AU Chairperson Joao Lourenco said African nations meet at a moment of global transition and must move from reacting to crises to shaping international agendas.
“Africa’s strength will lie in a union that is confident and united,” he said, stressing that the continent must assert its voice and influence global decision-making.
AU Commission Chairperson Mahmoud Ali Youssouf framed water as both a development and security issue, calling it "our continental wealth” that must be used to promote peace and stability.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed noted that water is “more than a resource; it is the foundation of development, innovation, and stability,” and can become an engine of peace when managed cooperatively.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who also attended the summit, said Europe’s future is inseparable from Africa’s stability and prosperity, underscoring the continent’s growing geopolitical importance.
"Neither Italy nor Europe can have a bright future without the meaningful participation of Africa," she said.
During the summit, Burundi’s President Evariste Ndayishimiye was elected African Union chairperson for 2026, taking over from Lourenco.
The two-day gathering is also expected to review major security crises across Africa, including Sudan, the Sahel region, and Somalia, alongside discussions on climate action, economic reform, and institutional strengthening.

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. Agencies within the US Department of Homeland Security have been left without funding due to a partial government shutdown and are formally required to cease operations.
On Thursday, a funding bill for the department failed to secure the necessary votes in the US Senate. As a result, the department partially suspended operations at midnight Friday into Saturday local time. This is the third shutdown in the United States in recent months, but this time it affects only one department.
Most employees are expected to continue working, but without pay. This concerns several agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Coast Guard, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and the US Secret Service.
At the same time, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agencies, whose operations were largely central to the shutdown, can continue working with minimal changes through funding from other bills.

Bulgaria saw a record influx of Romanian tourists in 2025, according to the latest figures from the National Statistical Institute. Nearly one million overnight stays in Bulgarian accommodation facilities were registered from Romania, marking an 8.5% increase compared to 2024. This milestone represents the highest number of tourist registrations from the country to date, and shows a remarkable 51.2% rise compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Outgoing Minister of Tourism Miroslav Borsos highlighted these results as proof of the ministry’s targeted efforts to position Bulgaria as a preferred destination through strategic marketing and strong international partnerships. He noted that Romanian visitors are drawn to Bulgaria for its variety, quality, and authentic experiences, signaling both recognition and a responsibility to continually enhance the tourism offer.
In line with these achievements, Bulgaria is showcasing its tourism potential at the TTR 2026 international exhibition in Bucharest, held from February 12 to 15. The event brings together tour operators, agencies, hoteliers, and institutions from across Europe, providing an opportunity to promote Bulgaria’s destinations and services to the Romanian market. The country’s national stand, presented in a fresh new visual concept, emphasizes the blend of tradition and modernity. Visitors can explore the diversity of Bulgaria’s offerings, from cultural and urban tourism to seaside, winter, and eco experiences, reinforcing the message that Bulgaria is a year-round destination.
Special attention is given to cultural heritage, including crafts and the internationally recognized Bulgarian bagpipe, added to UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage List in 2025. The exhibition space aims to immerse visitors in Bulgarian culture, natural beauty, and hospitality, drawing interest from attending media. Borsos underlined that the innovative design of the national stand reflects the direction of Bulgarian tourism: a combination of modern trends, traditions, and national identity. He stressed that the country is being presented as an inspiring, safe, and competitive destination offering experiences across all seasons. Participation in TTR 2026 forms part of Bulgaria’s broader strategy to strengthen its presence in key international markets and promote sustainable growth within the tourism sector.

Indian national admits role in plot to assassinate US Sikh leader
Prosecutors say plot to kill Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun was linked to India government employee, an allegation New Delhi denies.
An Indian national has admitted in a United States court that he took part in a 2023 scheme to hire a hitman to assassinate a prominent Sikh separatist leader living in New York, federal prosecutors said.
Nikhil Gupta, 54, pleaded guilty on Friday over his alleged role in attempting to make contact with a hitman to kill Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh separatist who holds dual US and Canadian citizenship.

Pannun is affiliated with a New York-based group called Sikhs for Justice that advocates for the secession of Punjab, a northern Indian state with a large Sikh population.
In court, Gupta told Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn that while in India in 2023, he transferred $15,000 online to someone he believed would carry out the assassination.
The individual that Gupta contacted was, in fact, a confidential source working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
FBI Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky said Pannun “became a target of transnational repression solely for exercising their freedom of speech”.
Gupta, who was detained at Prague airport in the Czech Republic in June 2023 and extradited to the US, pleaded guilty to “murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering”, the US attorney’s office for the southern district of New York said in a statement.
Under federal sentencing guidelines, Gupta could face between 20 and 24 years in prison. A plea agreement calls for him to serve at least two decades.
He is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29.
US and Canadian authorities say the plot forms part of a wider campaign to target Indian dissidents abroad, allegations that have strained ties between Washington, Ottawa and New Delhi.
‘The Sikh state of Khalistan is my life’s mission’
James C Barnacle Jr, head of the FBI’s New York office, said Gupta worked with an Indian government employee who directed him to arrange the killing.
Prosecutors allege that Indian intelligence officer Vikash Yadav, who remains at large, directed the plot and recruited Gupta in May 2023 to hire a hitman to carry out the murder.
Indian officials have denied involvement, saying any such operation would be contrary to government policy.
The case has drawn attention from Sikh activists in the US and Canada.
About two dozen Sikh supporters of Pannun attended Friday’s hearing, some chanting a victory slogan afterwards and holding a prayer service outside the court, waving yellow “Khalistan” flags – the name which they hope one day will replace Punjab.
Pannun, who is designated a “terrorist” by New Delhi, said in a telephone interview after the hearing that he would continue his activism “even if I have to face a bullet”.
“I’m not a terrorist”, he told The Associated Press news agency.
He described himself as a Sikh who, as a human rights lawyer, is campaigning to turn Punjab into a place where “all religions will have equal rights”.
Describing Gupta as “just a foot soldier”, Pannun called on US authorities to pursue those in India who he says authorised the plot.
“The Indian government cannot shield itself behind this operational foot soldier because the command, the direction and the funds are authorised by the Indian government,” he alleged.
“I am ready to take India’s bullet rather than take a step back and live like a slave. Working towards the independence of the Sikh state of Khalistan is my life’s mission, until either I am killed or Punjab becomes an independent country,” Pannun said.

China’s top court rules drivers responsible in assisted driving cases

16:21:10 KST

China's top court has issued a ruling confirming humans in cars with assisted driving technology are responsible for their vehicle, setting a nationwide benchmark as Beijing positions itself as a standards-setter in the auto market.
Drivers are still responsible for ensuring road safety after activating assisted driving functions, China's top court said in a "guiding case" issued on Friday.
"The on-board assisted driving system cannot replace the driver as the primary driving subject," the Supreme People's Court said in the Friday ruling.
The driver "is still the one who actually performs the driving tasks and bears the responsibility to ensure driving safety", it added.
Chinese tech companies and carmakers have poured billions of dollars into autonomous driving technology in the race to outperform each other, as well as rivals in the US and Europe.
However, Beijing has moved to tighten safety rules after a high-profile crash last March.
Establishing legal standard
In its ruling, the court referred to a case in which a man relied on the technology while drunk and asleep at the wheel.
The reference case is a September ruling in southern Zhejiang province, in which a driver surnamed Wang was jailed and fined for fully relying on the assisted driving system while drunk.
Wang installed a device to mimic hand grip on the steering wheel, set the car to drive, then fell asleep in the passenger seat, the court said.
Police found Wang after the car stopped in the middle of a road.
While most such systems currently used on the road specify that the driver is ultimately in control of the car, the court's ruling now makes that a legal standard nationwide.
Lower courts are to reference the judgement when deciding on similar cases.
Tightening safety rules
Beijing had already warned leading automakers that safety rules would be more tightly enforced after a crash that killed three college students last March raised concerns over the advertising of cars as being capable of autonomous driving.
Friday's guidance comes after China announced it will ban hidden door handles on cars, a minimalist design popularised by Tesla, from next year, also over safety concerns.
Folding into the body of the car, such door handles help reduce drag while in motion but are prone to losing operability in the event of a crash.
One high-profile incident occurred in October, when rescuers were shown failing to open the doors of a burning electric vehicle in the southwestern city of Chengdu.

In 2025, Bulgarian wineries produced a total of 66 million litres of wine, according to Krasimir Koev, Executive Director of the Executive Agency on Vine and Wine. Koev made the announcement while attending a traditional vine-pruning ceremony at Plovdiv Agricultural University, held in celebration of Trifon Zarezan, the annual festival honoring vine growers and winemakers.
Koev noted that Bulgaria currently has 365 active wineries operating across the country. He added that production and grape harvests fell by 10-15 percent compared to previous years, citing challenging climatic conditions as the main factor. Despite this, certain regions with effective irrigation systems managed to yield high-quality grapes. Koev emphasized that Bulgarian winemakers are highly trained, with five years of university-level education in agronomy and enology, and are recognized internationally for their expertise.
Annual wine consumption in Bulgaria ranges between 110 and 120 million litres, Koev said, highlighting that there is no risk of excess stock. He also pointed out that domestic wine dominates the market, with foreign wines accounting for only about 10 percent of overall consumption, reflecting strong local preference for Bulgarian varieties.

Some lovebirds in Hong Kong are expressing their affection this Valentine’s Day by spending hundreds of dollars on bouquets and gifts, while several vendors have recorded growth in sales of about 20 per cent.
At the bustling Flower Market in Mong Kok, many men were among the crowds picking bouquets of roses, while others browsed for flowers to celebrate the coming Lunar New Year. The high number of shoppers on Tung Choi Street even prompted police to put in place crowd control measures.
Stalls were lined with bouquets of all sizes from a handful of red roses to 99, ranging from about HK$200 (US$25.60) to HK$3,000.

February 14 in Bulgaria: Honoring Trifon Zarezan and the Joy of Wine

Today, February 14, Bulgarians across the country are raising their glasses to celebrate Trifon Zarezan, the traditional holiday honoring the patron saint of vineyards and wine. Known as the “wine grower’s day,” Trifon Zarezan has been a staple of Bulgarian folklore for centuries, combining agricultural rituals, lively gatherings, and a touch of magic for a good harvest.
The holiday traces back to medieval times and even earlier, when wine production was a central part of Bulgarian life. Saint Trifon, a Christian saint venerated for his connection to vineyards and fertility, became associated with the care of grapevines. Over time, the day evolved into a festival where winemakers, vineyard workers, and families would honor the land and ensure a bountiful grape harvest.
Traditionally, the festivities begin with the symbolic pruning of the vines, performed by vineyard owners or local officials. This ritual is believed to protect the vines, encourage strong growth, and guarantee a plentiful harvest later in the year. People also sprinkle wine on the soil as a blessing for fertility and abundance.
No Trifon Zarezan celebration is complete without wine. People gather to taste the first wine of the season, often accompanied by hearty meals, music, and dancing. Folk songs and dances energize the festivities, connecting participants to Bulgaria’s rich cultural heritage. In some regions, communities organize small competitions for the best wine, highlighting the pride locals take in their craft.
In urban areas, the holiday has a more festive and social character. Restaurants, wine bars, and cultural centers host events where friends and families share wine, laughter, and stories, blending the old traditions with modern celebrations.
Interestingly, Trifon Zarezan coincides with Saint Valentine’s Day, celebrated by some Bulgarians, particularly the younger generation. For them, February 14 is a dual celebration: honoring both love and wine. Some couples combine the two, enjoying a romantic meal with a glass of local wine while taking part in the traditional customs of Trifon Zarezan.

With Europe’s trust in US undermined, Washington seeks to ease tensions — NYT

NEW YORK, February 14. /TASS/. Europe has lost trust in the United States, and Washington is attempting to reduce tensions in relations with European countries at the Munich Security Conference, The New York Times (NYT) writes.
"European trust in America’s commitment to shared values, European security and even territorial integrity was already damaged, but after Davos (World Economic Forum - TASS) many of Europe’s leaders gave up hope for a return to the old trans-Atlantic relationship," the op-ed states.
According to the publication, at the conference that kicked off on February 13 in Munich, the US has been making efforts at de-escalation. American officials are reportedly guided by the so-called "pragmatic realism," and do not make insults toward Europe.
"But there is little evidence that American policy has changed," the NYT adds, noting that Europeans remain skeptical and wary of the United States.

ChatGPT’s AI caricature social media trend could be a gift to fraudsters, experts  warn
Unknown

16:00:54 KST

Images uploaded to AI chatbots could be retained for an unknown amount of time and, if in the wrong hands, could lead to impersonation, scams, and fake social media accounts.
The artificial intelligence (AI) created caricature trend that showcases everything a chatbot knows about someone in a colourful picture, can pose serious security risks, according to cybersecurity experts.
Users upload a photo of themselves with a company logo or details about their role and ask OpenAI’s ChatGPT to create a caricature of them and their job using what the chatbot knows about them.
Cybersecurity experts told Euronews Next that social media challenges, such as AI caricatures, can provide fraudsters with a treasure trove of valuable information. A single image, paired with personal details, can be more revealing than users realise.
“You are doing fraudsters’ work for them - giving them a visual representation of who you are,” according to Bob Long, vice-president at age authentication company Daon.
The wording of itself should raise red flags, he argued, because it “sounds like it was intentionally started by a fraudster looking to make the job easy.”
What happens to images once they’re uploaded?
When a user uploads an image to an AI chatbot, the system processes the image to extract data, such as the person’s emotion, environment, or information that could disclose their location, according to cybersecurity consultant Jake Moore. That information may then be stored for an unknown period of time.
Long said the images collected from users can be used and retained to train AI image generators as part of their datasets.
A data breach at a company like OpenAI could mean sensitive data, such as uploaded images and personal information gathered by the chatbot, could fall into the hands of bad actors who could exploit it.
In the wrong hands, a single, high-resolution image could be used to create fake social media accounts or realistic AI deepfakes that could be used to run a scam, according to Charlotte Wilson, head of enterprise at Check Point, an Israeli cybersecurity company.
“Selfies help criminals move from generic scams to personalised, high-conviction impersonation,” she said.
OpenAI’s privacy settings state that uploaded images may be used to improve the model, which can include training it. When asked about the model’s privacy settings, ChatGPT clarified that this does not mean every photo is placed in a public database.
Instead, the chatbot said it uses patterns from user content to refine how the system generates images.
What to do if you want to participate in AI trends
For those who still want to follow the trend, experts recommend limiting what you share.
Wilson said users should avoid uploading images that reveal any identifying information.
“Crop tightly, keep the background plain, and do not include badges, uniforms, work lanyards, location clues or anything that ties you to an employer or a routine,” she said.
Wilson cautioned against oversharing personal information in the prompts, such as their job title, city or employer.
Meanwhile, Moore recommended reviewing privacy settings before participating, including the option to remove data from AI training.
OpenAI has a privacy portal which lets users opt out of AI data training by clicking on “do not train on my content.”
Users can also opt out of training from their text conversations with ChatGPT by turning off an “improve the model for everyone” setting.
Under EU law, users can request the deletion of personal data collected by the company. However, OpenAI notes it may retain some information even after deletion to address fraud, abuse and security concerns.

Pension annuity sales hit record as average pot exceeds £80,000

The government’s “inheritance tax raid” on pensions has helped drive sales of retirement annuities to new highs.
Industry data this week revealed they enjoyed a “record-breaking” 2025, with sales growing by 4% to £7.4bn and the average amount invested in an annuity surpassing £80,000 for the first time.
Some of this enthusiasm for what many people traditionally viewed as a dull, poor value product, has been put down to people who are keen to ensure that no more of their cash than is necessary ends up in the hands of HM Revenue and Customs. In addition, many are seeking some certainty in turbulent times.
An annuity is a product that converts an individual’s pension pot into a regular, guaranteed income for the rest of their life (or for a fixed term). They pay a life insurance company a lump sum, and, in exchange, it guarantees a regular payout.
Demand plummeted after the “pension freedoms” introduced in 2015 meant people no longer had to take one out. But changes to inheritance tax (IHT) on pensions announced by Rachel Reeves in her October 2024 budget helped give them a new lease of life.
She said money left in a defined contribution (AKA money purchase) pension after someone’s death will be pulled into the IHT net from April 2027. All private pensions, and most workplace schemes, are defined contribution.
The changes mean “unused” pension savings could be taxed as part of someone’s estate if they exceed the IHT threshold. Unused funds are money in a pension pot that has not been used to claim an income – such as buying an annuity.
Commenting on the data issued by the Association of British Insurers, Clare Moffat at the insurer Royal London said: “With changes next year to inheritance tax and pensions, there has been an increased interest in using annuities for IHT planning.”
Annuities now also offer better value than they used to. Marianna Hunt at the investment firm Fidelity International said its recent data showed that a 66-year-old in good health with a £300,000 pension pot could buy a single-life annuity paying £22,440 a year – a rate of about 7.5%.
“Five years ago, rates were closer to 4%to 5%, delivering roughly £13,500 from the same pot. That’s a substantial uplift in guaranteed income,” she added.

Andrew aide advised Epstein to omit conviction on China visa form, files suggest

An aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor advised Jeffrey Epstein to illegally hide his child sexual abuse conviction to obtain a visa to China, according to the latest Epstein files release.
David Stern, who was a close associate of both Epstein and the then prince, was asked for his help after the disgraced financier’s initial application for a visa was rejected.
Stern advised Epstein’s assistant to make the application at the Chinese embassy in Paris and “in addition it will be better not to tick the boxes re being denied previously or criminal charges”.
Stern added in the email chain of 2012: “Whether or not to do this should be J’s decision of course and not mine.”
Epstein was given an 18-month jail sentence in the US in 2008 after pleading guilty to soliciting girls as young as 14.
There is no suggestion that Mountbatten-Windsor knew of Stern’s advice and it does not appear that Epstein made the planned visit to Beijing.
Stern, 48, was a fixer to Mountbatten-Windsor from about 2010 and a director of his Pitch@Palace business between 2016 and 2019. He was also close to Epstein, describing him as his mentor.
Stern had proposed a year earlier that he and Epstein set up an investment office in Beijing for “high net worth individuals” and “very discreetly make PA part of it and use his ‘aura and access’”.
PA is the abbreviation regularly used by Stern and Epstein in correspondence contained within the 3m documents released by the US Department of Justice relating to the disgraced American financier, who killed himself in his cell in 2019.
It is unclear whether the idea for a Beijing office was developed but an email from the 23 June 2012 suggests the three men did conspire further about working together in Asia. Stern, a German national now believed to be living in the United Arab Emirates, wrote to Epstein that there were two options open to them.
The first would be to launch a company called the Serpentine group, which would be a “new company for this purpose only”. The second was to use Stern’s company Asia Gateway, which “has history and accounts and prove (sic) of clients in the past and can be used”.
Stern said he had “informed PA that you are thinking about the company set up and I will wait for your feedback before taking action … He replied that I should at least send the letter so we can proceed … I will wait for your instruction.”
Epstein responded: “Send asia gateway.”
Stern wrote back: “Understood and confirmed: it will be done as Asia Gateway. PA agrees to your decision. Letter will be send (sic) as below.”
In the letter to Mountbatten-Windsor of which the royal was seemingly already aware, Stern wrote that Asia Gateway was an advisory firm based in South Kensington that focuses on “developing, structuring and investing in a wide range of projects, specifically connected to the United Kingdom”.
It says: “My deep admiration for your relentless work as the UK’s special representative for international trade and investment serves as inspiration to the AG business model. Knowing your commitment to the UK and its trade and businesses I wonder if there is not more that could be done to establish a business network of unrivalled comparison.
“Additionally and based on my thirteen years of business experience with China, AG aims to attract Chinese investors and companies to the UK market and relevant opportunities. I know this is an area of opportunity for the UK as a whole and is a priority for the UK government. I would be most honoured to discuss this approach with you personally and to understand, if it were possible, how AG can support your crucial work.”
Stern and Mountbatten-Windsor have been approached for comment.
Thames Valley police are liaising with prosecutors and examining material in the Epstein files in relation to allegations related to “misconduct in public office” by Mountbatten-Windsor.
The former prince is alleged to have leaked confidential information to Epstein, including official reports of trips to Singapore, Hong Kong and Vietnam in 2010 and 2011 when he was a government trade envoy. Trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality.
According to the police, officers are seeking “to determine whether a criminal offence is suspected and whether a full investigation is required”.
The former British ambassador to the US Peter Mandelson faces an investigation relating to the same alleged offence, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.
Both men have denied any wrongdoing.

‘My husband burned down our house – then the bank threatened repossession’

Family life ended for Francesca Onody on a late summer evening in 2022 when her abusive husband doused their cottage with petrol as police arrived to arrest him. She and her children escaped seconds before the building exploded. Her husband Malcolm Baker died in the blaze.
That night, Onody lost her husband, her home, her pets and her possessions.
She also lost all her money. Shortly before he died, Baker had emptied their joint bank accounts and cancelled her mortgage protection and buildings insurance.
Three years later, she faced losing the little she had left. The mortgage lender, Halifax, announced that it planned to repossess the property to pay off the £35,000 of mortgage arrears and other charges that had accrued since Baker’s death. That included the land around the ruins of her home, where she and her children have been living in a caravan ever since the fire.
“It feels like my world has once again imploded,” she said when she first contacted Guardian Money in June last year. “I saw my home razed to the ground. I’ve scraped together to put a very basic roof over mine and my kids’ heads, and now the Halifax want to literally pull the ground out from under our feet.”
This month, three-and-a-half years after the explosion, Onody, 53, was able to pay off the mortgage and take possession of the land. Halifax halted proceedings after Guardian Money intervened. It also cancelled the interest and fees that had accrued on the mortgage during Onody’s long legal battles to secure probate.
Her ordeal exposes the legal and financial obstacles faced by domestic abuse victims long after a relationship has ended.
In the years since Baker’s death, she has had to challenge his will, which left her with nothing, battle banks and insurers, and fund a barrister to represent her at his inquest.
Meanwhile, red tape at the Probate Office and the Land Registry left her in legal limbo for months.
Worst of all, at one point she faced potential blame for Baker’s death when the Home Office commissioned a domestic homicide review to establish whether he was the abuse victim. The Home Office later apologised to her. It acknowledged in a letter that Baker was the perpetrator and that the investigation had “continued the dynamics of abuse” that Onody had suffered during the 18-year marriage.
“My husband’s campaign of financial and domestic abuse was strategically planned to continue after his death, and the subsequent lack of recognition and support from organisations has inflicted further years of fear on me,” she says.
Onody’s nightmare began years before the explosion. Baker, a Metropolitan police superintendent, had become mentally unstable after retiring from the Met in 2011, his inquest was told. He was also a heavy drinker. Onody says matters escalated when she demanded a divorce.
“He became more vindictive, threatening to ruin mine and my kids’ lives,” she says. “On one occasion he left a dead rabbit in my bed. We lived in a constant state of anxiety, wondering whether in a drunken stupor or one of his rages he might destroy our house around us while we slept.”
Baker began stockpiling canisters of petrol in the family home, Onody says, and she made frequent calls to the police as his behaviour became more threatening.
On his final night, she had dialled 999 after a confrontation. Baker barricaded himself in an upstairs bedroom when officers arrived. Onody and her children were downstairs when petrol began streaming through the sitting room ceiling. Police evacuated the house, which caught fire seconds later and exploded. Baker, still barricaded upstairs, could not be saved.
Onody and her children moved into a caravan alongside the ruin without heating or piped water. Since the deeds to the property and the mortgage were in Baker’s sole name, she was unable to sell the land or apply to rebuild the cottage.
It took her 28 months to successfully contest his will under the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act and to be appointed as personal representative of the estate.
During that time, she was not authorised to discuss the mortgage with the Halifax since she was not named in probate.
She took over the administration of the estate in February 2025 and discovered that in the interim, £34,700 of mortgage arrears and legal fees had built up, and a repossession order had been issued by the Halifax.
Halifax, she claims, initially agreed to allow her to remortgage the estate in her own name so she could sell the land, but last June it withdrew the offer and warned her that the property would be repossessed unless she paid off the debt within two months.
It is at that point that Onody first contacted the Guardian for help.
“I am being punished for my husband’s actions, with the Halifax now acting in his place as financial controller and abuser,” she said in an impact statement. “If I had a mortgage in my name and lodged with Land Registry, I would be able to move forward with my plan to sell the land, pay off all debts and build us a home and a secure, fear-free future.”
Halifax suspended the repossession order after Guardian Money questioned its handling of the case. It agreed to transfer the mortgage into her name once the deeds to the property had been amended to show her as the owner. It also admitted that a staff member had erroneously worked on a mortgage application for her last February and paid her £500 as an apology.
A spokesperson for Halifax said: “We recognise the very difficult and complex situation Ms Onody faced. While trying to support her as she awaited the court’s decision on the disputed will, we could have explained more clearly what we were able to do and what steps she needed to take to transfer the deeds.
“We’re sorry we didn’t provide the level of support she needed at first. To put this right, we paused recovery action against the estate indefinitely to give her time to complete the deed transfer, paid her £500 compensation, and reduced the mortgage balance by over £21,000 to the date of her husband’s death.
“We’ve always been willing to discuss mortgage options once the deeds were in her name, but we understand her decision to sell the land and move on.”
The Land Registry agreed to expedite the application for the transfer of deeds when we got in touch.
Onody became legal owner of the land in November, and this month she paid off the mortgage.
She now hopes to sell the land and buy a property elsewhere to rebuild a life with her children.
“It’s been a really tough time for years,” she says, “but I’m ever-optimistic that there can be some degree of happy ending.”
The Financial Conduct Authority introduced new rules in 2023 to force financial firms to improve support for vulnerable customers. The Consumer Duty requires companies to act flexibly to protect customers in vulnerable situations but, according to the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, victims like Onody are still being failed.
“This story is a heartbreaking but sadly all-too-common reflection of the devastating harm caused by economic abusers,” says its chief executive Sam Smethers.
“Perpetrators will use any tool at their disposal – from insurance products to joint mortgages – to maintain control and cause earth-shattering harm to victim-survivors. Financial services [companies] have made significant progress in the support they offer victim-survivors of economic abuse, but there’s still a long way to go.”

In upcoming elections, Republicans have a Texas problem — and so do Democrats

With less than nine months until the midterm elections, Donald Trump's party is in trouble. The president's policies and actions are unpopular, Republicans keep losing special elections, and now even have to defend once-solid seats in Congress. One state has become a focal point: Texas.
“Don’t mess with Texas”: visitors to the second biggest US state have no doubt seen this phrase on everything from T-shirts to belt buckles.
Politically, it has become the unofficial slogan of conservatives whose message is two-fold: Texas is a class of its own — the only state that was an independent republic before joining the United States — and it is solid Republican territory.
The multi-million-dollar question that pundits in Austin and Washington are asking is whether this will end in this year’s midterm elections.
After scoring a sensational win in a state Senate special election in late January, Democrats are brimming with excitement.
Driven by US President Donald Trump’s growing unpopularity, they believe they have a shot at cracking historic Republican dominance and winning what Time Magazine has called “the wildest Senate race in the country."
“A Democratic victory in Texas in November would be an earth-shattering event that would signal a massive shift of political power and mean a major step towards Democrats controlling the US Senate,” Mark Jones, political scientist at Rice University in Houston Mark Jones told Euronews.
“It would end the longest losing streak anywhere in the country for Democrats,” added Jones, whose research focuses on electoral laws and voting patterns.
The longest losing streak, indeed. The last time a Democrat won a presidential election in Texas was Jimmy Carter in 1976, and the last statewide office a Democrat won was in 1994.
What gives Democrats hope is not just that they flipped a state Senate seat in the latest special election in Texas, but also the sheer size of their victory.
This was a district that Trump won by more than 17 points two years ago, and that the Republican candidate lost by 14 points – an eye-popping swing of more than 30 points towards the Democrats.
“This was remarkable and highly unusual,” said Cal Jillson, who wrote nine books on US and Texas politics and teaches at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.
“There was a massive shift of disaffected Republicans and independents who voted for the Democratic candidate,” Jillson added.
“People are no longer excited about Trump, which should be a warning sign for Republicans across the country.”
This is setting the stage for a potentially epic and, with a price tag of more than $300 million, most expensive Senate race in Texas history.
The money surge is being driven largely by Republicans in an unusually competitive and nasty matchup.
In the 3 March primary, long-time incumbent Senator John Cornyn, who is seeking a fifth consecutive term, is facing the toughest reelection campaign of his career, challenged by MAGA hothead Attorney General Ken Paxton and US Representative Wesley Hunt of Houston, another right winger.
Texas is one of a handful of states that require a candidate to get a majority of the votes in a primary to advance to the general election, not just a plurality.
This means a candidate must get 50% plus one vote to win an election, otherwise the top two vote-getters in each primary advance to a runoff.
Latest polling from the University of Houston suggests the Republican race could head to a runoff in May between Paxton (38%) and Cornyn (31%).
Such an outcome would delight state Democrats, as the controversial Paxton is considered an easier target in the general election.
Sounding the alarm, top Republican senators in Washington are trying a last-ditch push to get Trump to endorse Cornyn to keep the Texas seat safely in Republican hands.
But Trump, who normally relishes being the kingmaker among Republican candidates, has been ominously silent so far.
"I don’t expect him to weigh in," said Bill Miller, an Austin-based political consultant who has worked with both Republicans and Democrats.
"He’s very close to Ken Paxton, and John Cornyn is a sitting senator and has professed his love for Trump now. Trump's getting the best of all possible worlds."
Fearing for their majority, Republicans in the Senate beg to differ.
“It’s a very difficult race, and one that’s going to be a lot more expensive to hold the seat,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune told CNN about the impact of Trump remaining neutral.
Asked why Trump is ignoring the pleas, Thune said: “I’m probably not the right person to answer that question.”
Polls suggest that if Paxton beats Cornyn in the primary, it could open the door to another stunning Democratic victory.
If Democrats nominate the right candidate, that is.
The prospect of a Paxton candidacy has galvanised Democrats, but they are facing a tough primary choice between two rising stars who represent two opposite strategies for the future direction of the party.
On one side is US Representative Yasmine Crockett, a left-wing firebrand who has made a name in Washington as a make-no-prisoners nemesis of the Trump administration.
On the other is James Talarico, a moderate Texas state representative and Presbyterian seminarian whose faith-based approach to politics has brought him the support of the largest Latino group – not a small feat in Texas.
Republicans fear Talarico the most because he is more culturally attuned to the conservative state. Crockett may be entertaining, but she'd be the weaker candidate, Professor Jillson said citing polling of possible match-ups.
Yet, the Democrats winning the Texas Senate race is still a long shot.
“But the simple fact that we’re talking about the possibility tells you a lot about how things have been moving in Democrats’ direction,” Jillson said.
Whereas a possible Democratic takeover of the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 53-47 majority, was on nobody’s radar just a few months ago, Democratic control of the House of Representatives is now almost a foregone conclusion.
Or can it still go wrong?
"Democrats still have a lot of homework to do and tell voters what exactly their party stands for," Jackson Janes, resident senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States in Washington, told Euronews.
"If they still make it all about Trump, they will lose in '26 and they will lose in '28," he added.
"Trump is no longer on the ballot and Democrats have a big opportunity to fill the vacuum with a positive message. If they don't do that, they might blow it."
The good news for Democrats is that history is on their side.
“One of the ‘laws’ of American politics is that midterm House elections rarely deliver good news to the president’s party,” writes James Lindsay, senior fellow at the US-based Council on Foreign Relations.
“The midterms in many ways function as a referendum on how presidents are doing, and voters are tough graders," Lindsay pointed out in a research paper.
In the last five midterm elections, the president’s party has lost an average of 31 House seats — as of this article's publication, the Republicans hold a 218-214 lead with three vacancies.
Sensing an electoral rout, Trump has pushed Republicans in solid red states to redraw district lines to create more Republican-leaning districts – and that push started in Texas.
The result has been the creation of five districts expected to swing from Democrats to Republicans.
But this only triggered a backlash from California, where voters in a referendum approved a Democrat-led redistricting that would net the party also five potential new seats.
An obvious risk with such partisan manipulation is that it may backfire.
The redistricting rests on the assumption that the party can shift enough of its voters to change the outcome in a new district without jeopardising its chances of winning in the old district, according to Lindsay.
If voter preferences change, as in the Texas state Senate race, redistricting may inadvertently put a once-solid seat for either party into play. And that can result in a classic political own goal.

Is smart clothing the future of health tracking? Research shows it outperforms current wearables

Sensors in looser clothing outperform tight wearables in tracking body metrics, according to new research.
Most health and fitness trackers take the form of a strap around the wrist or the body. But new research has found that looser clothing can track movement more accurately.
Loose fabric can predict and capture the body’s movement with 40 percent more accuracy and using 80 percent less data, the results published in the journal Nature Communications showed.
Current wearables are tight to the skin, measuring raw movement and vital signs, and converting them into more concrete metrics such as steps, calories, or sleep stages.
The researchers have debunked the common belief that if a sensor is loose, the data will be “noisy” or messy. In fact, loose, flowing clothing makes motion tracking significantly more accurate.
“Meaning, we could move away from 'wearable tech' that feels like medical equipment and toward 'smart clothing' - like a simple button or pin on a dress - that tracks your health while you feel completely natural going about your day,” said Matthew Howard, co-author of the paper and reader in engineering at King’s College London.
He added that when someone moves their arm, a loose sleeve doesn’t just sit there; it folds and moves, reacting more sensitively than a tighter-fitting sensor.
The team at King’s College tested sensors on different fabrics, using both human and robot subjects doing a variety of movements.
They compared the findings from loose fabrics with standard motion sensors attached to straps and tight clothing and found that the fabric-based approach detected movements more quickly, more accurately, and with less data.
Researchers found that the sensor accuracy was not affected by its location in the clothes or the distance from where the fabric touches the body.
Accurate for subtle movements
Sensors in looser clothes could also help sense small movements that current wearables often miss, such as Parkinson's tremors.
“Through this approach, we could ‘amplify’ people’s movement, which will help capture them even when they are smaller than typical abled-bodied movements,” said Irene Di Giulio, co-author of the study at King’s College.
She added that this could allow tracking people from their own homes or care homes while in their everyday clothing by adding the sensor to buttons on shirts.
“It could become easier for doctors to monitor their patients, as well as medical researchers to gather vital data needed to inform our understanding of these conditions and develop new therapies, including wearable technologies that cater for these kinds of disabilities,” Di Giulio said.
Limitations of current trackers
Current wearables have proven useful for measuring steps and movement during exercise; however, they have limitations in clinical metrics, such as heart rate variability, blood pressure, and oxygen levels.
Recent research has found that wearables such as Apple Watches accurately measure heartbeats at rest; however, they show inconsistency and large errors in measuring energy expenditure – especially during activity.

US ends temporary protected status for Yemeni refugees, asylum seekers
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has determined it is safe for Yemenis to return to their country, despite ongoing conflict.
The United States government has ended the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Yemen, ordering the more than 1,000 Yemeni refugees and asylum seekers living in the country to leave within 60 days or face arrest and deportation.
The action on Friday came as part of US President Donald Trump’s broad immigration crackdown, which is impacting those who fled perilous lives in war-torn countries.

It will terminate TPS for roughly 1,400 Yemeni nationals who have had access to the legal status since September 2015 because of armed conflict in their country, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced on Friday.
“After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law’s requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status,” Noem said in a statement.
“Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest,” she said, describing the revocation as an act of “putting America first.”
Contrary to Noem’s determination, Yemen continues to be riven by years-long conflict in one of the world’s poorest nations.
The State Department currently advises against travel to Yemen, citing “terrorism, unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, and landmines”.
TPS allows narrow groups of people in the US to live and work in the country if they’re deemed to be in danger if they return to their home nations, because of war, natural disaster or other extraordinary circumstances.
While the protections are technically temporary, historically, presidents have continued to renew TPS statuses for refugees and asylum seekers rather than revoking them and rendering them undocumented.
The TPS for Yemen was last extended in 2024 and was set to expire on March 3 of this year.
Yemeni beneficiaries with no other lawful basis for remaining in the US have 60 days to voluntarily depart the country or face arrest, the statement said, offering a complimentary plane ticket and a $2,600 “exit bonus” for those who “self-deport”.
Since coming to office last year, Trump has ended the status for Venezuelans, Hondurans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Somalis, Ukrainians and thousands of others.
The Trump administration has also expanded its travel restrictions since returning to power, imposing a total ban on citizens of 19 countries from entering the US, primarily targeting Muslim-majority and African nations, including Yemen, Somalia and South Sudan.
Citizens from a further 29 countries, including Nigeria and Senegal, are subject to partial bans.

What's next for Cuba? Trump turns the screws as the island runs out of jet fuel

Cuba's communist-run government is facing its biggest test since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
U.S. President Donald Trump has ratcheted up the pressure on the Caribbean island since the Jan. 3, military operation to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a long-time ally of Cuba's government. Cuba said 32 of its citizens were killed in the attack.
Trump has since effectively cut Cuba off from Venezuelan oil, called its government "an unusual and extraordinary threat" and pledged to impose tariffs on any country that supplies it with oil.
Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel condemned the move and said: "Surrender is not an option." He's since said the government is prepared to hold talks with Washington, albeit "without pressure or preconditions."
The country has warned that international airlines would no longer be able refuel in the country due to fuel shortages. Gripped by a worsening economic crisis, Cuba's government recently adopted rationing measures to protect essential services and ration fuel supplies for key sectors.
The plan reportedly includes restrictions on fuel sales, the closure of some tourist establishments, shortening school days and a shorter working week at state-owned companies to four days, from Monday to Thursday.
"The current situation in Cuba is as serious as it has been since the 1990s, when Cuba suddenly had to survive without the support of the Eastern Bloc," Par Kumaraswami, professor of Latin American Studies at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, told CNBC by email.

Trump's tariff threats have created a deterrent for many nations, Kumaraswami said.
Mexico has sent humanitarian aid but suspended oil shipments, as it sought to preserve its relationship with Havana while avoiding Trump's tariffs.
Kumaraswami said there was "of course frustration with the difficulties of daily life," but that "many Cubans are resolved to resist threats to their national sovereignty and a new wave of patriotism has emerged."
'An accelerating collapse'
Air Canada subsequently has canceled all flights to Cuba amid the fuel shortage, though the airline said Monday that it would bring some 3,000 customers already in the country home over the coming days.
Tourism is a significant source of revenue for Cuba's cash-strapped government and the country is a popular winter vacation destination for Canadian tourists.
Unlike in previous crises, Cuba's regime lacks foreign partners that can step in to help, according to Robert Munks, head of Americas research at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.
"Raising the stakes, the US has also limited Cuba's access to hard currency and pressured Nicaragua to end visa-free travel for Cubans," Munks told CNBC by email.
The government's pledge to increase the use of limited renewable energy sources is likely "too little, too late," Munks said. He added that outbreaks of civil unrest were possible, given that the island's domestic energy production is far short of what it needs to keep the lights on.
"An accelerating collapse of basic services will put the regime under extreme pressure to find a negotiated solution," Munks said.
He added that "the odds are shortening" on Díaz-Canel being forced from power in the months ahead in a Maduro-style managed transition, but Munks said it was more likely that "the regime will try to muddle through" until the U.S. midterm elections in November.

Cuba's dwindling oil supplies prompted the United Nations to warn of a possible humanitarian "collapse" last week.
"The Secretary-General is extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Cuba, which will worsen, and if not collapse, if its oil needs go unmet," said UN spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric.
A big test for BRICS
Cuba's emergency measures should be seen as crucial test for the BRICS bloc of developing nations, according to Helen Yaffe, a Cuba expert and professor of Latin American political economy at the University of Glasgow, Scotland.
"This is probably the most important test now for BRICS … If BRICS cannot protect, defend and rally around a member, then what is it worth?" Yaffe told CNBC by telephone.
Cuba acquired "partner country" status of the BRICS group in January last year, bolstering its ties with the likes of Brazil, Russia and China. Indeed, each of these three countries have sought to offer support to Cuba in recent days.
A spokesperson for China's foreign ministry said Tuesday that Beijing "stands firmly against the inhumane actions that deprive the Cuban people of their right to subsistence and development." They added that China would, "as always," seek to provide assistance to Cuba.
Russia, meanwhile, has described Havana's fuel situation as "truly critical" and said U.S. attempts to further pressure the country were causing numerous problems.
"The Cuban government is not going to submit," Yaffe said. "The fact is, [the U.S. is] going to keep squeezing and the Cubans are going to keep resisting and there's going to be a lot of unnecessary suffering."
She added: "I'm a historian and it's very vainglorious for historians to try and predict the future but we can look at trends — and I can guarantee you that we were here before in the early 1990s where nobody thought Cuba would pull together and pull through — and they did."

First of all, on behalf of the Chinese embassy in Belarus, I would like to express our sincerest gratitude to the Ministry of Culture of Belarus, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Tourism, and all our partners for the enormous efforts that have made this event possible. And I want to extend my warmest greetings to you, dear guests gathered here today,” the head of the Chinese diplomatic mission emphasized.
The ambassador also noted: “The Spring Festival is the most important and revered traditional holiday of the Chinese people. It is not only the warm moments when families gather together, but also the living heritage of Chinese civilization, its roots and the heartbeat that has endured for thousands of years.”
The diplomat proudly stressed that this holiday, carrying the deep feelings of the Chinese people, was officially inscribed by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity at the end of 2024, becoming a common cultural treasure for the entire world. “This honor inspires us to bring the joy of the Spring Festival to different corners of the planet. Just last year, we held more than 500 festive events in over 100 countries and regions, celebrating the holiday together with the peoples of the world and sharing the unique charm of Chinese culture,” the head of the Chinese diplomatic mission said.
“Belarus is our dear friend, with whom we share this joy. More than ten years have passed since our first joint celebration of the Happy Spring Festival in Minsk in 2014. Starting as a cultural exhibition, this event has grown into a large-scale cultural event, today combining artistic performances, interactive elements of intangible heritage, and cultural and creative exhibitions, becoming a golden thread linking the hearts of our peoples,” the ambassador continued.
The diplomat said: “This year, we have prepared for you a cultural celebration at the intersection of eras and cultures, where antiquity and modernity meet, the spirit of China and Belarus. Here you will be able to get to know about the intangible cultural heritage of Beijing and appreciate the creative ideas of the masters of this ancient capital, as well as enjoy joint performances by Chinese and Belarusian artists, witnessing the harmonious fusion of two magnificent cultures. We want to show you a multifaceted, colorful China and a hospitable Beijing.”
Zhang Wenchuan noted that 2026 is the Year of the Horse according to the Chinese lunar calendar. “In Chinese culture, the horse symbolizes strength, loyalty, and striving forward. In the Chinese language, there are expressions such as ‘full of energy like a dragon and horse,’ which means indomitable vitality, and also ‘may success gallop in with the speed of a horse,’ which embodies the best hopes for swift victory and good fortune. We wholeheartedly wish that relations between China and Belarus, like a horse galloping at full speed, be full of dynamism, steadily move towards the goal of shared prosperity, and rapidly achieve success,” the diplomat noted.
In his opinion, cultures become more diverse and colorful through exchanges, and civilizations are enriched through mutual learning. “May the joyful laughter and merriment of this evening merge into a beautiful wave in the long river of Chinese-Belarusian friendship, promoting the deepening of mutual understanding and the strengthening of mutual trust between our peoples through cultural exchange, so that we can together write a new chapter in the brilliant chronicle of the all-weather and comprehensive strategic partnership between China and Belarus,” the ambassador of China to Belarus wished.

Merz Opens Munich Security Conference Urging Europe to ‘Switch the Mental Gear’

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz opened the Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Friday with a warning that Europe has entered a new era shaped by overt great-power politics; furthermore, that it must respond by strengthening its own military, political and economic capacity while keeping its security policy firmly anchored with allies.
Merz said the international order “based on rights and rules” no longer exists “in this form,” arguing that Europe must adjust to a world in which influence, dependencies and coercion are increasingly used as tools of statecraft.

“Our freedom with our neighbors”
Merz framed Russia’s full-scale war against Ukraine as the clearest marker of the shift, describing it as violent revisionism and a direct assault on Europe’s political order. He said Europe’s “first task” is to recognize the new reality and make preparations “for the new time,” stressing that Germany’s foreign and security policy would remain European in its foundations.
“Our freedom we defend with our neighbors,” Merz said, rejecting any notion of Germany acting alone and calling instead for what he described as a “program of freedom.” That program rests on four pillars: i) strengthening Europe’s military, political, economic and technological power; ii) building a more sovereign Europe as a stronger pillar within NATO; iii) renewing transatlantic ties; and iv) expanding partnerships beyond the West.
Trump’s Trading of Ukraine
The German chancellor also argued that democracies face a double risk: too much state power can erode freedom, but too little state capacity can produce the same outcome through vulnerability and paralysis. Germany, he said, must close what he described as a gap between ambitious rhetoric and the practical means to enforce policy.
NATO anchor, European pillar
Merz emphasized that he does not see “great-power politics in Europe” as an option for Germany, but said Europe must become stronger inside NATO. He portrayed the alliance as a “competitive advantage” for both Europe and the US, even as he acknowledged a widening political and cultural distance across the Atlantic.
He also pointed to Germany’s stepped-up defense posture, including the goal of making the “Bundeswehr” (Germany’s armed forces) the strongest conventional military in Europe as quickly as possible. Additionally, he highlighted efforts to deepen European industrial and technological capacity in areas such as air defense, long-range strike capabilities and satellites.
Macron: Europe must stop underselling itself
French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking at the conference in the evening, urged Europe to project confidence rather than accept caricatures of the continent as slow, bureaucratic or weak.
Macron argued that the European project – which he described as “a political construction of sovereign states” – has institutionalized peace and created mutual economic dependence, and that Europe should treat these achievements as strengths rather than liabilities. He also said that Europe should not concede to Russia’s demands, but increase pressure, while continuing to back Ukraine.
High-stakes weekend in Munich
Friday’s opening set the tone for a weekend of high-level diplomacy. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Merz on the sidelines of the conference, ahead of a closely watched speech he is due to deliver on Saturday.
As the first day of the Munich Security Conference came to a close, President Volodymyr Zelensky said Europe must be able to act independently, while remaining a strong and reliable partner of the US – arguing that only a confident, self-reliant Europe can credibly defend its security and support Ukraine.
Zelensky is also expected to accept the Ewald von Kleist Award 2026 – traditionally honoring those who make an outstanding contribution to peace and conflict resolution – at the Bavarian State Chancellery on Saturday. In its citation, the Munich Security Conference said this year’s award honors the “brave Ukrainian people” in deep appreciation of their courage, sacrifice and unwavering resolve to defend their freedom, as well as “the freedom of all of Europe,” and commemorates those who have been killed or injured during Russia’s full-scale invasion. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk is scheduled to deliver the laudatory address, while Zelensky is expected to give brief remarks.

Europe should overcome reliance on US in defense — British PM

LONDON, February 14. /TASS/. European nations must end their dependence on American military support by strengthening cooperation among themselves, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer argues in a speech he is due to make at the Munich Security Conference.
"We are not the Britain of the Brexit years anymore. Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward - we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen," excerpts of his speech provided by his office read.
"There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history - and it is today’s reality too," Starmer is expected to say, calling for "a more European NATO."
The British prime minister believes Europe should replace excessive dependence on its transatlantic partner with greater regional cooperation. "I’m talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well," Starmer’s address reads.
Starmer also describes Europe as a "sleeping giant," arguing that its economy exceeds Russia’s "10 times over."
At the same time, he notes that making such important decisions requires achieving broad public consensus, so that far-right and far-left movements do not gain strength by offering simplistic solutions.

Trump administration sued for attempted overhaul of public golf course in Washington

WASHINGTON - A non-profit organisation and two residents in Washington sued US President Donald Trump’s administration on Feb 13 seeking to stop its attempted overhaul of a more than a century-old public golf course, a court filing showed.
Since taking office in January 2025,
In late 2025, the Trump administration cancelled a lease held by the National Links Trust (NLT) to oversee three public golf courses in Washington, DC, giving a fresh opportunity for Mr Trump to put his stamp on a part of city life.
Mr Trump’s Interior Department said it was terminating the 50-year-lease the group received in 2020 to run the golf courses. The agency accused NLT of failing to make required investments in the properties and to pay rent.
NLT disputed the allegations that it defaulted on its lease or had not paid what was required. It said the Interior Department provided little information about the issue.
The lawsuit filed on Feb 13 in the US District Court for the District of Columbia said the Trump administration’s reconstruction of East Potomac Park that includes the East Potomac Golf Course violated a congressional act from 1897 which said it should be “forever held and used as a park for the recreation and pleasure of the people”.
The US Interior Department was quoted by local media as saying it does not comment on pending litigation but added it would “ensure these courses are safe, beautiful, open, affordable, enjoyable and accessible for people visiting” Washington.
The Interior Department and the National Park Service, which is a part of the department, were named as defendants in the lawsuit. The plaintiffs included non-profit group DC Preservation League and Washington residents Dave Roberts and Alex Dickson.
The lawsuit alleged the Trump administration’s actions violated environmental laws and would pollute a park on the National Register of Historic Places. REUTERS

Eternal City eternally damp as Rome suffers record rainfall

Eternal City eternally damp as Rome suffers record rainfall
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
ROME – It is carnival time in Rome, known as the “Eternal City”, which traditionally means piazzas filled with excitable children in costumes, gorging on fried treats – but record rains are ruining the party.
Persistent bad weather has dogged the whole of Italy since the start of 2026, with storms causing huge damage and disruption.
Rome itself has seen near-daily downpours in February after a record amount of rain in January.
“January 2026 ranked as one of the three wettest Januarys (in Rome) since 1782,” meteorologist Lorenzo Tedici told AFP.
With its lush parks and outdoor social scene, the Eternal City is known for its long summers and temperate winters.
But Italy is a so-called “hot spot” for climate change in Europe, and in recent years, the whole country has been experiencing extreme weather events,
The storms sweeping through in recent weeks have at least “ended the drought in several southern regions – particularly Sicily and Sardinia”, Mr Tedici said.
Yet the “exceptionally rainy period” is now “causing problems due to excess water in central and southern Italy”, he said.
Nearly 58 per cent more rainfall than average fell across Italy in January, he said.
Coastal areas took a pummelling in January, with one town in Sicily, Niscemi, left teetering on the brink of a cliff after a massive landslide triggered by Storm Harry.
‘English climate in Italy’
With the bad weather expected to last until Feb 20, according to Mr Tedici, mayors in storm-hit towns have been cancelling or postponing carnival celebrations.
The festivities are a last hurrah before Lent, a period of abstinence in the Christian calendar leading up to Easter – and can last for days.
But at the Antico Forno Roscioli in Rome, where carnival delicacies including crispy pastries and custard-filled donut balls are piled high, many customers are not in the mood.
“The rains are definitely putting a (damper) on festivities and slowing sales,” manager Paolo Martinucci told AFP.
Mr Davide Faranda, research director at the Climate and Environment Sciences Laboratory in Paris, said Italy was currently being drenched by Storm Nils.
The storm, which has already lashed parts of France, Portugal, and Spain, has brought stronger than usual winds and rain.
Climate change is increasing the intensity of heavy rainfall events across Europe, by warming the atmosphere and allowing it to hold and release more moisture.
The Mediterranean region as a whole is also warming faster than the rest of the globe.
That means “changes in temperature and the hydrological cycle tend to be stronger there than the global average, which can exacerbate heavy rainfall”, Mr Faranda told AFP.
What is more, Italy has specific geographical characteristics “that can amplify impacts”, he said.
“Its location between the Mediterranean Sea and the Alps, combined with complex topography and long coastlines, makes it particularly sensitive to moisture transport, orographic rainfall (caused by air flowing over mountains), and slow-moving storm systems,” he said.
Mr Tedici said the “endless rain” was caused by the polar jet stream – a ring of fast-moving air around the Arctic – being “further south than normal”.
It is “essentially bringing the English climate to Italy”, he said.
And while Storm Nils is passing over, Anbi Water Resources Observatory warned Italy on Feb 13 to batten down the hatches for the incoming “St Valentine’s Cyclone”. AFP

Trump says Iran regime change 'best thing that could happen' as second carrier heads to region
US President Donald Trump said Friday that a change in power in Iran "would be the best thing that could happen" as he confirmed the deployment of a second aircraft carrier group to the Middle East. The US president is hoping to strike a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear programme, but has warned of severe consequences if one does not come through.

US President Donald Trump on Friday embraced potential regime change in Iran and declared that "tremendous power" will soon be in the Middle East, as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
Trump's military moves and tough talk comes even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators. The source said Witkoff and Kushner will also meet officials from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday in Geneva in the US drive to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen". He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said "there are people".
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking," Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. "In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We've been going on for a long time."
Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country's ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in strikes last year.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the "dust". He added: "If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left."
Long deployments
US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the United States' newest and the world's largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.
Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it ... if we need it, we'll have it ready."
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.

The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering "illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere".
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.
The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.

Former Norway PM charged with 'gross corruption' over Epstein ties

Former Prime Minister of Norway, Thorbjorn Jagland, has been charged with "gross corruption" due to his connections with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to a report by the New York Times (NYT).
Last week, economic crime investigators launched an inquiry into the relationships between Epstein and several individuals, including Jagland.
The charges against Jagland were filed a day after the Council of Europe decided to waive his diplomatic immunity, which had been granted due to his previous leadership role in the organization.
The NYT also reported that Norwegian police have searched several of Jagland's properties, and his lawyer publicly stated that Jagland is cooperating with the authorities.
Files released by the US Justice Department reportedly indicate substantial communications between Jagland and Epstein, including messages discussing meetings and stays at Epstein's properties.
Investigators are reportedly examining whether Jagland received any gifts, travel benefits, or loans from Epstein that were linked to his official positions, according to the NYT.
Russian ties?
The inquiry has also raised concerns about potential Russian connections involving individuals mentioned in the Epstein files.
According to the NYT, in a 2018 correspondence, Epstein reportedly wrote to Jagland, who was then the head of the Council of Europe, regarding President Vladimir Putin of Russia and his foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov.
In the exchange, Epstein suggested that Jagland might recommend that Lavrov speak with him for insights.
Although there is currently no evidence that Epstein confirmed any meeting with Lavrov, these communications have raised significant concerns.
Other senior figures in Norway named in the NYT report who are also under scrutiny following the release of the Epstein files include Crown Princess Mette-Marit and former Foreign Minister Borge Brende.

Indonesia’s Mount Semeru erupts sending hot clouds nearly 4 miles
Authorities warn residents to avoid riverbank near volcano
ISTANBUL
Indonesia’s Mount Semeru volcano in East Java erupted early Saturday, sending scorching clouds and ash 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) from its crater, according to state-run media.
The eruption occurred at 5.54 am (2254GMT Friday), with hot clouds traveling southeast toward the Besuk Kobokan river area, Antara News reported, citing a Semeru Observation Post official.
Ash drifted toward the north and northeast, forming a thick gray column rising 2,000 meters (6.561 feet) above the summit.
A second eruption followed at 7.25 am, producing an ash plume 1,500 meters above the peak. Seismic monitoring recorded significant volcanic tremors during both events.
Located along the border of Lumajang and Malang regencies in East Java province, Semeru remains at Level III Alert status, Indonesia’s second-highest warning level.
The Center for Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation has urged residents and visitors to avoid activities within 13 kilometers (8 miles) of the crater in the southeast sector, particularly along the Besuk Kobokan river.
Authorities also warned against approaching riverbanks within 500 meters, citing the risk of lava flows and expanding hot clouds that could reach 17 kilometers from the summit.
Indonesia sits on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a zone of frequent seismic activity, and has more than 120 active volcanoes.
No immediate reports of major damage followed the eruptions.

Fire at oil refinery contained amid worsening fuel shortage in Cuba
No injuries, disruption reported, says Energy Ministry
ISTANBUL
A blaze at an oil refinery in Cuba was swiftly contained as the island grapples with a worsening fuel shortage, the Energy Ministry said Friday.
Black smoke was seen billowing from the Nico Lopez Refinery in Havana.
“The workday at the Nico Lopez Refinery continues with complete normalcy,” the ministry wrote on US social media company X.
It added that the fire was quickly brought under control, did not spread and was confined only to a warehouse containing disused products.
There were no injuries, and an investigation continues to determine the cause, it added.
Cuba’s fuel crisis has worsened after the US cut off oil supplies from longtime ally Venezuela, which had been shipping tens of thousands of barrels daily to the island.
The disruption followed a US operation that captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the seizure of oil tankers, effectively halting key fuel deliveries.

Bangladesh's Tarique Rahman poised to become PM as Islamists concede defeat
Bangladesh's largest Islamist party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister after 17 years in self-imposed exile.

Bangladesh's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami said Saturday it had accepted the "overall outcome" of the election won by the rival nationalist party, despite earlier having alleged problems with the vote count.
The move clears the way for Tarique Rahman, the once exiled leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), to become prime minister.
Election Commission figures showed Rahman's BNP had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina.
The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in Britain, far from Dhaka's political storms.
Read moreBangladesh Nationalist Party wins thumping victory in landmark post-Hasina election
Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh's most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.
His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman "would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development".
The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.
'Verdict of the people'
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would "seek redress" from the commission, with his party alleging "inconsistencies and fabrications".
But a day later, he conceded defeat.
"In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people," the Jamaat leader said in a statement.
"We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law."
Hasina's Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an "illegal and unconstitutional election".
The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a "historic victory", while neighbouring India praised Rahman's "decisive win", a notable shift after deeply strained ties.
China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.
International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been "credible".
The International Republican Institute noted that while "election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile".
'Successful'
Jamaat's Rahman said his party "will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account".
Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success.
"It was by far the best election," he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.
"People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it," he said Saturday. "If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court."
The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.
Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.
Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his Islamist party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.
"With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics," he said. "That is not a setback. That is a foundation."
Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced "daunting challenges", including "boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process".

Nigerian rock artist wants people to pause and feel loved in the hustle and bustle of Lagos
In Nigeria's capital, a rock musician is taking to the streets with roses and a guitar to remind people to slow down and feel the love ahead of Valentine's Day
- Bookmark
Valentine's Day can be a secondary consideration for some in Lagos.
The Nigerian city of more than 20 million people is renowned for its hustle and bustle, its restless energy and commercial drive — a place where honks from signature yellow passenger buses fill the air.
But Lagos-based rock musician Bianca Okorocha, known as “Clayrocksu," wants people to pause and feel loved as Valentine's Day approaches.
She is taking her music offstage and onto the streets of the city, crooning love songs to random commuters and handing them single-stem roses.
Their faces, first shocked at the encounter, give way to a broad smile as she pulls the strings of her guitar, twanging to James Blunt’s “You are Beautiful.”
“I am a musician, and we just thought it was a special and nice thing to do for people,” Clayrocksu told The Associated Press. “Especially in this time and climate where everything is kind of difficult and all you hear on the news is bad news.”
Since Nigerian President Bola Tinubu came to power in 2023, he has undertaken major economic reforms, including the removal of a decades-old fuel subsidy program. The government said the changes would save costs and boost investment, but they have resulted in one of the West African nation’s worst cost of living crises in a generation.
The country’s deadly security crisis has also worsened the fate of millions, limiting access to farmland in the conflict-battered north, which in turn resulted in a surge in the prices of goods elsewhere, including in the economic hub of Lagos.
But amid the tough times, people like Clayrocksu are bringing joy and color to many across the vibrant city in this season of love.
Barbara Lulu, a Lagos resident, who got serenaded by Clayrocksu and her partner, was going about her day stressed until the rock team showed up.
“First off, this was a very shocking moment for me, because I never expected it. It just kind of happened, and all I can say is yay!” she said.
In a city where Valentine’s Day is usually focused on lovers, Clayrocksu said that she wants to change that perception and bring roses to many others.
“People think that Valentine’s Day is only about romantic gestures, only boyfriend and girlfriend, husband and wife,” she said. “But Valentine is really just about sharing love.”

A street in Ecuador’s largest city has been named after Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, founder of the Republic of Türkiye, following an initiative by the Turkish Embassy in Quito.
The inauguration ceremony in Guayaquil highlighted the bonds of friendship and cooperation between the two countries as officials formally opened the street bearing Atatürk’s name.
The event was attended by senior municipal officials, consular staff, members of the Ecuador–Türkiye Business Council, representatives of the energy company Karpowership, which operates three vessels in Ecuador and members of the Turkish community.
Türkiye’s Ambassador to Quito, Makbule Başak Yalçın, underlined the symbolic value of the Guayaquil Municipality’s decision, noting that it not only reflects the friendship between the two peoples but also honors the memory of Atatürk, an exceptional leader respected worldwide.
Yalçın thanked Türkiye’s Honorary Consul General in Guayaquil, Alvaro Dassum, for his efforts in completing the process, which lasted more than two years and expressed her appreciation to Karpowership for its financial support.
She added that Atatürk Street in Guayaquil reinforces the Turkish presence in the city, alongside symbolic locations in the capital such as Türkiye and Ankara streets and a Türkiye park, further strengthening ties between the two countries.
Drawing a comparison between Guayaquil, Ecuador’s commercial and cultural hub, and Istanbul, Yalçın said the newly inaugurated street would serve as a new bridge of friendship between the two nations united by shared values.

AI challenges authenticity of works by Flemish master Jan van Eyck
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

15:29:00 KST

An Artificial Intelligence analysis of two paintings by the world-famous Flemish artist Jan van Eyck has raised an important question. Are the paintings really his work? Experts say they may be studio works that originated in Van Eyck's studio but were not painted by him. 'That could mean that there is a lost original somewhere that should be seen as more Van Eyck's work than these examples. The two paintings in question were once owned by the Bruges nobleman Anselm Adornes.
“Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” is the title of two almost identical, unsigned paintings attributed to Jan van Eyck, one of the greatest painters the Low Countries has ever produced. Worldwide, he is renowned for his keen eye for detail, his use of light and his oil painting technique. Only about 20 works from his oeuvre have survived.
Stigmata refers to the spontaneous appearance of bodily wounds, scars, or pain in locations corresponding to the crucifixion wounds of Jesus Christ. Primarily associated with Roman Catholicism, these marks are considered a mystical phenomenon, representing a physical union with the suffering of Christ.
One version of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” hangs in the Musei Reali in Turin, Italy, the other in the Philadelphia Museum of Art in the United States. Art lovers flock to admire them as happened when the works were on display at the major Van Eyck exhibition at the MSK Fine Arts Museum in Ghent in 2020.
But what if neither of these works is really a Van Eyck? That is a question that has arisen following a scientific analysis using artificial intelligence (AI) conducted by the Swiss company Art Recognition.
Art Recognition uses AI to verify the authenticity of paintings and drawings. The company works for auction houses, collectors, galleries and art dealers, and also carries out research projects, for seats of learning like Tilburg University in the Netherlands.
Art Recognition compares digital photographs of a work with a huge database of known, authentic works by the artist. In the case of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata”, Art Recognition says that the version in Philadelphia was “91 per cent negative” and the version in Turin was “86 per cent negative”.
This would suggest that there is little certainty that Van Eyck actually painted these works himself.
So are they studio paintings?
A few weeks ago the analysis of Van Eyck's work was discussed on the podcast “Is it? The Art Mystery Podcast” with American art historian Noah Charney. He is also an author and is regularly asked to act as an expert in cases of suspected art forgery or crime.
In each episode, he asks whether a specific painting was really created by the famous master. Charney was surprised when he saw the analysis of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata”. “The negative result for both works was so astonishing that in-depth tests were carried out to confirm the results,” he says.
Charney spoke with Till-Holger Borchert, former director of Bruges Museums Musea Brugge and one of the foremost Van Eyck experts. According to Borchert, the analysis supports earlier suggestions by experts that both versions of “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” are studio paintings. This means that they were made in the artist's studio, but not necessarily by the artist himself.
Borchert also felt the high negative score was pretty surprising but says that the AI analysis of the artworks mainly raises questions that need to be investigated further.
Is there a lost original out there somewhere?
Charney himself thought that the painting in Turin would be confirmed as an original, and the version in Philadelphia as a copy, originating from Van Eyck's studio or from a later period. ‘The negative results suggest that the two versions are studio works,’ says Charney.
‘If a work comes from Van Eyck's studio, that does not necessarily mean that he actually painted all aspects of it himself,’ he explains. ‘That's a misconception that people have retained from the 19th-century image of the lonely artist in an attic room in Paris drinking absinthe, smoking cigarettes, wearing a beret and doing every aspect of the work himself.’
‘All this could mean that there is a lost original somewhere that is much more Van Eyck's work than these copies.’
Once belonged to Bruges aristocrat Anselm Adornes
Both Francis paintings also have an additional link with Flanders. In 1470 the Bruges nobleman and businessman Anselm Adornes mentions the works in his will. He was about to embark on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, feared for his life, and bequeathed a painting of Saint Francis by Van Eyck to each of his two daughters. His daughters Margriet and Louise were both nuns; it is not clear whether they ever received the paintings. Anselm Adornes returned safely from his pilgrimage, as evidenced by the Jerusalem Chapel and the Adornes estate in Bruges.
Rubens's “Samson and Delilah” and fake masterpieces on eBay
Art Recognition has built up quite a reputation since it was established in 2018. In 2021, with the help of AI, the company concluded that Peter Paul Rubens's masterpiece “Samson and Delilah” was 91 per cent likely not to have been painted by the Flemish baroque master. There had long been doubts about the work, which is on display at the National Gallery in London.
In 2024, Art Recognition was able to identify dozens of suspected fakes that were being touted as authentic on the auction site eBay. These included works by Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The Monet was offered for $600,000, the Renoir for $165,000, but were 95 per cent likely to be fake.
This was a boost for Carina Popovici, co-founder and director of Art Recognition, who wants to use AI analyses to detect forgeries in the art world with greater accuracy and protect buyers. At the same time, AI should help museums, collectors and auction houses to make the verification process of artworks more objective, accurate and faster.
The high negative results for “Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata” also surprised her. She had thought that if one painting was negative, the other would be positive. ‘But no, they were both negative,’ she told UK daily The Guardian.
‘I don't think the museums in Philadelphia and Turin will be happy with this. It's not good news for them.’
The Guardian contacted both museums for comment but has not yet received a response.
Art Recognition previously conducted an analysis of “The Portrait of Giovanni Arnolfini and his Wife”, another famous work by Jan van Eyck. That analysis yielded an 89 per cent probability that it was authentic.

'Virgin' frescoes emerge from Pompeii suburb

Tourists visit the 1st century BC luxurious residence of Poppaea Sabina (Poppea), second wife of the Emperor Nero, in Pompeii on Febuary 12, 2026.
Amid the remains of a sumptuous villa near Pompeii, the hard-hatted conservationist scraped away centuries-old ash to reveal a vibrant red fresco.
For the first time on Feb. 12, visitors were allowed in to see the renovations underway at Villa Poppaea, a pleasure palace of Ancient Rome destroyed by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
"It's important, now that we're almost finished, to start reopening the villa and allowing everyone to visit it," said Arianna Spinosa, the director of the archaeological site near Naples, southern Italy.
The villa was the home of the Emperor Nero's second wife, Poppaea Sabina, whom some believe he later killed, and was being renovated at the time of the volcanic eruption.
The latest discoveries were found in its oldest section, which date back to the middle of the first century B.C.
"Each excavation is a surprise," Spinosa told AFP during a visit to the ruins, which on a wet February morning resembled a building site.
"We certainly expected to find some of the frescoes that could be seen on the other wall, but the surprises were, of course, far more numerous.
"First of all, because of the colors that appeared, so vivid in their authenticity."
Among the discoveries were the legs of a graceful bird set against the backdrop of a yellow frieze emerging out of the mud, a peacock missing only its head.
It was found in the villa's most impressive room, the main salon, which has a mirrored wall.
The peacock, a sacred animal associated with the goddess Juno, is "one of the decorative motifs that recurs very frequently in the decoration of the villa", noted Giuseppe Scarpati, the site's chief archaeologist.
'Virgin surfaces'
Depicting birds, fish and fruit, the newly-discovered frescoes are breathtaking in their intricacy, but it is their colours that really stand out.
"This vibrant red panel bears original, untreated pigments," Spinosa explained.
Such "virgin surfaces" are hugely valuable to those studying the villa and its former occupants, she said.
The villa is part of Oplontis, an archaeological site of Roman-era buildings between Pompeii and Herculaneum, in the modern town of Torre Annunziata.
The Villa Poppaea, a grand residential complex also known as Villa A, was discovered by chance during the construction of a canal at the end of the 16th century.
Excavations began in the 18th century.
In 1974, archaeologists found the remains of a second building, so-called Villa B, during the construction of a school sports hall.
Unlike the first building, Villa B, which was used for the processing of wine and oil, is closed to the public.
Elena Gravina, the chief conservator of the Villa Poppaea, said it was a site of "exceptional quality, both in design and quality".
Archaeologists had identified bright red cinnabar and Egyptian blue pigments, which "were very expensive and difficult to obtain at the time", she told the first visitors Thursday.
"They testify to the commercial connections and the wealth of the patrons, as well as the skill and expertise of the artisans."
From now on, groups of up to ten people will be able to visit the site each Thursday morning, obtaining a glimpse of the frescoes but also the experts at work, in the dirt and under scaffolding.
Only 50 to 60 percent of the overall area of the villa has been excavated so far, so there is still work to be done.
"We don't know its boundaries to the north, east, or west. Potentially, the villa could still hold many surprises for us," Scarpati told AFP.

Russia is suffering "crazy losses" in Ukraine, tallying around 65,000 soldiers over the last two months, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference. He also said NATO's alliance was, for now, strong enough to deter Russia from attacking it.
This liveblog is no longer being updated.
Zelensky says Russia's change of negotiator meant to postpone any decisions
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Saturday he was surprised that Russia had decided to change the leadership of its negotiating team for peace talks in Geneva next week, a move he said was designed to postpone any decisions.
Speaking to journalists on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, Zelenskiy said foreign troops would be needed in Ukraine after a peace deal was reached to deter any future aggression by Russia.
He said the US had proposed a security guarantee lasting for 15 years after the war, but Ukraine wanted a deal for 20 years or longer.
German defence minister calls for predictable and reliable US partnership
German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius called for a predictable and reliable partnership between the United States and its European partners, which he said had to build up their hard defence capacity.
Responding to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's remarks earlier on Saturday, which criticised many aspects of what the international system had become, Pistorius agreed that institutions needed reform but said the answer could not be for a state to try to go it alone.

EU food chief sounds warning on food weaponisation
Europe must be alert to the threat of food supply chains being weaponised, the EU's agriculture chief warned Saturday, saying dependency on external food production would leave the European Union vulnerable.
"You cannot build a continent on an empty stomach and you cannot win a war on an empty stomach," Christophe Hansen said at the Munich Security Conference.
"Russia considers grains as its second oil. And it's not me saying that: they say it themselves, and they are using it massively, and I think we need therefore to work on our dependencies, because dependencies are vulnerabilities."
Iran protest rally in Munich grows to 200,000 people
The crowd of demonstrators in Munich denouncing the Iranian government grew to an estimated 200,000 people Saturday, police told AFP, as world leaders gathered nearby at the Munich Security Conference.
The protesters rallied in Munich's Theresienwiese area, condemning the leadership of Iran's Islamic Republic following the deadly repression of nationwide protests in January.
Russians suffering 'crazy losses' in Ukraine, says Rutte
Russia is suffering "crazy losses" in Ukraine, tallying around 65,000 soldiers over the last two months, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Saturday at the Munich Security Conference.
Separately, he told a media roundtable that the NATO alliance was strong enough that Russia would not currently try to attack it.
"We will win every fight with Russia if they attack us now, and we have to make sure in two, four, six years that same is still the case," he said.
No one in Europe wants to replace the United States' nuclear umbrella, says NATO chief
NATO chief Mark Rutte said Saturday no one in Europe was pushing to replace the United States' nuclear umbrella, after Germany said it was talking to France about its nuclear deterrence.
"I think every discussion in Europe making sure that collectively the nuclear deterrence is even stronger, fine, but nobody is arguing in Europe to do this as a sort of replacement of the nuclear umbrella of the United States," the NATO secretary general told journalists at the Munich Security Conference.
Trump has 'woken up' NATO, made it stronger, Rutte tells FRANCE 24
In an exclusive interview with FRANCE 24, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte argues that the alliance is stronger today, thanks to US President Donald Trump’s push for higher defence spending.
He highlights Europe’s growing leadership within NATO, while reaffirming the importance of the US anchor.
Rutte also stresses the urgent need for more support for Ukraine, acknowledging that current aid levels are insufficient.
UK to deploy aircraft carrier group to Arctic this year
The UK will deploy its aircraft carrier group to the North Atlantic this year in a "powerful show of force" against Russian threats in the Arctic, Britain's Starmer told the Munich conference earlier today.
"I can announce today that the UK will deploy our carrier strike group to the North Atlantic and the High North this year, led by HMS Prince of Wales, operating alongside the US, Canada and other NATO allies in a powerful show of our commitment to Euro-Atlantic security," he said.

The group will include Royal Navy warships, F-35 jets and helicopters in what has been dubbed "Operation Firecrest," the ministry of defence said in a statement.
The HMS Prince of Wales is the Royal Navy's largest warship and US aircraft are also expected to operate from its deck.
Zelensky says US too often asks Ukraine, not Russia, for concessions
Zelensky decries that arms are developing faster than political efforts to end the Russian invasion.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," Zelensky tells the Munich Security Conference.
In a jab at US-led talks, he says "the Americans often return to the topic of concessions, too often discussed in the context of Ukraine, not Russia".
He also says that Europe is "practically not" present at the table, describing this as "a big mistake".
Zelenksy: Russia losing 156 soldiers per kilometre of Ukraine
The Russian army is losing 156 soldiers for every square kilometre of Ukrainian soil it captures, the Ukrainian leader says.
"Putin is not concerned about this now, but there is a level at which he will start to care," Zelenksy adds, describing the Russian leader as a "slave to war".
Ukraine will produce enough interceptors to make Shahed drones 'meaningless', says Zelensky
Zelensky says Ukraine in January alone, Ukraine has had "to defend against 6000 attack drones, most of them Shahid drones".
He says his country will produce enough interceptor drones to make Shaheds "meaningless".
Pointing to the drones' Iranian manufacture, Zelensky says the regime in Tehran "must be stopped".
"The Iranian regime has already done and can still do more harm than many other regimes could do in the century. (…) When they have time, they only kill more. They must be stopped immediately," he says.
Not a single power plant in Ukraine left undamaged, says Zelensky
The Ukrainian leader is now speaking in Munich, and he begins by denouncing the relentless Russian attacks on the country's energy infrastructure that have left Ukrainian civilians to face the bitter winter cold without heating.
"Not a single power plant in Ukraine has been left undamaged by Russian attacks," Zelensky says.
Rubio reaffirms US-Europe ties, under Trump's terms
FRANCE 24's correspondent Nick Holdsworth brings us the latest from Munich.
UK could explore closer ties with EU single market in some sectors
The UK must explore areas where it could move closer to the European Union's single market, Starmer adds in his Munich address.
"We want to work together to lead a generational shift in defence industrial cooperation," the UK leader says. "Now this includes looking again at closer economic alignment," he adds, six years after Britain left the European trading bloc.
"Deeper economic integration is in all of our interests so we must look at where we could move closer to the single market in other sectors as well, where that would work for both sides."
Starmer says Europe must build 'hard power', the 'currency of the age'
Speaking after Von der Leyen, Britain's Keir Starmer stresses the need for Europe to build "hard power" and be ready to fight if necessary.
"We are not at a crossroads today, the road ahead is straight, and it is clear we must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," he says.
"We must be able to deter aggression, and yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight, to do whatever it takes to protect our people, our values and our way of life and, as Europe, we must stand on our own two feet."
Von der Leyen: Europe's future and Britain 'as bound as ever'
Europe and Britain needed to to cooperate more closely on "security, on economy.. on defending our democracies", the EU Commission chief goes on to say.
"Europe and in particular the UK should come closer together .. 10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever," she adds.
EU must 'bring to life' mutual defence pact, says Von der Leyen
The head of the European Commission is next on the podium in Munich.
She says the time has come to bring a mutual defence clause anchored in the EU's founding treaty "to life".
"Mutual defence is not an optional task for the European Union. It is an obligation within our own treaty," von der Leyen tells the security conference.
"It is our collective commitment to stand by each other in case of aggression, or in simple terms: one for all and all for one. And this is Europe's meaning."

Crowds flock to Istanbul's Museum of Innocence before TV adaptation

Visitors look at the display cases in The Museum of Innocence in Istanbul.
On a cobbled street in Çukurcuma, a district known for its antiques shops on Istanbul's European side, the story penned by Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk in his bestselling novel "The Museum of Innocence" has been brought to life.
Inside a red-painted house, visitors are confronted by a wall of 4,213 cigarette butts, many of them lipstick-stained, others angrily stubbed out, all obsessively kept by the book's protagonist, Kemal Basmacı.
The museum, opened by Pamuk in 2012, mirrors the novel’s 83 chapters with 83 display cases filled with jewelry, photographs, cinema tickets and bottles of Meltem soda, evoking 1970s Istanbul and a love story spiraling into fixation.
Interest has surged ahead of the nine-part Netflix adaptation, released on Feb. 13. Since trailers began airing, daily visitors have risen from around 200 to 500, according to museum staff.
The series, produced by Istanbul-based Ay Yapım, stars Selahattin Paşalı as Kemal and Eylül Kandemir as Füsun, and was directed by Zeynep Günay.
Set in the 1970s, it follows a wealthy young man devastated by the loss of his distant cousin and lover, prompting him to collect objects tied to her memory over eight years.
Pamuk details fight for creative control
In an interview with the New York Times, published before the premiere, Pamuk described a years-long struggle to bring the novel to screen on his own terms.
He said he had previously signed with an unnamed Hollywood company but was “horrified” by a script that strayed far from the 500-page narrative, adding a new plotline he felt distorted the story. After a legal battle, he regained the rights in 2022.
Pamuk partnered with Ay Yapım, remaining closely involved in a four-year script process he described as exacting.
He declined advance payments and refused to sign contracts until the screenplay was complete, insisting the museum be credited alongside the book and that no second season be produced, regardless of success.
The digital premiere marks a late career first for Türkiye’s most internationally recognized novelist.
With the book translated into more than 60 languages, the adaptation is expected to expand its global reach further — and offers another showcase for Türkiye’s booming television industry, now the world’s third-largest exporter of TV series after the United States and the United Kingdom.

Turkish interest in Greek residency soars via Golden Visa scheme

Turkish nationals securing Greek residence permits through the Golden Visa program have seen a dramatic surge recently, with a particularly sharp increase last year, Greek media has reported.
Data cited by the Greek daily Kathimerini show that applications from Turkish citizens jumped by 160 percent last year compared with the previous year, reaching 3,291 successful applicants.
This placed Turks second only to Chinese nationals among Golden Visa beneficiaries.
The report notes that this surge is primarily driven by wealthy Turkish investors seeking to protect their savings from high inflation at home.
Beyond wealth preservation, Greek real estate is increasingly viewed as a dual-benefit asset, offering both robust rental yields and long-term capital appreciation.
According to Greek media, financial returns are not the sole motivation.
For many Turkish applicants, the ability to travel freely within Schengen, along with political concerns and family security considerations, plays a significant role.
Greece introduced its Golden Visa scheme in July 2013, granting renewable residency permits to non-EU nationals who make a qualifying investment — most commonly through real estate.
In addition to legal residence in Greece, holders gain visa-free travel within the Schengen Area, making the program especially attractive to international investors.
Last year, the majority of approved Golden Visa holders in Greece came from Türkiye, Israel, China, Iran and the United States.

Merz calls to repair Europe’s rift with US, saying old world order ‘no longer exists’
Speaking at Munich Security Conference, German leader says he has begun talks with France on a European nuclear deterrent; Macron: ‘Europe has to become a geopolitical power’
MUNICH — German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called on Friday for the United States and Europe to “repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together,” saying that even the US isn’t powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order has withered.
Merz called for a “new trans-Atlantic partnership,” acknowledging that “a divide, a deep rift” has opened up across the Atlantic as he opened the Munich Security Conference, an annual gathering of top global security figures, including many European leaders and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Merz said that the post-World War II world order, “as imperfect as it was at its best times, no longer exists” today.
Hours later, French President Emmanuel Macron said that “Europe has to become a geopolitical power.” He said that “it’s ongoing, but we have to accelerate” in areas such as defense, technology and “de-risking vis-a-vis all the big powers in order to be much more independent.”
At last year’s conference, a few weeks into US President Donald Trump’s second term, US Vice President JD Vance stunned European leaders by lecturing them about the state of democracy and freedom of speech on the continent — a moment that set the tone for the last year.
A series of statements and moves from the Trump administration targeting allies followed, including Trump’s threat last month to impose new tariffs on several European countries in a bid to secure US control of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. The president later dropped that threat.
Stronger together
“The culture war of the MAGA movement in the US is not ours,” Merz said. “The freedom of the word ends here when this word is turned against human dignity and the constitution. And we don’t believe in tariffs and protectionism, but in free trade.”
He said that Europe would stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization.
But Merz said that Europe and the US should conclude that “we are stronger together” in today’s world.
“In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone,” he said. “Dear friends, being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage, so let’s repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together.”
The Europeans, Merz said, are doing their part.
A European nuclear deterrent
Merz said that Berlin had begun talks with France about a European nuclear deterrent, while Macron said Europe had to become a geopolitical power given the Russian threat would not disappear.
“I have begun confidential talks with the French President on European nuclear deterrence,” Merz said. “We Germans are adhering to our legal obligations. We see this as strictly embedded within our nuclear sharing in NATO. And we will not allow zones of differing security to emerge in Europe.”
Macron is due to make a speech on the nuclear deterrent later this month.
He said the consultations with Germany and other leaders were part of a broader discussion that included conventional deep strikes capabilities, which Europe does not possess unlike Russia, and the role of France’s nuclear deterrent.
“This is the right time for audacity. This is the right time for a strong Europe,” Macron said. “Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power. It was not part of our DNA.”
“We have to reshuffle and reorganize our architecture of security in Europe. Because the past architecture of security was totally designed and framed during Cold War times. So it’s no longer adapted,” he said.
European nations have long relied heavily on the United States, including its large nuclear arsenal, for their defense but have been increasing military spending, partly in response to sharp criticism from the Trump administration.
While Germany is currently banned from developing a nuclear weapon under international agreements, France is the European Union’s only nuclear power following Britain’s departure from the bloc and has the world’s fourth-largest stockpile.
“This is the right time for a strong Europe,” he said. “This Europe will be a good ally and partner for the United States of America, because it will be a partner taking its fair share of the burden. It will be a partner being respected — and we have to be respected.”
‘Shift in mindset’ in Europe
Since last year’s Munich conference, NATO allies have agreed under pressure from Trump to a large increase in their defense spending target.
NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said that there has been a “shift in mindset,” with “Europe really stepping up, Europe taking more of a leadership role within NATO, Europe also taking more care of its own defense.”
With Rubio heading the US delegation this year, European leaders can hope for a less contentious approach more focused on traditional global security concerns. Before departing for Germany, Rubio had some reassuring words as he described Europe as important for Americans.
“We’re very tightly linked together with Europe,” he told reporters. “Most people in this country can trace both, either their cultural or their personal heritage, back to Europe. So, we just have to talk about that.”
But Rubio made clear that it wouldn’t be business as usual, saying: “We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to reexamine what that looks like.”
Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the United Nations, told the conference that the US had been sustaining the financial burden of multilateralism for too long and Europeans need to do more.
“There is a cost to the status quo and the status quo was not sustainable any more,” Waltz said.
Merz said that Europe’s “excessive dependency” on the US was its own fault, but it’s leaving that behind.
“We won’t do this by writing off NATO — we will do it by building a strong, self-supporting European pillar in the alliance, in our own interest,” he said.
He acknowledged that Europe and the US will likely have to bridge more disagreements in the future than in the past, but “if we do this with new strength, respect and self-respect, that is to the advantage of both sides.”

Rubio at Munich security meet to address Europeans rattled by Trump

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio speaks during the 62nd Munich Security Conference (MSC) on Feb. 14, Munich.
U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to recharge the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the U.S. on its mission of global "renewal".
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in U.S.-European relations sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about U.S. allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said, calling for "a reinvigorated alliance."
"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the U.S. "belong together."
He echoed Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration posed a threat, saying that "mass migration" was "a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West."
He said that Europe and the U.S. were "heirs to the same great and noble civilisation" and that he hoped Europe "together with us are willing and able to defend it." Change in tone
Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a "rift" between U.S. and Europe.
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of U.S. Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on a range of issues including free speech, shocking European allies.
The Trump administration has also charged that Europe faced a "civilisational decline" and has courted far-right parties on the continent.
Ties plunged last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.
Some breathed a sigh of relief following Rubio's speech, with Estonia's defense Minister Hanno Pevkur telling AFP "it was needed to show that we are still allies and partners."
But others said they did not mark a shift in the U.S. stance, with former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis saying "it was simply delivered in more polite terms. I am not sure the white paint will hold."
Europe security
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defenses, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering on Saturday that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security, including closer ties with Britain 10 years after Brexit.
British leader Keir Starmer echoed the sentiment, saying "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age," calling for a building of "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defense production".
Ukraine war
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defense and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky decried that political efforts to end the war have not worked.
"Weapons evolve faster than political decisions meant to stop them," he said, calling for speedier arms deliveries for Ukraine's Western-supplied air defense systems.
He said that "there is not a single power plant in Ukraine that is not damaged by Russian strikes" after Russia stepped up its attacks on infrastructure over the past few months, as the coldest snap since the war started in February 2022 hit the country.
"No one in Ukraine believes (Russian President Vladimir Putin) will ever let our people go, but he will not let other European nations go either, because he cannot let go of the very idea of war," Zelensky warned.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged Kiev to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the U.S. leader said.
But Rubio said on Saturday that "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."
Rubio renewed the Trump administration's criticism of the United Nations, saying that "it has no answers and has played virtually no role" on the most pressing conflicts like the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.

Trump says change of power in Iran would be 'best thing'

U.S. President Donald Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen," as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Trump's comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran's clerical establishment, and came as he pushes on Washington's arch-foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear program.
At the same time, the exiled son of the Iranian shah toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution renewed his calls for international intervention following a bloody crackdown on protests by Tehran.
"Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina when a journalist asked if he wanted "regime change" in Iran.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."
He has previously backed off full-throated calls for a change of government in Iran, warning that it could cause chaos, although he has made threats towards Khamenei in the past.
Speaking earlier at the White House, Trump said that the USS Gerald R. Ford — the world's largest warship — would be "leaving very soon" for the Middle East to up the pressure on Iran.
"In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it," Trump said.
The giant vessel is currently in the Caribbean following the U.S. overthrow of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro. Another carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, is one of 12 U.S. ships already in the Middle East.
'Terribly difficult'
When Iran began its crackdown on protests last month — which rights groups say killed thousands — Trump initially said that the United States was "locked and loaded" to help demonstrators.
But he has recently focused his military threats on Tehran's nuclear program, which U.S. forces struck last July during Israel's unprecedented 12-day war with Iran.
The protests have subsided for now but U.S.-based Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah, urged international intervention to support the Iranian people.
"We are asking for a humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process," he told the Munich Security Conference.
It followed a call by the opposition leader, who has not returned to his country since before the revolution, for Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations this weekend.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
Iran and the United States, who have had no diplomatic relations since shortly after the revolution, held talks on the nuclear issue last week in Oman. No dates have been set for new talks yet.
The West fears the program is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.
The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said Friday that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities was possible but "terribly difficult."
Reformists released
Trump said after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week that he wanted to continue talks with Iran, defying pressure from his key ally for a tougher stance.
The Israeli prime minister himself expressed skepticism at the quality of any agreement if it didn't also cover Iran's ballistic missiles and support for regional proxies.
According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 7,008 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the recent crackdown, although rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.
More than 53,000 people have also been arrested, it added.
The Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) NGO said "hundreds" of people were facing charges linked to the protests that could see them sentenced to death.
Figures working within the Iranian system have also been arrested, with three politicians detained this week from the so-called reformist wing of Iranian politics supportive of President Masoud Pezeshkian.
The three — Azar Mansouri, Javad Emam and Ebrahim Asgharzadeh — were released on bail Thursday and Friday, their lawyer Hojjat Kermani told the ISNA news agency.

What it means to live without security as an Arab citizen in Israel - opinion
Unknown
Unknown Publisher

06:13:52 UTC
15:13:52 KST

I was on my way to pick up my daughters from school when it happened.
In the middle of the main street, in broad daylight, a young man on a motorcycle pulled out a gun and fired into the air. I froze. Around me were parents just like me, walking to collect their children. People were shocked and frightened, but not surprised.
This is Nazareth, the northern Israeli city where I live. Guns are everywhere. Crime and violence are all-pervasive. I am not being dramatic: People from Palestinian communities inside Israel go to the hospital for gunshot wounds at a rate that is six times higher than their Jewish neighbors. In just the first six weeks of 2026, 42 people have been murdered; that’s nearly one a day.
This is not because Arab communities are more “violent” by nature or because we are poor. It is a symptom of a political reality in which Palestinian citizens of Israel, more than 20% of the country’s population, have been abandoned by their government, left to the mercy of illegal weapons, extortion, drugs, and organized crime. Personal security ought not be a radical demand. It is the most basic condition of citizenship.
The crisis stems from long years of Arab citizens being denied opportunities offered to their Israeli fellow citizens. Arab men face far higher unemployment so that our youth, especially young men, are often left without prospects. There is no social safety net to catch them. And so their hopelessness, at ever making money, getting married, building a life for themselves, leaves them vulnerable to criminal recruitment.
For our community, there is, at long last, some momentum around breaking our own internal silences, strengthening our sense of agency, and building our own power and resilience in the face of our sense of abandonment and despair.
Palestinian citizens left to fend for themselves
For Americans, Israel is usually discussed through the lens of Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the war in Gaza, and indeed, these are the great nightmares of our time. Far less visible is what happens inside Israel’s own borders, where Palestinian citizens are being left to fend for themselves with no functioning police force against criminal networks armed with military-grade weapons.
In other words, on top of policies enabling settler violence and annexation of new West Bank territories, and on top of continuing to bomb Gaza intermittently despite the ceasefire, there appears to be a deliberate policy to weaken, exhaust, and kill the Palestinian community inside of Israel itself.
Yes, we are at the mercy of a racist minister of national security, Itamar Ben Gvir, the Israeli lawmaker convicted on counts of incitement to (Jewish) racism and support for a (Jewish) terrorist group, who has told the police force to deprioritize our community’s safety. But it goes so much deeper than that.
Jewish and Palestinian citizens standing together
In the face of all of this, less than two weeks ago, tens of thousands of Jews and Arabs filled the streets of Tel Aviv in a protest that should not have been necessary. Not because it wasn’t justified, but because in a functioning state, citizens should not have to demonstrate to demand protection for their lives.
When Jewish and Palestinian citizens stood together to remind the government, loudly and peacefully, that enforcing the law is its responsibility, I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time: hope. If the Jewish community truly stands with the Arab one, we might finally build the pressure necessary for real, much more significant change, not just for one protest, but for a shared future.
The scale of the crisis is staggering. In 2025 alone, 252 Palestinian citizens of Israel were killed. It was the deadliest year on record. This, as homicide rates among the Jewish population remain far, far lower. In 2024, the Arab population saw 220 homicides; the Jewish community, which is roughly four times the size of the Arab one, saw just 58. The rate is obscene; there are 14 Arab murders for every 1 Jewish one. This gap cannot be explained away as cultural or inherent; it reflects disparities in policing, investment, and pure attention.
In towns and cities like mine, everyone already knows what the police claim is impossible to track. People know who was murdered, why, who threatened whom, and where the weapons are. The information is open, shared, and visible. The only actor choosing not to act is the state, through a police force weakened, politicized, and, too often, indifferent to Palestinian lives.
Arab murders are simply not investigated with the same rigor as Jewish murders. In 2025, fewer than 10% of cases were solved, compared with roughly 65% for murders of Jewish Israelis.
The violence in Arab communities is not limited to deaths. Hundreds are wounded every year by shootings, car bombs, and assassination attempts. Last year, this violence turned 231 children into orphans. And thousands live under constant threat: business owners, teenagers, teachers, municipal workers, and elected officials. Arab mayors warn they cannot govern without basic protection. Some are extorted. Some are threatened. Entire towns have seen criminal networks fill the enforcement void while the state stands by.
Take the case of Ali Zbeidat, a grocery store owner in Sakhnin, who helped ignite the current wave of protests. After criminals riddled his shop with bullets and sent him repeated death threats and demands for “protection” money, he made an extremely courageous choice: He publicly shut down his business and called for a general strike of Arab workers. He told the Israeli press something that I believe: “People’s safety is more important than money.” And his call took off. Shops, schools, and institutions closed in solidarity, and tens of thousands marched demanding action.
A deadly feedback loop
The result is a deadly feedback loop: Violence grows, trust in authorities collapses, and citizens are told, implicitly and explicitly, that their safety matters less.
For Americans who see Israel as a democracy committed to equality, this should be deeply unsettling. Citizenship is not real if protection is selective. Democracy cannot survive if a fifth of the population is treated as a security problem rather than as people entitled to security.
What makes this moment different is that the silence is breaking. The question now is whether Israel’s government will listen, and whether Israel’s friends abroad, especially in the United States, will notice that this struggle is not peripheral, but central to what it means for Israel to call itself a democracy.
A country ought to be judged, first and foremost, by how it treats those who live under its own flag. Abandoning Palestinian citizens to organized crime is a moral, civic, and democratic failure at the heart of the state. This is not the shared future for Jews and Arabs that I work for; it is the present that Itamar Ben-Gvir has given us.
The gunshots I saw and heard on my way to pick up my daughters were not random. They were political. They were the sound of a government withdrawing from its responsibility to protect all its people.
This needs to change. And if Arabs and Jews, and all those around the world who care about Israel, work together, it will.

Israeli shark diving community pushes to reopen Hadera beach after fatal attack
Unknown

15:12:23 KST

For nearly a year now, Eliran Ovadia has struggled to reunite with his favorite marine apex predators.
Since last April, following the fatal shark attack in which diver Barak Tzach, 40, was killed near the Hadera stream outlet, the city’s diving zone has been closed. The site, located near the Orot Rabin power plant, had long served as a magnet for sharks and the divers who came to observe them.
Despite the tragedy, Ovadia, a diving instructor for 27 years and owner of the “Middle East Divers” school, insists sharks are not inherently dangerous animals. In his view, their fearsome reputation is largely a public relations failure.
“It’s an injustice that Steven Spielberg did to them in ‘Jaws,’” he said. “Most of the population, here and worldwide, is afraid of this animal. Why? Because of the movies. People see sharp teeth and panic. The fear is not justified in relation to reality. For me, it’s a fish. Yes, a top predator, but still a fish.”
A big fish, and one that can be dangerous in certain circumstances.
“The gap between what people imagine and what actually happens is enormous,” Ovadia said. “Of course you have to learn about it, and I’m not recommending anyone go to a beach marked ‘Danger: Sharks’ and jump in freely. Absolutely not. Like anything in life, before you do it, you need to study it and train with professionals.”
Ovadia, 49, who lives in Moshav Ganei Yohanan, began diving at 21, shortly after completing his military service. His first encounter with a shark came while working at a fish farm in Ashdod.
“We were a few guys there and didn’t really understand what was happening or how to behave, but it was fascinating. It just swam around us and disappeared. That day I realized it’s not such a big deal to dive with sharks. Everyone stays in their own world, even when you meet by chance in the depths.”
An apex predator with an ecological role
According to Ovadia, sharks play a critical ecological role that many people overlook.
“The shark sits at the top of the food chain and has a role in ecological balance,” he said. “If there are no sharks, we could see invasive species here, like lionfish from the Red Sea or sea urchins that start multiplying. The shark eats them. If there’s no predator for those just below it, they multiply and multiply.”
Hadera became Israel’s unofficial shark capital largely because of the Orot Rabin power plant. Warm water discharged as part of the electricity production process creates a relatively comfortable winter habitat. Schools of fish gather in the heated currents, providing a steady food source.
“Because of the warm water, fish are there all year, so prey is available,” Ovadia explained. “The artificial current also allows sharks to live there more easily. A shark needs movement to survive. If you catch a shark and stop it from moving, it can die. Around the world, sharks live in areas with strong currents that keep them active.”
Most shark activity in Israel is concentrated off Hadera, Ashkelon and Ashdod, but Hadera has the largest aggregation. “Just recently I counted about 100 sharks there using drone footage,” he said. “We’ve been living this for 13 years as divers.”
The dominant species are the dusky shark and the sandbar shark, which arrive with the cold, typically from November and December through April, when water temperatures range between 20 and 24 degrees Celsius. In summer, when temperatures climb to around 30 degrees, they migrate onward.
From curiosity to catastrophe
For years, the site drew divers and curious onlookers. In November 2018, the Hadera municipality even issued a public call to regulate boat tours that would allow people to view sharks in a controlled and safe manner. The initiative eventually stalled.
Everything changed after Tzach’s death. He entered the water near the stream outlet, where crowds had gathered to observe the sharks, and was fatally attacked. Since then, authorities have prohibited shark enthusiasts from entering the beach. Inspectors patrol the area and issue warnings to divers who attempt to go in.
The diving community refuses to give up. If they are blocked from shore, some reach the area by motorboat. Recently, enthusiasts organized, launched a petition and are considering a future class-action lawsuit to challenge what they call a sweeping and unjustified ban.
“There is no law that forbids seeing sharks, so why block us?” Ovadia asked. “We have regulated diving clubs under large international organizations. We teach shark history, species, physiology, reproduction, ecology and risk awareness. And yes, also about danger, even though most shark species today are not dangerous.”
He acknowledges that sharks are opportunistic animals and can become more active under certain conditions, such as before storms, when marine life enters a feeding mode. “But for us as scuba divers, I don’t want to say incidents don’t exist, but they are almost nonexistent. In nearly 100 percent of encounters, nothing happens.”
Still, as the fatal attack showed, it takes only one exception to cause tragedy.
“In Hadera, the dusky and sandbar sharks simply pass by you,” he said. “They have no interest in us. When we’re face to face, the shark sees our size, the bubbles, something unfamiliar. Through its senses, it understands we are not food and just swims on.”
‘A rare natural spectacle’
Israel’s shark enthusiasts number in the thousands. Among them is Dafna Blum-Zeira, 57, a divorced mother of three, two of them certified divers, who only caught the diving bug last year.
“When people ask why dive with sharks, I answer: Why do you go to Jerusalem? Because it’s beautiful and impressive,” she said. “It’s the same thing. This is a rare spectacle that happens under specific conditions. We have to be part of it.”
She describes diving in general as overwhelming. “You descend into deep water and suddenly see natural and archaeological treasures, and beautiful sharks. It gives you chills, not because of fear or cold water. When you come up after 40 minutes, you realize how little we know about the depths.”
Adir Magen, 47, a professional diver from Tel Aviv who often dives with his 17-year-old son, emphasized that enthusiasts are not encouraging the public to jump into shark waters freely.
“The sea is the sharks’ home, and we teach people how to protect them and nature,” he said. “There is risk, just like driving a car is risky, but we operate under strict safety rules. We go down with one instructor for every two divers and conduct proper briefings before every dive. Statistically, shark attacks on humans represent a tiny fraction. It’s not supposed to happen.”
Michal Nigkar, 40, from Ashkelon, encountered her first shark while diving in Sinai. “It was frightening for a moment,” she admitted. “I had a terrible fear of water as a child, but 11 years ago I decided to fight it. It’s about inner work and calmness. This isn’t about flirting with danger. Everything is supervised. Like birdwatching, we observe sharks.”
Waiting for next winter
As the shark season nears its end, enthusiasts know they have already lost this year. Soon the sharks will raise their fins and continue on, away from Hadera’s smokestacks.
The divers hope that next winter they will once again be allowed into the water — not from balconies or video screens, but face to face with what they see as a misunderstood marvel of nature.
“The death of the diver created trauma,” said Shay Gispan, 51, a diver and partner in a local diving club. “But it doesn’t justify an indefinite blanket ban. Diving should be allowed through clubs and professionals, not freely without supervision. With guidance and oversight, it becomes a completely different experience.”

Indian author Arundhati Roy quits Berlinale after ‘stay out of politics’ Gaza comments
‘History will judge’ those in the film industry who do not speak out against the Gaza war, the Booker Prize winner says

Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy has said she is withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders’ comments that cinema should “stay out of politics” when asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement on Friday that she was “shocked and disgusted” by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory at a press conference the day before.
Roy, whose novel The God of Small Things won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.

However, she said that the “unconscionable” statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider, “with deep regret”.
When asked about Germany’s support for Israel at Thursday’s press conference, Wenders said: “We cannot really enter the field of politics”, describing filmmakers as “the counterweight to politics”.
Fellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a “little bit unfair” to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.

China FM tells EU diplomats not to blame Beijing for bloc's problems

China's foreign minister told his French and German counterparts that Beijing was not to blame for Europe's economic and security problems as he pushed for more cooperation at a summit in Munich, a foreign ministry statement said Saturday.
Wang Yi made the comments at a meeting with France's Jean-Noel Barrot and Germany's Johann Wadephul on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.
He sought to promote China as a reliable partner of the European Union at a time when the bloc is trying to reduce its dependence on both Beijing and an increasingly unpredictable Washington.
"China's development is an opportunity for Europe, and Europe's challenges do not come from China," Wang said, according to the statement.
Warning that "unilateralism, protectionism, and power politics" were on the rise globally, he said he hoped Europe would "pursue a rational and pragmatic policy towards China".
"The two sides are partners, not adversaries; interdependence is not a risk; intertwined interests are not a threat; and open cooperation will not harm security."
The meeting came against the backdrop of trade tensions between the two giant economies and disputes over what the EU sees as China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.
The EU is seeking to cut its reliance on China for strategic goods like rare earths while also rebalancing a trade relationship that sees it run a large deficit with the world's second-largest economy.
In recent years, the two sides have clashed over Chinese electric-vehicle exports, which threaten Europe's car industry and which Brussels argues are based on unfair subsidies, and Chinese tariffs on EU goods ranging from cheese to cognac.
Wang urged Germany and France to help "give a clear direction for the development of China-Europe relations".
In a separate meeting with Wadephul -- also on Friday -- Wang touted economic and trade cooperation as "the cornerstone of China-Germany ties", according to a foreign ministry readout.
Wang also met Britain's foreign minister Yvette Cooper, telling her that Beijing and London should "explore more potential for cooperation", while the two sides also discussed Ukraine and Iran.

Key Takeaways from the ISW:
- Western reporting suggests that the United States has accepted Russia’s demanded sequence of having Ukraine cede territory to Russia before receiving formal US or European security guarantee commitments.
- Meaningful security guarantees are crucial to any peace agreement that allows Russia to occupy parts of Ukraine, especially if Ukraine withdraws from territory it currently holds.
- Putin’s rejection of meaningful Western security guarantees for Ukraine is a greater impediment to a prospective peace deal than Ukraine’s position on ceding its territories.
- The Kremlin likely sees an opportunity to manipulate the US-led negotiations process into another means through which Russia can achieve its unchanging military and political objectives, which it has failed to achieve in nearly four years of war.
- Russian President Vladimir Putin’s unwavering determination to conquer more Ukrainian territory and gain full political control over Ukraine is severely degrading Russia’s military and economy at the cost of the Russian population, and Russia will increasingly have to reckon with this degradation in the coming year.
- The Russian Central Bank lowered its key interest rate for the first time in 2026 and fifth time in the last 12 months, likely in an attempt to increase capital available for the Russian defense industrial base (DIB) and maintain the facade of domestic economic stability.
- Ukraine’s European allies continue to provide military aid to Ukraine through the Ramstein format, including via the purchase of US-produced weapons.
- Ukrainian forces recently advanced near Oleksandrivka and Hulyaipole. Russian forces recently advanced near Slovyansk.

New prototypes of the homegrown combat aircraft KAAN, which will undergo testing during the development process led by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), have made their debut.
The head of Türkiye's Secretariat of Defense Industries, Haluk Görgün, visited the KAAN hangar on Friday to receive information regarding the latest developments.
Görgün noted that the rollout of the aircraft intended for full-size static testing, alongside the first and second flight prototypes, represents a significant technical milestone.
The official emphasized that KAAN stands beyond a mere aircraft as a symbol of Türkiye’s engineering prowess and independent defense capabilities.
The primary objective of the project centers on indigenously developing a next-generation combat aircraft that will serve the Turkish Air Force for many years.
KAAN will feature advanced capabilities such as low observability, internal weapon bays, enhanced situational awareness and sensor fusion for superior performance in both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.
Following the first flight of the initial prototype in 2024, development and production processes continue uninterrupted while simultaneously advancing operational capabilities for manned and unmanned fighter jets.
Görgün explained that KAAN continuously enhances the country's defense and aviation infrastructure, elevating Türkiye into an elite league of global players, particularly through the ongoing development of a domestic engine.
The strategic program also serves as a catalyst that simultaneously strengthens the country's infrastructure, human resources and technological accumulation, he noted.
Authorities are rapidly carrying out preparations for mass production in parallel with the current testing phases as part of this critical technology initiative.
The domestic supply chain for KAAN currently consists of more than 5,000 employees working across over 300 companies in more than 20 cities, Görgün said.

‘Unforgivable’: police chief slams lawyer, doctors linked to crash-for-cash scams
‘Knowledgeable professionals should not do such immoral and unethical things,’ Commissioner of Police Joe Chow says
Hong Kong’s police chief has slammed the alleged involvement of a lawyer and doctors in a spate of so-called crash-for-cash scams as “unforgivable and unacceptable”.
Commissioner of Police Joe Chow Yat-ming said on Saturday that the force would speed up its investigation into such cases and expected a fresh wave of arrests.
He noted police previously arrested a couple and two doctors for their alleged roles in more than 20 crash-for-cash scams, adding that officers were investigating more than 100 other suspicious cases.
Authorities earlier said they had received reports of drivers facing sudden massive civil claims, months after police had closed the related traffic cases, with some involving minor or no collisions.
The claims typically covered legal fees, medical expenses, loss of income, vehicle repairs and other miscellaneous costs.
Chow noted officers had also raided the office of a lawyer in Mong Kok that had filed most of the claims linked to the couple.

This Valentine’s Day, chocolate comes with new risks

This Valentine’s Day, chocolate comes with new risks
Cocoa prices have eased since last year’s spike, but climate shocks and forest loss are making volatility the new normal. Agroforestry offers a way to protect supply and forests alike.
This Valentine’s Day, chocolate prices are no longer at last year’s peak, but cheap chocolate has not made a comeback, and it probably never will. Last year’s cocoa price crisis, driven by a combination of extreme heat, drought and disease in key producing regions, may have eased. But the aftertaste remains: A market that no longer behaves the way it used to, because the landscapes that grow cocoa are no longer the same. And the world’s unwitting appetite for cheap chocolate at the expense of biodiversity is part of the reason.
Cocoa is one of the most rainfall-dependent crops in the tropics, grown mainly by smallholders with few safety nets. Because cocoa production is concentrated in a handful of regions, a bad season in one place can quickly ripple across global supply. That fragility was laid bare in 2024, when the Ivory Coast and Ghana, which produce nearly 60 percent of the world’s cocoa, were hit by climate extremes that slashed harvests. Prices surged by more than 300 percent, squeezing some farmers, enriching others, and leaving consumers paying for the uncertainty.
The problem is not simply that cocoa is vulnerable. It is that we have built a cocoa economy that magnifies the vulnerability. For decades, the world has chased low prices and high output, and too often that has meant converting forest landscapes into farmland, from West Africa to parts of Latin America and Southeast Asia.
But forests are not optional. They regulate rainfall, protect soils, and create the microclimates on which cocoa depends. Full-sun cocoa farms can produce higher yields in the short term, but the sugar rush is followed by a costly crash: Depleted soils, limited protection from heat and drought that is on the increase, and little for farmers to fall back on when the monocrops fail. Yields fall, farms expand deeper into forests to compensate, and the cycle repeats.
This is why cocoa’s price volatility is not a temporary blip. It is a warning sign: We are weakening the natural systems cocoa depends on at the same moment that climate change is making harvests less reliable.
Research by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows how extreme heat undermines agriculture, reducing both the quantity and quality of crop yields and increasing pest and disease pressure. A recent study modelling cocoa under mid-century climate change finds that warming could wipe out as much as a third to half of today’s suitable cocoa area in some core producing zones, while shifting production towards new regions. Without safeguards, that transition risks trading climate stress in one place for forest loss in another. The details will vary across regions, but the implication is global: As climate change alters weather patterns, the geography of cocoa production will shift, and a stable supply will become harder to take for granted.
Unless we build resilience now, future Valentine’s Days may come with less chocolate and higher prices.
But we can eat our chocolate and keep forests too, by changing how cocoa is grown. It starts with bringing trees back to cocoa farms, reversing the damaging practices that are ultimately undermining production. Change can be made through climate-resilient agroforestry practices that rebuild shade cover, improve soil health and moisture retention, and reduce cocoa’s exposure to heat and drought. Cocoa grown under shade trees can stabilise farm conditions and support biodiversity, while producing higher-quality beans that meet premium market standards, giving farmers stronger incentives to maintain tree cover rather than clear more land.
Sceptics argue that growing cocoa with trees means accepting lower yields. But when it comes to unsustainable practices, high productivity today comes with a high cost tomorrow. A farm that exhausts its soil, loses shade, is exposed to drought, and needs ever more chemical inputs to maintain production is not a success story. It is a trap.
In a changing climate, the point is not how much cocoa a farm can produce in a year, but how reliably it can produce year after year. That requires resilience built into the landscape, now more than ever: More tree cover, healthier soils, and diversified farm systems that protect livelihoods when climate extremes hit.
This is not theoretical. It is already happening.
In Ecuador’s Amazon province of Napo, a project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and supported with technical assistance from the FAO has helped strengthen a sustainable cocoa value chain built around the traditional Chakra agroforestry system used by Kichwa communities. Put simply, it is cocoa grown as part of a forest garden: Kichwa women known as Chakramamas help steward these farms, cultivating cocoa under shade trees alongside a diverse mix of other crops and native plants, rather than clearing land for a single crop. Recognised by FAO as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System, the model is still expanding more than a decade on, helping Indigenous producer families earn more from premium cocoa through stronger processing, marketing, and partnerships with high-value buyers. High-end chocolatiers continue to source from Chakra producers, showing that cocoa grown alongside trees can deliver world-class quality while keeping forests standing for biodiversity, climate and land benefits.
There are more examples. In the Ivory Coast, FAO-backed efforts supported by the Green Climate Fund are already delivering results, restoring 1,084 hectares (2,679 acres) of degraded land and converting 3,527 hectares (8,715 acres) of conventional cocoa into improved agroforestry systems while reducing pressure on forests. Meanwhile, 234 farmers now have access to cocoa cooperatives, ensuring access to international fair-trade and organic certifications and a better price for their products. In Sao Tome and Principe, FAO has supported cocoa agroforestry through the GEF-funded Restoration Initiative, helping restore nearly 10,000 hectares (about 25,000 acres) of forest and improve land management across a further 23,000 hectares (about 57,000 acres). These are not boutique experiments. They are working models for stabilising supply, supporting farmer incomes, and reducing the forest loss that fuels cocoa’s growing volatility.
But projects alone will not be enough. Scaling them will take serious investment: From governments, companies, and consumers. It will also require rules that shift incentives across the entire cocoa economy, such as a new European Union law that requires cocoa and chocolate entering the EU market to be deforestation-free. By tying market access to how cocoa is grown, these rules are pushing governments, producers, and companies to rethink production models, improve traceability, and strengthen zero-deforestation cocoa systems.
Governments will also need to invest in farmer adaptation and long-term productivity, not just short-term output. That means accessible finance, practical support on farms, and policies that reward sustainable production instead of expansion into forests.
And chocolate companies need to promote resilience across their supply chains, not just chase volume. In a world of climate disruption, the cheapest cocoa is not necessarily the best bargain if it comes at the expense of farmers’ livelihoods or the ecosystems that keep cocoa viable in the years to come.
Paying farmers for chocolate that keeps forests standing is not a luxury. It is part of what makes cocoa more available and keeps farmers in business in a warming world. Chocolate is sold as a simple pleasure, but cocoa is no longer a simple crop: Its future depends on whether we treat forests and biodiversity as essential infrastructure for stable and resilient agrifood systems.

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. The United States will produce and deliver roughly $15 billion worth of military equipment to Ukraine in 2026 under a NATO program financed by European countries, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told PBS.
He noted that the US has not halted arms deliveries to Ukraine. "The US has said ‘We are willing to deliver’, and they are doing it. <...> No pauses, no blocks, nothing," Rutte said.
"They’re delivering to the tune of a billion euros a month. So that will be about 15 billion for this year in dollars, and 12 billion in euros. Critical lethal and non-lethal [equipment], including the [missile] interceptors," the NATO chief added.

Türkiye on Friday rejected resolutions adopted by the European Parliament that it said contained “baseless allegations” against the country.
In a statement, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said it “categorically” rejected claims made in resolutions passed Thursday concerning the situation in northeast Syria and alleged targeted expulsions of foreign journalists and foreign Christians in Türkiye.
The ministry said the resolution on the situation in northeast Syria disregarded “Türkiye’s role in Syria’s recovery and stabilization.”
It urged the European Parliament to make greater efforts to understand “realities on the ground and the aspirations of Syria and the Syrian people,” rather than adopting what it described as misguided and ill-intentioned measures.
The statement also dismissed allegations related to freedom of expression and religion, saying claims in the resolution titled, “Targeted expulsions of foreign journalists and foreign Christians in Türkiye,” contradicted the facts.
“No foreign institution, including the European Parliament, can interfere in judicial proceedings conducted in our country,” it underlined.
The ministry urged the European Parliament to "take constructive steps" for Türkiye-EU relations rather than "being instrumentalized for efforts against our country and attempting to interfere in our internal affairs."

Japan, Qatar sign 27-year LNG deal for 3M tons annually
Agreement signed between Jera Co., Doha's state-run QatarEnergy
ISTANBUL
Japanese and Qatari companies signed a 27-year agreement for 3 million tons of liquefied natural gas per year beginning in 2028, media reports said Saturday.
The agreement was signed between the major Japanese energy company Jera Co. and Doha's state-run QatarEnergy.
"Jera remains committed to building a resilient, well-balanced LNG procurement portfolio by sourcing from the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, the United States, and other regions," said the company.
Jera is one of the world's largest LNG buyers.
LNG-fired thermal power remains a key part of Japan’s energy mix, even as Tokyo expands nuclear and renewable sources.
Thermal power’s share is expected to decline to 30% - 40% by fiscal 2040, down from 68.6% in fiscal 2023 under the latest energy plan
Japan imported 66.15 million tons of LNG in 2023, with 4.4% from Qatar. Australia was the largest supplier at 41.6%, followed by Malaysia at 15.6%.
Separately, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry signed a memorandum of understanding with JERA and QatarEnergy, allowing Tokyo to request additional LNG supplies during natural disasters or other energy security emergencies.

Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa issued a presidential decree appointing a governor for Hasakah province.
The Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) said Nour al-Din Ahmad Issa was appointed governor of the northeastern province.
His appointment comes under a Jan. 18 comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement between the Syrian government and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.
The deal also stipulates the naming of a governor for Hasakah by presidential decree to guarantee political participation and local representation.
Syrian security forces and administrative bodies have entered areas previously controlled by the SDF, including Hasakah, Qamishli and Ayn al-Arab (Kobani), as well as strategic facilities such as airports, oil fields and border crossings.
The agreement provides for the gradual handover of security responsibilities, the deployment of state institutions and the integration of SDF forces into official government structures.
On Jan. 16, Sharaa issued a decree affirming that Syrian Kurds are an integral part of the Syrian people, and their cultural and linguistic identity forms a core component of the country’s unified national identity.
The Syrian Army launched an operation against the SDF on Jan. 16 in areas west of the Euphrates River. The operation later expanded east of the river with the participation of tribal forces, leading to all of the territories previously occupied by the group coming under government control.
Damascus, Washington stress Syria’s sovereignty, territorial integrity
On another development, Syrian and U.S. officials stressed Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity during talks on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, according to a statement Friday by the Syrian Foreign Ministry.
The Syrian delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani, met U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio to discuss key local and regional developments.
Both sides emphasized the unity of Syria, its sovereignty and the integrity of its territory. The U.S. reaffirmed its support for the Syrian government.
Washington also expressed support for the recent integration agreement between the government and the YPG/SDF terror organization, as well as Syria’s efforts to combat the ISIL terror group.
Syria formally joined the anti-ISIL coalition last November. The coalition was formed in 2014 and has carried out military operations against the terror group in Syria and Iraq, though Damascus was not previously a member.
The talks also addressed relations between Syria and the U.S. and ways to develop cooperation in various fields.
On Jan. 18, the Syrian government and the SDF reached a comprehensive ceasefire and full integration agreement, outlining sweeping measures to restore state authority in the northeast.

BUSINESS & ECONOMY
- US tech giants expect to spend $670B primarily in artificial intelligence, data centers
US-based tech giants like Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are projected to spend $670 billion on capital investments this year, primarily funding their artificial intelligence (AI) and data center efforts.
Analysts said the massive influx of capital resembles the rapid railroad expansion of the Gilded Age, covering the late 1870s to the late 1990s, when the world’s first billionaires emerged with industrialization.
The rise of railroads and the further advancement of port and mining activities held a key place in the US economy at the time, while agriculture began to lose its former glory.
The large investments may have a long payback period, and the cash flow and profitability may come under pressure in the short term, analysts warned.
- Türkiye secured $13.1B in foreign direct investments in 2025, defying global slowdown
Türkiye defied global economic slowdowns last year and received $13.1 billion in foreign direct investments (FDIs), a surge of 12.2% year-on-year, according to the country’s Investment and Finance Office.
The wholesale and retail trade sector attracted the most investments with a 32% share totaling $3.052 billion, driven primarily by the rise of e-commerce platforms in the country.
The manufacturing sector followed with a 31% share, reaching $3.02 billion, while the information and communications sector received $1.308 billion, or a 14% share.
- Partial government shutdown looms over US Homeland Security Department
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) faces a partial government shutdown after Congress failed to approve funding for the agency by a deadline Friday.
DHS is now the only federal agency without funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2026, which continues through Sept. 30, while lawmakers have already approved spending bills covering the rest of the government since a record-long shutdown ended in November.
The latest funding measure, passed at the end of January, provided DHS with a two-week extension to allow Congress additional time to negotiate changes to the agency’s immigration enforcement practices -- a stipulation pushed by Senate Democrats following the killing of two Americans by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the state of Minnesota in January.

China’s foreign minister, US’ Rubio agree to boost dialogue on sidelines of Munich Security Conference
Wang Yi, Marco Rubio discuss stabilizing ties, implementing leaders’ consensus amid improving relations between world’s 2 top economies
ISTANBUL
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Friday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany, Xinhua News reported.
The two agreed to strengthen dialogue and cooperation in various fields and promote the stable development of China-US relations.
Wang said Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump have provided strategic guidance for the development of relations.
He stressed that both sides should jointly implement the key consensus reached by the two leaders and work to make 2026 a year in which China and the US advance toward mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.
Dialogue is better than confrontation, cooperation is better than conflict, and win-win outcomes are better than zero-sum games, said Wang.
The meeting comes as Trump is expected to make his first trip to China in his second term at the White House in April.
The world’s top two economies have seen ties stabilize since November, after momentary tensions about Trump’s steep tariffs on countries around the world.
Early this month, Trump spoke to Xi, after the two met face-to-face in South Korea in October, during which the two discussed ties, with the Chinese leader issuing a warning on arms supplies to Taiwan.

Meet the Inuit scientist kayaking around Greenland to highlight just how far microplastics travel
Unknown

One scientist is on a mission to reveal the far-reaching spread of microplastics after kayaking around a remote glacier in Greenland.
Armed with just a kayak and a self-built microplastic filter, Kristian Louis Jensen has spent the last decade paddling through the most “pristine places” on our planet.
During his Master’s degree in environmental protection, the Inuit scientist developed ‘The Plastaq’. This citizen-science tool allows kayakers and local communities to collect surface water samples containing debris from items such as abandoned bottles and packaging.
“But that work led me to ask a deeper question about the invisible footprint of humanity,” he tells Euronews Green. It is this that inspired his most recent trip, over to a remote glacier in eastern Greenland.
‘Fossil fuels in motion’
Jensen kayaked to one of the most “isolated corners of the Arctic”, located hundreds of kilometres from any kind of road. He expected to find fibres and general plastic debris - which he did - but Jensen also stumbled across traces of car tire particles in his samples.
“Finding them on a pristine glacier in eastern Greenland was a shock because it validated a terrifying thesis: these particles are no longer just an urban issue,” Jensen says.
“They have become dust, airborne, and have travelled thousands of kilometres to the Arctic. This is ‘fossil fuels in motion’. It tells us that the Arctic is a ‘sink’ for the world’s pollution.”
With more than five billion tyres on the road globally, each loses around 10-30 per cent of its mass during its lifespan.
“That mass doesn’t disappear,” Jensen says. “It breaks down into toxic dust that settles at the very start of our food chain.”
The impact of Greenland’s microplastic pollution
Jensen’s work has highlighted the far-reaching extent of microplastics, which are starting to cause a trifecta of problems for local communities in Greenland.
“Ecologically, we’re seeing early evidence that tire toxicity is high for Arctic species,” he explains. “For instance, chemicals like 6PPF are lethal to Coho salmon.”
Car tire pollution can also cause deformities in Atlantic cod eggs, threatening the very foundation of the nation’s fishing industry.
For Indigenous communities, Greenland’s polluted waters have become a matter of environmental justice that poses a serious health risk.
In urban areas, chronic exposure to these kinds of particles has already been linked to a slew of health issues such as worsening asthma and cardiac problems.
“In the Arctic, that threat is now settling on our food sources, turning a pristine environment into a repository for global waste,” Jensen adds. “The higher latitudes and the people living in them are disproportionately being adversely affected by global pollution and climate change.”
‘A critical blind spot’: What pollution regulations miss
Scientists have long warned of Greenland’s growing microplastic issue - with multiple studies finding higher concentrations of tiny particles in sea ice in these remote areas compared to infamous ocean garbage patches.
But Jensen argues that there is a “critical blind spot” in climate policy that aims to tackle this pervasive problem.
“Currently, we regulate what comes out of the tailpipe, but we ignore what wears off the tire,” he warns.
“This is dangerous, given that tire particles are now recognised as a leading source of microplastics entering ecosystems globally.”
Are fossil fuels to blame for Greenland’s microplastic pollution?
Momentum to transition away from fossil fuels rapidly gained traction at last year’s COP30 summit in Belém - with more than 90 countries including Germany, the Netherlands and the UK backing the idea of a roadmap.
However, following pushback from petrostates, all mentions of a phaseout were scrubbed from the final deal. Hope for a fossil fuel-free future now lies outside of the UN’s remit. In April, more than 85 countries will meet at Colombia’s Global Fossil Fuel Phaseout conference, which will be co-hosted with the Netherlands.
However, Jensen says the transition away from fossil fuels mainly focuses on ‘black carbon’. These are emissions that are generated from burning fuel.
“We need to broaden this to include ‘carbon black’, the fossil fuel-derived filler that makes up a massive portion of every tire,” he explains.
“We cannot claim to be tackling the fossil fuel crisis if we ignore the solid petrochemicals rolling beneath our vehicles.”
There is also growing support for more transparency among manufacturers. Jensen is therefore calling for a “collaborative ecosystem” where ecotoxicologists have full insight into the chemical cocktails that make up modern tires.
The Black Carbon coalition
Taking down fossil fuel giants and huge corporations is no easy task - one that Jensen can’t manage on his own. It’s why he’s launching the Black Carbon scientific coalition at the Arctic Frontiers conference this month.
“The core of this campaign is the formation of a cross-sector science coalition to monitor black carbon and carbon black in the Arctic, and its effect on the health of the Arctic,” Jensen says.
The coalition will bring together toxicologists, Indigenous leaders and policymakers to investigate the specific impacts of tire particles on Arctic health. It hopes to take this evidence to the EU Parliament, and to COP31 later this year.
“Our ultimate goal is to secure national and international commitments to reduce and mitigate black carbon and tire particle emissions,” Jensen says.
Jensen’s work will soon be shown on the big screen, in a documentary with award-winning German filmmaker Steffen Krones. Black Carbon aims to expose the devastating impacts of microplastics on the Arctic and communities living in harmony with these fragile ecosystems.
The film is currently in production following Jensen, his investigation and his advocacy work.

‘Police need to investigate’: will Andrew be questioned over his relationship with Epstein?

Gordon Brown is a man who gets into the detail.
In office, and since then, he has applied his forensic mind to the matters that concern him. Lately, he has been focused on the Epstein files.
What he discovered shocked him. There was the immediate anger about the “extent of betrayal” by his former business secretary, Peter Mandelson, during the global financial crisis.
But it was the “the abuse of women by male predators and their enablers – and Britain’s as yet unacknowledged role” that has left the deepest mark.
He looked at flight records, examined the evidence and came to a conclusion: Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor should face police questioning over Jeffrey Epstein.
He’s not on his own in that conviction.
This week, voices around Westminster and beyond have insisted the role of UK institutions in this most horrifying of scandals must be now examined. And that includes the monarchy.
On Thursday, Cabinet Office parliamentary secretary Chris Ward was cornered about the former prince by Sarah Owen, chair of the Commons women and equalities committee.
Mountbatten-Windsor was trade envoy to critical countries, including China and Hong Kong, between 2001 and 2011.
Wasn’t it time for him “to answer both to the police and parliament”, she asked.
MPs can no longer afford to be deferential when it comes to the royals, Owen told the Guardian.
“We have to do this to put faith back into systems where people have lost it,” she said. “If we don’t it weakens people’s belief in democracy, their trust in politics as a force for good. That risks us going down to a really dark path.”
Writing in the New Statesman, Brown referenced a BBC investigation which found many of Epstein’s private planes had travelled through Stansted and other UK airports, where women “were transferred from one Epstein plane to another”.
But Brown had been “told privately” that previous Metropolitan police inquiries “related to the former Prince Andrew did not properly check vital evidence of flights”.
“The Stansted revelations alone require them to interview Andrew,” he argued.
Former Victim’s Commissioner Vera Baird told the Guardian that she had spoken to the police about Mountbatten-Windsor before the Covid pandemic struck, but was assured the issue was being investigated thoroughly in the US.
“Clearly, [Mountbatten-Windsor] is not going to do anything himself. Clearly, there’s a limit to what the royal family can do,” she said. “So the police need to investigate.”
Even from his bolthole in Sandringham, Norfolk, to where he is exiled by his brother, King Charles, can Mountbatten-Windsor, despite his vociferous denials of any wrongdoing, still ignore the deafening roars for him to cooperate with any police investigations, and to testify to the US Congress on what he himself knew about Epstein?
Thames Valley police is assessing whether to investigate the apparent sharing of some documents by Mountbatten-Windsor to Epstein during his time as trade envoy, and is engaged in discussions with specialist crown prosecutors from the CPS. The same force is assessing claims a woman was sent to the UK by Epstein for a sexual encounter with the then prince, which allegedly occurred at his former Royal Lodge residence in 2010. The woman, who is not British, was in her 20s at the time. The allegation is separate to the one made by Virginia Giuffre.
As Mountbatten-Windsor’s past answers over his relationship with Epstein are apparently blown apart, there has been no response from him.
When, with titles still intact, the then Prince Andrew told interviewer Emily Maitlis and 1.7 million BBC Newsnight viewers in 2019 of his Pizza Express in Woking alibi, and revealed a temporary medical inability to sweat, he would have expected to be believed, especially as the queen’s son.
Not any more.
There was also the matter of that March 2001 photograph, with Mountbatten-Windsor’s hand seemingly around the bare waist of a 17-year-old Virginia Giuffre, who would later claim she was forced to have sex with the royal, a claim he has always denied, and said to have been taken in Ghislaine Maxwell’s London Belgravia mews home.
Asked about it, he had stared at Maitlis, earnestly. It was difficult, he insisted, to “prove” it was “faked”, because it was a photograph of a photograph.
“Whether that’s my hand, or whether that’s the position …” he went on, before concluding: “I’m afraid to say that I don’t believe that photograph was taken in the way that has been suggested.”
Was it taken by Epstein? The then prince said that he had never seen Epstein “with a camera in my life”.
Yet Epstein appears to have kept many photographs of people, presumably to utilise for some purpose at a future date.
Mountbatten-Windsor’s explanation of that photograph is now robustly questioned by a July 2011 email from Epstein to his publicist, which states: “yes she was on my plane and yes she had her picture taken with Andrew”, in an apparent reference to Giuffre.
Maxwell further strengthens the argument for its authenticity in an email to Epstein in 2015, headed “draft statement”. She appears to write: “In 2001 I was in London when [redacted] met a number of friends of mine including Prince Andrew. A photograph was taken as I imagine she wanted to show it to friends and family.”
Another reason to doubt the photo, Mountbatten-Windsor insisted to Maitlis, was he was “not one to, as it were, hug and public displays of affection”. Yet, a photograph recently disclosed of him crouching on all fours, barefoot and smiling, over an unidentified woman lying on the floor, also casts doubt on this claim.
What of another photograph, pivotal to his downfall, and taken in early December 2010, five months after the financier’s release from prison for soliciting sex with a minor, showing the two men strolling in New York’s Central Park?
Wielded as proof of his ongoing relationship with Epstein that conviction, Mountbatten-Windsor would brush it aside as the final moment of their friendship.
He had to show “leadership”, he told Maitlis, and tell Epstein: “That’s it.” It was the “honourable and right thing to do” face-to-face. Crucially, he insisted, “from that day forth, I was never in contact with him”.
But a thank-you email he appears to have written to Epstein on 22 December 2010 reads: “It was great to spend time with my US family. Looking forward to joining you all again soon.”
Then with imminent publication by the Mail on Sunday of an article about Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, “The Duke” writes to Epstein in February 2011: “It would seem we are in this together and we will have to rise above it.” Another, in March 2011 reads: “Please make sure that every statement or legal letter states clearly that I am NOT involved and that I knew and know NOTHING about any of these allegations. I can’t take any more of this my end.”
These emails may raise serious questions about the personal integrity of a public figure, but what of professional integrity.
Emails between Andrew and Epstein show the former prince sharing information about potential investments for his friend – all while he was on the government payroll as UK trade envoy.
When the anti-monarchy campaign group Republic this week reported Mountbatten-Windsor to Thames Valley police, its CEO Graham Smith said: “I cannot see any significant difference between these allegations and those against Peter Mandelson.”
Christmas Eve 2010, after he has insisted he had no contact, the former duke appears to forward to Epstein a document including information on investment opportunities in gold and uranium in Afghanistan.
The document, specifically prepared by government officials for him, according to the BBC, references “significant high value mineral deposits” and the “potential for low cost extraction”, including valuable natural resources such as marble, gold, iridium, uranium, thorium and possible deposits of oil and gas. All sent, apparently to Epstein.
Another email indicates that on 7 October 2010, he sent Epstein details of his official upcoming trips as trade envoy to Singapore, Vietnam, Shenzhen in China and Hong Kong, where he was accompanied by business associates of the child sex offender. After the trip, on 30 November, he appears to have forwarded official reports of those visits sent by his then special assistant, Amit Patel, to Epstein, five minutes after receiving them.
Buckingham Palace may have said in October, when Charles stripped his brother of all vestiges of royalty, and booted him and his ex-wife out of his 30-room Windsor residence, Royal Lodge, that such “censures are deemed necessary, notwithstanding the fact that he continues to deny the allegations against him”.
As the drip-drip of disclosures continues, Buckingham Palace has stressed this week that Charles has “profound concern” at the allegations and is ready to support any police investigation. Though “specific claims in question are for Mr Mountbatten-Windsor to address”, it said, “if we are approached by Thames Valley police we stand ready to support them as you would expect”. The Prince and Princess of Wales, were also said by their spokesperson to be “deeply concerned” by the continuing revelations.
Will that palace support translate into access to any royal email addresses Mountbatten-Windsor used? One Epstein survivor has called on Buckingham Palace to proactively search files and emails relating to the then Prince Andrew. Juliette Bryant, who told the BBC at her Cape Town home she had never met Andrew and has made no allegations against him, said of the Palace: “It’s great that they’ve made a statement, finally. But the thing is, are they going to actually act on it?” Referring to the palace, as well as the police and other authorities, she added: “They need to go through all Prince Andrew’s files and emails.”
It’s difficult for the family whose dysfunction has been brutally exposed in the public domain, for politicians who like to praise the royal family and for a public with a profound respect for this most revered of public institutions, says Bolsolver MP Natalie Fleet, a survivor of teenage grooming.
Fleet said: “I definitely have [the royal family] on a pedestal, and I want to keep them there, they are such an important part of our country and I think most people feel like that.”
“But that is why there’s even more need for them to be seen to be doing the right thing at times like this. Women are sick of hearing the right thing. We’re always grateful for it, but it has to be followed up by action, deeds, not words.”
Mountbatten-Windsor has been approached for comment.

‘Seasons have become confused’: the people struggling in UK’s relentless rain

With 76 flood warnings still in force across the UK and further downpours forecast this week and next, parts of the country have endured rain almost without pause since the start of the year.
The prolonged wet weather is disrupting livelihoods as well as daily life, particularly in rural areas, where flooded roads, waterlogged ground and repeated storms are making it harder to keep businesses afloat, protect crops and maintain steady work.
Here, people share how the relentless rain and bad weather is affecting them and their businesses.
‘You’re sitting in your truck doing nothing while the rain pours’
In north Devon, Mark Harrington, a master thatcher, has been inundated with calls from customers with leaking roofs in recent months. “This is silly season for us thatchers,” he says.
Harrington, 61, has been fixing thatched roofs for 30 years. “I do understand that you’re going to get some rain in winter, but it has definitely got worse. Even if you do manage to work for a day, it’s punctuated by periods of an hour and a half of rain where you’re sitting in your truck doing nothing. Before, I used to think, a day off, that’s great. But now you think, oh, jeez, not another day off!”
The delays have financial consequences for Harrington. “I am haemorrhaging money at the moment just trying to cope with the delays,” he says. “Jobs are taking longer, customers are unwilling to pay for extra scaffolding to over-roof their property, and the lads who work with me – who I have spent time and money on over the years training – are grumbling that they need to find work indoors. I’m earning a minimal wage myself.”
Harrington used to be able to pay his employees half a day’s wages when their work was rained off, but not any more. “I’d run out of money.”
The weather’s impact on his materials, such as wheat, adds further pressure. “If wheat seeds lay on wet ground for an extended period of time, they don’t germinate and this will affect availability. We had a disastrous crop two years ago and are still suffering from the after-effects of the shortage.” Shortages mean the crop becomes more expensive, leading to higher costs for customers.
“If a skilled tradesman such as myself is unable to maintain a team or even work as much as is required, then I fear for the future,” he says.
‘I’m concerned that what we’ve seen so far is only the beginning of a long drawn out disaster’
On a hill near Helston in Cornwall, John, 83, says it is the relentlessness of the rain that is doing the damage. This year alone he and his wife, Vicki, 73, have lost 15 trees – many of them pines they planted nearly 40 years ago to provide shelter for their plant nursery as well as for “sheer beauty”.
“What I see is a combination of results from the increased numbers of storms and continuous rainfall,” he says. “The ground gets very soggy, and the trees hold less well in it,” he says. “It’s such a shame to see a tree you planted lying on its side.”
Living on a hill offers some protection from flooding, but the surrounding lanes have been submerged, at times with water three-quarters of the way up car wheels. Heavy rain has also worsened potholes, turning what was once a straightforward seven-mile drive into Helston into an obstacle course. “The time I take to do that same drive is pretty well doubled, because I’m dodging potholes and having to keep my speed right down,” he says.
The worsening weather has caused other problems. Vicki, who runs the plant nursery, says the increasingly unstable weather has made small-scale growing far more difficult.
Even on a south-facing slope high on a hill, the ground is “totally soggy and waterlogged”, with standing water lingering after heavy rain. “Flood water is really irritating – slopping around in mud everywhere and trying to keep drains clear,” she says. But it is the combination of saturated ground and increasingly violent winds that has proved most damaging.
Vicki, who specialises in old-fashioned fragrant and historic roses, along with culinary and aromatic herbs, has decided to scale back operations. The latest bad weather brought three storms in quick succession. “Storm Goretti,” she says, “blew my last remaining polytunnel cover off.” Looking across the site, she adds: “It’s very hard to come back from that. It takes a lot of work to build up stock.”
“Thirty or 40 years ago, it was fine. There’s no way I would contemplate polytunnels on top of a hill now. The climate has changed so much.”
John predicts the worst is yet to come. “As global heating progresses there is a likelihood that we will have structural damage to buildings as well as trees. I’m concerned that what we’ve seen so far is only the beginning of a long drawn out disaster,” he says. “Some mornings we wake up and because it’s so misty and dank, it feels like the start of a third-rate historian novel.”
The relentless rain hasn’t just affected those working in rural areas.
‘I worked in gardens where half the plants were dying last summer, and now they’re all soaked’
“It’s been hard to work with this much rain,” says Connor Law, a gardener in London. “I don’t mind working through a shower or two but when it’s so consistently wet, you can end up accidentally disturbing plants. So jobs get pushed further and further back. I’m self-employed, so it’s going to start making money a bit tight if it carries on for too long.”
Law, 33, has worked outdoors for the past 10 years and has noticed changes in the weather becoming increasingly extreme. “I worked in gardens where half the plants were dying last summer, and now they’re all soaked. Especially here in London, seasons have become confused. I saw spring bulbs flowering in December,” he says.
“Working as a gardener, you see it first-hand every day. [Parts of the UK] only recently came out of an official drought due to how dry last year was. It wasn’t really that noticeable unless you’re working in the gardens. [But] droughts followed by flooding are becoming increasingly common.”
Law says people will have to change their approach to their gardens. “We can’t do what we’ve traditionally done for the last couple of hundred years. They’re going to have to look a bit different. I’ve always told people to grow wetland plants; if you’ve got an area garden that keeps flooding, try and embrace it and encourage frogs and insects to move in.
Conditions in London may be milder than other parts of the country at the moment, but the climate is still a concern, Law says. “The rain isn’t causing danger to people’s lives like in other parts of the country – I have family in Wales and the south-west where it’s more hairy.
“But in terms of the health of the natural environment, people’s gardens are really important for biodiversity, insects and carbon capture. And if things in your garden are constantly dying because the conditions have changed, we’re going to lose that resource.”

Rain, rain, go away: the peculiar British stoicism of ‘celebrating’ awful weather

May it fall as a blessing, not as a curse. So goes the ancient prayer inviting us to embrace days of rain.
It is a prayer that would not be welcomed by anyone on the floodplains the UK persists in filling with houses. It would be met with outright hostility by any farmers who are now unable to do any of the things they need to do in February because their land has had literally 40 days and nights of rain.
For most, though, weather affects mood, not home or livelihood. The recent wet spell has been so abundant that residents of these islands may feel they are running out of ways to express stoical acceptance of the inevitability of rainfall: “the garden needed it”, “lovely weather for ducks” and the rest.
Like Wales’s “raining old women and sticks” and the Midlands’ “black over the back of Bill’s mother’s”, these phrases defy all efforts to find their origins. The origin – and the content – is beside the point.
A conversation about whether it looks wettish out or whether they say it’s going to last at least until the end of the week comes across, to people who are unused to the British climate, as an obsession with weather in general and rain in particular. Really, this is nothing like weather-report-as-conversation. It is a ritual, its participants offering the phrases often without being aware they’re doing so.
The only other place where this happens – where there can be four distinct rains in one day – is Japan. Similarly positioned between a vast landmass and a vaster ocean, Japan too receives weather systems from places cold and warm, fighting for dominance on arrival. Elsewhere, weather follows more predictable cycles, so discussing it seems daft. Brittany comes close to Britain: there, like in the Lake District and the west of Ireland, you can buy tea towels and fridge magnets “celebrating” the certainty of showers.
Another phrase with no known origin is: there’s no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothing. Certainly, if an inhabitant of Britain’s rainy islands decides that there is no point waiting for it to stop – for when will it stop? – and makes it their choice to go out while rain is still falling, they’re accepting that it will do what it will do. Their only option is sartorial: denim is bad; wool is much worse; worst of all by far is the precise suit Rishi Sunak wore to call a general election at a sodden lectern in May 2024.
Once you’ve given in to rain, the next step is to enjoy it. In Four Weddings and a Funeral, when Carrie finishes kissing Charles and announces that she hadn’t noticed the weather, the point is not that the embrace was passionate despite the rain. The rain is more romantic, just like with Helen and James in Sliding Doors, just like Raleigh and his cloak for Elizabeth I and all the other rains of national legend. The greatest romantic scenes are in rain, not in parching heat.
This is why chummy forecasters who use expressions such as “I’m afraid it’s going to be another wet one” hit a bum note. The British relationship with rain is not one of simple regret; it’s better summarised in a phlegmatic Manchester remark. “If you can see the Pennines from town, it’ll be raining soon. If you can’t see them, that’s because it’s already raining.” Archetypal Lancashire humour … except that the same quip is heard in Devon (“If you can see Dartmoor …”), Edinburgh (“the Fife coast”), Swanage (“the Isle of Wight”) – and everywhere else.

Given the toxicity of social media, a moral question now faces all of us: is it still ethical to use it? | Frances Ryan

In a week during which Keir Starmer has been under pressure to resign, cabinet ministers took to X to show their support. “We’ve all been made to tweet,” one Labour figure told a political journalist. The irony is hard to escape: as the prime minister is embroiled in the scandal of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, and now his former aide’s links to a sex offender, MPs are defending him on a platform that has in the past month allowed users to create sexualised images of women and girls.
This says something about the unprecedented way in which X has been tied to modern politics since it was still known as Twitter, as well as how widespread the culture of indifference is to the violation of female bodies, both online and off. But it also points to a growing dilemma facing not just politicians, but all of us: is it possible to post ethically on social media any more? And when is it time to log off?
It seems as though every major social-media platform has been contaminated to some degree. Since Elon Musk bought X, on top of deepfakes of sexually explicit images, the site’s algorithm has ramped up its boosting of rightwing content, with Musk himself posting about how the white race was “rapidly dying” and other extreme views on race almost every day of January. Facebook, long accused of mass data collection and involvement in Russia-backed election interference, dumped fact-checkers weeks before Donald Trump’s second term. Instagram, also owned by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, was found to knowingly be making teenage girls’ body images worse. And TikTok has been criticised for “exploiting” children, with under-13s exposed to self-harm content alongside dance crazes.
The Guardian’s revelation this week that Substack – the publishing forum some progressives fled to after other sites shifted rightwards – is making money from hosting Nazi newsletters sums up the no-win situation social-media users find themselves in. Substack, which has up to 50 million users worldwide, was found to be platforming writers espousing white supremacy, Holocaust denial and antisemitism, including an activist who described Adolf Hitler as “one of the greatest men of all time”. It’s all very 2026, isn’t it? Or 1936.
Still, none of this would be as disturbing if the disgust wasn’t accompanied by a pull to keep posting. There are very real reasons so many of us have failed to delete the apps, and not just because our dopamine-hungry brains have been trained to reach for our phones every five seconds. Over the past 15 years, for good or ill, social media has become a key way of connecting with others that – if we’re honest – many of us would struggle to fully break. That’s even more the case for marginalised groups, such as disabled people, who are more likely to rely on online networks for socialising and practical help. Just as it’s simpler to take the moral stand to cancel Prime if you can get to the shops with ease, it’s much easier to “get off socials” if you can walk up the stairs to your friend’s flat, feel safe in an LGBT+ bar or afford a round at the pub.
Social media can also be a literal lifeline for oppressed people, from Palestinians using Bluesky to crowdfund for food and medicine, to the lawyer of a protester in Iran notifying the world of their imprisonment. That is the absurdity of social media now: the same platforms that let some users scroll mindlessly to see what colour Stacey Solomon is painting her kitchen enable others to track and escape Israeli bombing. Often, we are in the surreal state of witnessing both through our screens at once.
There is a deep irony in the fact the platforms we seek escapism in are increasingly the most glaring demonstrations of the very darkness we wish to avoid. On the rare occasions I check my X account, I am usually greeted within seconds by (in no particular order): racism, pro-Trump posts, anti-benefit/eugenist rhetoric, Islamophobia, AI images and/or naked women. Perhaps as damaging as the content itself is the (quite false) feeling that this small corner of the internet is somehow representative of the country or humanity at large. There are few more successful ways for bad actors to keep resistance low than exhausting good people into thinking the battle is already lost.
There will be those in politics and public bodies who genuinely believe platforms such as X and Facebook help them reach the electorate, not least in an era when many older and disenfranchised people get their news – and plenty of fake news – from social media. There is certainly some truth in that. And yet the Mandelson and Downing Street aide scandals, much like the government using X to defend them, are a reminder of how the very worst behaviour quickly becomes normalised when it is, at minimum, being tacitly condoned by those in power. If Starmer wishes to show his government’s disdain for sexual abuse or the far right, logging off X would be a good start. Public opinion of politicians – and the current Labour party – is in the gutter. It seems unlikely that it will improve by them tweeting from it.
Personally, I’d just like to post a photo of my dog without coming into contact with a Nazi. I’m not sure that’s the snowflake demand Musk and co want us to think it is.

How a Soviet-era heating system exposes Ukraine to Russian attack – a visual guide

Many Ukrainians are without heating in sub-zero temperatures as a result of relentless Russian strikes on energy infrastructure, while the country suffers through its coldest winter of the war so far.
Ukraine is especially vulnerable to such attacks, as Moscow can exploit a widespread Soviet-era heat system in which multiple apartment blocks rely on communal central heating.
Under this system, water is heated at a huge main power plant and then is pumped via pipes to residential blocks, where it is distributed into radiators and taps. That means that with a single strike on a heating plant, Moscow can wipe out heating for whole neighbourhoods.
Ukraine says that all such power stations have now been hit during the course of the full-scale war. These thermal power plants often also produce electricity, leaving people cold and in the dark.
Kyiv has been the main target of such attacks this year, with heavy bombardment of thermal power plants and sub-stations that pump the hot water.
People in the capital live in 20th-century Soviet Union apartment blocks that were mass-produced out of concrete panels and are called panelki. Cities across the former USSR are dotted with these multi-storey residential buildings, which were built during a postwar housing shortage in the 1950s and 1960s.
The heating system was considered efficient, and can serve tens of thousands of people across entire neighbourhoods.
But a centralised infrastructure is inherently vulnerable to attack. Russian bombardment this year has left about 3,500 apartment buildings in Kyiv without heating, according to mayor Vital Klitschko.
There are frequent capital-wide blackouts restricting electricity to three or four hours a day. Authorities in Kyiv have set up tents where local residents can go for warmth.
The intense bombardment has coincided with bitterly cold conditions. The lowest temperature recorded this year at a weather station in Kyiv was -20.7C on 2 February. Average daily temperatures have not risen above freezing this year.
Several people have frozen to death, and some residents have started to dig cesspits as the water system fails.
Other cities have also been badly hit. Nearly 300,000 people were left without power and water supply in the southern city of Odesa after a Russian attack, the deputy prime minister, Oleksiy Kuleba, said this week. More than 10,000 consumers were also left without heating in the south-eastern city of Dnipro.
The European Commission last month said it would deploy 447 emergency generators.
“The EU will not let Russia freeze Ukraine into submission and will continue helping Ukrainians get through this winter,” the commission has said.
Russian attacks have also disrupted electricity infrastructure, meaning backup generators or battery packs can fail, leaving people with very few options to keep warm.
The Facebook account of the Kyiv city state administration posted an image of candles held underneath bricks, which it said was used as a rudimentary but dangerous source of heat. It cautioned that the temperature would only rise by 1 or 2C.

Race to find source of carcinogenic Pfas in Cumbria and Lancashire waters

A string of toxic pollution hotspots has been uncovered across Cumbria and Lancashire, with high levels of the banned cancer-causing “forever chemical” Pfos detected in rivers and groundwater at 25 sites.
The contamination, spread across a large area, was uncovered by Watershed Investigations and the Guardian after a freedom of information request revealed high concentrations of Pfos in Environment Agency samples taken in January 2025.
Pfos is a type of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (Pfas), known as “forever chemicals” because they take hundreds or thousands of years to degrade. They are widely used in consumer products and some have been linked to a range of serious health problems.
At one site, groundwater contained Pfos at 3,840ng/l, alongside elevated levels of other banned Pfas compounds. Twenty-five sites recorded Pfos concentrations well above drinking water guideline limits of 100ng/l for the combined total of 48 Pfas compounds.
The contamination spans an area of outstanding natural beauty with multiple protections for wildlife and habitats.
A resident whose business’s private well is polluted said they found out in November 2021 after being “unofficially” informed by an individual at the Environment Agency, and stopped drinking the water immediately. According to the resident, the agency had been testing the well for about 35 years because of concerns about “chemical drift” in the groundwater.
“When I contacted the agency, they offered no help,” the resident said, adding that they were directed to Westmorland and Furness council, which “said they wished I had not been told, as they could not even test for Pfas … there was no help, no advice, no support of any kind”.
“I tried to get the council to look for the source of the pollution but no one seemed interested,” the resident said. “They said it looked like we were an outlier … nearly five years later I am still no wiser.”
Westmorland and Furness council said it was informed by the Environment Agency about the contaminated supply in late 2021 and that the business switched over to the mains water supply.
“The council has continued to support the business to ensure compliance in line with statutory requirements and the provision of a safe water supply. These arrangements remain in place and are being managed to ensure there is no risk to public safety,” said a spokesperson.
The Environment Agency said it identified elevated levels of Pfas in the area in 2022 through its national surveillance monitoring programme, but stressed that responsibility for protecting users of private water supplies lies with local authorities.
The agency said it alerted the private borehole owner after detecting Pfas above drinking water guidelines and advised them to contact the local council. It added that councils, the UK Health Security Agency, the Food Standards Agency and the Drinking Water Inspectorate (DWI) were informed in 2025.
Possible sources of Pfos contamination identified in the Environment Agency’s March 2025 report include a paper mill in Beetham, where Pfas are known to have been used. Sites where Pfas-contaminated paper pulp may have been spread on land are also flagged as potential hotspots where Pfas could contaminate soils and enter the food chain.
The mill’s operator went into administration and its assets were sold to a new operator in June 2025. Responsibility for earlier operations now sits with the former company’s administrators.
“The mill is now operated by a new legal entity,” said Robyn Khan, director of the new operator Pelta Medical Papers. “Since this acquisition, there has been no use of Pfas-based chemicals on site, and the mill does not manufacture paper containing Pfas.
“Any manufacture of Pfas-containing paper products occurred under the previous legal entity and ownership, in line with regulatory guidance and permit conditions in force at the time. We take our environmental responsibilities seriously and will continue to engage appropriately with the relevant regulatory authorities.”
The mill’s administrators, Kroll Advisory, did not respond to requests for comment.
The Environment Agency report also identified five historical landfills and one operational landfill as possible sources of Pfas, alongside sewage treatment works, fire stations and discharges from caravan parks.
The government’s new Pfas action plan, published on Tuesday, sets out proposals to tighten controls on the chemicals, including new guidance on contaminated land, a consultation on statutory limits on Pfas levels in drinking water, and potentially tougher rules for industrial sites.
But Water UK wants Pfas banned altogether. It said: “We risk falling further behind other European nations, which are increasingly banning these substances and demanding manufacturers pay for clean up.”
Chloe Alexander, the chemicals policy lead at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said the government’s plan was “a roadmap to nowhere”, warning it contained no binding phaseouts, no clear timetable, and no commitment to match the EU’s proposed Pfas ban.
There are about 33,000 private water supplies in England and “it is becoming ever clearer how vulnerable some private water supplies are as the climate changes”, a DWI report said, with more running dry during droughts and others increasingly hit by environmental pollution.
Hannah Evans from the environmental charity Fidra said: “This is yet another case demonstrating just how prevalent Pfas pollution is and the real-world consequences. Persistent chemicals should not be in our drinking water, our food, or our bodies. We urgently need to turn off the tap and transition the UK towards Pfas-free alternatives, many of which are already widely available.”

UAE ‘surpassing Hong Kong’, challenging Singapore for global trade crown
With non-oil trade nearly doubling, analysts say the UAE has secured a first-mover advantage that leaves regional rivals trailing behind
Defying global headwinds from war and instability across its own region, the UAE’s non-oil trade almost doubled between 2021 and 2025 to reach 3.8 trillion dirhams (US$1.03 trillion), Prime Minister Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum announced on January 31.
That surge – powered by an aggressive outreach to emerging markets and strategic investment in logistics – has already fulfilled 95 per cent of targets once set for 2031, according to Maktoum, who is also the UAE’s vice-president and ruler of Dubai, the most populous emirate.
“Our investment environment is complete, our international partnerships have doubled, our partnerships with the private sector have been strengthened, and global confidence in the UAE has been firmly established,” he said in a statement.

Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te has appealed for public support amid a dispute about a special military budget, warning that the deadlock could delay key weapons deliveries and send the island down the US arms supply priority list.
The NT$1.25 trillion (US$40 billion) special budget has been repeatedly blocked by opposition parties, even as Taipei has come under increasing US pressure to prove its commitment to its own defence.
Analysts warn that continued delays could weaken perceptions of Taiwan’s defence resolve in Washington and regional capitals as the US reassesses its security priorities amid intensifying competition with Beijing.

Lai said this week that strengthening defence spending was “not an act of provocation” but a “necessary step to safeguard security and maintain regional stability”.
At a news conference on Wednesday, he also urged lawmakers on all sides to begin a substantive review of the special budget bill when the legislature reopened on February 24 after the Lunar New Year holiday.

Admiral Mei Chia-shu, the chief of the general staff, said at the same press briefing that Taiwan had already finished coordinating its plans with the US over pricing, delivery and supply schedules.

Software sector sell-off: Which European companies are hit?
Unknown

15:00:15 KST

AI anxiety is reshaping the software sector's landscape. What started as a US sell-off has become a reckoning for Europe's tech giants.
The software sector is experiencing its worst market sell-off since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, but this time the trigger is not a banking collapse, it is artificial intelligence.
The US sector fell 14.5% in January, its worst monthly performance since October 2008. The sell-off accelerated in early February, with a further 10% decline in less than two weeks.
At the heart of the rout is a growing investor concern. Many fear that AI tools may not simply enhance existing software products, but erode parts of the subscription-based business models that have underpinned the sector’s growth for more than a decade.
From AI market darlings to market drags
In the United States, some of the sector’s former high-flyers have seen dramatic reversals.
Unity Software, which provides tools for video game developers, cybersecurity group Rapid7, and customer engagement platform Braze have each lost more than half their market value since the start of the year.
Even the giants have not been spared. Palantir, long considered an AI bellwether, alongside enterprise stalwarts Salesforce, Intuit, and ServiceNow, have fallen by around 30% year-to-date.
One of the key triggers for the sector’s sell-off was Anthropic’s unveiling of new enterprise plugins for its Claude AI assistant in January.
The announcement suddenly pushed investors to ask an uncomfortable question: if AI can do what these software platforms do, why do we need the platforms at all?
When the US sneezes, Europe catches cold
Europe’s broader software sector is valued at roughly €300bn and is heavily concentrated in a handful of companies.
That concentration makes every percentage drop more visible — and more painful.
Germany’s flagship technology group SAP is by far the largest European software company with a market capitalisation of around €200bn.
Shares in SAP have already fallen roughly 20% year-to-date and by 40% since its peak in February 2025.
In terms of market value, SAP has wiped out €188bn over the past year alone, nearly half of its current capitalisation.
Even more worrying than the number is the trend: SAP is heading for its ninth straight month of decline. That's never happened in over 30 years of trading.
For a company long seen as a pillar of European tech resilience, the symbolism is stark.
France’s Dassault Systèmes, known for 3D design and engineering platforms used in aerospace and manufacturing, ranks second among Europe’s listed software groups, with a market capitalisation of around €24bn.
Its shares have fallen approximately 25% since the start of the year and are heading for a fifth consecutive month of declines — the longest losing streak since 2016.
In third place sits Sage Group. The British accounting software provider has dropped about 25% year-to-date, including a 17% slide in February alone, putting the stock on course for its weakest monthly performance since July 2002.
British information and analytics group RELX suffered a sharp 17% single-session drop earlier this month — its steepest daily decline since 1988 — and is now on course for what could become its worst month on record.
Worst-performing European software stocks in 2026
If Europe’s software heavyweights are under pressure, mid-sized firms are feeling the strain even more acutely.
Smaller companies tend to have narrower client bases and less diversified revenue streams, meaning shifts in investor sentiment can translate into sharper share price swings.
France’s Sidetrade, which uses artificial intelligence to help companies manage order-to-cash processes, has fallen nearly 50% since the start of the year — making it the hardest-hit name in the European software space.
Sweden’s Lime Technologies, a CRM provider focused on the Nordic region, is down almost 38%, while Denmark’s cBrain, known for its digital platforms used by public administrations, has lost roughly 35%.
Norway’s LINK Mobility Group, which provides communications and messaging platforms for businesses, and SmartCraft, delivering cloud-based tools to the construction industry, have each dropped by around 32%.
French group 74Software, specialising in API management and digital finance integration, has recorded a similarly steep decline.
Software panic or just market repricing?
The debate among experts reflects the market’s uncertainty.
Jensen Huang, chief executive of Nvidia, has dismissed the idea that AI will replace software as “the most illogical thing in the world,” arguing that AI will enhance existing systems rather than eliminate them.
Wedbush Securities said markets are pricing in “an Armageddon scenario” that appears disconnected from corporate reality, noting that companies will not rip out software infrastructure overnight.
JP Morgan strategists have similarly suggested that investors are discounting worst-case disruption scenarios that are unlikely to materialise in the near term.
Veteran Wall Street investor Ed Yardeni said markets have swung from “AI-phoria to AI-phobia”, indicating that while industry valuations now appear more compelling, earnings expectations may not yet fully reflect the potential slowdown facing software companies.
Yet others urge caution. Goldman Sachs strategist Ben Snider has warned of “long-term downside risk”, drawing parallels with industries such as newspapers and tobacco that underestimated structural change.
The expert highlighted a fundamental market rotation, with investors rapidly exiting AI-exposed software stocks and reallocating capital towards cyclical and value-oriented sectors more closely tied to the “real economy”.
What happens next?
The central question is whether this marks a necessary repricing of a sector that had benefitted from years of elevated valuations — or the early stages of a more structural reset driven by AI.
For investors, the current sell-off goes beyond quarterly earnings or interest rate expectations. It reflects a deeper uncertainty about how value will be created and captured in an AI-driven economy.
If AI tools reduce the need for multiple layers of enterprise software, margins, and pricing power could come under pressure.
If, instead, AI enhances productivity within existing platforms, today’s correction may prove excessive.
History suggests technology transitions rarely eliminate entire sectors. More often, they reshape competitive hierarchies.
Some companies are likely to emerge stronger, others may struggle to defend pricing power or relevance.
The software industry is not disappearing overnight. But its winners and losers are likely to look very different from those of the past decade.

Gisèle Pelicot tells BBC: I felt crushed by horror - but I don't feel anger

Gisèle Pelicot tells BBC: I felt crushed by horror - but I don't feel anger
Gisèle Pelicot, the woman at the centre of France's largest rape trial, has told BBC Newsnight she was "crushed by horror" on discovering that, for years, her husband had repeatedly drugged her unconscious and invited dozens of men to rape her.
"Something exploded inside me," says Ms Pelicot, 73, of the moment she realised the scale of her husband's crimes. "It was like a tsunami."
In an extensive interview ahead of the publication of her memoir, A Hymn To Life, she describes how phoning her three children with the news of what she had discovered about their father was possibly the toughest experience of her life.
'Descent into hell'
She recalls the moment she decided to waive her legal right to anonymity, and how she has never regretted that decision. She also reveals she still has unanswered questions she wants to ask her now ex-husband - the man she refers to as "Mr Pelicot" - in jail, where he is serving a 20-year term.
Warning: This article contains accounts of rape and sexual abuse
The Hôtel de Ville in central Paris, with its ceiling frescoes and rich wood panelling, is a far cry from the drab courtrooms in which Ms Pelicot was last seen publicly, during the four-month trial that shook France.
She describes the moment that marked the beginning of what she calls her "descent into hell".
She had accompanied her husband, Dominique Pelicot, to a police station near their home in Mazan, southern France. He had been summoned for secretly filming underneath women's skirts in a supermarket.
Ms Pelicot was taken aside by a policeman, who started asking her a series of increasingly probing questions. What kind of man was her husband? A great guy, she answered. Had they had ever engaged in swinging? No, of course not, she protested.
"He told me: 'I am about to show you something you won't like.' I didn't understand right away."
The officer showed her two photos of a lifeless woman lying on a bed. They were among thousands of pictures and videos her husband had taken of her while she was drugged.
"I didn't recognise myself," she says. "This woman was lying on the bed as if she were dead. There are men next to her. I didn't understand who they were. I didn't know them. I'd never met them."
She pauses, fiddling with her red-framed reading glasses. As she recounts the shock that engulfed her, her voice grows quieter but never falters.
Police told Ms Pelicot that she had been repeatedly raped by dozens of men. Although her husband had recorded, labelled and neatly catalogued the videos of the rapes on a hard disk, many of the men could not be identified.
She was advised by the police not to be alone after receiving this news. She went home in a daze and phoned a friend. "I told her: 'Dominique is in custody because he raped me and had me raped.' That's when I used the word rape. It was after five hours of questioning that I put words to Mr Pelicot's crime."

Her three grown-up children - David, Caroline and Florian - also had to be told what their father had done.
"I was well aware that for my children it was going to be immensely difficult," says Ms Pelicot. She now believes making those three phone calls was the hardest thing she has ever had to do.
She remembers Caroline's reaction: "I heard my daughter scream. It was almost inhuman, that scream."
She remembers David, her eldest, being in a state of shock, and Florian, the youngest, immediately asking how she was.
"They realised I was alone, and that I might do something stupid. For them, too, it was like an explosion."
Her children travelled to be with her in Mazan the following day. All three have since recalled destroying or throwing out the family's belongings - from furniture to photo albums - in an attempt to cancel their father's existence.
Their mother stood by and watched.
"I told myself that my life was in ruins, that I had nothing left apart from my children."
Since David's birth, when Ms Pelicot was in her early 20s, her children had been the centre of her life. Motherhood became a way to leave behind a childhood steeped in sadness.
"I lost my mother at a very young age, my brother and my father too," she recalls. "So I needed to rebuild everything I had lost."
In the interview, Ms Pelicot talks of her beloved parents, whose marriage profoundly shaped her own understanding of love.
She was nine when her mother died of cancer, plunging her father and the family into grief they never truly recovered from. Meeting Dominique Pelicot - 19 years old, handsome and just as bruised by a tough upbringing - had provided her with a chance to start anew. They married in 1973.
"We were very in love, and we threw ourselves into life. And we started a family, because that was the main goal for me," she recalls in a steady voice.
Inconceivable betrayal
By 2011, Ms Pelicot had started suffering from memory loss. She attributed this to neurological problems, but she was also suffering from persistent gynaecological issues. These were later proven to have been caused by the sedatives she was plied with, and the strangers who came to rape her multiple times a week.
She consulted a number of doctors. Her husband was by her side throughout the inconclusive examinations. He was also there every morning after the night-time assaults.
"It was inconceivable that this man who shared my life could have committed these horrors," says Ms Pelicot. "I would get up and have breakfast, and he would look at me in the eye. And I don't know how he could have betrayed me for so many years."
She would later learn that, alongside the drugs, her husband had given her powerful muscle relaxants, so that the next day she would not feel any pain for what her body had been put through.
She now believes her abused body was close to giving up, and that her survival was at risk.
"It is hard for me to recognise that he had no mercy," she says.
The revelations have taken their toll on the whole family, says Ms Pelicot.
"It's wrong to think that such a tragedy brings a family together. It took us a long time to rebuild ourselves."
Her daughter Caroline, in particular, has been condemned to a "perpetual torment", she says, as photos of her asleep in her underwear were found on her father's laptop.
"The incestuous look he cast on his daughter, I found utterly unbearable."
Ms Pelicot's ex-husband has given contradictory explanations for those photos. Caroline is convinced he drugged and raped her too, but lack of additional evidence means he has never been prosecuted.
Relations between mother and daughter were strained during the trial, and Caroline said she felt like a "forgotten victim". At various times - both before and after the case – Ms Pelicot lost touch with some of her children.
"It took Caroline time, because she's filled with hatred and anger - feelings I don't have," Ms Pelicot says. "I have neither hatred, nor anger. I felt betrayed and outraged by Mr Pelicot, but that's just how I am."
Ms Pelicot says she and her daughter are now repairing their relationship.
"Each of us needed time to find our own path. Today, we're trying to bring each other peace, and I hope we're on the right road to healing."
Further revelations
Revelation was to follow revelation. In 2022, police informed Ms Pelicot that her husband had admitted to the attempted rape of a young woman. He was also being investigated for the killing of a 23-year-old estate agent in Paris in 1991 - an allegation he denies.
That her husband could be a murderer as well as a serial rapist is almost too much for Ms Pelicot to contemplate.
"I dare hope he is not the perpetrator of this heinous crime, because otherwise it would once again be a descent into hell, both for me and for his children."
While the investigation was taking place, she relocated to the quiet Île de Ré, a small island off France's Atlantic coast. "I really wanted to stay in the shadows," she says. "I absolutely didn't want anyone to know who I was."
As is the case for rape victims in France, Ms Pelicot was entitled to a closed-door trial - full anonymity, no media. She had pushed back on suggestions from her daughter to have an open hearing, worried about cementing her status as the victim of a heinous crime.
Then, walking on the beach, four months before the case began, something within her shifted.
A closed hearing would mean the men on trial would also benefit from anonymity, she realised. Moreover, it would leave her outnumbered - 51 men and 40 lawyers versus her, her small legal team, and her children.
'If I was able to do this, all victims can too'
"For more than four years, I carried this shame," says Ms Pelicot. "And I felt that it was like a double punishment for victims, and a suffering we imposed on ourselves."
Her lawyers gave her a week to decide whether she truly wanted to open the trial up to the public and the media. She only needed one night. "By the next morning, I knew," she says.
It was an extraordinary choice.
"I have never regretted my decision, not once," she says. "It was also a message to all victims who don't dare to do the same… It could give them some of the strength I found in me.
"Because," she says without hesitation, "within us we have resources that we don't even suspect. And if I was able to do this, all victims can too. I am convinced of this."
In 2024, the Pelicot trial exploded into full view of France and the world.
The ability to let the light shine through the depravity Ms Pelicot was subjected to - the "filth", as she repeatedly calls it - is a testament to her resilience.
Every day, she held her head high as she walked into the Avignon courthouse. A throng of women assembled outside to show their support, and she acknowledged them with a slight nod and a hand on her heart.
Surrounded by dozens of cameras, Ms Pelicot says they gave her "unbelievable strength".
"For me, they soothed what was happening within the courtroom," she says. "On my own, I think it would have been difficult."
Even Queen Camilla reached out from the UK to express her admiration with a personal letter, which surprised her. "I felt moved and very honoured... I am grateful to her," she says.
Throughout the interview, Ms Pelicot is composed and assured. Then, she is shown videos of French women, filmed by Newsnight, thanking her for her choice to have an open hearing.
"Thank you for being so brave," says one woman.
"We are here to support you! Life is beautiful, madame!" says another.
As one beaming face follows the next, Ms Pelicot, for the first time, wipes away a tear.
"It touches me enormously because these are the faces I met during the trial," she says. "I saw them putting up posters, I saw their collages, I saw the banners."
"They were truly exceptional," she smiles.
In the courtroom, Ms Pelicot and her family sat through nearly four months of veiled insinuations and open accusations of complicity from both the defendants and their lawyers. "You go through hell in a courtroom. You're really humiliated," she says.
At the time, this led her to label what was unfolding as the "trial of cowardice". Now, too, her voice rises slightly as she recalls those moments.
"They didn't want to own up to what they had done," she says of the 50 men her husband had allowed to abuse her. She feels they acted as if they had committed a petty crime and refused to accept that she could not have given consent.
"Then, the video attesting to the truth would be shown," she says. "We could see that man raping me. He'd be asked those questions again, and would reply: 'No, I didn't rape her, I didn't have any intention of raping her.'
"So where are we supposed to go from there?" she wonders aloud, exasperated.
"I think that as far as they're concerned, they couldn't have raped me because Mr Pelicot was there and had given his consent. Therefore, they didn't consider it rape," she concludes.
The argument was rejected by the seven judges who oversaw the case. All the defendants were found guilty. Her former husband (their divorce was finalised shortly before his trial) was given a maximum sentence of 20 years. The other 50 men were jailed for terms between five and 15 years.
Rebuilding her life
As Ms Pelicot speaks, a tall bespectacled widower named Jean-Loup watches on discreetly. She met him on Île de Ré in 2023. "We had this stroke of luck," she says, her voice measured and warm. "We fell in love like teenagers, when neither of us was expecting it."
They have been a couple ever since. "Life put a man on my path who has the same values, the same principles as me - and who has also been through many ordeals in his life."
"So you see," she continues, her head tilting to one side, "life always holds beautiful surprises. It's brought a lot of colour into our lives."
It has been almost six years since Ms Pelicot was shown the photos of a woman who looked "dead". The question of why her ex-husband subjected her to years of abuse still looms large. Dominique Pelicot admitted in court he wanted to "subdue an unbreakable woman".
"He would have liked me to participate in swinging sessions and I always refused because I have a sense of modesty," she says. "I think he found a way around it by subduing me."
But how he could have brought himself to do what he did is a different question. "I might ask myself this for the rest of my life," she says.
Ms Pelicot says she intends to visit him in jail to ask him what he may have done to their daughter Caroline, and the murder case he has been linked to.
"I need to meet him to have answers. I don't know if I will, but I need to look at him straight in the eye."
Meanwhile, the rebuilding of her life continues. "I am healing," she says.
She resists the idea of entirely disavowing the life she led with her ex-husband.
"In order to live, I have needed to think that the 50 years I spent with Mr Pelicot were not all just a lie. Because otherwise, it's as if I'd been dead. As if I no longer existed."
During one of the rare times she took the stand in court, Ms Pelicot told her ex-husband that his betrayal had been "immeasurable".
"I always tried to lead you towards the light, but you chose the depths of the human soul," she said.
It is a sentiment she echoes now. In life, she says, "you always have to choose, to decide which path to follow. There is the good and the bad."
"As for me," she concludes in her poised voice, "I have always chosen to walk toward the good."

One in five Lithuanians lives in poverty, among worst rates in EU

About one in five residents in Lithuania lives in poverty, the State Data Agency (VDA) reported, with the most affected groups including people struggling to enter the labour market, pensioners and those with disabilities.
Alekas, 30, has a passion for cooking but has been unable to find work as a chef for over a year.
“I see ads for assistant cooks. But when you call – thank you, we already have someone. You know how it goes. Still, hope dies last,” he said.
He lost his home a year ago and now stays in a shelter, visiting a charity soup kitchen almost every day. In the afternoons, the centre is full, serving hundreds of people, including seniors, the disabled, recently released prisoners, and the homeless.
Ingrida Radzevičė, director of the Betanija Social Centre, said younger people are increasingly seeking help.
“There are very young people, 20 or a little older, as well as young mothers with children. Some have returned from working abroad, where they were cheated and not paid. Here, they have lost their homes and sometimes broken ties with family. The stories are very diverse,” Radzevičė said.
Aistė Adomavičienė, director of the National Poverty Reduction Network, said young adults aged 18–24 are at the highest risk of poverty because they are often just entering the workforce.
Children and people with disabilities make up a significant portion of those in poverty, she said, while public misconceptions persist that poor people are lazy or living solely on state aid.
“In Lithuania, only about 4% of welfare recipients could potentially work but do not. Children make up a quarter of those in poverty, and people with disabilities are another portion. About 15,000 could potentially work,” Adomavičienė said.
Poverty is unevenly distributed, she added, with rates in Vilnius and surrounding areas roughly half of those in other parts of the country.
Daiva Skučienė, a professor at Vilnius University’s Faculty of Philosophy, said structural issues contribute to the problem, including lack of jobs, inconvenient transport, and limited options for young mothers balancing childcare and work schedules.
“People may lack motivation, and some grow up in families where skills are not developed. Various structural factors play a role, which is why social welfare systems focus on early support, because it’s much harder to recover later,” Skučienė said.
She added that shifts in the labour market also affect poverty: people with skills can become unemployed if they do not adapt to changing demands.
Eurostat data show Lithuania’s poverty rates have remained among the highest in the European Union for many years.

If you don’t want to swap between different streaming platforms, you’ll usually save money on subscribing by locking in for a year. For example, Amazon Prime is £8.99 per month, or £95 a year, so you’ll save £12.88 by opting for an annual subscription.
Start the cancellation process
Some streaming services will offer a better deal to encourage you to stay, so if you want to save, click ‘cancel’ to see if you’re offered a lower price.
Keep an eye out for deals

MINSK, 14 February (BelTA) – Joint projects were discussed during a working visit of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Belarus to Egypt and concurrently to Oman Yevgeny Sobolevsky to Muscat, BelTA learned from the press service of the Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
During a meeting of the Belarusian diplomat with President of the Oman Investment Authority Abdulsalam Al Murshidi, the parties noted the positive dynamics in contacts between relevant agencies and business circles of Belarus and Oman, as well as the intensity of joint efforts to implement trade, economic, and investment projects in line with existing top-level and high-level agreements. They also discussed the schedule of bilateral events for the near future, including the first session of the joint committee for cooperation and investment.
At a meeting with Oman’s Minister of Health Hilal Al Sabti, the parties reviewed the implementation of agreements reached during the visit of the Omani official to Belarus in June 2025. They expressed interest in exchanging experience in cancer treatment and transplantology, noting the growing contacts between medical institutions of the two countries. Consideration was given to the prospects for cooperation in the production and supply of medicines.
With Chairman of the Public Authority for Special Economic Zones and Free Zones Qais Al-Yousef, Yevgeny Sobolevsky discussed formats for implementing a project to establish a Belarusian re-export hub in Oman. Further elaboration of the issue will be continued with interested bodies in Belarus.
Following a meeting with Oman’s Deputy Minister of Trade, Industry, and Investment Promotion Ghalib Al Mamari, the fruitful interaction in the development of joint industrial cooperation projects was noted, and prospects for cooperation in woodworking and the furniture industry were outlined. Readiness to continue interaction in antimonopoly regulation between the relevant ministries of the two countries was expressed.
Issues of organizing joint events involving business circles were discussed with Chairman of the Oman Chamber of Commerce and Industry Faisal Al Rawas. The parties agreed to promote the development of cooperation between Belarusian and Omani commercial organizations in industry, food security, and information technology.
Earlier, it was reported that the Belarusian government had decided to open an embassy in the Sultanate of Oman. A permanent Belarusian diplomatic presence in Oman will significantly improve the efficiency of work on developing political, trade, economic, and investment ties, and enable a more in-depth study of opportunities for industrial cooperation and joint development of new markets. This will strengthen Belarus’ position on the Omani market and will also help find access to African countries and Yemen.

Ministry of Internal Affairs helps evacuate more than 6,300 people from frontline areas since start of year
According to Ukrinform, Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko stated this on Telegram.
"This is difficult but extremely important work. Evacuation crews, including White Angel and Phoenix, operate under shelling, often literally a step away from the enemy. Each operation requires careful planning: identifying safer routes, preparing transport, and coordinating with local authorities and military administrations," Klymenko said.
According to him, for many people the decision to leave is difficult, so the work of rescuers and police officers is not only about logistics. It also involves communication, explanations, an individual approach, support for families with children, and assistance for people with limited mobility.
All members of the evacuation crews are certified paramedics, meaning they not only organize departures quickly but also provide medical assistance when necessary.
"Recently, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law regulating the procedure for mandatory evacuation of the population. This important decision will allow us to act faster, more clearly, and more effectively when it comes to the safety of vulnerable categories of citizens. Work in frontline regions continues without interruption. And its most important achievement is saved lives," Klymenko emphasized.
As Ukrinform previously reported, in Kherson the zone of mandatory evacuation for families with children was expanded in the Dniprovskyi district due to the increased intensity of Russian shelling.

US ends decade-long temporary protected status for Yemenis

The US government has said it is ending a protected status for migrants from Yemen, which had been in place for the past decade.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced on Friday that Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, first designated for the Middle Eastern nation in September 2015 because of armed conflict there, would be terminated in 60 days' time.
It applied to roughly 1,400 Yemeni nationals in the United States.
"After reviewing conditions in the country and consulting with appropriate US government agencies, I determined that Yemen no longer meets the law's requirements to be designated for Temporary Protected Status," Noem said in a statement.
"Allowing TPS Yemen beneficiaries to remain temporarily in the United States is contrary to our national interest," she said, describing the revocation as an act of "putting America first."
Yemeni beneficiaries with no other lawful basis for remaining in the US have 60 days to voluntarily depart the United States or face arrest, the statement said, offering a complimentary plane ticket and a $2,600 "exit bonus" for those who "self-deport."
Immigration policy shift
The Trump administration has rolled back TPS protections for many nations, mostly in the developing world, as part of a drive to scale back immigration.
TPS allows narrow groups of people in the United States to live and work in the country if they're deemed to be in danger if they return to their home nations, because of war, natural disaster, or other extraordinary circumstances.
While the protections are technically temporary, historically presidents have continued to renew TPS status for migrants rather than revoking it and rendering them undocumented.
Yemen, one of the world's poorest countries, has been riven by civil war since 2014.
The State Department currently advises against travel to Yemen, citing "terrorism, unrest, crime, health risks, kidnapping, and landmines."
Since coming to office last year Trump has ended or sought to end TPS for nationals of Haiti, Somalia, Honduras, Nicaragua, Nepal, Ethiopia, and Venezuela, among others.

Why the BNP won Bangladesh’s post-uprising election

Why the BNP won Bangladesh’s post-uprising election
Jamaat recorded historic gains and voters punished the old order, but first-past-the-post maths, patronage networks and political familiarity ultimately returned the BNP to power.
In the end, the 13th parliamentary election in Bangladesh was not a revolution. It was a reckoning.
When the ballots were counted, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had secured a decisive victory, returning to power after years in the political wilderness under Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule.
Most headlines framed it as a dramatic comeback, and rightfully so. But beneath the surface, this was less a tidal wave of voter choice than a carefully navigated current. This was a contest shaped by frustration and the arithmetic of first-past-the-post (FPTP).
To understand why BNP prevailed, one must first dispense with the lazy narrative that this was a Jamaat moment squandered. When the results became clear, Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) secured 68 seats, while the Jamaat-led bloc secured 77 seats in parliament. That is no small feat for a party whose previous best parliamentary showing was just 18 seats in 1991. Many analysts had suggested Jamaat’s support had grown in the run-up to the poll, and the data vindicated that claim. But in an FPTP system, a swelling vote share does not automatically translate into 151 seats out of 300 elected constituencies.
This election was not driven by any momentous revolution, even though it came on the back of a mass uprising that toppled Hasina’s autocracy in August 2024. But there was no deep ideological rupture, and no permanent reordering of voter loyalties, at least not on a scale that would rupture the very fabric of the country’s electoral mindset.
And of course, it was not a national wave election, in which a single mood sweeps towards a particular party across class, gender and region. What unfolded was a hybrid: Largely a normal election with significant deviations, but a predictable outcome.
Party loyalists mostly stayed home. Swing voters mattered. And in pockets of the country, frustration with BNP’s local leadership triggered temporary defections – many of them to Jamaat or NCP.
The anger was real. After August 5, BNP’s grassroots machinery performed abysmally. Petty leaders across districts were accused of corruption and extortion. In rural market towns and urban peripheries, resentment simmered.
Voters were not merely disappointed; they were, to use the language heard in tea stalls and union parishad courtyards, “really, really pissed off”. That fury explains Jamaat’s surge. A portion of BNP loyalists and a significant share of swing voters drifted towards the promise of an “honest alternative”.
But drift is not destiny.
BNP’s base, historically broader and organisationally deeper than Jamaat’s, did not collapse. Even after defections, it remained numerically larger. BNP’s nomination strategy proved unexpectedly shrewd.
Where Jamaat fielded relatively unknown but ideologically trusted figures, BNP leaned on its old guard – candidates with entrenched name recognition and dense informal networks.
That mattered, particularly in rural Bangladesh. Urban, educated voters may be thrilled by the rhetoric of ethical governance. For them, the idea of an incorruptible, ideologically disciplined candidate resonates as a moral reset.
But rural voters are pragmatic actors. They operate within intricate patronage webs. An MP is not an abstraction; he (and it is usually he) is a broker of safety nets, jobs, stability and dispute resolution. Honesty, in isolation, does not guarantee access. Familiarity does.
Thus emerged the central voter dilemma. Disgusted with BNP’s excesses, many considered a switch. In constituencies where Jamaat fielded a well-known leader, some made it. But elsewhere, voters encountered candidates they did not know, whose “honesty” they could not verify, and whose party offered little beyond moral branding.
Faced with uncertainty, they chose the “devil” they knew.
Jamaat compounded its structural limitations with strategic missteps. Its awkward posture on women’s issues – oscillating between reassurance and dog whistles – failed to convince large segments of female voters who have, over decades, carved out expanding public roles.
Bangladesh’s social transformation is not cosmetic, and women are central to its labour force, education system and microcredit economy. A party that cannot articulate a credible vision for gender equality cannot win a national wave.
More damaging was Jamaat’s revisionist flirtation with the memory of 1971. The Liberation War is the country’s moral founding document. Attempts to soften or reinterpret Jamaat’s historical role alienated voters far beyond the secular-liberal elite.
Even conservative families drew red lines around 1971. The prevailing mode of public sentiment was probably blunt: One may forgive; one does not forget.
Yet Jamaat’s performance was still historic. Jamaat-e-Islami and its allied coalition secured 77 seats, a testament not only to its disciplined cadre but also to BNP’s own misdeeds. Extortion scandals and local arrogance pushed voters into Jamaat’s arms.
In a tightly contested FPTP landscape, even a few percentage points can flip dozens of seats. Jamaat capitalised on that anger with precision in Rajshahi, Khulna and Rangpur divisions, where its organisational muscle is strongest.
But precision is not the same as breadth. Jamaat’s surge remained regionally concentrated. Its support varied sharply by class, gender, education and age. That is the opposite of a wave election. Without uniform national momentum, being a victor in FPTP is not an easy task.
Then there was the ghost in the machine: The Awami League (AL). Much commentary underestimated its residual vote. Surveys suggested a hardcore 5 to 7 percent would never defect, but beyond that lay a larger bloc – perhaps 20 to 25 percent – either undecided or unwilling to disclose preferences. In this election, that particular bloc mattered a lot.
Pre-election field research and multiple polls indicated that many non-hardcore AL voters were breaking towards the BNP – probably not out of ideological alignment but out of instrumental rationality. They believed BNP would form the government and wanted access to services through the winning MP.
In areas where BNP’s old guard had harassed AL supporters, some abstained or flirted with Jamaat. But nationally, the gravitational pull favoured BNP. Voters wanted to be on the side of the winner. Perception became a self-fulfilling prophecy.
The four plausible scenarios before election day clarified the stakes. Without significant AL turnout, BNP would likely secure a plurality in a tight race. With moderate AL support, it would win a comfortable majority. With overwhelming AL backing, even a two-thirds majority was conceivable. Only a full-blown Jamaat wave – a cross-class, cross-gender national embrace – could have reversed the equation.
That wave never materialised.
BNP’s victory, then, is a product of structural advantage, strategic candidate selection and the rational calculations of the country’s traditional voters. It was aided by Jamaat’s self-inflicted wounds on women’s rights and historical memory. It was enabled, paradoxically, by BNP’s own local misconduct, which inflated Jamaat’s vote share but not enough to overcome FPTP mathematics.
One more footnote of this election deserves attention: The emergence of the National Citizen Party (NCP), which captured five seats. For a new party born out of an uprising, in the highly polarised political environment of the South Asian nation, that is no small accomplishment.
It signals a hunger, however modest, for alternatives outside the new binary of BNP and Jamaat. Under proportional representation, such a party might flourish. Under FPTP, five seats is both a breakthrough and a ceiling.
Bangladesh’s 13th parliamentary election was, in the end, a story of limits: The limits of anger, the limits of moral branding, the limits of revisionism, and the enduring power of organisational depth in a winner-take-all system.
BNP won not because it inspired a nation, but because it understood it.

US pressures Vanuatu at UN over ICJ’s landmark climate change ruling
Cable seen by Al Jazeera says the US ‘strongly objects’ to the island nation seeking support for ICJ’s landmark climate ruling.
The United States is urging governments to pressure Vanuatu to withdraw a United Nations draft resolution supporting a landmark International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling that countries have a legal obligation to act on climate change.
A US State Department cable seen by Al Jazeera on Saturday says that the Trump administration “strongly objects” to the proposed resolution being circulated by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu in support of last year’s ruling by the ICJ – the UN’s top court.

The Associated Press news agency, which also reported on the cable, said that it was circulated to all US embassies and consulates this week, shortly after Vanuatu announced it was putting forward the draft UN resolution for consideration.
“We are strongly urging Vanuatu to immediately withdraw its draft resolution and cease attempting to wield the Court’s Advisory Opinion as a basis for creating an avenue to pursue any misguided claims of international legal obligations,” a copy of the cable seen by Al Jazeera states.
The ICJ’s 15 judges considered tens of thousands of pages of written submissions and two weeks of oral arguments during the court’s biggest-ever case, before delivering their verdict last year that states have a legal obligation to act on the “existential threat” of climate change.
The ICJ case took place after Vanuatu won the support of 132 countries in the UN General Assembly, which can request opinions from The Hague-based court.
It also came as the Trump administration has sought to undo US action on climate change, both at home and at the UN.
The US cable claims that Vanuatu’s proposed UN resolution in support of the ICJ opinion was based on “speculative climate models to fabricate purported legal obligations that seek to assign blame and encourage baseless claims”.
Louis Charbonneau, Human Rights Watch’s director at the UN, urged support for Vanuatu’s draft resolution on Friday, saying “governments should live up to their obligation” to protect human rights around the world by protecting the environment.
“Responsible governments shouldn’t allow themselves to be bullied by those that reject the global scientific consensus and continue to support reliance on harmful fossil fuels,” he said.
Vanuatu’s UN Ambassador Odo Tevi, who said his country wants a vote on the resolution by the end of March, has stressed that it would ensure that the clarity in the ICJ ruling “strengthens global climate action and multilateral cooperation”.
An article in Vanuatu’s Daily Post newspaper said that the draft resolution has been endorsed by countries including Barbados, Burkina Faso, Colombia, Jamaica, Kenya, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, the Netherlands, Palau, the Philippines, Singapore and Sierra Leone.
Many of these countries are already experiencing the worsening effects of climate change, including increasingly severe storms.
Trump, who has promised to “drill, baby drill” for oil in his second term, has withdrawn the US from UN climate bodies, including the UN’s top climate change treaty body, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Trump has also threatened to impose sanctions on diplomats who voted for a levy on polluting shipping fuels at the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

International Monetary Fund says Türkiye’s disinflation program delivering results, growth remains steady
Global organization notes inflation decline on tight policy mix, urges continued fiscal discipline, structural reforms to secure lasting stability
ISTANBUL
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Friday that Türkiye’s disinflation program has shown success, and the current policy mix “continues to balance disinflation with steady growth.”
The IMF Executive Board completed the 2025 Article IV consultation with Türkiye, it said in a statement.
“Since the 2024 Article IV, Türkiye’s disinflation program has shown successes,” said the fund. “Inflation fell from 49.4% (y/y) in September 2024 to 30.9% in December 2025 on the back of strong fiscal consolidation, prudent income policies, and a tight monetary policy stance.”
It noted that following a temporary deceleration in mid-2024, GDP growth has remained strong, with a forecast at 4.1% in 2025. “Turkish Lira demand has strengthened, bolstering international reserves, and the current account deficit remains adequately financed,” it added.
Tight monetary policy expected to support gradual disinflation
“Tight monetary policy, moderate wage growth, and broadly neutral fiscal policy are expected to support gradual disinflation,” it said, emphasizing that the current policy mix continues to balance disinflation with steady growth.
The statement said end-2026 inflation is expected at 23%, as domestic demand remains strong, and boosted by further policy rate cuts and rising confidence, growth is expected at 4.2% for 2026.
It also noted that the current account deficit would “remain adequately financed, while depositor confidence and strong gold prices would allow reserves to stay at around 80 percent of the IMF’s adequacy metric.”
While growth should remain solid and inflation will fall, the IMF said the approach bears risks and costs, noting that external risks remain elevated due to persistent global trade uncertainty and regional conflicts.
“The materialization of an adverse shock, like an increase of energy prices or a negative weather event, could further extend the period of still-high inflation. Moreover, the gradual approach to disinflation has weighed on the financial sector and slowed productivity growth,” the statement said.
Call for ambitious structural reforms
The statement included the executive board’s assessment, praising authorities for significant achievements under the disinflation program, which reduced macroeconomic imbalances, strengthened confidence and preserved strong growth.
Inflation remains well above the target and the economy is highly vulnerable to shocks, the IMF said, underscoring the need for a tighter macroeconomic policy mix and ambitious structural reforms to entrench disinflation, strengthen external buffers and support inclusive medium-term growth.
Authorities were commended for strong fiscal efforts last year, with the IMF urging continued fiscal tightening to reinforce disinflation.
“Directors emphasized the role of measures to broaden the tax base and improve compliance, together with further efforts to streamline expenditures through phasing out energy subsidies,” the statement said.
Directors also called for carefully sequenced and well communicated measures “to minimize second-round inflationary impacts while mitigating the impact on vulnerable households.”
“As fiscal space expands, additional resources could be redirected to social priorities. Directors also supported full alignment of wage policies with inflation targets, as well as stronger oversight of PPPs and SOEs,” the IMF said.
Financial sector remains robust
Directors stressed that the financial sector “remains robust,” supported by the authorities’ swift and effective response to market stress.
They generally urged tighter monetary policy to secure durable disinflation, while emphasizing the need for policy rate decisions should remain data-dependent and mindful of macro-financial effects.
“To bolster policy credibility and strengthen transmission, Directors emphasized the importance of a simplified monetary policy framework firmly centered on the policy rate, with enhanced central bank independence and communication,” the statement noted.
Directors also stressed that continued vigilance is warranted, particularly for still high FX liquidity risks, and supported ongoing efforts to strengthen the supervisory and resolution frameworks along with enhanced oversight, including of crypto assets.
The statement underlined that the directors urged structural reforms to foster productivity, resilience and medium-term growth, with top priorities including “improvements in labor, education, and governance and legal frameworks, support for SMEs, and raising the share of renewables in the energy mix.”
Economic indicators
According to IMF projections, Türkiye’s economy is expected to grow 4.1% in 2027 and 4% annually between 2028 and 2031.
The unemployment rate is forecast at 8.3% in 2026, 8.7% in 2027, and 9.1% during 2028-2031.
Inflation is projected to fall to 19% next year and then ease to 15% through 2031. The current account deficit is expected to equal 1.4% of GDP in 2026-2028 and 1.5% in 2029-2031.

Two dead after alleged car theft and police chase across Sydney
Updated ,first published
Two women are dead after a man who allegedly led police on an hour-long chase across Sydney’s south-west in a stolen vehicle crashed into their car before being arrested at gunpoint.
Police said the pursuit began soon after Luke Francis, 31, allegedly punched a 25-year-old who was filling his red Toyota with fuel at a petrol station on King Georges Road in South Hurstville about 10.20am on Saturday.
The 25-year-old fell to the ground after being struck before Francis allegedly stole his car keys from his pocket as well as his mobile phone, and drove off in the car.
Highway patrol officers in Beverly Hills spotted the car a short time later, and tried to get Francis to pull over. When he did not stop, officers called in more support, including a police helicopter, to chase the car.
The vehicle pursuit was terminated when the Toyota was on the M5 motorway around Bankstown about 10.30am.
NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Brett McFadden said the helicopter continued to track the Toyota as officers considered different strategies to try to stop it.
“I’ve watched the footage … He was driving in what I could describe as one of the most reckless and dangerous demonstrations of driving I’ve seen in a long time,” McFadden said. “He was overtaking vehicles at speed in the breakdown lanes, was crossing onto the incorrect side of the road.”
After evading police for 50 minutes, at the intersection of Remembrance Drive and the Old Hume Highway south of Camden, the Toyota collided with an Alfa Romeo being driven by a 60-year-old woman and carrying an 84-year-old passenger.
“The offending driver has gone up the inside of those vehicles at speed, crossed into the intersection and impacted with another vehicle that had the lawful opportunity to turn right,” McFadden said.
The two people in the Alfa Romeo were treated by police and ambulance paramedics, but both died at the scene.
Francis fled the scene on foot but was arrested at gunpoint by police on Nepean Avenue, Camden.
Francis was charged with a raft of offences, including dangerous driving causing death, driving recklessly, driving unlicensed and assault with intent to take a vehicle. He was refused police bail to appear in court on Sunday.
“This is a tragic set of circumstances. What we do know is that the 60-year-old driver and 84-year-old passenger, both who died at the scene, are part of an extended family … our hearts and thoughts are with that family at this devastating time,” McFadden said.
“The 31-year-old male that is in custody is well known to us, and he is directly responsible for the death of those two women.”
The driver was taken to Campbelltown Hospital for mandatory testing and subsequently taken to Campbelltown police station for further questioning.
Police said they had set up several crime scenes. A critical incident team from Burwood Police Area Command would lead the investigation, supported by the St George Police Area Command and the crash investigation unit.
The investigation will be reviewed by the Professional Standards Command and overseen by the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission.
Police have asked anyone with dashcam footage to provide it to Crime Stoppers.

Investigators search second home in Nancy Guthrie kidnapping case

No arrests after investigators search second home in Nancy Guthrie kidnapping case, sheriff says

Click here to listen to this article - Share via
- Authorities served a search warrant at a Tucson home two miles from Nancy Guthrie’s residence and removed two people as the 13-day kidnapping investigation intensifies.
- Video footage shows an armed man in a balaclava tampering with her doorbell camera at 1:47 a.m. the night she vanished from her home.
- Investigators test gloves and DNA evidence while multiple ransom notes, including one from an alleged impostor, add confusion to the search.
Authorities served a search warrant at a home in Tucson on Friday night in connection with the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, who investigators say was kidnapped from her nearby home 13 days ago, but made no arrests.
Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told 13 News in Tucson the operation was “nothing more than a lead tracked down that led to a search warrant.” Nanos also told Fox News no arrests were made.
A SWAT team converged on a house about two miles from Guthrie’s Arizona residence and removed two people from inside, law enforcement sources told The Times.
A man and a woman complied with orders to exit the home, News Nation reported.
Around midnight, federal agents and sheriff investigators focused their attention on a silver Range Rover SUV parked outside a restaurant about two miles away from the home that was being searched. After taking photographs of the vehicle, agents opened the trunk of the SUV using a tarp to block onlookers view inside the vehicle, video shows.
It is not clear what, if anything, was found.
Investigators got their first major break in the case Tuesday with the release of footage showing an armed man wearing a balaclava, gloves and a backpack approaching the front door of Guthrie’s home and tampering with a Nest camera at 1:47 a.m. the night she was abducted.
Later Tuesday, authorities detained a man at a traffic stop in Rio Rico, a semirural community about 12 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border, in connection with the investigation. Deputies and FBI forensics experts and agents searched his family’s home overnight but did not locate Guthrie. The man was released hours later and has denied any involvement in her disappearance. The Times is not naming him because he has not been arrested or accused of a crime.
Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of “Today” host Savannah Guthrie, was discovered missing Feb. 1 after she didn’t show up to a friend’s house to watch a church service. She was taken from her home without her heart medication, and it’s unclear how long she can survive without it.
A day after Guthrie disappeared, news outlets received identical ransom notes that investigators treated as legitimate. Days later, a note was sent directly to the Guthrie family, allegedly from a man living in Hawthorne, that authorities say was an impostor.
Another ransom note was sent to a television station in Arizona last week.
Sources told The Times that authorities have no proof the person who authored the ransom notes has Guthrie. But they also said the Feb. 2 note felt credible because it included details about a specific damaged piece of property and the placement of an accessory in the home that had not been made public.
On Friday, TMZ said it received a letter from someone claiming to know the identity of the person who abducted Guthrie and demanding the $100,000 FBI reward in bitcoin. The person wrote they don’t trust the FBI, which is why they’re sending the communication through TMZ, the website’s founder, Harvey Levin, told CNN.
“The manhunt of the main individual that can give you all the answers be prepared to go international,” the letter reads, according to Levin.
Authorities have released limited details about other evidence in the case.
However, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said Friday that investigators located several gloves, including some found about two miles from Guthrie’s home, that are being tested.
Authorities also found DNA evidence that does not belong to Guthrie or members of her family at her home. Investigators are working to identify whom the DNA belongs to, according to the sheriff’s department.

University sparks free speech row with proposed ‘campus access’ policy
La Trobe University is facing resistance to a proposed tough “campus access” policy that would give management veto powers over banners, flags and even gazebos.
Students are pledging to fight the policy, arguing that it is aimed at further curtailing pro-Palestinian protests and other activism but will also give the university’s management sweeping powers to shut down any form of expression it finds embarrassing or inconvenient.
The proposed rules would give security guards the right to demand identification from people on university property and march protesters off campus, with lengthy bans potentially imposed by university authorities.
The policy would also give university management veto power over any banners or flags attached to university property and impose an Australian Electoral Commission-style authorisation regime on posters, pamphlets, flyers and other material distributed on campus.
The consultation period for the policy ends on Monday, three weeks before the vast majority of students return to campus from their summer breaks for the start of semester 1.
La Trobe management told this masthead the policy was designed to provide for “reasonable and proportionate action” to be taken against activity that put campus users in danger, obstructed university operations or broke the law, and that much of the policy was not even new.
The university has endured months of bad publicity after one of its key sponsored events, the Bendigo Writers Festival, collapsed after La Trobe, urged on by pro-Israel activists, moved to impose a “code of conduct” on participants at the literary gathering.
University bosses are also embroiled in a bitter dispute with the La Trobe Student Union after trying to establish an alternative student representative council that gave university executives power to hire or fire council members or even bar people from standing for election.
Students for Palestine spokesman Xavier Dupe said the latest developments all pointed to an increasingly authoritarian regime at La Trobe, aimed at shutting down opposition and dissent on campus.
“Clearly, this is an attempt by the university to make it more difficult,” Dupe said. “They want to create an atmosphere where students feel afraid to speak out for fear of repercussions.”
The activist said that another aspect of the policy – mandating official permission for any sort of temporary structure on campus including tents and gazebos – would give management unprecedented control over more aspects of university life.
“Under this policy, you would need permission from the director to set up a table and hand out leaflets, the most basic campus activity,” Dupe said.
“What that means is, unless you get approval from the appropriate director, it would mean the student union could not set up a table to leaflet about students’ rental rights.
“It would mean the National Tertiary Education Union could not set up a table to try to recruit people to the union.
“Even for non-political clubs, it would place a massive burden. You would need permission to do something as simple as set up a table to ask people to join the Islamic Society or the Pakistani Society, or the arts and crafts club.”
The National Tertiary Education Union’s La Trobe representative did not respond to requests for comment.
A university spokesperson defended the proposed policy.
“The draft campus access, premises and facilities policy reflects La Trobe’s commitment to designing, building and maintaining premises that are fit for their intended purpose,” the spokesperson said.
“The draft policy sets out the university’s expectations associated with all those who enter or use our campus premises and facilities.
“The draft policy is intended to provide for reasonable and proportionate action to be taken where any activity or an individual presents an unacceptable health and safety risk, unreasonably disrupts operations or otherwise breaches the law or another university policy.”
The spokesperson said that comments from university staff and students would be considered as part of the consultation process.
“As with all policies, we have actively communicated about the consultation with staff and students and will carefully consider their feedback before the policy is finalised and approved,” the spokesperson said.
“The consultation period reflects that many of the proposed policy features align with existing regulations set out in university statute, as well as existing practice. ”

Law enforcement investigating the disappearance of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie's mother sealed off a road near Nancy Guthrie's home in Arizona late Friday night.
A parade of sheriff’s and FBI vehicles, including forensics vehicles, passed through the roadblock that was set up about 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the house.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department said the activity was part of the Guthrie investigation but declined to detail specifics.
Guthrie, 84, was reported missing on Feb. 1. Authorities say her blood was found on the front porch of her Tucson-area home. Purported ransom notes were sent to news outlets, but two deadlines for paying have passed.

NATO chief says drawing down American troops in Europe to take time

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. The process of reducing the number of the US army units stationed in Europe will not be quick, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in an interview with PBS.
"This will take time because what for the US is crucially important, is that they see the seriousness [of European countries’ intentions to significantly increase defense spending]," he said. The NATO chief emphasized that under US pressure, many countries have already boosted their military budgets, including Germany.
"And yes, it is true the US wants to pivot more towards Asia," he added, explaining that Washington was concerned about a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait.
In 2025, the Pentagon redeployed a brigade from the 101st Airborne Division of the US Army from Romania back to its home base. The troops returned to the state of Kentucky.
At the end of 2025, the US Congress approved a defense budget that explicitly barred the Pentagon from reducing the number of American troops stationed in Europe below 76,000 for more than 45 days.

Creating a culture of kindness in our schools

Creating a culture of kindness in our schools
Bullying in our schoolyards costs the country upwards of $500 million over 13 years of schooling and victims up to eight months of learning.
Today’s report by Emily Kowal on the NSW government’s landmark policy for handling bullying represents a significant shift in the way schools are required to respond to the age-old problem of abuses of power in the playground.
The state’s behaviour expert, Donna Cross, has found that “zero tolerance” policies involving suspension and expulsion are ineffective and harmful.
While the new policy, detailed in The Sun-Herald, takes a broad approach, the notion that a culture of kindness in schools and the rehabilitation of the bully are key to prevention makes sense. The question now is whether the implementation is achievable across the state’s schools, particularly given the training that will be required for already-stressed teachers.
We know that addressing bullying is vital; research has shown that children who are bullied are at much higher risk of developing depression and anxiety in adulthood.
We also know that schools struggle to manage bullying. Often there is a lack of evidence about a specific instance, or the context is not clear, or victims and witnesses are afraid to speak up for fear of being labelled a “snitch”. Too often victims and their families feel like their concerns have been dismissed, or that the bully has escaped with insufficient consequence.
Until now, this confused response has been due to the fact that many schools have lacked a framework to guide their response to difficult questions, such as what level of seriousness should trigger an investigation, who should do the investigating, and how the victim and bully should be managed before anything is proven?
As The Kidman Centre director Rachael Murrihy told the Herald in 2024: “Often there’s two points of trauma. There’s the bullying in the first place and there’s the handling of it by the school. It’s not something that’s intentional, but it’s a significant problem.”
The focus of the NSW government on addressing bullying promptly and in a more holistic fashion is welcome. That schools such as Heritage College, featured today, place as much emphasis on teaching good character as they do on academics is smart; as headmaster Simon Dodson says, not every child is academic, but each one can be a kind person.
Moreover, if less classroom time is spent on misbehaviour, more time can be spent on learning.
The new policy does not prevent bullies from being suspended or expelled – only that those measures will become a last resort. Combining consequences for bullies with behavioural interventions such as counselling and personalised support is in everyone’s interests.
Indeed, it seems superior to the well-trodden path from suspension to expulsion, to being another school’s problem. In the worst outcomes for the perpetrator, the bully falls behind, loses interest in their schooling and is disadvantaged further in life by their childhood behaviour. If their behaviour is not addressed constructively, they may well victimise others.
No policy tweaks, it should be remembered, excuse parents from encouraging kindness in their children. The removal of social media from the screens of under 16s will help with that.
For schools, with the carrot comes a stick. The Sun-Herald welcomes the NSW Education Standards Authority’s threat to remove a school’s accreditation should they not implement the new policy and respond promptly to instances of bullying.
While NESA must ensure its policies strike the right balance between rehabilitating the perpetrator and protecting the victim, the new policy is a welcome refresh. How it works in the real world is something that will be worth watching, for all of our children’s sake.

Budget impasse shuts down US Department of Homeland Security

Budget impasse partially shuts down US Department of Homeland Security
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) entered a partial shutdown on Feb 14 as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.
At the centre of the budget dispute is the department’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, whose agents killed two US citizens
The Democrats oppose any new funding for the DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.
In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.
“Donald Trump and the Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on Feb 13.
“Dramatic changes are needed,” Mr Jeffries told a news conference. “Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government.”
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that “Democrats are barrelling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons”.
But while the DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in the 2025 government spending Bill.
Senator John Fetterman pushed against his fellow Democrats, saying: “This shutdown literally has zero impact on ICE.”
The primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters.
The Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait times and cancelled flights.
Negotiations stalled
The shutdown would be the third of Mr Trump’s second term, including a record 43-day government closure in October and November 2025
The government had just reopened from a smaller, four-day partial shutdown earlier in February
Even if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the body’s 100 members to advance the budget Bill, meaning several Democrats would need to get on board.
In response to the Democrats’ demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate over immigration enforcement policy.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune called it “an extremely serious offer”, but warned that the Democrats are “never going to get their full wish list”.
Some concessions were made during the previous shutdown amid Democratic pressure and national outcry after federal agents shot and killed Ms Renee Good
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents in the city would wear body cameras “effective immediately” in a move that would be later “expanded nationwide”.
The Senate went into recess for a week starting Feb 12, but senators could be recalled to Washington in case of a rapid leap in negotiations. For the moment, however, talks between the White House and Democrats appear to be at a standstill. AFP

The United States and Iran are expected to hold a second round of nuclear talks in Geneva next Tuesday as both sides seek a diplomatic path to avert conflict, according to U.S. and other sources familiar with the planning.
President Donald Trump has expressed a preference for a negotiated solution but has simultaneously ordered a significant U.S. military buildup in the Middle East, including the deployment of a second aircraft carrier strike group.
The US delegation in Geneva will include senior adviser Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, while Iran’s delegation is expected to be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi. Oman’s foreign minister, who has been mediating between the parties, is also expected to attend.
Trump told reporters that any deal must include Iran’s commitment to zero uranium enrichment, a core demand that has so far complicated negotiations.
Behind the scenes, U.S. officials have been relaying messages through mediators to Tehran in the lead-up to the Geneva talks, an indication of intense diplomatic activity even as the threat of military action looms.

US’ Rubio, German chancellor discuss Ukraine, NATO, supply chains in Munich
Meeting comes on sidelines of Munich Security Conference, where Rubio, Merz discussed 'pressing global challenges,' says State Department
WASHINGTON
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio met Friday with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Munich, where they discussed efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war and deepen the partnership between their countries, according to the US State Department.
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
Rubio and Merz discussed “pressing global challenges,” including securing supply chains, advancing efforts to end the Russia-Ukraine war and reinforcing the US-Europe partnership, according to the US State Department.
Rubio expressed appreciation for Germany’s support for Ukraine, noting that Berlin has provided more than $76 billion in assistance since 2022. The pair also discussed continued coordination on Ukraine’s reconstruction, said the State Department.
A German government source said the situation in Ukraine and the status of negotiations with Russia were central to the talks, along with continued military support for Kyiv, "particularly military aid."
The leaders also addressed NATO and Europe’s role within the alliance, with Rubio commending Germany’s efforts to strengthen it.
Merz and Rubio exchanged views on developments in the Middle East, particularly Iran, and discussed trade policy and the situation in East Asia ahead of the chancellor’s trip to China, the source added.

Partial government shutdown looms over US Homeland Security Department

Partial government shutdown looms over US Homeland Security Department
Lawmakers in House, Senate left Washington without funding deal
WASHINGTON
The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) faces a partial government shutdown after Congress failed to approve funding for the agency by a deadline Friday.
DHS is now the only federal agency without funding for the remainder of fiscal year 2026, which continues through Sept. 30, while lawmakers have already approved spending bills covering the rest of the government since the record-long shutdown ended in November.
The latest funding measure, passed at the end of January, provided DHS with a two-week extension to allow Congress additional time to negotiate changes to the agency’s immigration enforcement practices -- a stipulation pushed by Senate Democrats following the killing of two Americans by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in the state of Minnesota in January.
On Thursday, the upper chamber failed to advance a measure to fund the department and lawmakers in both chambers left Washington without any deal.
A total of 16 agencies fall under DHS, including the Coast Guard, FEMA and the US Secret Service. Two of the agencies that have stoked Democratic furor amid President Donald Trump's migrant crackdown -- ICE and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) -- are unlikely to suffer any major operational effects from a partial shutdown.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters that "dramatic changes" are needed at the DHS in terms of ICE and CBP.
"ICE needs to be dramatically reformed. Period. Full stop," Jeffries stressed.
When asked if the Democrats want a direct meeting with Trump to try to close the deal, Jeffries said they have not called for a direct meeting "at this point."
"But again, we're ready to sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace, if they are serious about the types of dramatic reforms that are necessary to get ICE under control," he said.
Democrats and Republicans have been discussing potential changes to ICE and CBP, but so far, the two parties have not reached a consensus.
Trump said Friday that negotiations with the Democrats are progressing on a funding agreement for the department.
“We’ll see what happens. We always have to protect our law enforcement. They have done a great job,” Trump told reporters.
Democrats have insisted on stronger oversight and tighter limits on immigration enforcement -- including banning the use of masks by officers, requiring body cameras to remain on, and mandating visible identification -- as a condition for supporting the funding bill.
"I know what they want; I know what they can live with," Trump said, adding that Democrats "have gone crazy. They're radical left lunatics. That's why their cities are so unsafe."

These examples of classic modernist architecture are where, exactly?

These examples of classic modernist architecture are where, exactly?
The enclave of classic Australian modernist architecture is so well hidden that some long-time residents might not even know it exists.
Yet, this is no ritzy Melbourne cul-de-sac or CBD development, but a quiet residential court in Wangaratta, north-east Victoria. Despite the understated location, these architectural gems reflect a crucial part of the town’s history.
After World War II, Wangaratta was experiencing an industrial boom driven partly by textile manufacturing.
One company driving that economic expansion was Bruck Mills, which built a factory for textile production as well as housing and accommodation for workers and visitors.
In the mid-1950s, the company commissioned the firm Grounds, Romberg & Boyd, in which acclaimed Australian architect Robin Boyd was a partner, to design three single-storey staff houses, a caretaker’s cottage and a double-storey accommodation and entertainment facility.
Robin Boyd’s designs have become synonymous with his distinctive Australian modernist style, which included “window walls”, integration with the natural environment and clever use of indoor space in both compact and large houses. The Wangaratta buildings were completed about 1954.
But now residents of Bruck Court and the Robin Boyd Foundation are aghast at plans to demolish the caretaker’s cottage as part of a residential development proposed by Australian Textile Mills, which owns the factory. Australian Textile Mills also owns the caretaker’s cottage and the double-storey building known as Bruck House.
The company argues the cottage is dilapidated and the proposed development will preserve the enclave’s historic purpose of providing worker accommodation.
In December, Wangaratta Council approved Australian Textile Mills’ application to demolish the cottage, build seven dwellings for worker accommodation and subdivide the land into two lots.
While the company owns the cottage and Bruck House, the neighbouring houses are now privately owned.
The Robin Boyd Foundation urged Heritage Council Victoria to intervene. It subsequently issued a 60-day interim protection order, which expires on March 1.
HCV will then make a recommendation on whether the buildings should be added to the Victorian Heritage Register. The buildings are currently only covered by Wangaratta Council’s heritage overlay.
Chris Spencer moved to Wangaratta 16 years ago to work for Bruck Textiles and moved into one of the homes designed by Boyd’s architecture firm. She bought the home from Bruck about three years later.
“I love the history of the place, and it’s a great little house,” she said.
Spencer wants the properties heritage listed even though that would ultimately place limits on what she could do with her house.
“I’m happy for that to happen,” she said. “I think it’s important to preserve something that’s done by renowned architect Robin Boyd.”
Spencer said the design worked well for her lifestyle.
“It’s a small house, but it’s compact. It’s got everything I need, and it just works.”
A report by heritage consultant Deborah Kemp described Boyd as Australia’s most influential mid-century voice within the architecture profession.
She said the Bruck Mill complex was an experiment in urban planning where Boyd sought to demonstrate how to develop a medium-density housing cluster in contrast with the standard freestanding house on a quarter-acre block.
“Boyd was clearly an innovator and, with this development at Bruck Court, was experimenting with a planned urban environment,” the report said.
The designs for the three single-storey staff houses and caretaker’s cottage reflected Boyd’s early modernist architectural ideals, the report observed.
“This includes largely modular buildings with the simple rectangular forms and flat roofs.”
Kemp’s report described the Wangaratta buildings as a rare surviving example of the modernist aesthetic Boyd developed during the 1950s.
Architect Steven Bishop, who represents property owner Philip Bart, said Australian Textile Mills was a major employer in Wangaratta. He argued the caretaker’s cottage was dilapidated and had been “significantly altered over the years”.
“Although the Bruck House is attributed to Boyd himself, we are fairly sure that the caretaker’s cottage, which came later, was done by his firm and not him,” Bishop said.
He said the proposed development would support the mill’s viability by providing accommodation for specialist workers.
If Heritage Council Victoria recommends retaining the caretaker’s cottage, Bishop said it would put the mill’s viability at risk: “Without consent, the project and the existing buildings on site will stall, and will likely fall further into disrepair.”
Wangaratta Council did not respond to The Age’s request for comment, but in a report to councillors noted there were conflicting opinions about the proposed demolition and development.
Robin Boyd Foundation chair Tony Isaacson lodged the application with Heritage Council Victoria hoping to gain protection for all the buildings designed by Boyd’s firm in Bruck Court.
Isaacson argued the houses in the court were excellent examples of Boyd design that should be protected both in their own right and as part of a cohesive group.
“This opportunity to bring the group together is what’s so special,” he said. “The individual buildings are as good as any in Australia of their type.”

The moment Claremont socialites almost came to blows in parking spot row

The moment Claremont socialites almost came to blows in parking spot row
The usually quiet streets of Claremont – an affluent and leafy suburb between the coast and the river in Perth’s west – were filled, if briefly, by an almighty yelling.
Two neighbours, both well-to-do professions, were close to blows outside their million-dollar strata complex in a row over a parking spot.
It was the culmination of a months-long argument that ended with one woman waving a knife, or a ruler – depending on who you asked – at the other.
West Australian architect Louise St John Kennedy, 74, was arrested and charged by police after the incident in May 2024 during which it was claimed she assaulted her 81-year-old neighbour, rheumatologist Dr Prudence Manners.
The protracted trial revealed a months-long dispute between the women that played out in text messages and ended in the driveway confrontation.
Now, with Kennedy found not guilty of being armed or pretending to be armed in a way that may cause fear and common assault, footage of the confrontation and heated messages between the pair were release by the court this week.
Shared driveway sparks strata stand-off
The saga began when Manners moved into the Chester Road property at the start of 2024 – a property that award-winning architect Kennedy had designed herself.
Kennedy later sold off four of the $2 million homes and kept one for herself and subsequently helped draw up the property’s strata by-laws.
One of them was about parking on a shared driveway and a sign was erected to the effect.
But Manners repeatedly parked in the no-go area, irking her neighbours – or at least, one neighbour in particular.
The first time Kennedy asked her politely to move the car was in February 2024.
During the following month, Manners had blocked the driveway five more times and messages showed that while it was clear Kennedy was becoming exasperated at being unable to use her car, she did try and strike up a friendship to smooth things over.
Still, the older lady kept parking in the no-go zone.
After one text exchange between the women, the doctor offered to show the architect how to back her vehicle out around her car.
Kennedy declined the driving lesson and told Manners she was missing the point before Manners went on to again park illegally, and then told Kennedy the car had a flat battery and couldn’t be moved until help arrived.
“Prue, after numerous polite requests for you to not park in the signed No Parking body corp area I’m again blocked in by your thoughtless parking,” Manners wrote in the days before the pair came to blows.
“Are you completely stupid or just incredibly thoughtless or both.
“Stop saying there’s room to get around a parked car and use your common sense and understand why that is both wrong and ignorant … and very f---ing frustrating.
“It is NO PARKING. This is my very last warning. Take this seriously. Louise.”
A vet trip sparks a confrontation that ends up in court
Days later, Kennedy needed to get her sick dog to the vet in an emergency but couldn’t get out of the driveway due to Manners’ parking.
What happened next was caught on camera by a neighbour.
Kennedy can be heard raging at the 81-year-old, saying: “Move your car you f---ing dumb bitch.”
She was also seen waving something around in her hand. Kennedy said it was an architect’s angle-finder ruler. Manners claimed it was a large kitchen knife.
Manners also alleged Kennedy grabbed her around the neck and pushed her, which was not caught on camera.
In response, Kennedy claims Manners shouted to her, “hope the dog dies, Louise”, which led her to “momentarily lose control”.
She admitted yelling profanities but was adamant she did not hit the woman and was never holding a knife.
Despite that she was charged with being armed or pretending to be armed in a way that may cause fear and common assault, which she pleaded not guilty to and represented herself in a drawn-out trial that began at the end of 2024 and ended last week in Perth Magistrates Court.
Kennedy was exonerated with a not guilty verdict.
Magistrate Lynette Dias called the doctor’s text messages “gaslighting” and said her 74-year-old neighbour momentarily lost self-control in a “final straw” event.
Dias said the architect had been “provoked” and that she saw no evidence of a knife being used in the argument.
She added that the doctor was “not a reliable witness”, as she had given contradictory evidence and at one point had to review courtroom footage as claims were made that she was being “coached” on the witness stand by her daughter.
After the not-guilty verdict, Kennedy said she would also be fighting a restraining order the older woman had placed on her.
“I was always confident of my side of the story and that justice would be done once that came out, and it was,” Kennedy told 9News Perth.
But Kennedy claims that, despite intervention from the police and the court, Manners continues to block the pair’s shared driveway.
“We’ve all been through a difficult process, Dr Manners, her family, and I hope we’ve got it in our hearts that we can live together peacefully now,” Kennedy said.

Bangladesh PM-in-waiting Rahman appeals for unity as BNP sweeps polls
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus congratulates Tarique Rahman for ‘the landslide victory of his party’.
Bangladesh’s prime minister-in-waiting Tarique Rahman has appealed for unity in the country and dedicated his sweeping win to those who “sacrificed for democracy”, as his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won with a thumping majority in the recently-concluded parliamentary elections.
“Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said on Saturday in his first speech since the election.

“I firmly believe that national unity is a collective strength, while division is a weakness.”
The Bangladesh Election Commission published a gazette of the newly-elected members of parliament, showing the official results of the landmark election held on Thursday.
The BNP alliance won 212 seats out of the 299 parliamentary seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.
The National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Sheikh Hasina and part of a Jamaat-led alliance, won just six of the 30 seats it contested, highlighting the difficulty of converting protest momentum into electoral support.
Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus earlier congratulated Rahman for “the landslide victory of his party” as he prepared to step down and hand over power to an elected government.
The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”.
The opposition Jamaat-e-Islami party has also issued a statement, saying it had accepted the “overall outcome” of the election won by the rival nationalist party, despite having alleged problems with the vote count.
“We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law,” Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman said in a statement.
Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had initially alleged “inconsistencies and fabrications” in the vote, but earlier on Saturday, he conceded, and said he would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.
Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part.
Late on Friday, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated the BNP, Rahman and “the people of Bangladesh” following the polls.
“The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote on X.
The success of Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in the United Kingdom, far from Dhaka’s political storms.
His father, former President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.
“Freedom-loving pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” he added, in an initial speech in English, before switching to Bangla.
“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy, this victory belongs to people who aspired to and have sacrificed for democracy,” he said.

Havana refinery fire under control amid deepening Cuban fuel crisis

A fire broke out at a refinery at the port in Cuba's capital, but was soon brought under control, authorities have said, as the island nation struggles under what amounts to a US oil blockade.
A massive plume of smoke rose from the Nico Lopez refinery in Havana Bay on Friday, though it quickly subsided.
The ministry of energy and mines said the fire, which broke out in one of the refinery's warehouses, had been brought under control.
"The cause is under investigation," the ministry said in a post on X.
The fire occurred not far from where two oil tankers were moored. Two Mexican navy ships arrived at the same harbor on Thursday with more than 800 tonnes of much-needed humanitarian aid.
‘No more Venezuelan oil would go to Cuba’
Cuba has risked being plunged into darkness since US President Donald Trump vowed to starve the country of oil.
The Caribbean country of 9.6 million inhabitants lost its main oil supply line when Trump last month ordered the abduction of Nicolas Maduro, the long-term leader of Cuban ally Venezuela.
Trump said no more Venezuelan oil would go to Cuba, and also threatened tariffs for any other country stepping in with crude supplies.
The island, under a US trade embargo since 1962, has for years been mired in a severe economic crisis marked by extended power cuts and shortages of fuel, medicine and food.
Reducing school hours, working days
No foreign fuel or oil tanker has arrived in Cuba in weeks, experts in maritime transport tracking have said.
Emergency measures kicked in this week to conserve Cuba's fast-dwindling fuel stocks. The government shuttered universities, reduced school hours and the work week, and slashed public transport as it limited fuel sales.
Staffing at hospitals was also cut back.
The United Nations said on Friday it was deeply alarmed by the crisis unfolding in Cuba.

Officials urge rethinking Sahel strategy at Munich conference
US, European, West African officials want shift from security-first policies to political, economic engagement
BAMAKO, Mali
Western counterterrorism policy in the Sahel has failed and must shift toward governance and economic development, officials said Friday at a panel on reengagement with the region during the Munich Security Conference.
US Rep. Sara Jacobs said a security-first approach during the past 25 years had not worked. “What we are seeing is a real failure of the United States and the West counter terrorism policy,” she said, arguing that focusing narrowly on security had worsened governance and economic challenges.
EU Special Representative for the Sahel João Gomes Cravinho said the bloc’s foreign ministers had adopted a renewed strategy centered on political and diplomatic engagement, human security and socio-economic resilience. “We need to be a lot better at listening,” he said, stressing the need to rebuild trust and address community-based justice, basic services and employment.
Mauritania’s defense minister Ould Sidi Hanana described the Sahel crisis as primarily economic, with security, political and climate dimensions. Sierra Leone President Julius Maada Wonie Bio, chair of the West African ECOWAS bloc, called for regional dialogue and practical engagement with Sahel neighbors, warning against “the older way of doing things.”
Participants said rebuilding trust would require closer consultation with Sahel governments, amid tensions over security strategies, trafficking and political disagreements.

Trump pushes for voter ID mandate ahead of midterms
'There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!' president says
WASHINGTON
US President Donald Trump said Friday that voter identification rules will be in place for the November midterm elections regardless of whether Congress signs off on them.
"There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" Trump wrote on Truth Social.
Trump also criticized congressional Democrats for election policy, accusing them of opposing voter identification and citizenship verification requirements.
"The reason is very simple — They want to continue to cheat in Elections," he said, without providing evidence.
The president added that he has explored new legal arguments to justify imposing voter identification requirements, even without congressional approval.
Trump also called for proof of US citizenship to vote and said mail-in ballots should be eliminated, with limited exceptions for military service members, voters with disabilities, illness or those traveling.
In a separate post, Trump signaled he may pursue executive action if Congress does not act.
"We cannot let the Democrats get away with no voter ID any longer ... If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this scam is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order," he said.

Savvy Hongkongers book 9-day Lunar New Year break for festive trips across Asia
Immigration Department earlier forecast number of trips by residents and visitors alike would reach 11.38 million between February 14 and 23
Travellers, including families with children and elderly relatives, gathered at check-in counters at Hong Kong International Airport in the morning as the city marked Valentine’s Day and prepared to ring in the Year of the Horse.
In an announcement, airport staff urged travellers to proceed to immigration counters as soon as possible after checking in, noting that “a large number” of passengers were expected to depart the city.
The Immigration Department earlier said it expected the number of trips by residents and visitors alike would reach 11.38 million between Saturday and February 23, an increase of 16 per cent from the previous Lunar New Year period.
Department figures showed that 506,940 residents had left Hong Kong by 9pm on Saturday, with 59,626 departing via the airport. Meanwhile, 141,908 mainland visitors had entered Hong Kong, with the West Kowloon high-speed rail terminus accounting for 30,053 – the most among all border control points.

This Sydney school has eliminated bullying. Now there’s a plan for every classroom

This Sydney school has eliminated bullying. Now there’s a plan for every classroom
Bullied students would be given personalised safety plans that could include more supervision and their own “safe zone”, such as a library, under new bullying rules to be rolled out across all NSW schools next year.
Schools must prioritise student wellbeing, explicitly teach kindness, respect and inclusion, and counsel bullies rather than simply punishing them. Every incident must be recorded and responded to within two days, and all unkind behaviour must be addressed.
Schools will need a triage system that categorises bullying incidents into low, medium or high risk based on factors such as physical harm, emotional impact and recurrence. Each triggers a specific response, from counselling to external referrals.
The government-issued advice to public, private and Catholic schools is designed to help schools align their policies with an anti-bullying framework, with which every school must comply by 2027 or risk deregistration.
The new rules follow a 2024 directive from Education Minister Prue Car to the state’s school regulator to work with the education department, Catholic, and independent schools to develop an evidence-based, best-practice model to combat bullying.
A study of more than 20 countries found Australian students were among the most exposed to bullying, with nearly one in five saying others had made fun of them, and one in 10 saying they had been deliberately excluded.
The guidelines call for schools to use a range of techniques, including anonymously surveying students about their experiences, inviting children to help design anti-bullying campaigns, and classroom behaviour rules.
Teachers have been told to refrain from using labels such as “bully” or “victim” when dealing with incidents, and to teach students who bully others alternative ways to express emotions, resolve conflict and build relationships.
Teachers should “use guided discussions to help students who bully others to understand the impact of their actions and commit to change”, the guidelines say.
They recommend selecting students to become “cyber safety ambassadors” to promote respectful online behaviour, and they also suggest that teachers encourage students to “create videos, podcasts or social media content that showcase positive digital behaviour and promote anti-bullying messages”.
Students will be taught to support their classmates and alert staff when someone seems distressed or isolated; acts of kindness are to be publicly celebrated.
Teachers should be trained to explicitly teach skills such as empathy, emotional regulation, conflict resolution and responsible decision-making. They should also receive data analysis training to “interpret bullying data, recognise trends and understand how to respond strategically”.
The guidelines call for schools to develop personalised safety plans for victims, including additional supervision, safe zones and trusted adult contacts to ensure the children feel secure during and after school hours.
The framework is underpinned by research conducted by NSW behavioural expert Professor Donna Cross, who found “zero tolerance” policies that involve suspension and expulsion to be ineffective and potentially harmful.
Her research has also found that NSW public students who reported being bullied in the year before NAPLAN lost up to eight months of learning in literacy and numeracy.
“A zero tolerance policy as a blanket policy shows no care for children who engage in bullying,” she said. “If we don’t respond and teach them in a learning environment, which is what schools are, how to behave different, the evidence demonstrates that behaviour will continue.
“It will continue to the workforce, it will continue in their families. Those children as parents will have children who bully.”
Instead, Cross said that schools should work to rehabilitate bullies, offering them counselling and support to address the underlying motivation for their behaviour. Suspension and expulsion should be used only as a last resort.
“What the new guideline is doing is really helping the schools to be more bespoke and tailored in the way that they address bullying,” Cross said. “The anti‑bullying guidelines are really guardrails to say: here are the things that will make the most difference.”
At Lake Macquarie’s Heritage College, every day begins with a short assembly on a weekly virtue and college principal Simon Dodson says that teaching students how to be a good human must be a school’s primary objective.
“We put character education in the first order of importance,” Dodson said. “Not everyone’s going to succeed academically ... but everyone needs to become a good person.”
Dodson draws a line between bad behaviour – a one-off insult or cruel comment, which still requires correction – and bullying, which is a repeated abuse of power. “Bullying can be eradicated … if everyone has a place and everyone’s valued and belongs,” he said.
Hurstville Public School – which meets the new mandatory criteria – has invested in a wellbeing hub and sensory play space. There are three part-time youth workers who attend the school each day, acting as an on-call support worker.
Support worker Eman Roumieh said prevention has made the biggest difference. “We’ve never reached suspension, which is fantastic to hear, but because of the whole preventative work that we do.”

Denmark, Greenland prime ministers meet US secretary of state in Munich
Danish prime minister describes 'constructive' meeting with Rubio, says they will continue as agreed in high-level working group
ANKARA
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen met Friday with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany.
Copenhagen said Frederiksen and Nielsen held talks with Rubio as part of the annual gathering in Munich.
“Constructive talk with Secretary of State Marco Rubio together with Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Chairman of Naalakkersuisut, at the Munich Security Conference. Work will continue as agreed in the high-level working group,” Frederiksen wrote on the US social media company X.
The talks follow a Jan. 14 meeting in Washington between Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen, Greenland’s Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt, US Vice President JD Vance, and Rubio.
During that meeting, officials discussed US President Donald Trump’s interest in Greenland because of its strategic Arctic location, rich mineral resources and concerns about increasing Russian and Chinese influence in the region.
Denmark and Greenland have rejected proposals to sell the territory, reaffirming Danish sovereignty over the island.
Critics said Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland threatens to tear apart NATO, which would be a boon for Russian and Chinese strategic interests. They added that the US could easily defend Greenland from outside threats by using existing treaties allowing numerous US bases and forces on the island.

Medals distributed in 6 disciplines on day 7 of 2026 Winter Olympics
Athletes medal in cross-country skiing, biathlon, speed skating, snowboard, skeleton, figure skating
ISTANBUL
Medals were claimed Friday in six disciplines at the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics.
On the seventh day of the Games in Italy, seven medal events took place -- biathlon, cross-country skiing, figure skating, skeleton, snowboard and speed skating.
Norwegian Johannes Hoesflot Klaebo left his rivals behind in the men’s 10-kilometer freestyle cross-country race in a time of 20 minutes, 36.2 seconds, winning his third medal at the Games and his eighth Olympic gold.
Klaebo tied the record for the most Winter Olympic golds held by Norwegian skiers Marit Bjorgen, Ole Einar Bjorndalen and Bjorn Daehlie.
French athlete Mathis Desloges won silver and Norwegian Einar Hedegart took bronze.
In the men’s 10-kilometer sprint biathlon, gold went to Frenchman Quentin Fillon-Maillet. Norwegian athletes completed the podium, with Vetle Sjaastad Christiansen taking silver and Sturla Holm Laegreid winning bronze.
In the men’s 10,000 meters speed skating, Czech skater Metodej Jilek won gold. Polish athlete Vladimir Semirunniy earned silver, while Dutchman Jorrit Bergsma took bronze.
In women’s snowboard cross, Australian Josie Baff claimed her first Olympic title by finishing ahead of her rivals in the final. Czech Eva Adamczykova won silver and Italian Michela Moioli took bronze.
In the men’s snowboard halfpipe, Japan’s Yuto Totsuka scored 95 points to win gold. Australian Scotty James earned silver and fellow Japanese Ryusei Yamada took bronze.
Great Britain’s Matt Weston captured gold in the men’s skeleton. German athletes completed the podium, with Axel Jungk winning silver and Beijing 2022 champion Christopher Grotheer taking bronze.
The last medals of the day were awarded in the men’s figure skating event. Kazakh skater Mikhail Shaidorov claimed the gold medal. Japanese skaters Yuma Kagiyama and Shun Sato won silver and bronze, respectively.
Curling and ice hockey competitions were also held.

Milan Cortina’s wide footprint reshapes the Olympic experience
The Milan Cortina Winter Olympics stretch across northern Italy, and the long travel times are reshaping the experience for athletes and fans
- Bookmark
The head of Haiti's ski federation, Thierry Montiller, spent over four hours driving mountain roads from Bormio, near the Swiss border, where his downhill skier is competing in the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, to Tesero in Val di Fiemme for his cross-country skier’s 10-kilometer race on Friday.
And he's headed back to Bormio on Saturday, another 220 kilometers (140 miles), for the giant slalom race.
“Yes, it is a major difficulty to have such distances,’’ he said.
Winter Olympics have often had city and mountain clusters, but these Games spread the mountain clusters over a much wider area, and the distance to the city is considerably farther. In total, competitions are taking place in a 22,000 square kilometer (8,500 square mile) swath of northern Italy, making this the most spread-out in Winter Games history.
Reviews so far are mixed and, at very least, this model will take some getting used to. There are advantages: avoiding massive public investment in venues that get little use after the Games; easier access for locals; and distributing tourists' dollars across the region. Still, after the first week, it seems that not everyone is a fan.
Bob Grover came from Portland, Oregon, to stay in Cortina for two weeks. He remembers going to the 2010 Games, where all the Alpine events were in Whistler and ice events in Vancouver — less than two hours apart. Not so in the Alps, where downhill sports are at different locations.
"It’s like, why isn’t it all in Cortina?" said Grover, 64, who owns a landscaping business. “Maybe they split it up so more of Italy could get the benefit. I understand the economic impact of that, so I won’t complain. But I’d like to go to more events.”
His wife, Theresa Kirsch, 63, lamented that the tradition of male downhill skiers cheering on their female teammates, and vice versa, in these Games would entail an 8-hour round-trip drive.
U.S. snowboarder Red Gerard had 11 days between his first two days of Olympic competition and was eager for a change of scenery. His sister arranged a celebratory meal with a Michelin-starred chef for 55 people in his extended family and guests, but it meant driving 3 1/2 hours to Milan, where they spent a couple of days, before returning to Livigno “to put his game face on.”
“Sometimes, I wish I was in Milan,’’ said Gerard. “It’s just a little harder to get the full Olympic experience. … It just takes a little more work.’’
A chance to embrace the open road
The Olympic universe better get used to this model, because that’s the way it will be going forward.
The 2030 Winter Games will hold snow events in the Alps, the closing ceremony in Nice and speed-skating abroad. The 2034 Games will be in Utah, as opposed to Salt Lake City in 2002, when the medals plaza was held in the state capital each evening. The 2038 Winter Games will span the entire nation of Switzerland, without city anchors.
For some fans, the dispersion of venues has proven an opportunity to get on the road and see off-the-beaten-path locations in a country where, in many places, overtourism has become a problem. That's especially true if money or time (or both) are of little concern.
Tyler Thostenson, 36, and his mother expect to spend up to $20,000 for their 12-day itinerary from Milan to Livigno, stopping for lunch in St. Moritz, Switzerland, before winding their way to Cortina for curling. Next stop: Milan, for speed skating and U.S. men’s hockey.
This is their fourth Olympics. While the 2014 Sochi Games and 2018 PyeongChang Olympics provided single mountain clusters, they have embraced the Milan Cortina adventure.
“We’re lucky that we have a rental car, so we can actually stop in some of the smaller villages, and not just look out of a frosted-up bus window or train. It’s been nice to explore more of the countryside,’’ Thostenson said.
International Olympic Committee President Kirsty Coventry praised the model on Friday, after spending two days in Cortina d’Ampezzo, where she saw Italian standout Federica Brignone win a gold medal in the super-G.
“Yes, it’s a little spread out, but the feeling of the Games is for me very magical,’’ Coventry told reporters in Milan. She acknowledged that the 400-kilometer (250-mile) drive to the Dolomites “wasn’t the most comfortable, right? But it was fun."
An Olympic heart
Unlike in other games, there isn't a geographic emotional center to the 2026 Winter Games in either Cortina and Milan, since both serve as anchors to five other venues.
In Milan, where venues are spread along the city’s outskirts and suburbs, the Leonardo da Vinci-inspired Olympic cauldron is the closest thing to a heart for the 2026 Games. It has become a gathering place for sporting fans and curiosity-seeking locals alike; they gather each night not to see sports, but rather a sound-and-light show against the backdrop of a Napoleonic arch.
But there's been an unexpected benefit: in past Olympic Games, that center has been the plaza where medals were distributed at the end of the day. Since the distances make bringing everyone together impossible, instead, spectators have been granted instant emotional payoff: medal ceremonies immediately after each event.
Kathy McCabe saw the U.S. figure skating team receive its gold medals on Sunday after a thrilling competition at the Assago skating arena. At the 2006 Games, she saw Shaun White win gold in the halfpipe, but not the medal draped over his chest.
“There was a lot more emotion to see the medal ceremony just a few minutes after the Americans won, and to see that raw emotion,’’ said McCabe, producer of the PBS series Dream of Italy. “It was really close and there were some beautiful performances.”
That snow events are held in several mountain towns means athletes, including South African cross-country skier Matt Smith, are removed from the Olympic glitz and happy to have that peace. He appreciates the intimacy in the 1,000-person village of Predazzo.
“I have gained a pukka Olympic experience, and I’m very grateful for it,’’ said Smith, using British slang for “amazing.”

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Trade between BRICS member states is growing at a significantly higher rate than the overall pace of global trade, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.
"Statistics show that trade growth among BRICS countries significantly exceeds both the overall growth rate of global trade and the trade growth between BRICS members and other partners," the diplomat noted.
According to Ryabkov, "this is simply an indication that BRICS - without being some kind of ‘magic wand’ - can truly help address challenges." "We need to expand this potential, and there is the political will to do so," he added.

Could BNP’s landslide win open a new geopolitical chapter for Bangladesh?
Tarique Rahman’s decisive victory may redraw regional alignments after years of pro-India policy under ousted PM Sheikh Hasina.
Islamabad, Pakistan – The Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s (BNP) commanding victory in Bangladesh’s parliamentary election marks not only a political watershed for the South Asian nation, but also a potential recalibration of regional power dynamics across India, Pakistan and China.
The Election Commission has published the gazette of the members of parliament elected, a final official seal on the election process on Saturday.

Initial results published on Friday by the Election Commission gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 out of 299 parliamentary seats, while the opposition Jamaat-e-Islami and its allies won 77 seats.
Tarique Rahman’s party has delivered what observers described as Bangladesh’s first genuinely competitive election in nearly two decades.
The country marked a decisive break from the Sheikh Hasina era and signalled the beginning of what analysts call a “paradigm shift” in Dhaka’s foreign policy orientation.
Soon after the results were announced, the prime ministers of both India and Pakistan congratulated 60-year-old Rahman for a decisive win.
Delwar Hossain, professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, described the election outcome as “a new turning point in crafting bilateral relations with India and Pakistan”.
“The new government may bring about a policy framework with clarity of purpose and effective implementation strategies,” Hossain told Al Jazeera. “The continuing India-Pakistan hostility and China-India rivalry may remain critical determinants of Bangladesh’s foreign policy moves in its neighbourhood.”
Will India ties be reset?
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted his congratulations to Rahman on X on Friday, following it up with a phone call hours later.
“India will continue to stand in support of a democratic, progressive and inclusive Bangladesh,” Modi wrote, adding that Rahman’s win “shows the trust of the people of Bangladesh in your leadership.”
In another post, Modi said he spoke with Rahman over the phone to convey his wishes.
“As two close neighbours with deep-rooted historical and cultural ties, I reaffirmed India’s continued commitment to the peace, progress, and prosperity of both our peoples,” he said.
New Delhi had cultivated close ties with Hasina’s government, viewing Bangladesh as a crucial partner as regional powers India and China competed for influence in South Asia.
But since a mass uprising in 2024 toppled Hasina’s authoritarian government and forced her into exile in India, relations between New Delhi and Dhaka plunged to historic lows, marked by recriminations, trade restrictions and India’s refusal to extradite Hasina despite a death sentence handed down by Bangladesh’s International Crimes Tribunal over her handling of the deadly 2024 protests.
Yet, India began adjusting to a new political reality in post-Hasina Bangladesh. Earlier this year, Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar attended the funeral of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, whose son Rahman is set to be the next Bangladeshi prime minister.
“India has experience dealing with BNP-led political regimes in the past,” Hossain said. “India has demonstrated its eagerness to work with the future BNP government. Now that the elections are over, that has become a reality.”
Asif Bin Ali, a geopolitical analyst at Georgia State University, said an elected government in Bangladesh would have “strong incentives to move back to a working relationship with India, even if it cannot and should not reproduce the level of political closeness seen under Sheikh Hasina”.
“I expect a more cautious middle position that stresses mutual respect, reciprocal sovereignty and noninterference in each other’s domestic politics, while keeping space for Dhaka’s own strategic autonomy,” Ali told Al Jazeera.
Still, major irritants persist besides Hasina – the unresolved water sharing disputes over rivers such as Teesta, deadly border shootings by Indian forces and a large trade deficit in India’s favour.
The new government will also face pressure at home to adopt a firmer tone towards New Delhi, particularly amid anti-India sentiment among a large section of Bangladeshi youth, who allege “excessive Indian interference” in the country’s internal affairs.
Saleh Shahriar of North South University in Dhaka questioned how far the BNP would go in its dealings with India. “Tarique Rahman’s BNP is different from Khaleda Zia’s BNP,” he said.
The Pakistan pivot
Where India confronts uncertainty, Pakistan has seen an opportunity.
Under Bangladesh’s interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh and Pakistan resumed direct flights, exchanged high-level civilian and military visits, and eased visa procedures, among various other confidence-building steps.
Analysts say that momentum could gather pace under a BNP government.
Former Pakistani foreign secretary and diplomat Salman Bashir told Al Jazeera the Bangladesh election “marks the end of Awami League’s long dalliance” with India and “a reopening of close relations” with Pakistan.
“Bangladesh does not have to balance its relations with India and Pakistan,” Bashir said. “Ties with Pakistan have improved. Pakistan should persist with its present policy of giving priority to its relations with Dhaka.”
Last month, the Pakistani military announced that it was in conversation with its Bangladeshi counterparts to sell them Pakistan-manufactured JF-17 fighter jets.
Bashir said there is a possibility that Bangladesh, Pakistan and China may come closer in defence matters.
“It should be possible for Bangladesh to lead a more independent policy towards Pakistan and the Middle East. Ties with China would be strengthened. In short, it means a reversal of India’s dominant posture in the region,” he said.
Other analysts, however, urge caution. “Bangladesh’s economic interests and geography ensure India remains its primary neighbour,” said Ali, the analyst at Georgia State University.
Praveen Donthi of the International Crisis Group thinks Dhaka will try to balance relations with both Beijing and New Delhi, with possible outreach to Islamabad as well. He said India pursues a pragmatic approach to its strategic and foreign policy, “though it may sometimes take time to reorient itself”.
Shahab Enam Khan, executive director of the Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs, said the BNP will pursue a “more transactional approach” towards both Islamabad and Delhi.
“Pakistan, as a natural regional neighbour, will benefit from more transparent and structured cooperation,” he said.
New chapter with China?
Perhaps the most consequential relationship for the incoming Bangladesh government will be with China.
Beijing maintained strong ties with Hasina, while also cultivating links across Bangladesh’s political spectrum, positioning itself regardless of the domestic political dynamics.
Under Hasina’s long rule, China expanded its economic footprint through its Belt and Road Initiative, deepening infrastructure investments and military cooperation with Dhaka.
The interim government that succeeded Hasina also secured about $2.1bn in Chinese investments, loans and grants, alongside high-level visits to Beijing, including by Yunus.
On Friday, the Chinese embassy congratulated the BNP on its victory, expressing readiness to work with the new government on “writing new chapters of China-Bangladesh relations”.
Hossain, professor of international relations at the University of Dhaka, said the BNP would likely “further deepen its relations with China, hearkening back to the past experience of friendly ties” under the previous governments led by the party.
At the same time, he noted, Bangladesh will face a “growing American opposition to China’s increased presence” in the region.
Ali of the Georgia State University argued that Dhaka’s most viable path would be to “keep Chinese investment and connectivity projects where they serve Bangladesh’s interests, while making foreign policy more predictable and rules-based” in relation to China, India and the US.
“If Dhaka can be transparent about its red lines and priorities and keep the China file focused on economics rather than security symbolism, it will have a better chance of avoiding being dragged into major power rivalries while protecting its own strategic space,” he said.
Dhaka’s delicate balancing act
As Rahman prepares to assume office, he faces what Shahriar, professor at North South University in Dhaka, describes as a “great power competition in the Bay of Bengal region”.
The BNP manifesto emphasised a “Bangladesh First” policy, which called for all international relations and engagements to prioritise national sovereignty, security and the welfare of the people.
“The reality is, as a sovereign country, Bangladesh needs to develop its relations with all the countries, including China, Pakistan, Myanmar. This will be a great challenge for the upcoming government,” he said.
Khan from the Bangladesh Center for Indo-Pacific Affairs said the new administration must ground its diplomacy in “pragmatism rather than rhetoric”.
Donthi of the International Crisis Group said the Bangladesh verdict gives the South Asian region a chance to recalibrate, as it is no longer a region that can be counted as the “back yard of one or the other”. Foreign policy, he said, tends to evolve gradually rather than shift abruptly.
“There are likely to be small, incremental shifts towards regional balancing between India and China, as already observed during Sheikh Hasina’s leadership. Dhaka will also aim to build a more active relationship with the US and, however minimally, normalise relations with Islamabad,” he said.

Following Bangladesh’s expulsion from the tournament for refusing to play their games in India, the Pakistan government stepped in to stop the group stage match from going ahead in a show of solidarity with the Bangladeshi team.
After talks with the game’s governing body – the International Cricket Council (ICC) – Bangladesh and tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, Pakistan reversed their decision.
Al Jazeera Sport takes a look at the game, now that matters return to the on-field rivalry – although handshakes and gestures will be under the spotlight once more.
What happened the last time India played Pakistan?
Sunday’s group-stage game is a repeat of the 2025 Asian Cup final, which India won by five wickets.
The game, much like the team’s earlier meeting in the tournament, was overshadowed by the lack of handshakes between the sides and India’s refusal to accept the trophy, which was to be presented to them by Asian Cricket Council (ACC) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who was also chair of Pakistan’s cricket board and the country’s interior minister.
Why are Pakistan allowed to play in Sri Lanka instead of India, but not Bangladesh?
Both India and Pakistan reached an agreement in 2024 that matches between the sides would be played at neutral venues, even if either were hosting a tournament.
Bangladesh’s late refusal ahead of its tournament to play matches in India over security concerns was not something that had been agreed to or sanctioned by the ICC.
One Pakistan player’s life was changed by an Indian cricketer
Pakistan’s Usman Tariq left his cricket ambitions back home to start a salesman’s job in Dubai, before a biopic about India great Mahendra Singh Dhoni changed his life.
The unusual bowling action of the double-jointed spinner has created plenty of chatter in his first T20 World Cup, and now he goes into Sunday’s revived clash against India as one of Pakistan’s main weapons.
His inspiration was born in India, and Tariq admits if he had not watched the 2016 Bollywood movie, M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story, he might not be playing cricket today.
Based on the life of India’s World Cup-winning captain, the movie told a tale of grit, rejection and eventual glory – and made Tariq believe it was never too late to chase his ambition.
“I had left behind thinking of making a name in cricket, but one day I watched this film, and it convinced me that I can also do the same,” Tariq said.
Tariq, now 30, left Dubai and roamed around the world to mature as a mystery spinner.
Pakistan skipper Salman Agha insisted Tariq will be a special weapon when his side face their archrivals, after being cleared to play following an Islamabad government U-turn that reversed an earlier order to boycott the India match.
“Tariq is our X-factor and a key weapon,” Agha said ahead of the tournament after Pakistan had used him sparingly to protect his unique action.
Since making his international debut just three months ago, Tariq has taken 11 wickets in four T20 internationals, including a hat-trick against Zimbabwe in Rawalpindi.
He grabbed a match-defining 3-27 against the USA in Colombo on his World Cup debut this week.
Why is Tariq’s bowling action controversial?
The 28-year-old’s bizarre bowling action was reported as illegal twice in the last two years, but was cleared by the ICC’s laboratory.
His action carries an element of mystery as he pauses exaggeratedly before releasing the ball in a slingshot manner.
England’s Tom Banton questioned Tariq’s action in the United Arab Emirates T20 League last year.
Australia all-rounder Cameron Green mimicked Tariq’s round-arm during the T20 series before the World Cup in Lahore, raising renewed doubts.
But India player Ravichandran Ashwin, himself a great spinner, and umpire Anil Chaudhary declared Tariq’s bowling action to be within the rules.
“I believe that it is entirely legal,” Ashwin wrote on X, explaining several factors of the action.
Tariq is unperturbed by the doubters.
“I have two corners of my bowling arm elbow, which is rare,” Tariq said. “I have been cleared twice, so I am confident that it’s legal.
“I have struggled this far and am not worried about such baseless questions.”
Tariq’s progress has come in leaps and bounds. He finished with 20 wickets in the Caribbean Premier League last year, forcing his way into the Pakistan team.
“My coach informed me about my selection in the Pakistan team while I was busy with my wedding last year, and initially I thought it was a prank,” said Tariq.
“But it was true, so I think my wife brought luck for me.”
From a salesman in Dubai to Pakistan’s potential trump card against India, Tariq’s script is still being written.
Colombo boosted by India and Pakistan tourism windfall
Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to the city to watch India play Pakistan.
The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices – the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.
After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.
Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to about $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 percent to roughly $666.
Nalin Jayasundera, president of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) said hotels were booked out. “Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.
Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches and lush tea plantations.
It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.
Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told the Reuters news agency that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20 percent of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.
The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.
“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.
Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.
“I think it’s going to be a great experience,” said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. “I’m really excited about this match.”
Sultan added he thought Pakistan “absolutely” could come out on top on Sunday.

Law enforcement officers identify and formally charge Russian serviceman who killed unarmed AFU member in Sumy region
According to Ukrinform, the Prosecutor General's Office stated this on Facebook.
On February 24, 2022, units of the 1st Tank Army of the Russian Armed Forces illegally crossed the border and entered the Sumy region.
Ukrainian forces struck enemy equipment, after which about 15 Russian invaders fled into a forested area near Okhtyrka.
During the pursuit, a Ukrainian serviceman, a rifle company commander, was ambushed and taken prisoner. He laid down his arms and did not resist. Despite this, a Russian soldier shot the unarmed captive three times with a VSS sniper rifle. The serviceman died at the scene. It has been established that the shots were fired by a captain, the deputy commander of the 1st Special Purpose Company of the reconnaissance battalion of the 96th Separate Reconnaissance Brigade of the Russian Federation.
The Sumy Regional Prosecutor's Office has notified the suspect in absentia of charges under Part 1 of Article 28 and Part 2 of Article 438 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (violation of the laws and customs of war combined with intentional murder committed by a group of persons).
Investigators are identifying accomplices, and a decision is being made to place the suspect on the wanted list.
As Ukrinform previously reported, law enforcement officers have identified and notified 211 individuals of suspicion for atrocities committed in Bucha and the Bucha district during the temporary occupation of the Kyiv region in 2022.

Valentine's Day at the Winter Olympics might look a little different, but it's still special

How Valentine’s Day is celebrated at the Winter Olympics
Some competitions already seem to have Cupid in attendance
- Bookmark
Beyond the pursuit of Olympic glory, the Milan Cortina Games are proving that winning medals isn't the only thing making hearts swell, with romance blossoming across the ice rinks and snowy hills. Cupid seems to be an early attendee.
Dutch speed skater Jutta Leerdam, after setting an Olympic record in the 1000-meter race, shared a tearful moment with her fiancé Jake Paul, the pair making heart signs. Elsewhere, downhill skiing champion Breezy Johnson's long-term boyfriend proposed to her near the finish line, witnessed by her U.S. Ski Team.
Such heartfelt displays highlight that for athletes and attendees, Valentine's Day at the Games, even without grand gestures, remains uniquely special.
Competing on Valentine's Day
Valentine’s Day is the finals for the women’s skeleton event. That means that Kim Meylemans of Belgium and Nicole Rocha Silveira of Brazil — an international couple who play for their separate national teams — will be too busy for a romantic dinner. They told The Associated Press they didn’t even bring gifts to exchange.
But since they are together all the time, “It’s always a bit of a Valentine's Day," Meylemans said. “It is part of our sport every day, our love.”
The two feel fortunate their national Olympic committees arranged for them to bunk together at Cortina's Olympic village, since typically only teammates share housing. Half their room is decorated for Belgium, the other half Brazil.
Rocha Silveira was new to the sport in 2019 when Meylemans was already competing in World Cup races. They fell in love during the pandemic while sharing short-term rentals, since many hotels closed.
Fast forward to 2024, and they unknowingly bought identical engagement rings and planned proposals for the same boat trip in Brazil while on vacation. They married last August.
When they compete, they high-five and kiss before each run, wishing the other well.
“It doesn’t matter which one is on the podium. At the end of the day, it’s a victory for our team," Meylemans said.
Rocha Silveira said it’s important their relationship appears during these Games in Italy, where same-sex marriages aren't recognized and only married heterosexual couples are allowed to jointly adopt.
It’s a great place to “show it even more,” and “encourage and inspire people that they can be themselves,” she said.
Volunteer valentines
Lori and Curtis Brown have been married for over 30 years and will be spend Valentine's Day at the skating arena where they are volunteering for this year’s Winter Olympics.
About 18,000 volunteers are spread across the venues in northern Italy — a sea of navy blue uniforms keeping the Olympics running around the clock, with duties such as giving directions, accompanying athletes to venues, crowd control and medical support.
Curtis, 60, said neither of them had realized they were scheduled to work. Now, they're hoping they can coincide their breaks to have dinner together, perhaps surrounded by the rest of the volunteers, he joked.
“This is the most special Valentine’s Day of our lives,” Curtis said. “Because we’re both here, we’re both on the same page, we’re both enjoying this adventure together.”
While presents are neither’s love language, Lori, 61, told the AP she bought boxer briefs from the official Milan Cortina souvenir store. Curtis hadn’t bought anything for her.
“It’s not so much about gift giving, just going out and doing something together,” said Lori, 61. She spoke while sitting beside Curtis, so perhaps she’ll be surprised on Saturday.
Canadians facing off against Germany
Canadian hockey forward Laura Stacey and her wife, team captain Marie-Philip Poulin, have a different kind of date: playing Germany's team in the quarterfinals in Milan.
“We have a game, we have a big game, so spending it together. We’re pretty lucky,” Stacey said. “Most people don’t get to do what they love, chasing their dreams together, and we do. So I think on February 14th, I think it’s important for us to just appreciate that and not take it for granted."
Aside from taking on Germany, they don't have plans — but Stacey said they will surely at least give each other cards.
Other Olympian couples
Many other couples are at the Olympics, some teammates and others competing against each other.
— U.S. alpine skiing star Mikaela Shiffrin — that sport’s all-time wins leader — is engaged to Norway’s Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, who returned to racing this season after dealing with major injuries.
— Latvia’s luge team includes the husband-and-wife pair of Martins Bots and Elina Bota, both single sliders.
— Italy’s luge team Dominik Fischnaller and the U.S.'s Emily Sweeney married last year after dating for almost 15 years.
— U.S. bobsledding has a power couple with reigning women’s monobloc world champion Kaysha Love engaged to men’s push athlete Hunter Powell. She’s in the Olympics for the second time, while he's making his debut.
— American figure skaters Madison Chock and Evan Bates were married in 2024 and won a silver medal on Wednesday.
—Curling may have the most well-known couples of any sport. Norway’s Magnus Nedregotten and Kristin Skaslien have been together since 2008 and won bronze in Pyeongchang. Jocelyn Peterman and Brett Gallant of Canada married in 2022 and were favorites this year. There are Switzerland’s Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwalller-Huerlimann, too; they brought their baby and photos of him carrying a curling broom twice his size went viral.
He looked like a curling Cupid.

UK’s Mandelson asked to cooperate in Epstein probe by US Congress
US lawmakers say Mandelson holds ‘critical information’ about Epstein’s operations and have requested his cooperation.
Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson has been asked to submit himself for an interview and answer questions as part of a United States congressional investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
In a letter sent to Mandelson by Democratic Representatives Robert Garcia and Suhas Subramanyam, both members of the House Oversight Committee, the lawmakers say it is “clear” that the former ambassador “possessed extensive social and business ties” to Epstein and request that he make himself available for a transcribed interview.

“The Committee is seeking to uncover the identities of Mr Epstein’s co-conspirators and enablers and understand the full extent of his criminal operations,” the lawmakers said in their letter.
“While you no longer serve as British Ambassador to the United States and have stepped down from the House of Lords, it is clear that you possessed extensive social and business ties to Jeffrey Epstein and hold critical information pertaining to our investigation of Epstein’s operations,” they said.
“Numerous pieces of evidence have come to light demonstrating your close ties to Jeffrey Epstein over the span of multiple years,” they add.
While the House committee does not have the authority to compel Mandelson to testify, it said it was seeking his “cooperation” and expected his response “no later than February 27, 2026”.
Mandelson assumed the role of the United Kingdom’s ambassador in February 2025 but was removed in September after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government claimed further details had emerged about the depth of his ties to Epstein.
He has since resigned from Starmer’s Labour Party following intensified scrutiny and the House of Lords.
Mandelson’s links with Epstein have led to calls for Starmer to stand down as prime minister, with critics questioning his judgement in appointing Mandelson as US ambassador, which is considered the most prestigious posting in British diplomacy.
While Starmer appears to have survived for now, the controversy continues to reverberate within his inner circle.
Starmer’s cabinet secretary, Chris Wormald, resigned on Thursday – the third senior aide of the prime minister to quit in a matter of days due to the Epstein scandal.
Starmer’s chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, a Labour Party stalwart, left on Sunday for advising Starmer to make the contentious Mandelson appointment, and so did communications director Tim Allan.
Mandelson has denied any criminal wrongdoing regarding his relationship with Epstein.

Colombia revives spraying of coca fields with drones amid renewed US cooperation

Colombia has resumed spraying drug fields with a toxic chemical using drones, the US embassy in Bogota has said, after a meeting between the two nations' leaders eased tensions.
"Colombia has launched drone eradication of coca crops" with support from the US government, Washington's mission in Bogota wrote on social media on Friday.
"This technology could be game-changing: lower coca cultivation, more security in Colombia, less deadly drugs reaching American streets, and more lives saved."
The South American nation in 2015 suspended the aerial spraying of glyphosate, which has been linked to cancer in humans, over concerns about its negative health impact.
US President Donald Trump and leftist counterpart Gustavo Petro met last week at the White House to smooth diplomatic tensions that had been building over the last year.
They pledged to resume historic military cooperation between Washington and Bogota, and to jointly combat guerrilla groups and drug cartels.
Growing pressure from US
Petro's government announced in December that it would resume the spraying of drug crops under growing pressure from the Trump administration, which is demanding a tougher anti-drug policy in Colombia.
The Colombian justice ministry presented the new drug crop eradication policy in December.
It said drones would fly 1.5 metres (5 feet) above coca fields and carry out "controlled" spraying to prevent the chemical from affecting communities.
Since taking office in 2022, Petro has followed a "total peace" policy to disband all armed groups through dialogue.
But six months before he leaves office, the efforts have yielded few results, forcing the president to shift towards a tougher war on drugs.

Top Japanese school faces backlash over Palestinian poetry in entrance exam

Controversy soon followed on Japanese social media over the use of the material related to war and displacement.
The two poets – Gaza-born Mosab Abu Toha and Palestinian American Zeina Azzam – welcomed the inclusion of their translated works in the exam, but also expressed concern about the ensuing controversy.
Nada Junior High School is a private all-boys school in Kobe whose graduates often go on to top universities in Japan. Every winter, hundreds of sixth grade students take the admissions test.
Abu Toha’s poem “What is Home?” – published in his 2022 book Things You May Find Hidden in My Ear – was used alongside Azzam’s “Write My Name” in the reading comprehension portion of the exam.

US homeland security department partially shutdown after lawmakers fail to agree funding

The Department of Homeland Security has begun a partial shutdown, after funding for the much-criticized agency expired, with a range of services, including domestic flights and the US Coastguard, now vulnerable to disruption.
The shutdown was all but confirmed on Thursday, after the Senate failed to clear the 60-vote threshold needed to pass the DHS appropriations bill and lawmakers left Washington for a long weekend without resolving the impasse.
Democrats say they won’t help approve more funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
Democrats demanded radical reforms of how agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) – which both fall under DHS’s remit – operate.
It is, however, unlikely the shutdown will affect ICE and CBP operations, which are deemed vital and already have extensive funding thanks to Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill”, passed last summer.
Instead, disruption is likely to fall on services such as the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema).
TSA workers, who include airport security staff and baggage handlers, are expected to continue working over the weekend without pay, to minimize the travel disruption that marked last year’s 43-day government shutdown, the longest in US history. Many Fema workers are expected to be furloughed without pay, limiting its ability to work with local and state partners. Officials have warned that the funding lapse could impede the agency’s ability to respond to natural disasters.
Thursday’s Senate vote fell almost entirely along party lines in a 52-47 vote on the legislation, with John Fetterman of Pennsylvania being the sole Democratic exception in backing the bill. Democrats also blocked an attempt to temporarily extend funding for two weeks at current levels.
While agreeing to agents wearing body cameras, Republicans have resisted other proposals, including demands that agents obtain judicial warrants, signed by a judge, before entering private property.
Chuck Schumer, the Democrats’ leader in the Senate, accused the Republicans of choosing “chaos”.
“They need to negotiate in good faith, produce legislation that actually reins in ICE and stops the violence,” he said on Thursday.
Before Thursday’s vote, Tom Homan, the US border czar, announced that the administration was winding down “Operation Metro Surge” and that the number of ICE agents in Minnesota would return to normal levels. Homan recently took over leadership of the operation from Greg Bovino, a senior border patrol official who was in charge when federal agents killed Good and Pretti.
Although senators were reported to be on standby to return to vote if agreement is reached, a weekend resolution seemed unlikely, as several members have left the US to attend the Munich security conference in Germany.
Both the Senate and the House of Representatives – which passed the appropriations bill on 22 January and another short-term continuing resolution on 3 February to keep the DHS funded and avert a partial shutdown – are scheduled to be in recess for the next 10 days to coincide with President’s Day next Monday, making an extended shutdown likely.
The shutdown will be the second partial government shutdown this month. At the end of January, Congress failed to pass a package of five appropriations bills, triggering a four-day shutdown that ended when lawmakers agreed to fund every agency until the end of the fiscal year except DHS, which they extended for two weeks.

TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown

TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown
A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has gone into effect
- Bookmark
A shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that took effect early Saturday impacts the agency responsible for screening passengers and bags at airports across the country. Travelers with airline reservations may be nervously recalling a 43-day government shutdown that led to historic flight cancellations and long delays last year.
Transportation Security Administration officers are expected to work without pay while lawmakers remain without an agreement on Homeland Security's annual funding. TSA officers also worked through the record shutdown that ended Nov. 12, but aviation experts say this one may play out differently.
Trade groups for the U.S. travel industry and major airlines nonetheless warned that the longer DHS appropriations are lapsed, the longer security lines at the nation's commercial airports could get.
Here’s what to know about the latest shutdown and how to plan ahead.
What's different about this shutdown?
Funding for Homeland Security expired at midnight. But the rest of the federal government is funded through Sept. 30. That means air traffic controllers employed by the Federal Aviation Administration will receive paychecks as usual, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations.
According to the department’s contingency plan, about 95% of TSA workers are deemed essential personnel and required to keep working. Democrats in the House and Senate say Homeland Security won’t get funded until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations.
During past shutdowns, disruptions to air travel tended to build over time, not overnight. About a month into last year’s shutdown, for example, TSA temporarily closed two checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. That same day, the government took the extraordinary step of ordering all commercial airlines to reduce their domestic flight schedules.
John Rose, chief risk officer for global travel management company Altour, said strains could surface at airports more quickly this time because the TSA workforce also will be remembering the last shutdown.
“It’s still fresh in their minds and potentially their pocketbooks,” Rose said.
What is the impact on travelers?
It’s hard to predict whether, when or where security screening snags might pop up. Even a handful of unscheduled TSA absences could quickly lead to longer wait times at smaller airports, for example, if there's just a single security checkpoint.
That’s why travelers should plan to arrive early and allow extra time to get through security.
“I tell people to do this even in good times,” Rose said.
Experts say flight delays also are a possibility even though air traffic controllers are not affected by the DHS shutdown.
Airlines might decide to delay departures in some cases to wait for passengers to clear screening, said Rich Davis, senior security advisor at risk mitigation company International SOS. Shortages of TSA officers also could slow the screening of checked luggage behind the scenes.
What travelers can do to prepare
Most airports display security line wait times on their websites, but don't wait until the day of a flight to check them, Rose advised.
“You may look online and it says two-and-a-half hours," he said. "Now it’s two-and-a-half hours before your flight and you haven't left for the airport yet.”
Passengers should also pay close attention while packing since prohibited items are likely to prolong the screening process. For carry-on bags, avoid bringing full-size shampoo or other liquids, large gels or aerosols and items like pocketknives in carry-on bags.
TSA has a full list on its website of what is and isn't allowed in carry-on and checked luggage.
At the airport, Rose said, remember to “practice patience and empathy."
“Not only are they not getting paid,” he said of TSA agents, “they’re probably working with reduced staff and dealing with angry travelers.”
Will the shutdown drag on?
The White House has been negotiating with Democratic lawmakers, but the two sides failed to reach a deal by the end of the week before senators and members of Congress were set to leave Washington for a 10-day break.
Lawmakers in both chambers were on notice, however, to return if a deal to end the shutdown is struck.
Democrats have said they won’t help approve more funding for Homeland Security until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations after the fatal shooting of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis last month.
In a joint statement, U.S. Travel, Airlines for America and the American Hotel & Lodging Association warned that the shutdown threatens to disrupt air travel as the busy spring break travel season approaches.
“Travelers and the U.S. economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay, which increases the risk of unscheduled absences and call outs, and ultimately can lead to higher wait times and missed or delayed flights,” the statement said.

Normalization of Russian-Japanese ties possible in near future

TOKYO, February 14. /TASS/. Normalization of relations between Russia and Japan is possible in the not-too-distant future if talks on Ukraine produce result and the process of lifting economic sanctions begins, a leading Japanese expert on Russia Taisuke Abiru has told TASS.
"There is no doubt that Prime Minister Takaichi fully understands the importance of Japan-Russia relations, as evidenced by the fact thatshe personally attended and delivered a speech at the National Convention Demanding the Return of the Northern Territories (Japanese name for Southern Kurils) held in Tokyo on February 7, the last day of her busy Lower House election campaign," said Abiru, a senior research fellow at the Sasakawa Peace Foundation and an author of numerous books on Russia, who also took part in several Valdai Discussion Forum meetings.
In his opinion, "two conditions must be in place for the Takaichi administration to turn its current policy toward Russia into a positive one."
"One is a strong domestic political base," the expert said, adding that this requirement has already been met "with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) sweeping victory in the recent Lower House election."
The second requirement is that peace and ceasefire talks on Ukraine, actively mediated by US President Donald Trump’s administration "must bear fruit and a trend toward lifting economic sanctions against Russia must be created." "The focus will therefore be on when the latter condition will be met," he added.
Current cooperation projects remain
"Until then, existing cooperation projects, mainly in the energy sector, such as the Sakhalin-2 LNG project, will be maintained," Abiru believes.
Japan receives almost 9-10% of all imported LNG, which is one of the key elements of the country’s energy balance, from Sakhalin-2.
"In addition, the two countries will gradually expand personnel exchanges in areas not subject to sanctions, such as the arts, culture, and academia," he said. "In this way, the groundwork should be steadily laid for the full-fledged normalization of Japan-Russia relations, which is expected to take place in the not-too-distant future."
At the same time, the expert noted that "the deterioration of Japan-China relations will also have some impact on the Takaichi administration's formulation of a new policy toward Russia."
Certain observers believe that closer ties with Russia will help Tokyo balance the cold spell in relations with Beijing to some extent.
After the start of Russia’s special military operation in Ukraine, Japan imposed several packages of sanctions against Moscow. In response, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced that it does not intend to continue consultations on the peace treaty, citing the impossibility of discussing such a fundamental document with a state that takes an openly unfriendly stance and seeks to harm Russia’s interests.
Besides, Moscow also withdrew from talks on joint business activities in Southern Kurils, and visits of former Japanese residents to these islands stopped. The Russian Foreign Ministry said on February 2 that the resumption of Moscow-Tokyo dialogue will be possible only after the Japanese government ceases its Russophobic policies. The Russian Foreign Ministry’s official spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, told reporters on February 2 that because of Tokyo’s "clumsy steps", Russian-Japanese relations have been brought to a critical "point of no return."

Minneapolis left to decide future of streetside memorials to 2 people killed by federal officers
The Trump administration announced this week that its immigration crackdown in Minnesota is ending
- Bookmark
As the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota winds down, Minneapolis will need to decide how to manage makeshift memorial sites for two U.S. citizens killed by federal agents last month.
Piles of flowers, signs and artwork swiftly formed to commemorate the lives of Renee Good and Alex Pretti at the locations where they were fatally shot. The memorials are the site of candlelight vigils and musical performances and draw a regular stream of visitors.
The public grieving spots echo the community-driven memorial to George Floyd, who was murdered in 2020 by a police officer less than one mile (1.61 kilometers) from Good's killing. It took the city more than five years to figure out how to officially memorialize the site of George Floyd Square, and construction is set to begin this year.
Now, the city has two more high-profile memorials to manage.
A memorial for Good sprung up within hours of her Jan. 7 killing on a Minneapolis street.
And before the smell of tear gas used by federal agents had dissipated on the day of Pretti's killing on Jan. 24, Minneapolis protesters were already using branches, police tape and candles to mark the space. Later, people placed crosses, stuffed animals, American flags and images of Pretti.
Minnesota resident Karel Hoffmann said that while she remained outraged with Good and Pretti’s killings, the memorials represented community solidarity.
“This is so unfair, the trauma, for everyone, is too much,” Hoffmann said as she visited Pretti's memorial recently. “We’re all in this together. And I’m really glad they have this here so everybody can come and be together.”
Lynn Elrod, a nurse, visited Pretti’s memorial last month and added her own offering: a plastic evergreen tree with red hearts and portraits of him and Good.
“I printed both of their pictures and put those on there again, just to signify the love that we have for both of them, really, and their contributions to the community and supporting their neighbors,” Elrod said.
The residential street where Good died remains open, but orange traffic cones offer a narrow walkway for those paying their respects, and a small band of volunteers watches over the mound of flowers, artwork and handwritten signs that has amassed between the sidewalk and the street.
Around the Pretti memorial along a commercial district known as “ Eat Street,” traffic lanes have been temporarily shifted and parking is closed off, said Jess Olstad, a spokesperson for the city of Minneapolis.
“The City’s top priority is to give our community space to grieve and heal,” Olstad said. “This both ensures emergency vehicles can get through the area and protects those who gather or visit the memorial.”
Olstad added that the city is “actively working on next steps, including continued community engagement regarding both memorials.”
Ally Peters, a spokesperson for Mayor Jacob Frey, said last week that it was “too early” to comment on whether the memorials would be made permanent.

Widespread arrests roil Iran weeks after security forces crushed protests
A month after Iran launched a crackdown on nationwide protests, widespread arrests are roiling the country
- Bookmark
The Iranian security agents came at 2 a.m., pulling up in a half-dozen cars outside the home of the Nakhii family. They woke up the sleeping sisters, Nyusha and Mona, and forced them to give the passwords for their phones. Then they took the two away.
The women were accused of participating in the nationwide protests that shook Iran a week earlier, a friend of the pair told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity for her security as she described the Jan. 16 arrests.
Such arrests have been happening for weeks following the government crackdown last month that crushed the protests calling for the end of the country’s theocratic rule. Reports of raids on homes and workplaces have come from major cities and rural towns alike, revealing a dragnet that has touched large swaths of Iranian society. University students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes and filmmakers have been swept up, as well as reformist figures close to President Masoud Pezeshkian.
They are often held incommunicado for days or weeks and prevented from contacting family members or lawyers, according to activists monitoring the arrests. That has left desperate relatives searching for their loved ones.
The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency has put the number of arrests at more than 50,000. The AP has been unable to verify the figure. Tracking the detainees has been difficult since Iranian authorities imposed an internet blackout, and reports leak out only with difficulty.
Other activist groups outside Iran have also been working to document the sweeps.
“Authorities continue to identify people and detain them,” said Shiva Nazarahari, an organizer with one of those groups, the Committee for Monitoring the Status of Detained Protesters.
So far, the committee has verified the names of more than 2,200 people who were arrested, using direct reports from families and a network of contacts on the ground. The arrestees include 107 university students, 82 children as young as 13, as well as 19 lawyers and 106 doctors.
Nazarahari said authorities have been reviewing municipal street cameras, store surveillance cameras and drone footage to track people who participated in the protests to their homes or places of work, where they are arrested.
Held for weeks with no contact
The protests began in late December, triggered by anger over spiraling prices, and quickly spread across the country. They peaked on Jan. 8 and 9, when hundreds of thousands of people in more than 190 cities and towns across the country took to the streets.
Security forces responded by unleashing unprecedented violence. The Human Rights Activists News Agency has so far counted more than 7,000 dead and says the true number is far higher. Iran’s government offered its only death toll on Jan. 21, saying 3,117 people were killed. The theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from past unrest.
Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejehi, a hard-line cleric who heads Iran’s judiciary, became the face of the crackdown, labeling protesters “terrorists” and calling for fast-tracked punishments.
Since then, “detentions have been very widespread because it’s like a whole suffocation of society,” said one protester, reached by the AP in Gohardasht, a middle-class area outside the Iranian capital. He said two of his relatives and three of his brother’s friends were killed in the first days of the crackdown, as well as several neighbors. The protester spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted by authorities.
The Nakhii sisters, 37-year-old Nyusha and 25-year-old Mona, were first taken to Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where they were allowed to contact their parents, their friend said. Later, she said, they were moved to Qarchak, a women’s prison on the outskirts of Tehran where rights groups reported conditions that included overcrowding and lack of hygiene even before the crackdown.
Other people whose arrests were documented by the detainees committee have disappeared into the prisons. The family of Abolfazl Jazbi has not heard from him since his Jan. 15 arrest at a factory in the southern city of Isfahan. Jazbi suffers from a severe blood disorder that requires medication, according to the committee.
Atila Sultanpour, 45, has not been heard from since he was taken from his home in Tehran on Jan. 29 by security agents who beat him severely, according to Dadban, a group of Iranian lawyers based abroad who are also documenting detentions.
Authorities have also moved to suspend bank accounts, block SIM cards and confiscate the property of protesters' relatives or people who publicly express support for them, said Musa Barzin, an attorney with Dadban, citing reports from families.
In past crackdowns on protests, authorities sometimes adhered to a veneer of due process and rule of law, but not this time, Barzin said. Authorities are increasingly denying detainees access to legal counsel and often holding them for days or weeks before allowing any phone calls to family. Lawyers representing arrested protesters also have faced court summons and detention, according to Dadban.
“The following of the law is in the worst situation it has ever been,” Barzin said.
Signs of defiance continue
Despite the crackdown, many civic groups continue to issue defiant statements.
The Writers’ Association of Iran, an independent group with a long tradition of dissent, issued a statement describing the protests as an uprising against “47 years of systemic corruption and discrimination.”
It also announced that two of its members had been detained, including a member of its secretariat.
A national council representing schoolteachers urged families to speak out about detained children and students. “Do not fear the threats of security forces. Refer to independent counsel. Make your children’s names public,” it said in a statement.
A spokesman for the council said Sunday that it has documented the deaths of at least 200 minors who were killed in the crackdown. That figure is up several dozen from the count just days before.
“Every day we tell ourselves this is the last list,” Mohammad Habibi wrote on X. “But the next morning, new names arrive again.”
Bar associations and medical groups have also spoken out, including Iran’s state-sanctioned doctors council, which called on authorities to stop harassing medical staff.
Anger over the bloodshed now adds to the bitterness over the economy, which has been hollowed out by decades of sanctions, corruption and mismanagement. The value of the currency has plunged, and inflation has climbed to record levels.
The Iranian government has announced gestures such as launching a new coupon program for essential goods. Labor and trade groups, including a national retirees syndicate, have issued statements condemning the economic and political crisis.
Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump has moved an aircraft carrier and other military assets to the Persian Gulf and suggested the U.S. could attack Iran over the killing of peaceful demonstrators or if Tehran launches mass executions over the protests. A second American aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mideast.
Iran’s theocracy has faced down protests and U.S. threats in the past, and the crackdown showed the iron grip it holds over the country. This week, authorities organized pro-government rallies with hundreds of thousands of people to mark the anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Still, Barzin said, he sees the ferocity of the crackdown as a sign that Iran’s leadership “for the first time is afraid of being overthrown.”

Federal law would stop the cars of drunk or impaired drivers, but it isn't happening yet
A federal law requires new cars to include technology that detects drunk or impaired driving, but regulators still have not cleared it
- Bookmark
A federal law requiring impairment-detection devices inside all new cars survived a recent push to strip its funding but remains stalled by questions about whether the technology is ready.
Rana Abbas Taylor lost her sister, brother-in-law, nephew and two nieces when a driver with a blood-alcohol level almost four times the legal limit slammed into their car in January 2019 as the Michigan family drove through Lexington, Kentucky, on the way home from a Florida vacation.
The tragedy turned Abbas Taylor into an outspoken advocate for stopping the more than 10,000 alcohol-related deaths each year on U.S. roads. Lawmakers attached the Honoring Abbas Family Legacy to Terminate Drunk Driving Act to the $1 trillion infrastructure law that then-President Joe Biden signed in 2021.
The measure, often referred to as the Halt Drunk Driving Act, anticipated that as early as this year, auto companies would be required to roll out technology to “passively” detect when drivers are drunk or impaired and prevent their cars from operating. Regulators can choose from a range of options, including air monitors that sample the car's interior for traces of alcohol, fingertip readers that measure a driver's blood-alcohol level, or scanners that detect signs of impairment in eye or head movements.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving called it the most important piece of legislation in the organization's 45-year history. Still, implementation has been bogged down by regulatory delays, without any clear signals that final approval is near.
“The way we measure time is not by days or months or years. It’s by number of lives lost,” Abbas Taylor said in an interview with The Associated Press. “So when we hear manufacturers say, ‘We need more time,’ or ‘The tech is not ready,’ or ‘We’re not there yet,' all we hear is, ‘More people need to die before we’re willing to fix this.’”
The ‘kill switch’ debate
A Republican-led effort to remove the Halt Act's funding was defeated in the U.S. House last month by a 268-164 vote. Another bill to repeal it entirely awaits a committee vote.
Most of the opposition has stemmed from suggestions that the law would require manufacturers to equip cars with a “kill switch". That would essentially allow them to “be controlled by the government,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis posted on the social platform X, drawing comparisons to George Orwell's dystopian novel “1984.”
The alcohol industry has fiercely defended the law against such arguments. Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said it specifically requires the technology to be passive, similar to other current safety mandates such as seat belts and air bags.
“There is no switch, there’s no government control, there is no sharing of data," he said. “That’s just an unfortunate scare tactic.”
But Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who authored the defunding effort, said even the dashboard acting on its own could serve as “your judge, your jury, and your executioner." He cited the example of a mother who swerves in a snowstorm to avoid hitting a neighbor's pet, only for her car to deactivate itself because it determines she's impaired.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade association for U.S. automakers, made a similar case to regulators in 2024, arguing that much more research was needed before mandating the technology.
“Even if 1 in 10,000 trips were expected to experience a false positive, this could result in thousands of unimpaired drivers encountering problems that prevent them from driving each day,” the Alliance wrote.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which is establishing the rules to implement the Halt Act, told the AP in an email that it's still “assessing developing technologies for potential deployment” and expects to report back to Congress soon. Even supporters predict the agency will push the decision at least into 2027, and auto companies still would have another two to three years to install it.
Vouching for the tech's reliability
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, recently announced that impairment detection and other technology aimed at curbing risky driving behavior would soon be included as criteria for a vehicle to earn one of its top safety awards.
Many states already have laws requiring breath-activated ignition interlock systems to be installed on the cars of DUI offenders. The system ultimately chosen under the Halt Act is intended to detect impairment beyond just drunk driving.
“We’re still sort of pushing back against this narrative that the technology doesn’t exist,” said Stephanie Manning, chief government affairs officer at MADD. “We’ve seen many different types of technology that can solve drunk driving. We just haven’t seen it deployed and implemented the way that we would like.”
To accelerate the timeline, one bill advancing in Congress would offer a $45 million prize to whoever can produce and deploy the first consumer-ready piece of technology. Abbas Taylor, whose family members were killed in the Kentucky crash, said efforts like that give her hope.
“When you've lost everything, there is nothing that will stop you from fighting for what is right,” she said. “But we see the writing on the wall, and we know it’s only a matter of time before this happens.”

Muted hearing of Christchurch mosque killer all part of the plan

Muted hearing of Christchurch mosque killer all part of the plan
Wellington, New Zealand: In a near-empty courthouse, in front of almost no one, the appeal by New Zealand’s most reviled killer was heard in muted fashion with little mention of the details of the country’s deadliest mass shooting.
Such is New Zealand’s desire to smother the racist motivations of Brenton Tarrant, who murdered 51 Muslims praying at two mosques in the city of Christchurch in 2019.
Tarrant, a self-professed white supremacist, referred to other perpetrators of hate-fuelled massacres when he committed his attack, and other mass shooters have cited his actions since. Yet, it’s rare to encounter the Australian man’s words in New Zealand, the country to which he migrated with a plan to amass semiautomatic guns and carry out the slaughter.
Officials have sought to curb the spread of his views, including through a legal ban on his racist manifesto and a video he livestreamed of the shooting. The effort to prevent public exposure to Tarrant is perhaps most apparent in New Zealand’s courts, where he sought this week to recant his guilty pleas.
A three-judge panel in the Court of Appeal in Wellington heard final arguments on Friday by Crown lawyers opposing Tarrant’s application to have his admissions in 2020 to charges of terrorism, murder and attempted murder discarded.
Tarrant is serving life in prison without a chance of parole, but the case would return to court for a full trial if he is allowed to revoke his guilty pleas. Opposing lawyers say his appeal has no merit.
The 35-year-old told the court this week he didn’t want to plead guilty and made the “irrational” admissions during a “nervous breakdown” induced by solitary and austere prison conditions. But Crown lawyers opposing his appeal bid said in their response on Friday that there was no evidence for the claims that he was seriously mentally ill.
Experts had ruled Tarrant was fit to enter pleas, and his former lawyers and prison staff didn’t raise concerns either.
“It’s difficult to see what more could’ve been done,” Crown lawyer Barnaby Hawes told the court. Tarrant, he added, “is an unreliable witness and his narrative should be treated with caution.”
The evidence against Tarrant – including his own livestream of the massacre, in which he filmed his face – was so overwhelming that a guilty verdict was assured if he had fought the charges in a trial, the lawyers said.
“Pleading guilty to charges where his guilt is certain can’t be seen to be irrational,” Hawes said.
The subdued hearing defies the tension over the case.
One topic nearly absent from the weeklong hearing was any mention of the hateful motivations Tarrant cited for committing the crimes. Lawyers both supporting and opposing Tarrant’s bid avoided reference to his white supremacist views, and proceedings unfolded in the quiet and stolid way New Zealand court cases usually do.
“Keeping this case alive is a source of immense distress” to the shooter’s victims.Crown lawyer Madeleine Laracy
But there were signs the court sought to limit the public’s exposure to Tarrant, as New Zealand’s justice system has done before. Almost nobody was permitted to view the gunman’s evidence and the appeal bid unfolded in front of nine reporters, nine lawyers, a few court staff, and an empty public gallery.
Tarrant was permitted to watch the proceedings by video conference from Auckland Prison, but his image was not visible in the courtroom except when he gave evidence.
Apart from in Christchurch, where the bereaved and wounded survivors watched a livestream of the hearing at the local courthouse, the shooter was invisible.
The approach New Zealand has enacted – in which even news outlets name the shooter as few times as possible in each article – stands at odds with the publicity given to trials for racist mass killers before, including widely covered proceedings for the Norwegian murderer Anders Breivik, whom Tarrant years later cited as an inspiration.
Crown lawyers urged the appeal judges on Friday to thwart the prospect of the matter returning to court in a lengthy public trial, which would happen if the Australian’s bid to recant his guilt was successful.
“Keeping this case alive is a source of immense distress” to the shooter’s victims, Crown lawyer Madeleine Laracy said. “It doesn’t allow them to heal.”
A swift ruling isn’t expected. The judges’ decision will be released later. New Zealand’s appeals court delivers 90 per cent of its judgments within three months of a hearing’s end, according to the court’s website.
If his bid to revoke his guilty pleas is unsuccessful, Tarrant’s case will return to the appeals court for a later hearing, where he will seek a review of his life sentence.

Partial US government shutdown throws Congress into turmoil again
Second shutdown in four months after funding halted for Department of Homeland Security, as Republicans and Democrats fail to reach a deal

Mark Magnierin New York
The US Government experienced its second shutdown in four months on Saturday, as funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) halted, underscoring Washington’s growing partisanship and dysfunction.
But in an ironic twist, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, at the centre of the Congressional showdown, will continue to operate despite being part of DHS, given its independent source of funding. In an unprecedented move, US President Donald Trump’s administration has allocated at least US$75 billion over four years to ICE in addition to its US$10 billion base budget, allowing it to circumvent the usual budget process.
The shutdown followed the death of two US citizens in Minneapolis at the hands of ICE agents. Public outcry was intense, emboldening Democrats and forcing Republicans to cede ground. Trump replaced the lead commander in the Midwestern city, wound down “Operation Metro Surge”, and agreed that ICE agents must wear body cameras.

But it balked at Democrats’ other demands, including requirements that agents stop hiding their identities behind face masks, obtain judicial warrants before entering private property, and wear identification, a move critics say engenders a sense of impunity.
This shutdown follows on the heels of the longest such stoppage in US history, when the government ground to a halt last October and November for 43 days. That saw US fourth-quarter GDP decline by 1.5 percentage points and led to a “Day 20 crisis” when millions of low-income Americans went without food assistance.
Trump’s unprecedented support for ICE has turned it into the highest-funded US law enforcement agency, resulting in some 10,000 new officers and a huge expansion in detention facilities. Law enforcement experts say its excesses are the result of inadequate vetting or training, as public antipathy has grown rapidly.

What we can learn from lovebirds, the rare birds that mate for life
Phoenix is believed to be home to the world's largest colony of rosy-faced lovebirds outside of their native Africa
- Bookmark
Minutes after getting to a park in the middle of Phoenix, you can see flashes of green in the sky and hear chatter because love is in the air — or at least, the lovebirds are.
The small parrots are transplants from the other side of the world that are thought to be descendants of pet birds. Arizona is believed to be home to the largest colony of rosy-faced lovebirds outside southwestern Africa. They've been able to survive in a place known for sweltering weather by sticking close to humans and their air conditioning.
The lovebirds may have something to teach humans this Valentine's Day about keeping strong romantic bonds.
How did African lovebirds end up in Phoenix?
Rosy-faced lovebirds are originally from another arid region, the Namib Desert, which stretches from Angola, across Namibia and into South Africa. They are one of nine species of lovebirds.
Around the world, lovebirds are a popular pet. No one knows for sure how the lovebird colony started in Phoenix but they were first noticed around the city in the 1980s.
Some think pet lovebirds escaped or were let loose by their owners or escaped from a pet store, said Robert Carter, a volunteer for the Maricopa Bird Alliance who leads bird walks in the Phoenix area. Others have speculated that they could have flown all the way to Arizona but Carter thinks in that case, they would've found another arid area to stay along the way. The population has grown to an estimated 2,000 birds in Phoenix today, he said.
They can be seen sticking their heads out of the holes in cactus and palm trees that they roost in. They're also known to hang out near air conditioning vents on really hot days to at least be a little less hot, including at Arizona State University's science building.
While Carter thinks they should have been left in Africa, he admires their adaptability.
“They definitely show a sense of resilience to the situation that they're in," he said.
While Phoenix's lovebirds are believed to be the largest, most firmly established colony outside of Africa, there are also fairly well-established colonies of rosy-faced lovebirds in parts of Hawaii — on the Big Island and in Maui, said Kenn Kaufman, field editor for Audubon magazine who has written about lovebirds.
Another kind of lovebird, the Fischer's lovebird, appear to have established a small colony on the southern coast of Portugal, he said.
How did the birds get their name?
Lovebirds earned their name because of their tendency to form lifelong bonds with their mates, who like to perch close together, almost like they're cuddling. While many parrots mate for life, fewer than half of bird species do, Kaufman said.
While genetic testing has revealed that birds considered “socially monogamous” sometimes also breed with other birds while raising their young with their mate, lovebirds are not known to stray. They often clean their mate's feathers, especially the hard-to-reach ones, and feed one another food throughout their lives, not just when they are courting, like some other birds, Kaufman said.
People who have kept lovebirds as pets report that their mate seems depressed when they lose their partner by not being active or making abnormal calls, said Dr. Stephanie Lamb, associate veterinarian and bird specialist at the Arizona Exotic Animal Hospital.
How do parrots display affection?
Even when they are with other birds, lovebirds are not afraid to engage in some PDA — or as Kaufman says, “parrot display of affection." They pass food to each other with their beaks, which often looks like kissing, he said.
But the reality might strike people as not so cute: the food they're exchanging is regurgitated.
“It wouldn't be quite so romantic if humans were doing it,” he said.
All that care and attention helps keep their bonds strong over their long lives, he said. They live about 20 years, less than bigger parrots but longer than smaller songbirds, he said.
Still, Lamb said lovebirds, like other parrots, can sometimes be violent with each other, screaming and pecking one another with beaks powerful enough to crack open seeds. Sometimes they have to sit at opposite ends of their cage for a bit, until one comes over and nudges their way back into a cuddle, she said.
“Then everything's good," she said. ___ Slevin reported from Denver.

BYU says star wide receiver charged with felony rape is no longer a student there
Brigham Young University says its standout wide receiver Parker Kingston is no longer a student there after he was arrested this week on a first-degree felony rape charge
- Bookmark
Brigham Young University said Friday that its standout wide receiver Parker Kingston is no longer a student at the Utah private school after he was arrested this week on a first-degree felony rape charge.
Kingston, 21, made his initial court appearance Friday in St. George, where prosecutors say a woman who was 20 years old at the time told officers that Kingston assaulted her at her home last February. He was arrested following a yearlong investigation in which detectives collected digital and forensic evidence and interviewed witnesses, Washington County Attorney Jerry Jaeger said.
“I found by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Kingston was a danger to the community," Judge John Walton said during the hearing.
Still, Walton allowed Kingston be released Friday on a $100,000 bond with $10,000 cash immediately paid to the court after he was held initially without bail.
His defense attorney, Cara Tangaro, agreed that Kingston could have no contact with his accuser or any potential witnesses, must stay off social media and would wear a GPS ankle monitor to ensure he doesn't return to the southwestern Utah county, except for court appearances. He appeared before the judge by remote video link from jail Friday.
If convicted, he could serve five years to life in prison.
Tangaro did not immediately respond Friday to email and phone messages seeking comment.
BYU spokesperson Jon McBride said the administration and coaches were only made aware of the investigation and the allegations against Kingston after his arrest this week. He declined to answer whether Kingston was kicked out or left the school voluntarily.
Kingston told St. George Police that “all sexual activity” with the woman accusing him of rape was “consensual,” according to an affidavit unsealed Thursday. The woman told investigators she had made clear to Kingston before he came to her house that she did not want to have sex with him, and she told him to stop several times when he initiated sex, the affidavit said.
BYU, the flagship university of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, known widely as the Mormon church, has a strict honor code for students that prohibits all sexual relations outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. Those who violate it can face suspension, and for athletes, many weeks riding the bench.
Other top athletes including Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff have opted to leave BYU when faced with lengthy suspensions for violating the honor code.
Kingston was BYU’s leading receiver last season.
He is expected to make his next court appearance Feb. 25.

US Preparing for Possible Weeks-Long Campaign Against Iran — Reports

Looking back at George Washington’s 1790 letter, the root of American religious freedom

One day in January 1948, in Atlanta, Georgia, a little boy named David stood in line with his father to visit the Freedom Train, filled with original American documents such as the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Gettysburg Address.
As we wandered through the train, we looked at these seminal papers. Several times, my father pointed out the signatures of Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and, of course, George Washington.
Now, after having seen more noted American historical signatures on various documents, my great American Jewish moment occurred. Frequently, I ask myself, “Could I actually have seen that most famous George Washington letter to the ‘Hebrew congregation in Newport, Rhode Island,’ written after he visited the synagogue in 1790?”
However, why not? My father, Louis, read to me from the letter: “May the Children of the Stock of Abraham, who dwell in this land, continue to merit and enjoy the goodwill of the other inhabitants; while everyone shall sit in safety under his own vine and fig tree, and there shall be none to make him afraid.”
That letter has come to mean so much to me that I purchased two facsimiles and have read the letter many times.
As Presidents’ Day approaches (February 16), I would like to review its meaning.
Noted American Jewish historian Prof. Jonathan Sarna offers a very important interpretation of the meaning of this letter.
Rights for religious liberty
“A short exchange between President George Washington and the Jewish community of Newport articulated a theory of religious liberty grounded in inherent natural rights rather than toleration – even before the First Amendment was added to the American Constitution.”
Sarna, who has been a historical activist throughout his life, wanted to see the actual letter in 2011. It had disappeared.
In order to make the letter visible and also protected, a journalist of The Forward began to write about the lost letter. After a search which he initiated, since the name of the owner was known, the letter was found in a basement – unprotected.
Actually seeing the original of the letter has motivated me to study the analysis by Sarna and other scholars. When Sarna was in Jerusalem and spoke about the meaning of the letter, I was present.
I quote from Sarna’s words again. “The letter reframes American religious freedom as a lived constitutional principle forged through minority claims, not merely legal text.”
Now Sarna emphasizes a key point: “Discussions of America’s religious origins are often framed almost exclusively through Christianity, yet this letter suggests that even the nation’s most important founder rejected such a narrow understanding.
“Over time, the letter took on sacred proportions not only for Jews but for anyone who cared about religious liberty. In today’s climate, where debates about religion and America are increasingly shaped by Christian nationalism, the letter stands as a foundational proof text for pluralism.”
My personal experience with pluralism was most fascinating. During the last major American celebration, the Bicentennial in 1976, I was a rabbi in Wilmington, Delaware, before making aliyah the following year. I received information encouraging ministers, priests, and rabbis to plan “American celebratory events” to be funded by the Bicentennial Commission of the US. I applied, the synagogue received a grant, and the cantor and I wrote a “Pageant of Freedom” in song with an original text. Five hundred people – Jews and Christians – attended the event.
Let me introduce Irvin Ungar, the collector of the art of Arthur Szyk. Szyk had disappeared from the scene except for his famous Haggadah. Ungar discovered Szyk art treasures. A major article on Szyk appeared in The New York Times in December 2025.
Szyk moved to the US from England at the beginning of World War II. His art depicting the story of the US had a defining figure, George Washington.
In his award-winning book on Szyk, Arthur Szyk: Soldier in Art, Ungar demonstrates the particular interest of the artist in the freedom he understood was to be found in the US.
“Early on, he was drawn to George Washington and the concept of democracy. And he was mindful of the unique freedoms of American Jews precisely because the United States protects religious liberty and – for the most part – embraces the diversity that inspired its motto ‘E pluribus unum,’ [meaning] ‘Out of many, one.’”
In 1930, Szyk drew his first picture of George Washington, on a horse, leading the American colonist fighters. “This painting and 37 others in this series of Washington and the American Revolution,” Ungar notes in his book, “were completed by Szyk in time for the 200th anniversary of Washington’s birth in 1932.” Bought by the president of Poland, they were presented to President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a gift.
“When FDR delivered his famous ‘Four Freedoms’ speech to Congress in January 1941, the walls of the White House displayed the entire Szyk series.”
For another American historical moment, Ungar describes the drawing, by Szyk, of the Declaration of Independence in this fashion. “All the symbols of the American Revolution are present, most prominently George Washington with hand raised as if in benediction.”
“The text, beautified with color and pattern,” Ungar writes, “highlights the most important words: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”
Ungar points to the meaning of the 1790 letter. “Twenty-four years after these words were written, Washington made it clear in his letter to the Jews of Newport that those inalienable rights, or ‘inherent natural rights’ as he termed them, included religious liberty.”
Prof. Melvin I. Urofsky wrote the book A Genesis of Religious Freedom: The Story of the Jews of Newport, RI, and Touro Synagogue. He added in the book title “including Washington’s letter of 1790.”
As it happens in his book, facing the picture of noted benefactor Judah Touro, he writes: “Although this letter carries with it a unique and cherished significance, in many ways it is a treasure for the entire nation. America, as [Alexis] de Tocqueville famously wrote, had been ‘born free,’ unfettered by the religious and social bigotries of medieval Europe.”
This letter demonstrates “that the United States did not espouse mere toleration, but full liberty of conscience. Freedom of religion in the United States had risen to the level of an inherent natural right, protected by the Constitution and now part of those inalienable rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence.”

From Der Judenstaat to modern Israel: Herzl’s vision in today’s world - opinion
Unknown

13:43:28 KST

February 14 marks 130 years since the publication of Theodor Herzl’s Der Judenstaat (The Jewish State). Published in 1896, it stunned the Jewish world.
It is generally recognized that the catalyst for Herzl writing this pamphlet – or skinny booklet, as it is described – was his experience as the Paris correspondent for the Viennese newspaper Neue Freie Presse. Herzl witnessed the degrading of Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French artillery captain falsely convicted of selling military secrets to Germany. Herzl saw this as an example of the blatant antisemitism pervading Europe. His answer was the creation of a Jewish state where Jews could live without fear of antisemitism. His vision encapsulated that while non-Jews would be welcome, the vast majority would be Jews.
Herzl, an assimilated member of Vienna’s middle class, was not a practicing Jew nor did he speak Hebrew. His ignorance of the Jewish religion saw a future Jewish state as having little to do with Judaism, leading him, at one point, to be prepared to accept Uganda as the home of the Jewish people.
What would Herzl think if he were to return to today’s world? For sure, he would be shocked to find the level at which antisemitism has pervaded the free and so-called enlightened world.
There are those who compare today’s Jew-hatred with the hatred of Jews during the 1930s and 1940s that led to Hitler and the Germans’ annihilation of two-thirds of European Jewry. However, today’s antisemitism is particularly disturbing, as it is not limited to a single country but is practiced in far too many sovereign states throughout the world.
World educated to despise Jews
The current Jew-hatred is the result of an Iran whose supporters and proxies have ensured that the free world is educated to despise Jews. Qatar, with strong ties to Iran, has financed major universities worldwide, guiding students toward the abhorrence of Jews.
Iran’s proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, while unsuccessful in physically eliminating the one Jewish state, have managed to persuade the “enlightened world” that Israel – the victim of Hamas’s attempt to wipe us off the map on October 7, 2023, – is the aggressor.
What the free world is not yet prepared to accept is that Iran is not only an enemy of the Jews; it is an enemy of the entire non-Muslim world.
The clearest evidence of how blind the West is in recognizing this reality is its failure to assist the brave Iranians who came out in their millions on the streets of Tehran (not for the first time), protesting against their leadership and paying the ultimate price.
Due to Iran’s complete blackout of communication, it is difficult to verify the exact number of Iranians who have been brutally murdered, but figures vary, with some quoted as high as 30,000 and beyond.
Where in the free, “enlightened” world are the demonstrators against the murderous Iranian leadership? There are those who find the time and energy to consistently demonstrate against the Jews and Israel but appear to show no sympathy for the countless men, women, and children barbarically murdered by their Iranian leaders.
What we witnessed recently in the center of London were thousands marching in support of Palestine and against Israel while brandishing placards bearing the image of Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, with words underneath reading “The right side of history.” Chants of “Long live the ayatollah” could be heard, and Nazi salutes were visible as demonstrators marched on their way to Downing Street, home of the UK’s prime minister.
Without doubt, what the world desperately requires today is a Churchill, who alone was prepared to confront Hitler in the 1930s. The West is in dire need of such a leader. There is a time to appease and a time to confront, and – without doubt – the time to confront a second Hitler is now.
At the same time, we in Israel need to confront the ever-increasing divisions within our own society, as we are facing one of the most challenging periods in our history. The time is long overdue for self-reflection. We are a split nation, which made us vulnerable to attack on Oct. 7.
Then the country was divided over Justice Minister Yariv Levin’s proposal to weaken the judiciary – a proposal that Levin continues to promote. He also holds the position of deputy prime minister.
Israel, a country without a constitution and devoid of a second house, requires the legal input on proposed law changes. Since 1995, the Supreme Court has the authority to strike down laws passed by the Knesset if they contradict Basic Laws. In January 2024, the Supreme Court determined it has the power to review and possibly strike down even Basic Laws if they violate the “core of Israel’s identity as a Jewish and democratic state.” The court can strike down government decisions or ministerial actions based on the “reasonableness” doctrine.
What Levin aims to achieve would enable the government to do as it pleases, regardless of what is legally or morally correct.
Right now we are witnessing the government’s attempt to remove the attorney-general, its questioning of the validity of the High Court of Justice, and its refusal to recognize Supreme Court President Isaac Amit as its legally elected head.
For more than a year, Levin has failed to convene the Judicial Selection Committee, thereby preventing the appointment of judges to the magistrate and district courts, heavily increasing the burden on the judicial system.
Simultaneously, we face a government bent on passing a budget giving financial support to the ultra-Orthodox sector that continues to refuse to play its part in the defense of this country.
How dangerous is this, at a time when the IDF is short of approximately 10,000 soldiers, including an urgent need for some 7,000 additional combat personnel due to the prolonged conflict in Gaza and other fronts!
The citizens of Israel – relying heavily on those who serve in the IDF – deserve a budget that reflects the contribution made by those who give to the country, rather than those who take and give naught.
One such individual who gave of himself to save others was St.-Sgt.-Maj. Ran Gvili. The entire country, and especially his family, were relieved when his body was returned to his home for burial. Gvili was the last hostage to be released. Extraordinarily brave on Oct. 7, he was among the first to arrive to defend Kibbutz Alumim’s men, women, and children. In spite of being shot twice, Gvili succeeded in killing 14 terrorists before succumbing to his wounds.
On this 130th anniversary of Herzl’s Der Judenstadt, we appreciate how right Herzl was in recognizing the need for a state where Jews would be masters of their own destiny.
The journey to retain the one Jewish state has been fraught with challenges, of which the most testing has been to fight those bent on our destruction time and again. This we have done thanks to the sacrifice of too many – may their memory be as a blessing.
Israel, in spite of those determined to annihilate us, has succeeded in becoming a country achieving way beyond Herzl’s wildest dreams – from the days of the earliest pioneers, who turned a swampland into a country whose desert has produced untold vegetation, to the start-up phenomenon and technological world leader Israel is today, embracing manifold health-promoting discoveries utilized throughout the world.
Herzl would be proud of what the Jewish state has accomplished, and he would be even prouder if we could find a way of coming together.
Am Yisrael chai.

Mark Carney joins hands with Canada opposition leader as he pays tribute to school shooting victims

Canadian prime minister Mark Carney has told residents of Tumbler Ridge that the country is “with you, and we will always be with you”, during a candlelight vigil for the eight victims of a mass shooting that has shattered the small mining town.
The prime minister, holding hands with opposition leader Pierre Poilievre while flanked by First Nations chiefs and local officials, paid tribute to the families enduring the loss of loved ones, after the shooting at a local school that has become one of the most deadly attacks in Canadian history.
“I know that nothing I can say will bring your children home,” the prime minister told nearly 2,000 people huddled in the cold and holding candles. “I know that no words from me or anyone can fill the silence in your homes tonight, and I won’t pretend otherwise.”
On Tuesday, an 18-year-old transgender woman opened fire at the Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, killing five students and a teacher, after earlier killing her mother and stepbrother at home. The attacker then took her own life.
Police recently released the names of the victims from the school, and at the vigil, leaders remembered Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit, Ticaria Lampert, Ezekiel Schofield and educator Shannda Aviugana-Durand.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
“When we leave here tonight and some of you go back to quiet houses, some of you go back to empty rooms, please know that you’re not alone,” Carney said. “Canada is a community that relies on each other’s grace, and may that grace bless us all.”
Earlier in the day, federal leaders walked to the memorial outside the school, meeting for the first time with victims’ families. Both Carney and Poilievre fought back tears as they spoke with victims’ families for the first time.
The two, who have clashed politically in recent weeks, have set aside partisan differences in order to show a unified front – a move welcomed by residents of the town.
“Today, there are no Conservatives. There are no Liberals, New Democrats, Greens or Bloc Quebecois” said Poilivre. “We are all just mothers and fathers. We all watch our kids going to school, expecting them to come back to us”.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace” and the two leaders joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall.
Leaders praised the acts of heroism and courage they said defined the town and its residents. British Columbia premier David Eby singled out one teacher who “did everything right” by barricading students in a classroom, even though his own son had left the class to use the bathroom. Eby credited older students for comforting and protecting younger students.
Eby also promisedthe students that, under no circumstances, would any be forced to return to the school. “We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school.”
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
Mayor Darryl Krakowka told the community to “make space” for each other, warning that the coming days would reveal the immense difficulty of returning to the routine of daily life. But he praised their resilience.
“Tumbler Ridge has been shaken, but not broken.”

Colombia resumes spraying drug crops with drones
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
BOGOTÁ – Colombia has resumed spraying drug fields with a toxic chemical using drones, the US embassy in Bogota said on Feb 13, after a meeting between the two nations’ leaders
The South American nation in 2015 suspended the aerial spraying of glyphosate, which has been linked to cancer in humans, over concerns about its negative health impact.
US President Donald Trump and leftist counterpart Gustavo Petro met last week at the White House to smooth diplomatic tensions that had been building over the last year.
They pledged to resume historic military cooperation between Washington and Bogota, and to jointly combat guerrilla groups and drug cartels.
Mr Petro’s government announced in December that it would resume the spraying of drug crops under growing pressure from the Trump administration, which is demanding a tougher anti-drug policy in the world’s top cocaine producer.
“Colombia has launched drone eradication of coca crops” with support from the US government, Washington’s mission in Bogota wrote on social media on Feb 13.
“This technology could be game-changing: Lower coca cultivation, more security in Colombia, less deadly drugs reaching American streets, and more lives saved.”
The Colombian justice ministry presented the new drug crop eradication policy in December.
It said drones would fly 1.5m above coca fields and carry out “controlled” spraying to prevent the chemical from affecting communities.
Since taking office in 2022, Mr Petro has followed a “total peace” policy to disband all armed groups through dialogue.
But six months before he leaves office, the efforts have yielded few results, forcing the president to shift towards a tougher war on drugs. AFP

US used Claude AI tool to capture Maduro, violating developer’s terms — WSJ

NEW YORK, February 14. /TASS/. During their operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the US military used Claude AI tool, despite the developer’s prohibition to use the technology to facilitate violence, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) newspaper reported citing sources.
The developer Anthropic’s user guidelines prohibit the use of the technology to facilitate violence, develop weapons or conduct surveillance.
"We cannot comment on whether Claude, or any other AI model, was used for any specific operation, classified or otherwise," an Anthropic spokesman was quoted as saying. "Any use of Claude—whether in the private sector or across government—is required to comply with our Usage Policies, which govern how Claude can be deployed. We work closely with our partners to ensure compliance."
In late January, WSJ reported that a contract between the Pentagon and Anthropic worth approximately $200 million was under the threat of being cancelled because of differences on the use of artificial intelligence technologies to spy on people on the US territory.

LOS ANGELES – The Los Angeles 2028 Olympics chief Casey Wasserman is putting his talent and marketing agency up for sale, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb 13, following criticism for f lirtatious e-mail exchanges with convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell
Mr Wasserman has been criticised and called on to resign as the LA28 chief after the release of messages. His firm too has lost a client, with pop star Chappell Roan saying earlier this week she was no longer represented by his company
Mr Wasserman has denied having a personal or business relationship with late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. He has previously apologised for his association with Maxwell, saying their relationship came before her or Epstein’s crimes were revealed.
Mr Wasserman’s talent agency did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
According to the Journal, Mr Wasserman told his firm’s staff in an internal memo that he felt that he had “become a distraction” to its work and had begun the process of selling the company.
“I’m deeply sorry that my past personal mistakes have caused you so much discomfort,” Mr Wasserman wrote in the memo, reported by the newspaper.
“It’s not fair to you, and it’s not fair to the clients and partners we represent so vigorously and care so deeply about,” he wrote.
The LA28 said earlier this week that Mr Wasserman will remain chairman of the 2028 games after organisers conducted a review of his past interactions with Maxwell and Epstein, and found his relationship with them did not go beyond what had already been publicly documented. REUTERS

Over 177,000 Russian soldiers killed in Ukraine identified by media investigation

Russian independent media outlet Mediazona, in collaboration with the BBC Russian service, has confirmed the identities of 177,433 Russian military personnel killed in Ukraine as of Feb. 13.
Since the media outlets' last update in early February, the names of 9,291 Russian soldiers have been added to the list of casualties.
The journalists note that the actual figures are likely significantly higher, as their verified information comes from public sources such as obituaries, posts by relatives, regional media reports, and statements from local authorities.
The confirmed death toll now includes over 57,200 volunteers, 21,400 recruited prisoners, and 17,000 mobilized soldiers, according to the media outlets. A total of 6,414 officers have also been confirmed to have been killed.
While Moscow does not disclose its casualty figures at all, President Volodymyr Zelensky told France TV in an interview on Feb. 4 that at least 55,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed on the battlefield since the start of Russia's full-scale war. Kyiv largely avoided commenting on its losses for the first two years of the full-scale invasion, until Zelensky announced in February 2024 that 31,000 Ukrainian troops had been killed.
Zelensky also told France TV that Russia would continue to incur staggering losses if it attempted to conquer all of eastern Ukraine by force of arms. His comments come amid the latest round of trilateral peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the U.S., where the status of Ukraine's eastern Donbas territory remains a major point of contention in negotiations.
Despite the heavy losses, Russia has been able to make marginal advances in Ukraine's front line region as it is able to offset its casualties through fresh contract soldiers. The Ukrainian open-source mapping project DeepState reported that Russian forces occupied 4,336 square kilometers (1,674 square miles) of Ukrainian territory in 2025, accounting for less than 1% of the country
The General Staff of Ukraine's Armed Forces estimates that as of Feb. 13, Russia has lost around 1,250,950 troops in Ukraine since Feb. 22, 2022. The figures do not specify killed or wounded, though the overall consensus is that it includes dead, wounded, missing, and captured.
Mediazona published the complete list of identified casualties for the first time in February, marking three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. According to the publication, volunteers manually enter and verify each record to prevent duplicate entries in the database.

Saudi Arabia rethinks its cultural policy as foreign interests vie for funding

Riyadh, January 29. An unusual parade set off through the new arty JAX hub, a string of former industrial warehouses transformed into cultural spaces. Located on the outskirts of the Saudi capital, it hosted the third edition of the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale. Pick-up trucks and camels moved side by side through the streets, before the beat of drums took over. The performance culminated in a grand finale, a concert put together by Saudi artist and rapper Mohammed Alhamdan, blending Bedouin songs with electronic music. The message was clear: The Wahhabi kingdom is changing rapidly, but not breaking with its roots. "This is not folklore. People here are very young, hyperconnected – they know what's happening in the world," said Sabih Ahmed, co-curator of this Biennale with Nora Razian, which had a distinctly Global South orientation.
Western artists have become a rare sight here, with the exception of Frenchman Théo Mercier, whose immense sand sculptures evoke a world in decay, somewhere between ruined data centers and fossilized cars. Instead, attention shifted to the Palestinians Taysir Batniji and Hazem Harb, who each, with restraint, referenced the suffering of Gaza. Or to Colombian Daniel Otero Torres, who paid tribute to slain environmental defenders in Latin America. Ahmed explained, "We don't want to show what the West expects to see, but rather connections that are the very opposite of the tired, one-dimensional clichés served up by CNN."

CNN’s Kaitlan Collins reacts to Trump scolding her to smile after she asked about the Epstein files: ‘It’s not about me’
‘It’s not a laughing matter, I don’t think, to talk about sex trafficking victims,’ Collins told the Absolutely Not podcast

Kaitlan Collins has said she was not “fazed” after Donald Trump deflected her question about the Epstein files by complaining she never smiled, but said the president’s reaction had been “revealing” about his attitude towards the issue.
“It’s not a laughing matter, I don’t think, to talk about sex trafficking victims. And I’ve interviewed a lot of these women who were underage girls at the time and their stories are powerful,” the CNN anchor told the Absolutely Not podcast Wednesday.
During the exchange, Collins asked about justice for the women victimized by Epstein's operation, causing the president to become angry and begin ranting about CNN and calling her "the worst reporter."
He then complained that she never smiled. "You know she's a young woman," Trump said to the rest of the room before redirecting to Collins. "I don't think I've ever seen you smile."
“In that moment, I was thinking, the question is about what these victims think,” Collins said. “It wasn’t even anything accusatory of Trump himself, which I think in itself is revealing of how he thinks about it and how he is viewing it through the lens of himself.
“It’s not about me. It’s not about me smiling and my expressions. It’s what these women think about what your administration has done. And so I think that’s why that moment resonated with so many people because just the issue at hand.”
Collins said that having covered Trump for 10 years he “doesn’t really surprise me that often with his responses,” but given the seriousness of the topic it had resonated with her especially, prompting her steely response.
Trump also lashed out at Collins in December, describing her as “always Stupid and Nasty” in a Truth Social post, and has been consistent in his attacks on other female journalists who have questioned him in the Oval Office and on press trips.
Last week, while flying to Florida on Air Force One, Trump lashed out at another reporter, telling her she had a “very bad attitude” after she questioned him over a reported split within the MAGA base over his immigration agenda.
“Where are you from?” the president asked The Washington Post reporter Natalie Allison. “Washington Post? Are you having a hard time getting readers? The Washington Post is doing very poorly… You have a very bad attitude. Go ahead.”
Despite the president’s use of childish and degrading language towards female reporters taking a notable uptick in the last year, the White House has insisted previously that the insults are “nothing to do with gender.”
“President Trump has never been politically correct, never holds back, and in large part, the American people re-elected him for his transparency,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told The Independent in December.
“This has nothing to do with gender – it has everything to do with the fact that the president’s and the public’s trust in the media is at all time lows.”

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. Almost 21,000 bribe-related crimes were exposed in Russia in 2025, which is the record-high number over the past few years, according to the Russian Interior Ministry’s statistics obtained by TASS.
In all, 20,918 such crimes were exposed in Russia in 2025, which is approximately 25% higher than in 2024, when the figure stood at almost 17,000. This includes over 8,500 bribe-taking crimes, almost 9,000 bribe-giving crimes and almost 3,600 cases of mediation. Compared to 2024, the growth in these categories will be 12%, 30%, and 39%, respectively.

Mistrial declared in case of students charged after Stanford pro-Palestinian protests

A judge declared a mistrial on Friday in a case of five current and former Stanford University students related to the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests when demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the school president's office.
Twelve protesters were initially charged last year with felony vandalism, according to prosecutors who said at least one suspect entered the building by breaking a window. Police arrested 13 people on June 5, 2024, in connection with the incident, and the university said the building sustained "extensive" damage.
The case was tried in Santa Clara County Superior Court against five defendants charged with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. The rest previously accepted plea deals or diversion programs.
The jury was deadlocked. It voted nine to three to convict on the felony charge of vandalism and eight to four to convict on the felony charge to trespass. Jurors failed to reach a verdict after deliberations.
The charges were among the most serious against participants in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protest movement on US colleges in which demonstrators demanded an end to Israel's war in Gaza and Washington's support for its ally, along with a divestment of funds by their universities from companies supporting Israel.
District Attorney seeks new trial
Prosecutors in the case said the defendants engaged in unlawful property destruction.
"This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else's property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. That is against the law," Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement, adding he sought a new trial.
Anthony Brass, a lawyer for one of the protesters, told the New York Times his side was not defending lawlessness but "the concept of transparency and ethical investment."
"This is a win for these young people of conscience and a win for free speech," Brass said, adding, "humanitarian activism has no place in a criminal courtroom."
Protesters had renamed the building "Dr. Adnan's Office" after Adnan Al-Bursh, a Palestinian doctor who died in an Israeli prison after months of detention.
Over 3,000 were arrested during the 2024 US pro-Palestinian protest movement, according to media tallies. Some students faced suspension, expulsion, and degree revocation.

Specialists neutralize Russian drone equipped with anti-tank mines in Poltava region
The Poltava regional police stated this on its website, according to Ukrinform.
After another air attack, a Geran-2 strike drone was discovered in a field in one of the communities of the Poltava region. It was equipped with KPTM-3 submunitions and a main warhead that had not detonated. Police bomb disposal experts in the Poltava region who arrived at the scene neutralized the dangerous findings and transported them to a special demolition site for further destruction.
It is noted that KPTM-3 mines are extremely insidious: they are fitted with a magnetic target sensor and a self-destruct mechanism that can be triggered without direct contact, reacting to the approach of vehicles. Even a downed or crashed UAV may remain active and pose a deadly threat.
As Ukrinform previously reported, explosive ordnance disposal specialists from the Poltava regional police also neutralized the warheads of a missile and a UAV.

Danish PM says more Greenland talks due after meeting US’s Marco Rubio
New opinion poll finds seven in 10 US adults disapprove of President Donald Trump’s handling of Greenland issue.
Denmark’s prime minister and Greenland’s premier met with United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio and agreed that talks would be pursued on the running of Greenland, the semi-autonomous Danish territory that President Donald Trump has threatened to take over.
Rubio held a 15-minute meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenland’s Premier Jens-Frederik Nielsen on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Friday.

Greenland’s leader Nielsen said in a post on social media that during the meeting with Rubio, “it was emphasised that the conversations being made are the right way forward and the interests of Greenland were once again clearly highlighted”.
Prime Minister Frederiksen said on X after the meeting: “Constructive talk with Secretary of State Marco Rubio together with Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Chairman of Naalakkersuisut, at the Munich Security Conference.”
“Work will continue as agreed in the high-level working group,” she said.
The meeting between the Danish and Greenlandic leaders and the US state secretary comes amid severely strained ties between Europe and Washington, and NATO allies, amid President Trump’s repeated threats to take over Greenland and criticism of European nations as “decaying” and “weak”.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said, “We’re negotiating right now for Greenland.”
“I think Greenland’s going to want us, but we get along very well with Europe. We’ll see how it all works out,” he said.
After months of bellicose language regarding the US’s necessity to acquire Greenland, Trump abruptly stepped back from his threats last month, saying that he had reached an understanding with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte that would give the US greater influence in the mineral-rich Arctic territory.
Late last month, the US, Denmark and Greenland also launched talks to find a diplomatic path out of the crisis.
Poll finds most US adults disapprove of Trump’s Greenland plan
The US administration has cited key national security concerns related to Russia and China to justify its demand to take control over Greenland and has accused Denmark, and Europe more broadly, of being unable to defend the strategic territory.
But, according to a new opinion poll conducted by The Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, Trump’s push to seize control of Greenland has gone down badly with the US public and members of his own party.
The survey, conducted between February 5-8, found that about seven in 10 US adults disapprove of how Trump is handling the Greenland issue – a higher disapproval rating than the share of those who dislike how he is handling foreign policy generally.
Even among Republican supporters, about half disapprove of his attempt to turn Greenland into US territory, according to the poll.
Sweden said on Thursday that it would send fighter jets to patrol Greenland as part of a newly launched NATO mission in the Arctic aimed at placating Trump’s concerns over the threats posed by Moscow and Beijing.
The government said in a statement that Swedish-made Gripen fighter jets would patrol Greenland as part of the newly-launched NATO mission, Arctic Sentry.
“As a NATO ally, Sweden has a responsibility to contribute to the security of the entire territory of the Alliance. The Arctic region is becoming increasingly important from a strategic perspective,” Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said.
In a separate statement, the Swedish Armed Forces said the fighter jets would be based out of Iceland, where six aircraft have been stationed since early February as part of the rotating incident response force, NATO Air Policing.
Swedish special forces would also be sent to Greenland to take part in training exercises for a couple of weeks, the military said.

US ambassador to NATO believes China could stop Russia's war in Ukraine with one call
US Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker has said that China is providing decisive support to Russia's aggression against Ukraine and could end the war with a single phone call.
Source: Bloomberg
Quote from Whitaker: "China could call Vladimir Putin and end this war tomorrow and cut off his dual-purpose technologies that they're selling."
Details: Whitaker added that Beijing could also stop its purchases of Russian oil and gas.
Quote from Whitaker: "You know, this war is being completely enabled by China."
Details: Bloomberg reported that China and Russia have forged even closer ties since the beginning of the full-scale war, with Moscow relying on Beijing for the supply of critical parts and components for drones and other military equipment.
China has also once again become the largest buyer of Russian crude oil, despite increasing international pressure on Moscow's vital oil trade.
Tracking data shows that Chinese ports unloaded 1.65 million barrels of oil per day in January, which is the highest level since March 2024 and the second-largest monthly volume since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Despite this, Beijing has repeatedly said it wants to play a "constructive" role in resolving the war. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met his Ukrainian counterpart Andrii Sybiha in Munich this week and offered humanitarian assistance to the country as it continues to defend itself against Russian attacks.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. BRICS member countries are working to create an exchange of precious metals, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov told TASS in an interview.
"Apart from a common investment platform, which the minister [Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov] was talking about, there is also an idea to create a special platform designed to work in special economic zones, which practically all BRICS members have," he said. "There is also a recent, but very important, initiative to create an exchange of precious metals, along with a grain exchange."
During Russia’s BRICS chairmanship in 2024, at the Kazan summit, a number of Russian initiatives were adopted for implementation, including alternative payment platforms, mechanisms for settlements in national currencies, reinsurance facilities for intra-BRICS trade and with BRICS partners, the establishment of a grain exchange, and a new investment platform.
Commenting on these initiatives, Ryabkov said "there are all reasons and prerequisites for something tangible to emerge" in that regard.

China’s foreign minister tells EU diplomats not to blame Beijing for bloc’s problems

BEIJING - China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his French and German counterparts that Beijing was not to blame for Europe’s economic and security problems
Mr Wang made the comments at a meeting with France’s Jean-Noel Barrot and Germany’s Johann Wadephul on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb 13.
He sought to promote China as a reliable partner of the European Union at a time when the bloc is trying to reduce its dependence on both Beijing and an increasingly unpredictable Washington.
“China’s development is an opportunity for Europe, and Europe’s challenges do not come from China,” Mr Wang said, according to the statement.
Warning that “unilateralism, protectionism, and power politics” were on the rise globally, he said he hoped Europe would “pursue a rational and pragmatic policy towards China”.
“The two sides are partners, not adversaries; interdependence is not a risk; intertwined interests are not a threat; and open cooperation will not harm security.”
The meeting came against the backdrop of trade tensions between the two giant economies and disputes over what the EU sees as China’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine.
The EU is seeking to cut its reliance on China for strategic goods like rare earths while also rebalancing a trade relationship that sees it run a large deficit with the world’s second-largest economy.
In recent years, the two sides have clashed over Chinese electric-vehicle exports, which threaten Europe’s car industry and which Brussels argues are based on unfair subsidies, and Chinese tariffs on EU goods ranging from cheese to cognac.
Mr Wang urged Germany and France to help “give a clear direction for the development of China-Europe relations”.
In a separate meeting with Mr Wadephul – also on Feb 13 – Mr Wang touted economic and trade cooperation as “the cornerstone of China-Germany ties”, according to a Foreign Ministry readout.
Mr Wang also met Britain’s Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper, telling her that Beijing and London should “explore more potential for cooperation”, while the two sides also discussed Ukraine and Iran. AFP

Elderly man mistakenly kidnapped from Sydney’s north-west: police
Updated ,first published
Police say a trio of kidnappers took the wrong person and are appealing for the return of an elderly man who was abducted from his bedroom in northern Sydney.
Officers have called on the kidnappers to relinquish Chris Baghsarian, who they fear may be hurt and who needs daily medication. They said the widower and grandfather was not the intended target, and lives alone at his North Ryde home.
“You have the wrong person,” said Detective Acting Superintendent Andrew Marks, in a direct appeal to the abductors. “If there’s a member of the kidnap crew who has any common decency, tell us where he is and we’ll do the rest.”
Baghsarian’s neighbours called police at 5am on Friday, after hearing a commotion. One witness, Felix Cho, told Channel 9 he heard glass smashing, “the screaming that just kept going” and dogs barking before a car took off down the street.
Detectives are investigating whether the intended target was someone linked to the Alameddine crime network.
Police found signs of forced entry to the home.
“They took Mr Baghsarian when they were at home in the bedroom, they bundled him into a car and took him to a location that we do not know,” Marks said.
Police believe there were up to three kidnappers, who drove a dark-coloured Toyota SUV. A burnt-out vehicle matching that description was found in nearby South Turramurra.
Baghsarian, who Marks said required daily medication and medical treatment, had been wearing a blue and maroon flannelette shirt and grey tracksuit pants.
Officers were worried he had been hurt. “We always fear for the safety of the hostage and we believe he may have been harmed, but we’re not sure,” Marks said.
Baghsarian’s family, which Marks said was not involved in any criminal activity, was worried. “They’re quite surprised that this has happened and what they want is the safe return of their father,” he said.
Anyone with information about his whereabouts is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.

Trauma and defiance: Life and death of 17-year-old killed fighting Israel

Trauma and defiance: Life and death of 17-year-old killed fighting Israel
Wael Mesheh, from the West Bank, had wanted to study. But his life took a turn after being imprisoned by Israel.
Nablus, occupied West Bank – Before he was killed by an Israeli drone 18 months ago at the young age of 17, Wael Mesheh was an aspiring university student who wanted to be a successful computer programmer.
But having seen five of his relatives and friends cut down by Israeli forces during almost daily raids of his northern West Bank refugee camp of Balata, the Palestinian teenager came to believe that life and death were the same, engendering a desire to sacrifice himself for the cause of Palestinian freedom, and therefore turning himself – in his belief – into a “martyr”.

“What our family was suffering planted this desire inside him: He always knew he wanted to fight and see his country without occupation,” Wael’s 47-year-old father, Belal, told Al Jazeera.
“And it was not just Wael, but many of his generation in the camp.”
Before he turned 17, Wael had been imprisoned for throwing stones at Israeli soldiers, assaulted in jail, and then freed in a prisoner exchange deal.
He joined the Qassam Brigades – the armed wing of Hamas – once he got out of prison, and was eventually killed in August 2024 while fighting Israeli troops near his home in Balata, southeast of Nablus.
Wael’s story is typical of many young Palestinians in the West Bank’s refugee camps. Children learn from an early age that trauma will define their lives in ways even other Palestinians are spared.
Psychologists from the West Bank told Al Jazeera young people in the camps face “incessant traumatisation”, and most are deprived of “safety, places to play, opportunities, and a chance to escape”.
Instead, as the offspring of refugees denied the right to return to their homeland, they face a life surrounded by poverty, death, and Israeli military violence.
They are part of Palestinian society, yet remain marginalised within it – without the sense of belonging others take for granted.
The conditions endured by those in the camps make them a breeding ground for armed resistance to Israel.
Belal says that it was Wael’s time in prison that eventually pushed him to fight. He says that Wael was tortured by guards for being defiant, and was kept in solitary confinement. He was eventually released as part of the November 2023 prisoner exchange deal, at the start of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.
Defenders of the camps
The West Bank’s 19 refugee camps, once makeshift tented communities when they were established in 1948 after Israel’s founding and intended to be temporary, are now densely populated built-up areas housing the descendants of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
The older generations remember being forcibly expelled from their homes in historical Palestine by Zionist militias in the 1948 Nakba to pave the way for the creation of an Israeli state.
The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) describes the camps as dominated by poverty, severe overcrowding, and joblessness. The camps are also the primary targets of Israeli military operations in the West Bank.
Without the prospect of a normal childhood for their occupants, the lure of fighting Israel can often prove irresistible.
Nablus-based psychologist, Nisreen Bsharat, said “martyrdom”, particularly for those in the camps, is viewed as the ultimate demonstration of faith and resilience.
Bsharat, who works with young people and grieving mothers from Balata, said martyrdom is seen as a “’heroic’ contribution to Palestine”, and that martyrs and their families are celebrated as such.
Those who fight against Israel are seen as “role models” when so few opportunities exist in refugee camps, Bsharat added.
“Historically, martyrdom is tied to our national identity,” she said. “It’s seen as the least we can offer our homeland, and part of our duty.”
Though far from an exclusively Islamic concept, Palestinians often refer to those who are killed by Israeli forces as martyrs, believing they sacrifice their lives fighting for their nation, Islam, and the Holy Land – and believe that God promises them their place in paradise.
Bethlehem-based clinical psychologist and academic, Amanda Manasra, who was born in Aida refugee camp, and focuses on trauma in Palestine, told Al Jazeera the vast majority of camp residents live with untreated complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD), which is significantly more difficult to cure.
The harsh environment of the camps creates a revolutionary fervour that is far less common in wealthier areas, Manasra added.
“The idea of martyrdom is related to how Palestinians find meaning to deal with hardship, individually and collectively,” she said.
“Many of my cases are adolescent men from the camps – many former prisoners – who have lost so many friends and family members.
“Joining the resistance is about taking control – it can feel like a reward for experiencing hardship, and can satisfy feelings of retribution.
“The fighters feel they have survived, persisted, and beaten the occupation war machine.”
Camps in the northern West Bank came under even more relentless attack since Israel launched “Operation Iron Wall” in January 2025, which has displaced tens of thousands of refugees in nearby Jenin and Tulkarem, and killed hundreds.
Psychological toll
Belal, who spent eight years in Palestinian Authority (PA) prison during Wael’s childhood, feels the pain of his son’s loss deeply.
They both had only ever known the narrow, labyrinthine streets and decrepit buildings of Balata, the most populous refugee camp in the West Bank. But Belal feels that he wasn’t able to be there to guide Wael through them.
“I didn’t get the chance to see Wael growing up, or spend time with him as all other fathers do,” he said, unable to fight back his tears.
“I envy his mother and brother because at least they lived with him. They have beautiful and plentiful memories with him, shared moments.
“Do you know what it feels like to carry your son on your shoulders, place him in his grave, and bury him with your own hands? It is the hardest thing in the world.”
Belal, whose brother was also killed by Israel when he was younger, said he and his son had so many plans for when he would be released from prison.
In the end, Belal was freed only on compassionate grounds so he could see Wael for the final time before he was buried.
Israel’s actions breed hatred
For those in Nablus’s refugee camps, violent incidents like Wael’s killing are nearly a weekly reality – and a doom-laden reminder that death lurks around every corner.
Belal recalled Wael becoming deeply affected as a child by the 20-year imprisonment of his closest uncle, after whom he was named. Later, he became preoccupied with avenging those close to him whose lives he says Israel had stolen. Four of Wael’s cousins had been killed in the 12 months preceding his death.
“Of course, it was also the constant invasions and the violence he grew up around, and the barbaric way the soldiers treat us,” Belal told Al Jazeera.
“Every night, we experience the atmosphere of Israel’s raids. We’re forced to accept this life – we have no choice but to adjust.”
Belal said that when Wael was growing up, there were no youth clubs or even parks that could take his mind off the harsh life in the camp. He added that soldiers had once raided the family’s house and destroyed “literally everything”.
“It’s actions like these that breed hatred toward them.”
Belal specifically remembered Wael, who had just begun high school, being enraged by footage of Israeli soldiers beating women in Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, one of Islam’s holiest sites.
“Wael couldn’t accept that soldiers would beat women and girls,” he said. “It was intolerable for him.”
Wael’s surviving family live in a crowded second-floor apartment near the centre of the camp, and his father, two of his brothers, his little sister, and his grieving mother took turns tearfully eulogising him.
His mother, Hanadi, was beaten, and his brother, Ibrahim, was also detained as soldiers broke into their apartment late at night to arrest Wael.
Hanadi was shocked by Wael’s condition once he was released from prison.
“The marks of torture remained on his body even after his release,” she said. “Burn scars from extinguished cigarettes were visible on his back and hands.”
Refugee camps under siege
Balata has often been a target for the Israeli military, and, according to the UN, 30 people have been killed in the camp since Israel intensified its attacks on the West Bank following Hamas’s October 7 attacks.
The pictures of Palestinians killed fighting Israel are emblazoned, like shrines, on the camp’s walls.
About 33,000 people are crammed into Balata’s narrow streets. It spans an area of 0.25 square kilometres (0.1sq miles), and has one of the highest rates of unemployment and food insecurity anywhere in the territory, according to UNRWA.
On August 15, Wael and two other fighters rushed to confront an incursion of Israeli soldiers when they were struck by a drone on the camp’s main street. Wael and fellow fighter Ahmad Khalil were killed instantly, while four others, including children, were injured.
Hanadi described the camp being surrounded by soldiers while gunshots rang close by, as she comforted her younger children.
“The moment I heard the sound of the missile, I knew he had been martyred,” she said.
“I started praying for God to accept him and to give me strength to bear this calamity.
“I also prayed that his face would remain unharmed because he always wished his face wouldn’t be disfigured so we could say our goodbyes to him properly.”
Tsunami of trauma
Manasra said there is a tsunami of untreated mental health problems across the West Bank, while services remain hopelessly stretched, underfunded, and inaccessible for most.
She says the glorification surrounding resistance to Israel and martyrdom also obscures a more difficult reality of unprocessed grief and trauma that lingers with individuals and families forever.
Supporting families in the camps like Belal’s is nearly impossible when services are so costly and restricted, she says.
Without any such mental health support, Belal spoke of his suffering and told Al Jazeera that, since his son’s death, “joy has not entered our house”.
“We may smile or laugh at each other to show politeness, but inside, it’s different,” he added.
“Inside, there’s only fire – and pain.”
Too often, the burden of resistance falls on the poorest residents of the West Bank’s refugee camps.
In each case, the reason for resisting is different. But there are nearly always similarities: Hardship, piety, retribution, and a sense of duty to one’s country.
The pride found in resisting only briefly distracts from the deep scars left by Israel’s occupation, which is tightening its grip over the West Bank – particularly in the refugee camps.
The surviving families of those killed are left somewhere between terrible grief and hopeful adulation.
“When I sit alone, I imagine Wael beside me,” Belal added.
“Sometimes, I feel like hugging his picture tightly to my chest as I cry my heart out.
“He was a role model even for me. I bid him farewell with complete serenity – I know God will accept him as a martyr.”

Senate Democrats seek probe of reported UAE stake in Trump family’s crypto company
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – Two Democratic members of the US Senate Banking Committee on Feb 13 asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to examine the potential national security implications of a reported purchase of a US$500 million (S$631.8 million) stake in the Trump family’s cryptocurrency venture
Senators Elizabeth Warren and Andy Kim asked Mr Bessent, who heads the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), to determine whether a CFIUS review is required of the 49 per cent UAE stake in World Liberty Financial
CFIUS is a Treasury-led interagency committee that vets foreign investments for national security risks, including top officials from the Defence, State, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice departments.
In a letter viewed by Reuters, they asked Mr Bessent to respond to several questions about the transaction by March 5, including whether CFIUS had reviewed the deal in any form, or submitted any recommendations to Republican President Donald Trump about it.
The Treasury had no immediate comment on the letter.
“The transaction raises significant national security concerns,” the senators said in the letter.
Ms Warren and other Democratic senators have repeatedly raised questions about World Liberty Financial, which was founded two months before Mr Trump’s November 2024 victory in the US presidential election, and potential conflicts of interest.
The firm was announced by businessman Steve Witkoff, who is now a key Trump envoy.
Mr Trump’s aides have said he has handed over control of his business ventures, which are being reviewed by outside ethics lawyers.
Ms Warren and Mr Kim said CFIUS had a “clear mandate to address potential national security risks from foreign investments, including transactions that could allow foreign governments like China or the UAE to access critical technology or the sensitive personal data of US citizens”.
They said the reported deal raised questions about whether the UAE or China might be able to access any of the “sensitive personal information” that World Liberty Financial says it collects, they wrote.
The Wall Street Journal in January reported that G42, a company backed by Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, who manages the UAE’s largest wealth fund and is a member of the Gulf nation’s royal family, bought the stake in World Liberty Financial days before Mr Trump began his second term in January 2025.
Months later, the Trump administration approved the sale of advanced artificial intelligence chips to the UAE.
World Liberty is behind the stablecoin USD1, which is pegged to the US dollar and backed by short-term US government Treasuries, US dollar deposits and other cash equivalents.
The company counts Mr Trump and Mr Witkoff as co-founders emeritus, and is run by members of the Trump and Witkoff families.

'Can a souffle rise once?': Albanese takes first swipe at new Opposition leaders

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has borrowed from a sharp-tongued predecessor to launch his first attack on new Opposition leader Angus Taylor, asking "can a souffle rise once?"
Albanese played on an infamous insult from former prime minister Paul Keating, who asked whether a souffle rises twice when Liberal Andrew Peacock mounted a challenge to regain the party leadership in 1989.
"Angus Taylor presents us with a new question: can a souffle rise once?" Albanese said during a speech to the NSW Labor Country Conference in Orange on Saturday.
It was the prime minister's first public comment on Taylor's toppling of Sussan Ley in a long-anticipated Liberal leadership spill.
Taylor's 34-to-17-vote win on Friday brought down the Liberals' first female leader just nine months after she took the top job.
Labor reaction to leadership change
Albanese said Taylor and his new deputy Senator Jane Hume had both damaged their party with their various opposition to tax cuts, cost-of-living relief and renewable energy.
"It is extraordinary that they have had eight months of plotting in order to deliver the two people to the leadership positions who more than anyone else on their entire show were responsible for alienating the Liberals from the Australian voters," he said.
"But that is what they have done. Every single challenge that is before us, they have failed on."
Within minutes of the change of leadership, the federal government rolled out online attack ads criticising Taylor's record as a minister and shadow treasurer.
Federal minister Murray Watt said the spill would do little for the Coalition.
"The Liberal Party has completely lost touch with the vast majority of Australians and what they care about," Senator Watt told reporters in Sydney on Friday.
"There is no evidence to date that Angus Taylor has any solutions for those challenges."
Treasurer Jim Chalmers said Taylor's record was shambolic.
"Angus has zero credibility on the economy and neither does the bin fire that is the coalition," he said.
Taylor pledges to prioritise 'standard of living'
Just days after reuniting the Coalition with Ley at the helm, Nationals leader David Littleproud said Taylor would be the right person to lead the Opposition back into government.
"Angus is the leader Australia needs to take up the fight against Labor's reckless spending and ideology," he said.
"Angus can offer hope to aspirant Australians and those who are struggling to enter the housing market."
Speaking after his win on Friday, Taylor said his first priority would be to restore Australia's standard of living, which he said "has collapsed under a rotten Labor government".
"They do not know how to manage this economy, [the] result is Australians are getting poorer, their standard of living [is] going backwards — not just in absolute terms, but relative to peer countries around the world," he told reporters.
Ley announced she would resign from parliament in the coming weeks after losing the leadership, triggering a by-election in her NSW seat of Farrer.
One Nation leader Pauline Hanson said her party would field a candidate in the upcoming by-election.

Freed hostage Arbel Yehoud breaks silence: 'I tried to end it three times'

More than a year has passed since Arbel Yehoud was freed from captivity after 482 days in what she describes as the hell of Gaza. Four months have gone by since she was reunited with her partner, Ariel Cunio, who was held for 738 days. Yet even now, Arbel struggles to speak about the horrors she endured, leaving them, in her words, in a “closed suitcase.” “What I went through, I went through from beginning to end, almost every day in captivity,” she said, declining to elaborate.
In a joint interview with Channel 12 News, Arbel said that after Ariel Cunio was released in the latest hostage deal in October, they "sat a little to the side and started talking. Then it dawned on both of us that he didn’t know anything about what I went through in captivity.”
“Even if I understood, I didn’t want to accept it in any way,” Ariel said of the day of his release and the painful conversation that followed. “Then you get punched in the stomach. It feels like your world has collapsed. By the end of that day, you could see it on me. I fainted. I started convulsing. My body just collapsed.”
Arbel said she had been determined to hold everything in until Ariel returned. “He is the person closest to me, the one I want to share with and tell. And we’re not there yet. It’s very hard. I so appreciate and admire and love the hostages who manage to sit down and open their mouths. To tell it, to open up their trauma.”
She said the shift for her came after former hostage Romi Gonen revealed the sexual harassment she endured in captivity, beginning on the fourth day. “I was repressing it well until then,” Arbel said.
Referring to Gonen’s account of meeting other female hostages in a tunnel and realizing she was in worse condition than the others, Arbel said she identified with much of what Gonen described, particularly the gap she felt when she encountered the other women.
“But even after I saw the horrors Romi had to endure, the gap remained. Because it was for so, so long. What I went through, I went through from beginning to end,” she said.
In a separate interview with the Daily Mail, Arbel said that what Gonen endured “I went through almost every day in captivity.” She was held alone throughout that period and said she attempted to take her own life on several occasions. “I tried to end it three times,” she said. “I felt I couldn’t go on. There were moments when I thought it was the only way out.”
What kept her alive, she said, was her love for Ariel, from whom she was separated after the two were abducted together. “Every time I remembered Ariel, it gave me the strength to keep breathing,” she said of her suicidal thoughts.
Arbel declined to provide further details about the abuse but said she was held in complete isolation, starved and subjected to psychological, sexual and physical abuse, including the breaking of two ribs.
Recalling their abduction on October 7, she said: “I put my hand over our dog’s mouth so she wouldn’t bark, but it didn’t help. They found us, dragged us outside and shot Merv in front of our eyes. We heard her crying until she died.” Arbel was beaten, and Ariel suffered severe blows to the head until he bled. Ariel’s brother David, his wife Sharon and their children were also abducted. Arbel’s brother Dolev was initially listed as missing and was later confirmed killed. Three hours after being taken into Gaza, the couple were separated and sent to different hiding places.
“I drove them crazy with questions about her,” Ariel said. “I wanted to hear her. I wanted to see her. And they understood I wouldn’t stop until they gave me something.” Eventually, he said, their captors agreed to let them exchange notes through intermediaries. The messages were short and direct: “I’m OK. I love you. Be strong.”
“It gave me strength,” Ariel told the Daily Mail. “It reminded me I wasn’t alone, that someone was fighting with me, even quietly.” Arbel said she constantly feared Ariel would try to escape and risk his life. “So the letters calmed me,” she said. But after several months, the exchanges stopped.
“They told Ariel that if he mentioned my name again, they would kill me,” Arbel said. “Every day I hoped he was safe. I didn’t know if he was alive, if they were hurting him. That fear was worse than anything.”
“The psychological price was insane,” Ariel added. “The separation, the uncertainty about whether she was OK. Sometimes I went crazy. I would walk in circles, bang my head against the wall just to release the tension.”
Arbel, who was held at times in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, said her captors interrogated her and tried to force her to convert to Islam. The two said that at first there was even talk of selling them or smuggling them out of Gaza. “I was held with a baby who was 4 months old. When I was released, he was 15 months old. They carry knives from age 7 or 8,” Arbel said of the Gazans she encountered. “Three days before I left, the baby pointed a gun at me. He was playing with it. He pointed it at me while I begged his mother to take it away.”
Arbel, who was released last January, walked out alone on her final day into a bloodthirsty crowd, surrounded by hundreds of gunmen. “I remember going out and seeing a sea of green headbands,” she said. “I was the only woman. My brain was trying to process — I’m free, but still surrounded by them? I was afraid, but I knew I had to survive. I thought about Ariel — I had to get back to him.” Then, for the first time since her abduction, she encountered another Israeli — Gadi Mozes, who was also released that day.
Ariel was freed after 738 days in captivity. “Since I came back, I haven’t really come back to life,” Arbel concluded. “What kept him going was the thought of me, the possibility that we would meet again. That maybe we would still have a life together.”
Now they continue to struggle — with sleepless nights, flashbacks and trauma — trying to learn how to live again after their home in the kibbutz of Nir Oz was destroyed.

"The focus is now on the talks that Iran is currently conducting with its partners, on the work with the Americans, which Iran is carrying out indirectly, primarily through Arab mediators," the senior Russian diplomat continued.
"I think that this work will continue," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

How ‘policy convergence’ could pave the way for US-China cooperation on AI
Two nations could work together on areas like global governance and safety and promote local-level collaboration, according to researchers
The team highlighted “policy convergence” on AI at the local level and challenged the “conventional and stereotypical” expectations of policy models in China and the United States that mainly focused on divergence.
“Despite fierce competition between the two AI superpowers, policy convergence keeps open the possibility of future cooperation and negotiation, particularly on issues of global significance, such as AI governance and safety and security management,” the researchers said in a paper published in the Journal of Comparative Policy Analysis in November.
The study involved a team from Polytechnic University, the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, as well as the National University of Singapore.
China and the US have been locked in an intense rivalry over AI – a technology set to have a disruptive impact on society. The competition goes beyond innovation to encompass economic power, national security, military capabilities, and global influence.
According to the paper, a prevailing “one-sided perspective” often characterises AI policy models in China and the US as “strictly binary”.

Marseille mayoral election: Who's running?

They have almost all claimed to have "Marseille in their blood," and made endless declarations of their love for the Mediterranean city, France's second largest. Each candidate has approached the race's starting line, hoping to secure Marseille's central City Hall, which has been run for the past six years by a coalition of left-wing, grassroots and Green parties known as the Printemps Marseillais.
Facing the incumbent left-wing independent mayor, Benoît Payan, who stepped in to replace his Green party predecessor, Michèle Rubirola, when she resigned in December 2020, are the ambitious local leader of the far-right Rassemblement National (RN) party, Franck Allisio; a right-wing and centrist alliance headed by Martine Vassal, the president of Marseille's metropolitan authority, who was previously defeated six years ago; and radical left-wing La France Insoumise (LFI) MP Sébastien Delogu.
This lineup of political heavyweights has barely been challenged by the unexpected candidacies of former senior civil servant Erwan Davoux, running as an independent alongside local right-wing figure Nora Preziosi. The race has also been spiced up by the presence of environmental activist Victor Hugo Espinosa, age 76, running as an independent Green candidate. Le Monde presents the six main candidates for mayor, whose scores and potential alliances between the two electoral rounds could play a decisive role in determining the future governance of Marseille and its metropolitan area.

Cops and SWAT teams swarm area near Nancy Guthrie’s home as sheriff says investigators ‘won’t quit’ even if search takes ‘years’
It’s been nearly two weeks since the 84-year-old vanished from her Arizona home in what police believe is a kidnapping
- Bookmark
Law enforcement agencies carried out a late-night operation Friday at a residence about two miles from 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie’s home as part of the investigation into her disappearance, but did not make any arrests.
More than a dozen law enforcement vehicles, including SWAT and forensic teams, reportedly descended on a residence around two miles from Guthrie’s Arizona home. Several roads were closed for about four hours, but later reopened, according to CNN.
The 84-year-old mother of “Today” show anchor Savannah Guthrie was last seen at her home on January 31 and was reported missing the next day. Police believe she was abducted.
A Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson confirmed “no arrests were made” during Friday’s search.
“Last night, a federal court-ordered search warrant was executed at a residence near E. Orange Grove Rd. and N. First Ave. in connection with the Guthrie case,” the spokesperson said Saturday. “The warrant was based on a lead we received.”
Separately, Friday night at a Culver’s restaurant in Tucson, also about two miles from Guthrie’s home, police searched and towed a silver or gray Range Rover following a traffic stop, Fox News Digital reported.
The Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokesperson confirmed one person was questioned after a traffic stop Friday evening, but provided few other details.
“A traffic stop was also conducted, and a person was questioned but no arrests resulted from that incident. There are no further details available at this time,” the spokesperson said.
Investigators “won’t quit” their efforts to find Guthrie, even if it takes years, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos told The New York Times on Friday.
“Maybe it’s an hour from now,” he said. “Maybe it’s weeks or months or years from now. But we won’t quit. We’re going to find Nancy. We’re going to find this guy."
Police have yet to find Guthrie or her alleged abductor, but have been releasing new information about the case as the days go on.
Earlier Friday, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department revealed that DNA that doesn’t belong to anyone in “close contact” with Guthrie was found at her home.
In a statement shared with The Independent Friday, the sheriff’s department said, “DNA other than Nancy Guthrie’s and those in close contact to her has been collected from the property.”
Guthrie lives in the affluent and secluded Catalina Foothills just outside of Tucson.
The sheriff’s department said investigators are working to identify whose DNA was discovered. Police are not currently disclosing where exactly on the property the DNA was found.
In its statement, the sheriff’s department also refuted any reports that a glove was found inside Guthrie’s home or on her property.
“Several gloves have been located during the investigation. The closest gloves were found approximately two miles from the home,” the department said.
Early this week, authorities shared photos and video of a suspect in Guthrie’s disappearance, taken from a doorbell camera at the front of her house on the morning police believe she may have been taken.
The FBI Phoenix Field Office announced Tuesday that the “previously inaccessible” video shows “an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance.”
The suspect, who is yet to be identified, was wearing a ski mask and gloves. It’s unclear whether the gloves the suspect was wearing in the video match the gloves authorities found.
On Thursday, the FBI increased its reward to $100,000 for information “leading to the location of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.”
The FBI has also shared a detailed description of the suspect, including the type of backpack he was wearing in the doorbell video.
“The suspect is described as a male, approximately 5’9” - 5’10” tall, with an average build. In the video, he is wearing a black, 25-liter ‘Ozark Trail Hiker Pack’ backpack,” the agency wrote on X.
On Thursday, Reuters reported, citing a law enforcement official with knowledge of Guthrie’s case, that Nanos was blocking the FBI from examining evidence.
The official claimed the FBI requested DNA and a glove to be processed at the agency's national crime lab in Virginia, but Nanos insisted on using a private Florida lab.
Nanos refuted the idea that he wouldn’t collaborate with the FBI, telling CNN’s Ed Lavandera his department and the bureau are “joined at the hip.”
“We want to find Nancy,” the sheriff added.
Savannah Guthrie and her siblings are desperate to find their beloved mother, offering to pay for her safe return.
There have been reports of ransom notes demanding millions of dollars in Bitcoin, but none have been verified by police.
"We received your message, and we understand. We beg you now to return our mother to us, so that we can celebrate with her," Savannah Guthrie said in a video posted Saturday, February 7, alongside her siblings, Annie and Camron Guthrie.
“This is the only way we will have peace. This is very valuable to us, and we will pay.”
Earlier this week, the sheriff’s department said a person was detained in connection with Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance. He was later released without charges.
A man named Carlos told local outlet ABC15 he was stopped by deputies for “kidnapping” Guthrie.
“They told me I was being detained for kidnapping, and I asked them, ‘Kidnapping of who?’” Carlos said.
As the investigation into Guthrie’s suspected kidnapping continues, Nanos holds out hope that she will be found.
“I believe she’ll be found,” the sheriff told Lavandera.
“We are working hard.”

US doesn't want to separate from Europe 'but revitalise' alliance, Rubio tells allies
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to assuage European leaders' worries about fraying ties with Washington as he addressed the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, telling the annual gathering that Europe and the US "belong together" and that Washington wants to "revitalise" the transatlantic alliance.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to "revitalise" the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the US on its mission of global "renewal".
Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about Washington's allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.
"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said. "What we want is a reinvigorated alliance."

"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US "belong together".
The United States will be "driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilisation's past", he said.
"It is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe," he said.

He echoed Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration was a threat, saying that "mass migration" was "a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West".
"We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilisation and together with us are willing and able to defend it."
"Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy... It will restore to us a clear sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilisational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike."
Change in tone
Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.
Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a "rift" between US and Europe.
US-Europe ties were further strained by the new US National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with "civilisational decline".
Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.

European security
European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.
European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering on Saturday that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security and called for closer ties with Britain, saying "10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever".
British leader Keir Starmer said "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age."
"We must be able to deter aggression and, yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight," he said calling for a building of "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production".
On Friday NATO chief Mark Rutte said that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever" and French President Emmanuel Macron said that "this is the right time for a strong Europe", that would be "building its own architecture of security".
Ukraine war
The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited.
At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the US leader said.
But Rubio said that "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."
Macron said a new framework was needed to deal with "an aggressive Russia" once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
And Merz said that "If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," but charged that "Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously".
Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.

LONDON, February 14. /TASS/. The armed forces of the United States is preparing for a possible military operation against Iran, which may take several weeks, Reuters reported citing two unnamed US officials.
According to their information, the plans for the upcoming operation have already been drafted. It will be more complicated than last year’s attack on the Islamic Republic and may include not only Iranian nuclear infrastructure, but also its governmental and security agencies.
At the same time, Washington expects Iran’s retaliation, which may increase the risk of a regional conflict, the agency reported.
Trump stated on January 26 that Washington had sent a "big armada" towards Iran, and expressed hope that Tehran would engage in dialogue and make a deal, renouncing nuclear weapons. The US leader warned that "the next attack will be far worse" than the summer 2025 strikes on Iran. "Don't make that happen again," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

White House submits its most detailed plans yet of Trump’s $400M ballroom project
The plans are titled the ‘East Wing Modernization Project’ and were submitted to the National Capital Planning Commission by Shalom Baranes Associates

The White House has submitted the most detailed plans yet for Donald Trump’s lavish $400 million ballroom project.
“When completed, it will be the finest Ballroom ever built anywhere in the World, one that has been sought by Presidents for over 150 years – and now they are getting THE BEST!” the president wrote on Truth Social Tuesday, sharing two images of the renderings.
“Because of its unprecedented structural, safety, and security features, it will also be used for future Presidential Inaugurations.”
Full renderings were shared with the National Capital Planning Commission, which oversees large federal construction projects in the region, by Shalom Baranes Associates. The document includes images from various angles and dimensions for the 90,000 square-foot building.
The plans are titled the “East Wing Modernization Project” and were submitted to the committee on Wednesday.
The renderings reveal that a large triangular pediment above the ballroom’s southern portico, included in previous plans, would now be removed. A similar pediment to the east remained as part of the plan.
Despite the removal of the southern portico pediment the height of the building is expected to remain the same height as the White House – a priority for Trump.
This has caused concern among outside architects and historical preservationists, with warnings that the project could overshadow the main structure and views of the White House from particular points including 15th Street NW.
Bruce Redman Becker, a Biden-appointed architect who was removed from the Commission of Fine Arts by Trump last year, told The Washington Post the designs showed “a poorly proportioned pseudo-neoclassical structure that is completely out of scale with the White House.”
Becker said the images also did not apply with guidelines developed by the National Park Service which require new additions to buildings to be compatible with the historic building. “The design team clearly ignored these guidelines, and should be asked to revise and resubmit plans that follow the guidelines,” he told The Post.
The Independent has contacted the White House and Shalom Baranes Associates for comment about the alleged non-compliance with the NPS guidelines.
The East Wing demolition prompted a public outcry after Trump forged ahead with it in mid-to-late October last year despite no independent reviews having taken place, or congressional approval given.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation has since sued to halt construction of the ballroom.
But legal battles were seemingly not of concern for the president, who added in his Tuesday post: “Two views of the Great Ballroom being built on the site of our wonderful White House – It is on budget, and ahead of schedule!”

ICE officers on leave while Feds probe into possible perjury about the shooting of a Venezuelan man in Minneapolis

Federal authorities have opened a criminal probe into whether two immigration officers lied under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis in January, as all charges were dropped against two Venezuelan men.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons said on Friday, February 13, that his agency opened a joint probe with the Justice Department after video evidence revealed "sworn testimony provided by two separate officers appears to have made untruthful statements" about the shooting of one of the Venezuelan men during the Trump administration's immigration crackdown across the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.
The officers, whose names were not disclosed, are on administrative leave while the investigation is carried out, he said. Lyons said the two ICE officers could be fired and face criminal prosecution. "Lying under oath is a serious federal offense," said Lyons, adding that the US attorney's office is actively investigating.
"The men and women of ICE are entrusted with upholding the rule of law and are held to the highest standards of professionalism, integrity, and ethical conduct," Lyons said. "Violations of this sacred sworn oath will not be tolerated. ICE remains fully committed to transparency, accountability, and the fair enforcement of our nation's immigration laws."
Earlier Friday, US District Court Judge Paul A. Magnuson dismissed felony assault charges against Alfredo Alejandro Aljorna and Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, who were accused of beating an ICE officer with a broom handle and a snow shovel during a January 14 fracas. The officer fired a single shot from his handgun, striking Sosa-Celis in his right thigh.

The cases were dropped after a highly unusual motion to dismiss from US Attorney for the District of Minnesota Daniel N. Rosen, who said "newly discovered evidence" was "materially inconsistent with the allegations" made against the two men in a criminal complaint and at a hearing last month.
The reversal follows a string of high-profile shootings involving federal immigration agents in which eyewitness statements and video evidence have called into question claims made to justify using deadly force. Dozens of felony cases against protesters accused of assaulting or impeding federal officers have also crumbled.
The immigration lawyer representing Aljorna and Sosa-Celis said they are "overjoyed" that all charges have been dismissed. Had they been convicted, the two immigrants would have faced years in federal prison.
"The charges against them were based on lies by an ICE agent who recklessly shot into their home through a closed door," said attorney Brian D. Clark. "They are so happy justice is being served." It is unclear whether the men could still be deported.
Last month, an FBI investigator said in a now-discredited court affidavit that ICE officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle driven by Aljorna on Jan. 14. He crashed the vehicle and fled on foot toward the apartment duplex where he lived. An immigration officer chased Aljorna who – according to the government – violently resisted arrest.
The complaint alleged Sosa-Celis and another man attacked the officer with a snow shovel and a broom handle as the officer and Aljorna struggled on the ground. The officer, who is not named in court filings, fired his handgun, striking Sosa-Celis. The men ran into an apartment and eventually were arrested.
After the shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, accusing the Democrats of "encouraging impeding and assault against our law enforcement which is a federal crime, a felony." The Department of Homeland Security did not respond Friday to questions about whether Noem stands by those statements, which ICE – part of DHS – says are now under investigation.
Robin M. Wolpert, a defense attorney for Sosa-Celis in the criminal case, said she was pleased ICE and the Justice Department are publicly acknowledging and investigating apparent untruthful statements by the two ICE officers. "These untruthful statements had serious consequences for my client and his family," Wolpert said. "My client is a crime victim." Clark, the immigration lawyer for Aljorna and Sosa-Celis, urged the government to release the name of the ICE officer who shot his client and charge him.
Court filings show state authorities have opened their own criminal investigation into the shooting, though the FBI has thus far refused to share evidence, provide the name of the ICE officer who fired his weapon or make him available for an interview.
Holes in prosecution's case
Rosen's motion seeking to drop the charges did not detail what new evidence had emerged or what falsehoods had been in the government's prior filings, but cracks began to appear in the government's case during a Jan. 21 court hearing to determine whether the accused men could be released pending trial.
In court, the ICE officer's account of the moments before the shooting differed significantly from testimony from the two defendants and three eyewitnesses. Available video evidence did not support the ICE officer's account of being assaulted with a broom and snow shovel.
Aljorna and Sosa-Celis denied assaulting the officer. Testimony from a neighbor and the men's romantic partners also did not support the agent's account that he had been attacked with a broom or shovel or that a third person was involved.
Frederick Goetz, a lawyer representing Aljorna, said his client had a broomstick in his hand and threw it at the agent as he ran toward the house. Wolpert, representing Sosa-Celis, said he had been holding a shovel but was retreating into the home when the officer fired, wounding him. The men's attorneys said the prosecution's case relied wholly on testimony from the agent who fired the gun.
Neither Aljorna and Sosa-Celis had violent criminal records. Both had been working as DoorDash delivery drivers at night in an attempt to avoid encounters with federal agents, their attorneys said.
Aljorna and Sosa-Celis retreated into their upstairs apartment and barricaded the door, so federal officers used tear gas to try to force the men out, the FBI agent said. Concerned about the safety of two children under 2 inside the home, Aljorna and Sosa-Celis surrendered.
A third Venezuelan man, Gabriel Alejandro Hernandez Ledezma, who lived in the apartment downstairs was also arrested. Hernandez Ledezma was returned to Minnesota and discharged from ICE custody on Monday after a federal judge ordered his release.

Why Renee walked away from her job to open Brisbane’s first romance bookshop

Why Renee walked away from her job to open Brisbane’s first romance bookshop
Renee Woolnough used to come home from her demanding job in corrections and curl up with a book to relax.
She used to say if she won the lotto, she would open a bookshop and cafe.
“I worked with Corrective Services. I was a senior case manager for 20 years, so I dealt with some interesting individuals, let’s say.”
Woolnough’s stories of choice are romance novels – a genre that makes up an increasing proportion of book sales, according to Nielsen BookScan Australia figures.
“Romance was my escape and then ... it was getting too much and I was burning out and I’m like, ‘My life is too short’.
“I want to bring joy to my life and bring joy to other people’s lives, and romance is a very popular genre. Who doesn’t like a coffee and a book?”
Sweet Chapter Books opened on December 20 along Moggill Road at Taringa, and is the first of its kind in Brisbane.
“I know there are a couple of romance bookshops on the Sunshine Coast, and I know there’s some new independent bookshops in Wellington Point and Redcliffe, but for solely romance, I think I’m it,” Woolnough said.
Alongside a healthy offering of books, Woolnough also stocks stickers, magnets, tote bags, book covers and more.
Romance has always been the biggest genre in publishing, award-winning author and QUT lecturer in creative writing Dr Rohan Wilson said.
Romance books sales now more than double those in pre-pandemic 2019. In 2024, Australian readers bought more than 3 million romance novels worth $46.4 million.
“It’s an absolutely huge chunk of the publishing industry,” Wilson said. “It’s easily the biggest growth area in publishing at the moment, and has been for a couple of years now.
“It’s probably the only genre that could sustain its own bookshop in Brisbane.”
Wilson said the rise of authors such as Colleen Hoover and Sally Rooney have given the genre more legitimacy in the last decade or so, but the biggest development has been the surging popularity in romantasy novels – the combination of romance and fantasy – with authors such as Sarah J. Maas and Rebecca Yarros leading the charge.
“I think people just love the emotional stakes at the centre of those stories. They love the relationships, they love the feeling of watching characters grow closer,” he said.
“And when you put that into a fantasy setting with all of the extra opportunities that fantasy storytelling brings along as well, it’s just so addictive and so compelling, and I fully understand why it’s popular and why readers are into it.”
Readers of the romance genre are voracious, Wilson said, and many will read three or four novels a week.
“The demand for it is like, you know, you almost can’t satisfy it.”
The vast majority of readers prefer their books in hard copy, with digital books only making up about 15 per cent of book sales.
“Print culture is really sticking around and not going anywhere at this stage,” Wilson said.
Wilson said the community that comes out of these spaces is another reason they remain so popular, with book signings and book clubs adding value for readers.
Woolnough hopes to promote indie authors as much as possible, with plenty of local authors available.
Local authors stocked at the shop include K.E. Barden, Lynise Reid, Millie St Graves, Asha Rose, Tania Joyce, and Nicole Rowles. Mia K. Rose’s signing for her latest novel From The Cold was held at the shop.
“I want to focus on indie authors and give them the chance to spread their wings,” Woolnough said.
“I wanted space to be able to have a couch and have people sit and do their book clubs and do all the things and just come in and browse and buy a book or two or three.”
Wilson is confident there is a huge demand out there for what Woolnough is offering.
“Romance is a very broad church. There’s literally something for everybody in the genre. It doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter your background, there is something in there for everybody, which I think you can’t say about every genre.”
“I think genres are reflections of human psychology, and it’s easy to see why romance is so important. At the end of your life, when you’re laying there on your deathbed thinking about, what are my regrets or what are my happinesses from my life? It’s always about your relationships.
“It’s the genre of human relationships, and it’s the stuff that matters most deeply to us, which is why it’s the biggest and most popular genre, and the one that never goes away.”

Malaysian police smash sex ring charging US$900 a session in posh KL area
The suspected ringleader and salesmen are Chinese nationals while a Singaporean and Malaysian have been asked to assist in investigations
The “romps”, which were either a 45-minute or 90-minute session, were offered by a syndicate that supplied women from countries such as China and Japan.
The syndicate had been operating from the detached house in the upscale residential area of Desa Pahlawan for about six months.
However, their illicit activities came to an end when immigration officers raided the bungalow at about 12.30am on Thursday.
Forty foreigners, aged between 21 and 43, were arrested.
One of them was the “salesman”, tasked with sourcing clients through online platforms. Another was believed to be the mastermind of the operation. Both men are Chinese nationals.

War crimes committed in Sudan's El-Fasher
The UN rights office on Friday accused Sudan's paramilitaries of war crimes and possible crimes against humanity during the capture of El-Fasher, saying some 6,000 were killed in just three days.
Since April 2023, the conflict between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces has killed tens of thousands, displaced 11 million and triggered what the UN calls one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
During its final offensive in October, the RSF unleashed "a wave of intense violence... shocking in its scale and brutality" and amounting to war crimes and possible crimes against humanity, said a report from the UN Human Rights Office.
The report said the RSF and allied Arab militia carried out widespread attacks, including mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture and ill-treatment, detention, disappearances, pillage and the use of children in hostilities.
In many cases, these were directed against civilians and people outside of combat based on their ethnicity or perceived affiliation, it said.
Based on interviews with over 140 victims and witnesses conducted in Sudan and eastern Chad in late 2025, the Human Rights Office said it documented more than 6,000 killings in the first three days of the RSF offensive.
It said that of those, at least 4,400 people were killed within El-Fasher, and over 1,600 others were killed as they fled along exit routes.
"The actual scale of the death toll during the week-long offensive is undoubtedly significantly higher," the office said.
The report voiced serious concerns over the fate of thousands of missing people.
"The unprecedented scale and brutality of the violence meted out during the offensive deeply compounded the horrific violations the residents of El-Fasher had already been subjected to during the long months of siege, constant hostilities and bombardment," said UN rights chief Volker Turk.
He said persistent impunity was fuelling the violence.
"There must be credible and impartial investigations to establish criminal responsibility, including of commanders and other superiors," Turk said.
"These must lead to meaningful accountability for perpetrators of exceptionally serious crimes, through all available means."

First concert of “Cold Winter-2026: Kyiv and Seattle Together” project held at Kyiv’s Central Railway Station
This is according to an Ukrinform correspondent.
“This is a Ukrainian-American solidarity project. Our partners from Seattle initiated it. We are launching this project to warm Kyiv residents spiritually at Points of Invincibility,” said Herman Makarenko, head of the Kyiv Classic Orchestra and People’s Artist of Ukraine.
He noted that in 2024 the Kyiv Classic Orchestra gave a charity concert in Seattle, with the funds raised transferred to Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital.
Makarenko has also recalled that the orchestra has been performing for Kyiv residents since March 2022. The first such concert in support of Ukrainians took place on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square) on March 9, 2022, amid air-raid sirens and explosions.
According to the orchestra’s director, at least six concerts are planned in Kyiv by the end of February – at Points of Invincibility, at Okhmatdyt Hospital, and possibly in the Darnytskyi and Desnianskyi districts.
During Friday’s concert at the Central Railway Station, air-raid alerts were announced twice, forcing the musicians to stop playing. Nevertheless, the audience was able to hear music by Semen Hulak‑Artemovsky from the opera Zaporozhets beyond the Danube, the dance Kozachok, the famous Summertime from Porgy and Bess by George Gershwin, Jazz Legato by Leroy Anderson, and Libertango by Astor Piazzolla.
The program also included the Ukrainian folk song Oi na hori dva dubky, Chornobryvtsi by Volodymyr Vermenych, Shchedryk by Mykola Leontovych, Bozhe velykyi, yedynyi by Mykola Lysenko, and Oi u luzi chervona kalyna.
The musicians dedicated Melody by Myroslav Skoryk to the warriors who gave their lives for Ukraine.
The project is organized by The Humanity Funds and the Kyiv Classic Orchestra.
As previously reported, Ukrainians in Finland are also organizing a charity concert, with proceeds to be directed toward urgent humanitarian aid for Ukraine.

Mistrial declared in case of students charged after Stanford pro-Palestinian protests

WASHINGTON – A judge declared a mistrial on Feb 13 in a case of five current and former Stanford University students related to the 2024 pro-Palestinian protests,
Twelve protesters were initially charged in 2025
The case was tried in Santa Clara County Superior Court against five defendants charged with felony vandalism and felony conspiracy to trespass. The rest previously accepted plea deals or diversion programmes.
The jury was deadlocked. It voted nine to three to convict on the felony charge of vandalism and eight to four to convict on the felony charge to trespass.
Jurors failed to reach a verdict after deliberations. The charges were among the most serious against participants in the 2024 pro-Palestinian protest movement in US colleges, in which demonstrators demanded an end to Israel’s war in Gaza and Washington’s support for its ally, along with a divestment of funds by their universities from companies supporting Israel.
Prosecutors in the case said the defendants engaged in unlawful property destruction.
“This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else’s property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage. That is against the law,” Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said in a statement, adding he sought a new trial.
Mr Anthony Brass, a lawyer for one of the protesters, told The New York Times his side was defending not lawlessness, but “the concept of transparency and ethical investment”.
“This is a win for these young people of conscience and a win for free speech,” Mr Brass said, adding that “humanitarian activism has no place in a criminal courtroom”.
Protesters had renamed the building “Dr Adnan’s Office” after Dr Adnan Al-Bursh, a Palestinian doctor who died in an Israeli prison after months of detention. More than 3,000 were arrested during the 2024 US pro-Palestinian protest movement, according to media tallies.
Some students faced suspension, expulsion and degree revocation. REUTERS

Ukraine war briefing: conflict could end if Russia economically or militarily ‘exhausted’, says Germany’s Merz

-
German chancellor Friedrich Merz has told the Munich Security Council Russia’s war against Ukraine will “only end when Russia is at least economically, potentially militarily, exhausted”. The German chancellor described the security gathering as a seismograph for the state of US-European relations. Merz said the Ukraine war “had forced Europe to return from a vacation from world history”.
-
With Russia’s war against Ukraine entering its fifth year, the conflict was high on the agenda at the security conference. French president Emmanuel Macron said any peace settlement must protect Ukraine, preserve European security and disincentivize Russia from attempting another invasion, while not providing the rest of the world with a “calamitous example to follow”. He said it was a “huge strategic mistake” to urge Ukraine to accept it was defeated. “One day Russians will have to reckon with the enormity of the crime committed in their name, with the futility of the pretexts and the devastating, longer term effects on their country, but until that time comes, we will not lower the guard.”
-
Several top European leaders were scheduled to meet at the conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday for talks about the conflict, the French presidency said. Macron said any peace deal between Ukraine and Russia had to involve Europe. “I want to be very clear: you can negotiate without the Europeans, if you prefer, but it will not bring a peace at the table.” A US official said secretary of state Marco Rubio was not attending those talks because of a packed schedule, but was “engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings” in Munich. Ukraine’s foreign minister Andriy Sybiga said he discussed ending the Russian invasion of Ukraine with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, whose country is a close partner of Moscow. Wang told Sybiga Beijing was “willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid”, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
-
Meanwhile, diplomatic negotiations on Ukraine will take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. A US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
-
Ukraine could hold elections if there was a two to three month ceasefire with Russia, said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference Zelenskyy said he would be happy, in principle, to hold a poll “as quick as possible,” but said the war had to stop first, and Ukraine had to be given security guarantees. “If president Trump … pushes Putin [into a] ceasefire [that will last for] two, three months, we will do elections.” Zelenskyy also said Trump wanted to agree on a peace deal “all at once,” because he “like things in one big package,” like he did with his “one, big, beautiful bill”. But the Ukrainian president said the sequence of getting things agreed was important.
-
Zelenskyy said Russia’s territorial demands were about Moscow’s ambitions to get Ukraine, bit by bit, a point he has emphasised to the US. He said compromises had already been made by Ukraine. “We made a lot of compromises. Putin and his friends, they are not in prison. This is the biggest compromise that the world made already.” He said Ukraine “can’t forget” how many people were killed during the war, but he said Kyiv was ready to end it at any time.
-
Britain has said it would send another £540m worth of weapons to Ukraine, including spending £150m on buying US made interceptors, using a Nato-run funding scheme for the first time. The latest commitment came before a meeting of the 50 country Ukraine Contact Group, which coordinates international weapons supplies to Kyiv, immediately after the Nato defence ministers summit. Britain has not previously used Nato’s Prioritised Ukraine Requirements List (Purl) before. It was devised last year as a mechanism for European countries to buy US weapons for Ukraine, after the US said it would no longer donate them. The remaining £390m will be spent on supplying 1,000 Lightweight Multirole Missiles (LMMs), which are manufactured in Belfast, to urgently bolster Ukraine’s air defences, which are struggling against nightly onslaughts of Russian attacks.
-
A Ukrainian missile attack killed two people and injured five on Friday in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said. Gladkov, speaking in a video posted on Telegram, said the men were members of crews restoring damaged heating and electricity networks in the city. Restoration work will resume on Saturday as it was too dangerous for crews to be operating at night, Gladkov said.

NBA star Chris Paul 'steps away' from basketball at age 40

Chris Paul, a 12-time NBA All-Star point guard, announced his retirement on Friday in a social media post after the 40-year-old American was released by the Toronto Raptors. "This is it! After 21 years I'm stepping away from basketball," Paul posted on Instagram after being dropped following his trade to Toronto by the Los Angeles Clippers last week. Paul has averaged 16.8 points, 9.2 assists, 4.4 rebounds and 2.0 steals a game over 1,370 career NBA games for New Orleans, Houston, Oklahoma City, Phoenix, Golden State, San Antonio and the Clippers.
The 2006 NBA Rookie of the Year was a two-time Olympic champion with the US squad of NBA stars, winning in 2008 at Beijing and 2012 in London. "After 21 remarkable seasons, Chris Paul retires as one of the greatest point guards in NBA history and a true steward of our sport," NBA commissioner Adam Silver said. "From the moment he entered the league, Chris distinguished himself with his savvy playmaking skills, elite competitiveness and intense work ethic."
Paul had played for four clubs in the past four years and decided it was time to retire after the Raptors released him. "As I write this, it's hard to really know what to feel, but for once – most people would be surprised – I don't have the answer lol!" Paul posted. "But, mostly I'm filled with so much joy and gratitude! While this chapter of being an 'NBA player' is done, the game of basketball will forever be ingrained in the DNA of my life. "I've been in the NBA for more than half of my life, spanning three decades. It's crazy even saying that!"
Paul, the NBA 2013 All-Star Game Most Valuable Player, stressed how much he simply enjoyed playing in the NBA. "Playing basketball for a living has been an unbelievable blessing that also came with lots of responsibility," Paul wrote. "I embraced it all. The good and the bad. "As a lifelong learner, leadership is hard and is not for the weak. Some will like you and many people won't. But the goal was always the goal, and my intentions were always sincere (Damn, I love competing!!)"
Paul never played on an NBA championship team, coming the closest in 2021 when, as a member of the Phoenix Suns, he reached the NBA Finals, only to lose to Milwaukee.
'Extraordinary career'
Paul had not played since December 1, the Clippers moving away from him after a 5-16 start but never releasing him and saving money under NBA salary cap rules in the trade. His career also included a stint as president of the National Basketball Players Association from 2013 to 2021, helping the union secure collective bargaining agreements with the league.
"He also poured enormous time and energy into his role as President of the Players Association -- offering thoughtful and principled perspectives to strengthen our game and our business," Silver said.
"His leadership on behalf of the players was essential in negotiating collective bargaining agreements, helping guide the league through a pandemic, addressing important societal issues and so much more. "On behalf of the NBA, I congratulate Chris on an extraordinary career and thank him for his friendship, partnership and lasting contributions to our game."

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. The United States believes that China will become its main strategic rival in this century, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker told the Munich Security Conference.
"You know, we face a lot of challenge. I think it's an incredibly dangerous world right now. We have certainly an ascendant China that is going to be a strategic competitor of the United States for the next century," he said.
"How we respond to that is most likely to define where we end up as a country, and whether it's another century of America and and what we offer to the world, or whether it's a century of China and what they bring to the world," Whitaker added.

UN defends Francesca Albanese after European criticism
A UN human rights spokesperson expressed concern on Friday about attacks on independent UN experts after several European governments criticised the organisation's special rapporteur for Palestine, Francesca Albanese, and called for her resignation.
This follows condemnation from Germany, France and Italy this week of Albanese's alleged criticism of Israel. Albanese, an Italian lawyer, denies making the remarks.
"We are very worried. We are concerned that UN officials, independent experts and judicial officials, are increasingly subjected to personal attacks, threats and misinformation that distracts from the serious human rights issues," UN human rights office spokesperson Marta Hurtado told a press briefing when asked about the criticism.
UN experts are commissioned by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council to monitor and document specific human rights crises, but are independent of the organisation itself.
On Friday, the Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Petr Macinka quoted Albanese on X as having called Israel a "common enemy of humanity", and he also called for her resignation.
A transcript of Albanese's remarks made in Doha on 7 February, seen by Reuters, did not characterise Israel in this way, although she has consistently criticised the country in the past over the Gaza conflict.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Thursday that Albanese's position was "untenable", while French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot accused her of making "outrageous and reprehensible remarks" against Israel.
Albanese criticises Europeans over Gaza
Albanese said in overnight remarks on X: "Three European governments accuse me - based on statements I never made - with a virulence and conviction that they have NEVER used against those who have slaughtered 20,000+ children in 858 days."
She was citing figures from the Gaza Health Ministry, which puts the total death toll from the Gaza war at more than 72,000, the figure is presumed to be higher.
US President Donald Trump's administration imposed sanctions on Albanese after she wrote letters to US companies accusing them of contributing to gross human rights violations by Israel in Gaza and the West Bank.
Albanese, whose term expires in 2028, is due to speak at the Rights Council in Geneva next month on Palestinian rights.
There is no precedent for removing a special rapporteur during their term, although diplomats said that states on the 47-member council could, in theory, propose a motion to do so.
However, they said strong support for Palestinian rights within the body means that such a motion was unlikely to pass.

Arundhati Roy ‘shocked’ by jury’s Gaza remarks, quits Berlin film festival
Jury chair Wim Wenders said filmmakers ‘have to stay out of politics’ when asked about German support for Israel’s genocidal war in Gaza.
Indian author Arundhati Roy has announced that she is withdrawing from the Berlin International Film Festival after what she described as “unconscionable statements” by its jury members about Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.
Writing in India’s The Wire newspaper, Roy said she found recent remarks from members of the Berlinale jury, including its chair, acclaimed director Wim Wenders, that “art should not be political” to be “jaw-dropping”.

“It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time,” wrote Roy, the author of novels and nonfiction, including The God of Small Things.
“I am shocked and disgusted,” Roy wrote, adding that she believed “artists, writers and filmmakers should be doing everything in their power to stop” the war in Gaza.
“Let me say this clearly: what has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel,” she wrote.
The war is “supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries in Europe, which makes them complicit in the crime,” she added.
During a panel to launch the festival on Thursday, a journalist asked the jury members for their views on the German government’s “support of the genocide in Gaza” and the “selective treatment of human rights” issues.
German filmmaker Wim Wenders, who is the chair of the festival’s seven-member jury, responded, saying that filmmakers “have to stay out of politics”.
“If we made movies that are dedicatedly political, we enter the field of politics. But we are the counterweight to politics. We are the opposite of politics. We have to do the work of people and not the work of politicians,” Wenders said.
Polish film producer Ewa Puszczynska, another jury member, said she thought it was “a bit unfair” to pose this question, saying that filmmakers “cannot be responsible” for whether governments support Israel or Palestine.
“There are many other wars where genocide is committed and we do not talk about that,” Puszczynska added.
Roy had been due to participate in the festival, which runs from February 12 to 22, after her 1989 film, In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones, was selected to be screened in the Classics section.
Germany, which is one of the biggest exporters of weapons to Israel, after the US, has introduced harsh measures to prevent people from speaking out in solidarity with Palestinians.
In 2024, more than 500 international artists, filmmakers, writers and culture workers called on creatives to stop working with German-funded cultural institutions over what they described as “McCarthyist policies that suppress freedom of expression, specifically expressions of solidarity with Palestine”.
“Cultural institutions are surveilling social media, petitions, open letters and public statements for expressions of solidarity with Palestine in order to weed out cultural workers who do not echo Germany’s unequivocal support of Israel,” organisers of the initiative said.

US Homeland Security faces shutdown as lawmakers clash over border enforcement

US lawmakers have remained locked in a standoff over immigration enforcement funding, putting the Department of Homeland Security at risk of a partial government shutdown beginning Saturday.
The funding lapse would take effect after midnight on Friday if Congress fails to reach an agreement.
"For weeks, we've been pushing commonsense reforms," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said ahead of the deadline.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats, telling Fox News that "Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons."
Democrats have refused to approve additional funding for DHS without changes to the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement carry out operations.
They are demanding limits on patrols, a ban on agents wearing facemasks during enforcement actions and a requirement for judicial warrants before entering private property.
"Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. "Dramatic changes are needed."
Democratic opposition intensified after the January deaths of two US citizens, Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who were shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis during protests linked to deportation operations.
"Democrats will not support a blank check for chaos," Schumer said.
Democratic votes needed
Even if all 53 Republican senators support the bill, Senate rules require 60 votes to advance it, meaning at least seven Democrats would need to back the measure.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune described the White House proposal as "an extremely serious offer" but acknowledged Democrats would not secure their full list of demands.
"Half-measures will not cut it," said Democratic Senator Patty Murray.
If no agreement is reached, thousands of federal workers could be furloughed, while others would be required to work without pay until funding is restored.
ICE would continue operating using previously approved funds, but other agencies could be affected.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration have warned of disruptions, including longer airport wait times.
The shutdown would mark the third of Trump's second term.

Can German stealth cargo gliders boost Japan’s remote island defence and logistics?
The HADIS system can deliver cargo of up to 500kg over a range of 120km and safeguard transport aircraft during resupply operations
Munich-based Hensoldt said on February 5 that it had marked a milestone in the development of its High-Altitude Drop Infiltrating System, or HADIS, after releasing a scale version of the uncrewed vehicle from a transport aircraft during trials last autumn.
HADIS is an uncrewed, autonomous, disposable, remotely operated carrier system designed to be released from a transport aircraft to deliver cargo – everything that a military unit would require, from medical equipment to munitions – to troops on the ground.
The glider can be steered remotely, is silent and therefore difficult to detect because it has no engine and can more accurately deliver cargoes over further distances.
Tests have shown that while a conventional parachute drop can typically deliver supplies to a distance of 50km (30 miles) from the point of release and cannot be guided, the HADIS system can accurately transport cargo of up to 500kg (1,100lbs) over a range of 120km.
The ability to launch HADIS a long way behind the front line also helps protect the relatively slow and less well-defended cargo aircraft that are tasked with carrying out resupply operations.

BRUSSELS — Sometimes it is the answers politicians decline to give that are the most revealing — like whether it’s still possible, after clashing bitterly over the fate of Greenland, for a European leader to trust Donald Trump.
“I don’t do that kind of judgment,” Sweden’s Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in an interview with POLITICO, when asked directly if he can trust the U.S. president. “The discussion we had on Greenland and Denmark was a bad one.”
But European leaders, he believes, took the decision to “stand up” for their values and for European integrity in the face of Trump’s aggression — and it worked. “We protected European interests, Danish interests, broader European interests as well. And we did that very clearly.”

BAKU, February 14. /TASS/. Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev expressed hope that his country’s peace with Armenia will last forever.
"The signing of this historic document at the White House, in the presence of the President of the United States, means that the conflict is over and that we have entered a period of peace, which I hope will last forever," the state-run AZERTAC news agency quoted Aliyev as saying in an interview with France 24 TV channel in Munich.
The president emphasized that more than six months after the signing, the situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijani border is calm. "We have a very quiet situation on the border with Armenia. No more shootings, no victims, no wounded," he said.
He also said that Azerbaijan unilaterally lifted its restrictions on transit of goods to Armenia, and began delivering critically important oil products to the republic, which de-facto means the launch of bilateral trade.
At the same time, he ruled out the possibility of signing a peace treaty between Baku and Yerevan as long as Armenia’s constitution contains territorial claims to Azerbaijan. He named it as the only obstacle to peace, adding that Armenia plans to hold a referendum on the matter.
Following the August 8, 2025, trilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Aliyev signed a joint declaration on the establishment of peace between Baku and Yerevan and on improving connectivity between the main part of Azerbaijan and its Nakhchivan autonomy through Armenia. The project was named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity."

A lawsuit seeks to stop Trump's overhaul of a 100-year-old public golf course in Washington
Two golfers in Washington, D.C., have sued the federal government to try to prevent the Trump administration from overhauling a more than 100-year-old public golf course

Two golfers in Washington, D.C., sued the federal government on Friday to try to prevent the Trump administration from overhauling a more than 100-year-old public golf course, accusing the administration of violating environmental laws and polluting a park that is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The suit is the latest in a series of legal battles challenging President Donald Trump's extraordinary efforts to put his mark on public spaces in the nation's capitol, including shuttering the Kennedy Center.
At the end of last year, a group of preservationists filed a similar lawsuit seeking to prevent the administration from demolishing the East Wing of the White House in order to build a ballroom — a project slated to cost $400.
Trump, who is an avid golfer himself, also plans on renovating a military golf course just outside of Washington that has been used by past presidents going back decades.
The complaint filed against the Department of the Interior on Friday says that the Trump administration's reconstruction of East Potomac Park — which includes the East Potomac Golf Course — would violate the congressional act that created the park in 1897. The roughly 130-year-old act established the park for the “recreation and the pleasure of the people."
The golf course, which has since been recognized on the National Register of Historic Places in part for its efforts to racially integrate in the 1940s. Municipal golf courses make up only 18% of courses in America.
"East Potomac Golf Links is a testament to what’s possible with public land and why public spaces matter," said Washington resident and plaintiff Dave Roberts. “It deserves better than becoming a dumping ground for waste and yet another private playground for the privileged and powerful.”
The lawsuit came after the Trump administration in December ended a lease agreement the nonprofit National Links Trust held for East Potomac and two other golf courses in Washington. The Interior Department said it did so because the nonprofit hadn't implemented required capital improvements and failed to meet the terms of the lease.
The Interior Department press office said in an email Friday that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
However, it said it would “ensure these courses are safe, beautiful, open, affordable, enjoyable and accessible for people visiting the greatest capital city in the world which is in line with President Trump’s agenda.”
The White House also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment on Friday evening.
Construction on the East Potomac course has already begun, according to the lawsuit. In October, the National Parks Service began dumping debris from the demolition of the East Wing of the White House onto the golf course, the complaint said, raising concerns that the materials could contain contaminants that could pollute the air.
As a result, the plaintiffs argued, the administration of also violated the National Environmental Policy Act by failing to consider the harmful environmental impacts of the project.
The National Links Trust said in December they were “devastated” by the decision to terminate the lease and defended their management of the courses.
They said $8.5 million had gone toward capital improvements at the courses and that rounds played and revenue had more than doubled in their tenure managing the courses. They also added that the termination of the lease jeopardized hundreds of local jobs.
The nonprofit has agreed to keep managing the courses for the time being, but long-term renovations will stop.
The first 18 holes of the East Potomac Park Golf Course were built from 1918 to 1923.

Prime Minister Carney and Canada's main opposition leader hold hands during school shooting vigil

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and the country’s main opposition leader held hands Friday as they paid tribute to the victims of one of the worst mass shootings in the country’s history at a vigil in a devastated British Columbia town.
Carney and Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre joined hands as an Indigenous leader sang a prayer outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge.
Carney and Poilievre also spoke. The prime minister named each of the six people killed at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and said the mother and brother of the shooter who were killed also “deserve to be mourned.”
Authorities said the 18-year-old alleged shooter, identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, killed her 39-year-old mother, Jennifer Jacobs, and 11-year-old stepbrother, Emmett Jacobs, in their home on Tuesday before heading to the nearby Tumbler Ridge Secondary School and opening fire, killing five children and an educator before killing herself.
Carney said he sat with people who are “living through something no one should ever have to endure.”
“When you wake up tomorrow, and the world feels impossible, know that millions of Canadians are with you. When the cameras leave and the quiet sets in — know that we will still be here,” Carney said.
A crowd of hundreds attended the vigil. Some held photos of loved ones they lost.
Carney said the community has always been defined by people caring for each other.
“And when the unimaginable happened on Tuesday, you were there again. First responders at the school within two minutes. Teachers shielding their children,” he said.
Poilievre commended Carney for his “tremendous grace.” Canada’s political leaders flew from Ottawa together.
British Columbia Premier David Eby said the students of the school won’t ever have to return to the building if they don’t want to.
“I will promise that not one of you will ever be forced to go back to that school. We will provide a safe place for you to go back to school,” Eby said.
Authorities on Thursday identified those killed at the school as Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa, Zoey Benoit and Ticaria Lampert, all age 12, as well as 13-year-old Ezekiel Schofield and assistant teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand, 39.
Maya Gebala, 12, who was wounded in the head and neck, and Paige Hoekstra, 19, who also suffered bullet wounds, remain hospitalized in Vancouver.
Dwayne McDonald, the deputy commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia, said earlier Friday that the alleged shooter did not appear to be searching for a specific target at the school.
“This suspect was, for lack of a better term, hunting,” McDonald said. “They were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with.”
McDonald described a “chaotic” scene at the school when police arrived, with fire alarms sounding and a person yelling out a window that the suspect was upstairs.
“They entered the school, proceeded to go up the stairwell, and were met with gunfire,” he said. “It was a matter of seconds after that there was more gunfire, not as we know now, having reviewed video, directed at any persons. Then the suspect took their life.”
McDonald said from the time the suspect encountered police there were no further injuries to students at the school.
Four guns were seized, two from the family home and two from the school, he said.
The attack was Canada’s deadliest since 2020, when a gunman in Nova Scotia killed 13 people and set fires that left another nine dead.
School shootings are rare in Canada, which has strict gun-control laws. The government has responded to previous mass shootings with gun-control measures, including a recently broadened ban on all guns it considers assault weapons.

US readying for potential weeks-long military campaign against Iran — sources
American official says strikes could target Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear sites; says US fully expects Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth attacks
WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Trump, speaking to US troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had “been difficult to make a deal” with Iran.
“Sometimes you have to have fear. That’s the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,” Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.”
“He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,” Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June’s “Midnight Hammer” operation was essentially a one-off US attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific detail.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would “be very traumatic, very traumatic.”
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, “it must include the elements that are vital to Israel.”
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Anti-gov't protests gather across Israel: Bereaved hostage family says officials seek to 'manipulate public consciousness'
Thousands of anti-government protesters gathered on Saturday evening across the country, including a demonstration outside the Prime Minister's residence in Jerusalem after months of no protests. Three protesters were detained as police ordered the crowd to disperse.
In Haifa, the mother of late hostage Ron Sherman, who was killed as a result of an Israeli air strike, told the audience, "Last week, we were exposed to the Prime Minister's Office's attempt to remove the word 'massacre' from the October 7 memorial law.

Sources close to Israeli president say Trump is 'crossing a line' by exerting pressure to pardon Netanyahu
Close associates to President Isaac Herzog said U.S. President Donald Trump is undermining Israel's sovereignty by exerting pressure to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
On Tuesday, Trump said that Herzog "should be ashamed of himself" for not granting a pardon to Netanyahu. In remarks he made at the White House the day after his meeting with Netanyahu, Trump claimed that Herzog had promised to grant a pardon "five different times," adding: "But he doesn't want to do it because, I guess he loses his power."
Trump also said, "I think the people of Israel should really shame him. He's disgraceful for not giving it."
On Friday, Trump was asked in a conversation with reporters outside the White House if he thought Netanyahu would receive a pardon and replied: "Yes, I think so."
Herzog said on Tuesday, "Contrary to the impression created by President Trump's words – the president has not yet made any decision on the matter."
He added that the pardon request is "made in accordance with the rules at the Ministry of Justice," and "only after the process is completed will the President of the State consider the request in accordance with the law."
The statement added, "President Herzog appreciates President Trump for his significant contribution to the State of Israel and its security. Israel is a sovereign state of law."
Saudi Arabia says it needs to see 'real end to the conflict' in Gaza before committing to reconstruction contribution
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said that his country would need to see "a real end to the conflict" before committing to their contribution to help fund reconstruction efforts in the Gaza Strip, when asked on the subject by Haaretz.
"We're fully supportive of the peace plan and the Board of Peace. I think we need to see first of all an end, a real end to the conflict," he said. "That means that we need to have clarity on when Israel is going to withdraw, when Hamas is going to disarm, when everybody's going to comply with all of the 20 points in the 20-point plan."
"I think the U.S. is working on that. There's a meeting on the 19th that will give us a lot more clarity," Al Saud added. "At that point, I think we will be able to have a better determination of what we can best contribute towards not just reconstruction, but also making sure that the people of Gaza, the people of Palestine have a better future.
Israel's foreign minister expected to attend Board of Peace launch in Washington
Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar is expected to represent Israel at a Board of Peace meeting set to convene in Washington this week.
The Board of Peace is expected to discuss the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, a source familiar with the matter told Haaretz.
The upcoming summit is described as a "launch meeting" and will be the first gathering of the Board of Peace since the charter signing ceremony in Davos, Switzerland in January.
U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday
U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio cautioned on Saturday that while U.S. President Donald Trump's preference was to reach a deal with Tehran, "that's very hard to do."
Trump, speaking to U.S. troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, openly floated the possibility of regime change in Iran, saying it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen." He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said, "there are people."
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking," Trump said.
Trump has long voiced skepticism about sending ground troops into Iran, saying last year, "the last thing you want to do is ground forces," and the kinds of U.S. firepower arrayed in the Middle East so far suggest options for strikes primarily by air and naval forces. In Venezuela, Trump demonstrated a willingness to rely also on special operations forces to seize that country's president, Nicolas Maduro, in a raid last month.
48 homicides in 45 days: Young man in 20s fatally shot in Nazareth
A young man of about 20 was fatally shot in the northern Israeli Arab city of Nazareth.
Magen David Adom reported that the victim was found in his car with "serious gunshot wounds."
Police announced that the victim has not yet been identified and that a criminal investigation into the circumstances of the shooting is underway, including a search for suspects.
Since the beginning of the year, 48 people have been killed in Israel in 45 days, 43 of whom are from Arab society.

'Terrorizing the civilian population' — At least 2 injured in Russian drone attack on Kyiv Oblast
Editor's note: This is a developing story and is being updated.
Russian forces launched a drone attack on Kyiv Oblast, injuring two people late on Feb. 13, officials reported.
The attack targeted the Vyshhorod district of Ukraine's national capital region, which is located on the northern outskirts of Kyiv. Regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported that a man and a woman were hospitalized with injuries stemming from the attack.
"The enemy continues to terrorize the civilian population of the Kyiv Oblast," Kalashnyk said in a post on Telegram, adding that the the male injured victim sustained multiple shrapnel wounds to his upper limbs, face, and neck, while the woman suffered a bone fracture.
The attack caused a fire to break out at a home in the region, which was extinguished by emergency crews.
The full extent of the damage caused is being investigated, Kalashnyk said.
The latest attack on the capital region comes as Russia has intensified attacks on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities over the course of the winter, targeting civilian and energy infrastructure across the capital.
The attacks have severely damaged the country's energy grid and forced it to impose lengthy blackouts amid freezing temperatures. Many Kyiv residents have been forced to suffer through heating outages as temperatures reached -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) in the past several weeks.
The renewed attacks on Ukraine's capital come as the United States intensifies diplomatic efforts aimed at brokering an end to Russia's war in Ukraine, which is nearing its fourth anniversary.
Despite months of negotiation and Russia's ongoing refusal to commit to ending to the war, on Feb. 13, U.S. President Donald Trump said Feb. 13 that President Volodymyr Zelensky needs to "get moving" to secure a peace deal with Russia.

The Kennedy curse: Assassinations, crashes, overdoses and the Jewish connection

“Reality surpasses all imagination,” the famous saying goes, and often it rings true. Just look at life since 2020. At least one family knows that all too well. For a change, we are not talking about the Kardashians or the British royal family, but about what might be considered their American counterpart: the Kennedys.
Since the mid-20th century, one of the most famous dynasties in the United States and around the world has made headlines time and again, almost always under tragic circumstances — assassinations, fatal accidents and even a lobotomy. The family is large. Irish Catholic by origin, many of its members had numerous children — Robert F. Kennedy, for example, died at 43 leaving behind 11 children — giving what some have grimly dubbed the serial killer named “Death” no shortage of potential victims.
Still, the scale of tragedy is hard to fathom. Of the nine children of family patriarch Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., four died unnatural deaths — two were assassinated and two were killed in plane crashes — and two others endured devastating life events, including a lobotomy and a near-fatal accident. The so-called curse spared neither children nor grandchildren, who fell victim to their own tragedies. Now, some say, it has reached the great-grandchildren.
Amid the grief, the family also produced compelling and influential figures — and more than a few romances, including that of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette, whose love story, too, was cut short. Tragically, their crash was only one episode in a chain of sorrow that has struck the family again and again.
Rosemary’s lobotomy
The Kennedy dramas began in the early 20th century. Joseph and Rose Kennedy married in 1914, launching the famed dynasty. They had nine children: Joseph Patrick Jr., John Fitzgerald, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert Francis, Jean and Edward, known as Ted.
Joseph Kennedy entered politics and served as U.S. ambassador to Britain in the late 1930s. He was widely regarded as charismatic. Some biographers have also described him as antisemitic.
Those searching for the roots of the family’s “curse” often point to a tragedy the parents themselves set in motion. Their third child, Rosemary, was introverted and struggled academically. At 11, she was sent to a boarding school for children with intellectual disabilities. At 15, she moved to a convent school with a special tutor, her writing skills reportedly at a fourth-grade level.
In her early 20s, her condition deteriorated, according to her sister Eunice. Rosemary experienced violent mood swings, lashed out physically and suffered seizures. When suspicions arose that she was sexually active — possibly with more than one man — her father, unwilling to endure rumors and embarrassment, approved a lobotomy on doctors’ advice. The procedure, which severs connections to the brain’s frontal lobe, was performed in 1941, long before public awareness of mental health issues had evolved. Later assessments suggested Rosemary may have suffered from depression rather than an intellectual disability.
The operation left the 23-year-old unable to speak coherently, with cognitive abilities comparable to those of a toddler. She spent the rest of her life in institutions. According to reports, her mother did not visit her for 20 years and her father never did. The procedure became public knowledge only in 1987. Unlike many Kennedys who died young, Rosemary lived to 86, dying in 2005.
Though less known than other tragedies, Rosemary’s story marked the beginning of what many describe as an unending series of disasters.
Fatal flights and assassinations
The eldest son, Joseph Patrick Kennedy Jr., was expected to follow his father into politics and, perhaps, the presidency. Instead, he became the first sibling to die prematurely. In 1944, during a secret mission in World War II, his military aircraft exploded over the English Channel.
Four years later, Kathleen Kennedy died in a plane crash en route to a holiday with her fiancé. Years earlier, she had been widowed when her husband, the Marquess of Hartington, was killed by a sniper in Belgium less than a month after Joseph Jr.’s death.
The political assassination that shook the world
The family rose to political prominence in the early 1960s when John F. Kennedy was elected president, fulfilling his father’s ambitions.
The Democrat won the White House in 1960 and was preparing to seek reelection when, on Nov. 22, 1963, he was shot and killed while riding in an open car with his wife, Jacqueline, in Dallas.
The assassination became one of the defining moments in American history, spawning investigations, cultural works and conspiracy theories. Lee Harvey Oswald, the convicted gunman, was himself killed two days later by Jack Ruby, who died of cancer in 1967.
Earlier in 1963, Jacqueline Kennedy had lost the couple’s premature infant son, Patrick, who lived just 39 hours.
Before the decade ended, Americans — and the Kennedys — were shaken again. Robert F. Kennedy, known as Bobby, was assassinated on June 5, 1968, while running for president. He was shot by Sirhan Sirhan, a 24-year-old Palestinian Christian immigrant from Jerusalem.
The motives for the assassination remain unclear. Sirhan initially said he acted in response to Kennedy’s support for Israel during the Six-Day War, but later changed his account, claiming he had “acted unconsciously, possibly as a result of hypnotic brainwashing.”
He was sentenced to death in 1969, but his sentence was commuted to life in prison, where he remains. In 2021, a parole board recommended his release, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected the decision. Sirhan, now 81, is expected to be eligible to seek parole again in 2027.
The brother linked to another woman’s death
After the assassinations of John and Robert, their brother Ted Kennedy remained in politics. In 1964, he survived a plane crash that killed an aide and the pilot, escaping with broken bones. In 1969, he drove off a bridge on Chappaquiddick Island with passenger Mary Jo Kopechne. He escaped the submerged car but failed to save her.
He contacted police about 10 hours later, drawing intense criticism and allegations he had been drinking. He pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a suspended sentence. The incident effectively ended his presidential prospects, though he served in the Senate for 47 years.
There was even an unexpected Israeli connection: an alleged romance with Israeli businesswoman and former lawmaker Pnina Rosenblum. In her memoir, “The Road to the Dream,” she wrote: “He was dynamic, mischievous and a lover of women. We met in Washington, and I remember him arriving in his red Mustang with a bottle of wine. I even cooked him dinner — chops and steamed vegetables.”
Ted Kennedy died in 2009 at 77 of a brain tumor. In 2011, his daughter Kara Kennedy died of a heart attack at 51.
Bobby’s descendants: drugs, deadly trees and drowning
Robert F. Kennedy’s children and grandchildren also faced tragedy. His fourth son, David, struggled with drug addiction after witnessing his father’s assassination on television. In 1984, he died of a drug overdose in a hotel room. In 1997, another son, Michael, died in a skiing accident in Aspen, Colorado, after crashing into a tree.
In 2012, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s ex-wife, Mary Richardson, died by suicide after years of battling addiction and depression. In 2019, Saoirse Kennedy Hill, a granddaughter of Robert F. Kennedy, died of an apparent overdose. Months later, Maeve Kennedy McKean and her 8-year-old son, Gideon, drowned after their canoe was swept away in the Chesapeake Bay.
The 'curse' spared not even the world’s sexiest man
In the 1980s and 1990s, John F. Kennedy Jr., the slain president’s son, became one of the family’s most prominent figures. A lawyer and magazine publisher, he was named People magazine’s “Sexiest Man Alive” in 1988.
In 1996, he married Carolyn Bessette, a former fashion publicist. They had been married just three years when their private plane, piloted by Kennedy himself, crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, likely due to spatial disorientation caused by heavy fog and darkness.
Kennedy, his wife and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, were en route to the wedding of his cousin, Rory Kennedy, when they were killed. It later emerged that he had not completed all recommended flight training or accumulated the suggested number of flying hours.
'I have added another tragedy to our family'
The sad stories continue to this day. In December 2025, Tatiana Schlossberg, a granddaughter of President John F. Kennedy, who was assassinated in 1963, died at 35 — just one month after revealing she had terminal cancer.
In an essay published in The New Yorker, Schlossberg expressed deep sorrow at adding another tragedy to her family’s long history of loss. “All my life I tried to be good — to be a good student, a good sister and a good daughter, to protect my mother and never sadden or anger her,” she wrote. “Now I have added another tragedy to her life, to our family’s life, and there is nothing I can do to prevent it.”
While the Kennedy name no longer dominates headlines as it once did, many descendants remain public figures. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., son of the slain senator, is an attorney and political figure who serves as health secretary in President Donald Trump’s administration, despite his father having been a Democrat. His role, like much associated with Trump, has drawn criticism, including from relatives.
There are also younger stars in the extended family: actor Patrick Schwarzenegger is the son of Maria Shriver, a third-generation member of the Kennedy family, and her former husband, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Their daughter Katherine is married to actor Chris Pratt.
Are angry rabbis to blame for the 'curse'?
Over the years, many have wondered whether the Kennedys were truly under a curse. The theories have ranged from mystical to psychological — and as often happens, Jews have surfaced in some of them.
One claim suggested the family fell victim to a “Pulsa Denura,” a Kabbalistic curse. Journalist Yigal Raviv addressed the issue in 2013. In an interview with ynet, he said: “Joseph Kennedy was the U.S. ambassador in London at the start of World War II. Some biographies strongly claim that a group of Jewish rabbis in England placed a Pulsa Denura curse on him. Today, after what happened to Rabin, we know what that means. According to those rabbis, all the disasters that befell the Kennedy family were the result of that curse.”
Another theory holds that Joseph Kennedy was cursed by a rabbi because, during his tenure as ambassador in London, he refused to help Jews flee the Nazis. A lighter version claims Kennedy had a heated argument with a rabbi during a sea voyage, and that the rabbi, angered by the dispute, cursed his descendants at the end of the trip.
A more grounded explanation suggests the Kennedys were simply a competitive, risk-taking family, many of whose members lived under intense public scrutiny and pressure — a combination that often ends in tragedy.

Jailed Palestinian leader Barghouti's writings to be collected in new book
Writings and correspondence from jailed Palestinian leader Marwan Barghouti will be collected in a new book due out later this year, with his family expressing hope on Friday that it would give a new audience insight into his mindset.
Unbroken: In Pursuit of Freedom for Palestine will be published in November and feature "private letters to his family, letters to public figures, press interviews, public statements, important historical documents", and personal photos, according to publisher Penguin Random House's Vintage division.
It will also include excerpts from his previous book, 2011's 1000 Days in Solitary Confinement, which was previously only available in Arabic, Vintage said.
Sometimes called the "Mandela of Palestine" by his supporters, Marwan Barghouti, 66, was one of the leaders of the Second Intifada, the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, and is often cited as a possible successor to Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
In June 2004, an Israeli court sentenced him to five life sentences after finding him guilty of involvement in four anti-Israeli attacks that killed five people.
"We just want to raise the awareness about who he is, why is he important for the Palestinian cause," Arab Barghouti, who lives in the occupied West Bank, told AFP. "These are his writings so everyone can have access to them."
He added that his mother, Fadwa, who has campaigned for her husband's release over the years and wrote the book's introduction, also hoped the publication would broaden the reach of Marwan Barghouti's thoughts.
"She really wishes that people can hear from him and see what he thinks and see his writings, especially his grandchildren," Arab said.
The book's publication will come roughly a year after his family and supporters launched a new campaign to secure Barghouti's release, after his imprisonment caught US President Donald Trump's attention.
In an interview with Time magazine in October 2025, shortly after a US-brokered ceasefire went into effect in Gaza, Trump was asked if he thought Barghouti, as a potentially unifying Palestinian leader, should be released from prison.
Trump responded that he had previously been approached with that question and would be "making a decision" on the matter, but did not elaborate.
Though Arab Barghouti has not been allowed to speak to his father in three years, he said the elder Barghouti represents Palestinian unity and the best chance for a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians.

Share where risky oysters are from, authorities urged after food poisoning cases
Restaurants say demand has plunged amid calls for diners to avoid eating them raw as number of norovirus-related food poisoning cases rises
Some Hong Kong restaurant operators have urged authorities to clearly tell the public about the origins of problematic raw oysters following a spate of food poisoning cases, so that diners can make informed decisions in the lead-up to Lunar New Year, their peak business season.
Consumers are becoming increasingly wary about oysters, with some restaurants saying demand has plunged amid calls from health officials for diners to avoid consuming them raw as the number of norovirus-related food poisoning cases rises.
“Hong Kong people love eating oysters,” said Wilson Lau, director of an oyster restaurant in Yuen Long. “But some people may have just heard the news, do not comprehend the issue clearly and may even think all oysters are problematic. It will affect the business of many other restaurants.
“Therefore, when the government releases information, it should say clearly where the problematic oysters are from. It is now like we are tarred with the same brush [as outlets linked to problematic oysters].”
A number of restaurants told the South China Morning Post on Friday night that diners were choosing oysters sourced from European markets rather than from Asia after Korean imports were linked to 13 out of the 37 food poisoning cases between February 1 and 12.
But the Centre for Food Safety said on the same day that some patients had eaten more than one type of oyster from markets such as South Korea, Spain, France, Japan and Ireland.

Trump privately lashed out at Republicans who condemned racist video depicting the Obamas as apes, report claims
‘Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House,’ Republican Senator Tim Scott said in reaction to the video

Donald Trump has privately lashed out at two Republican senators who condemned a racist video posted to the president’s Truth Social account last week depicting the Obamas as apes, according to a new report.
A video showing former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama’s faces superimposed onto the bodies of dancing primates to the song “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” has received sharp backlash across the political aisle.
Even some of Trump’s supporters in Congress rebuked the video, which the White House claims a staffer “erroneously” posted on February 5. The clip was taken down several hours after it was shared.
“Praying it was fake because it’s the most racist thing I’ve seen out of this White House. The President should remove it,” Tim Scott of South Carolina, the only Black Republican senator, wrote on X in response.
Trump then complained to allies while at Mar-a-Lago last weekend about Scott, people familiar with the matter told CNN.
“The president felt he could’ve handled that matter privately,” a senior Trump administration official told the outlet.
The official added: “He was like, ‘We work together all the time. He didn’t need to comment publicly.’”
Senator Katie Britt from Alabama also denounced the racist video, writing on X last Friday, “This content was rightfully removed, should have never been posted to begin with, and is not who we are as a nation.”
One CNN source said Trump slammed Britt, throwing out expletives, and said she was dead to him.
Britt’s office called CNN’s reporting “fake news” and defended her relationship with the president.
“Senator Britt has a 100% voting record with President Trump and remains one of his strongest allies in the Senate,” her office told the outlet. “Any narrative suggesting otherwise is not only misleading, it is flat out false.”
The White House boasted about Trump’s “great respect” for “incredible ally” Britt, per CNN.
The Independent has reached out to the White House and the offices of Scott and Britt.
Trump has refused to apologize for the racist video, telling reporters on Air Force One on his way to Palm Beach, Florida, last Friday, “I didn’t make a mistake.” The president insisted he only saw the first part of the video about “voter fraud,” and not the end that depicted the Obamas as apes.
The start of the video promoted false claims that Trump lost the 2020 presidential election because of voter fraud.
“It was a very strong post in terms of voter fraud,” Trump told reporters last Friday, adding that no one on his team knew the clip depicting the Obamas as apes was at the end. The president said if his staff had looked, they “probably would’ve had the sense to take it down.”
Trump said that he spoke with Scott, telling reporters, “Tim is a great guy. He understood that a hundred percent.”
The president told reporters Thursday that the staffer the White House claims mistakenly posted the video has not been fired.

The race for Farrer, and a strange saga that left the Liberals in shock

The race for Farrer, and a strange saga that left the Liberals in shock
If new Coalition leader Angus Taylor cares to study his history, he might learn that weird consequences can erupt – and have done so, to the great shock of the Liberal Party – when the voters of the vast electorate of Farrer, about to be abandoned by Sussan Ley, are asked to choose a new member.
The last time things went crazy for the Liberal Party in Farrer was in 1984, and no Liberal who was around at the time is likely to have forgotten it.
The byelection in Farrer precipitated by Ley’s decision to quit parliament following her defeat as leader is guaranteed to be Taylor’s first political test, and it is shaping up as a bunfight.
The Liberal Party and the Nationals can be expected to field candidates, splitting the traditional conservative vote, a surging One Nation has announced it will enter the race, and at least one popular and battle-ready independent – Michelle Milthorpe, who came second to Ley at the last election – is already out of the blocks. It wouldn’t be surprising if Labor chose to stay out of the contest and watch the feathers fly from a distance.
Farrer, sprawling along the Murray River from the foothills of the Snowy Mountains to the South Australian border, has always been conservative territory.
After the electorate was founded in 1949, it spent a comfortable quarter-century in the hands of the Liberal Party’s Sir David Fairbairn, wealthy grazier and minister in every Liberal cabinet until 1972.
Liberal Wal Fife, a minister under Malcolm Fraser, then held the seat from 1975 to 1984, when his home town of Wagga was removed from the electorate in a redistribution, and he transferred to the seat of Hume – now held by Taylor.
The election for Farrer in 1984, then, was expected to be won handsomely by the Liberal candidate, the long-time mayor of Albury, John Roach.
A fellow named Tim Fischer was chosen to run for the Nationals, but his bumbling manner of speaking meant he wasn’t initially taken too seriously.
Roach was so confident that he happily swanned off for a trip to the Netherlands in the middle of the election campaign.
The reason remains astonishing.
In 1934, the citizens of Albury were credited with saving the crew of a KLM Royal Dutch Airline plane called the Uiver.
The plane became lost in a storm over the upper Murray during the London to Melbourne air race, an event followed keenly by people throughout the world.
With the situation growing ever more desperate, the Albury town engineer used the town’s electric lighting system to flash morse code into the night sky, hoping to catch the attention of the Uiver’s captain.
The local radio station’s announcer, Cleaver Bunton, went on air and called on everyone with a car to drive urgently to the racecourse and line up to create a makeshift landing strip lit with their headlights.
Amazingly, the Uiver, guided by the lights, landed safely. It became bogged, but the following morning, townsfolk dug it out and pushed it to solid ground. The plane took off and won the race by handicap.
It caused a world sensation.
Fifty years later, the Dutch government announced it would present a medal honouring the city of Albury.
Alderman John Roach, Albury mayor and Liberal candidate for Farrer, flew to the Netherlands to accept the honour, leaving behind the election campaign.
In Roach’s absence, Fischer turned out to be a very canny candidate for the Nationals.
He hurtled around the electorate, meeting voters during brief stops in every small town and district, earning the nickname Two Minute Tim.
He even hired a venerable plane, the Silver City, formerly the VIP aircraft used by BHP executives, loaded it with journalists – including me, as I was employed by the Albury Border Morning Mail at the time – and took his campaign to the air.
When Roach returned from the Netherlands, I met him at Albury airport, inquired about whether he’d enjoyed his overseas jaunt, and asked whether he realised he was about to lose his tilt for Farrer.
He wasn’t happy and, unsurprisingly, berated me for asking such an impudent question.
Sure enough, a few days later Fischer became the member for Farrer. He held it comfortably until 2001, when he retired and Ley won it back for the Liberal Party.
Angus Taylor, having been handed a particularly awkward byelection by Sussan Ley, the leader he defeated on Friday, might advise whoever is chosen as the Liberal candidate to check their travel diaries and cancel any trip west of the South Australian border or east of the upper Murray.

US strikes second alleged drug boat in a week, bringing death toll to 133

The US military’s Southern Command, which oversees operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, said it had carried out its second deadly boat strike this week. The command said the latest strike killed three suspected drug smugglers in the Caribbean on Friday.
“Intelligence confirmed the vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,” the Southern Command said in a statement. The command included a video of the strike with its announcement, which shows a boat traveling through the water as it explodes into flames after being hit with what looks like a missile.
The Southern Command and the Pentagon did not immediately return requests for additional information.
The Friday strike comes after the Southern Command announced a deadly attack on another boat in the eastern Pacific on Monday. That hit resulted in the deaths of two suspected drug smugglers, with one survivor.
Friday’s killings bring the death toll to at least 133 people in 39 strikes, according to Pentagon statements tallied by the Intercept. This appears to be the command’s first strike in the Caribbean since November; the vast majority of the most recent strikes have happened in the Pacific.
The legality of these boat strikes is under scrutiny, with legal experts saying the attacks amount to extrajudicial killings by the Pentagon with a complete lack of accountability.
“Those being killed by US military strikes at sea are denied any due process whatsoever,” reads an analysis published Friday by the Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy organization. The Trump administration is “asserting and exercising an apparently unlimited license to kill people that the president deems to be terrorists”.
Earlier this month, Gen Francis L Donovan was sworn in as the new head of the Southern Command. Donovan took over after Alvin Holsey, a US navy admiral, chose to retire over reported disagreements over the boat-strike policy.
Friday’s strike in the Caribbean comes after the US launched an attack on the capital of Venezuela in early January, apprehending then-president Nicolás Maduro on alleged drug-trafficking charges. The Pentagon has framed its operations in the region as a campaign against “narco-terrorism”, but has provided scant evidence of coordinated drug-smuggling rings.

Young family pays $1.04 million for large inner south-east unit

By Caroline Zielinski
A fully renovated art deco house in the heart of St Kilda passed in at auction on Saturday after a bidding war between two parties.
The home at 27 Havelock Street, located in a quiet pocket just off popular Acland Street, featured three bedrooms, an entertainer’s kitchen with skylights and a private deck. It was guided at $1.4 million to $1.5 million.
Jellis Craig Port Phillip auctioneer Michael Hingston started the bidding at $1.4 million, which was soon met by the first bidder. As he was about to call the auction, a second bidder jumped in with a bid of $1,425,000.
The pair battled it out in increments of $25,000 until they hit the $1.5 million mark, after which the increments slowed to $10,000, $5000 and $2000. Hingston worked hard to get the property on the market at $1.65 million, but sought advice from the vendor when a final bid of $1,585,000 was placed.
There is no legal requirement for a vendor’s reserve to be in line with their property’s price guide.
The second bidder was then invited to enter negotiations with the vendor, which were ongoing at the time of publication.
The property was one of 828 scheduled to go to auction in Melbourne this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 68.4 per cent from 601 reported results throughout the week, while 72 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
Lead agent Katie Ryan said the 2026 market had “started stronger than it finished last year”.
“There’s plenty of buyers around and not enough properties on the market,” she said, adding that while the first interest rate rise has not yet had an impact, a subsequent rise could.
In Melbourne’s north-east, a local family secured the keys to a quirky, colourful house after placing the winning bid of $1,052,000.
The three-bedroom home at 2/178 Porter Road, Heidelberg Heights, featuring a pool and sustainable design elements like a rainwater tanks, was listed with a price guide of $920,000 to $980,000.
Ray White MacLeod lead agent Brett Schembri said the auction opened with a genuine bid of $950,000, with bids from three parties quickly surpassing the reserve price of $980,000.
“The bidding was strong, quick, not much hesitation,” he said. The buyer was a young, local family who “really appreciated the quality and effort the vendors had put into the home”.
The vendors, a retired couple, were moving overseas to be with family.
Schembri said the market has been interesting, but patchy. “We had four auctions this week, and all sold well under hammer,” he said.
Earlier, a young family paid $1.04 million for a unit with “house-like proportions” in Elwood in Melbourne’s inner south-east, outbidding two other parties.
The three-bedroom, two-bathroom unit at 13A/3 Wimbledon Avenue, Elwood, was guided at $1 million to $1.1 million, with a reserve price of $1.02 million. It featured a front courtyard and was within walking distance of Acland Street and the beach.
Belle Property St Kilda auctioneer and listing agent Will Johnson said bidding started at $980,000 and continued with a “fast back and forward in increments of mainly $5000”. Both underbidders were downsizers.
The vendor, also a family with two children, was selling the property to fund a renovation for a newly purchased house, he added.
Despite last week’s interest rate rise and fears of further rises, Johnson said he was seeing a lot of buyers with finance ready to go.
“There is plenty of activity in the market – a lot of things selling before auction,” he said.
In Malvern East, an investor paid $45,000 above the top end of the guide for an apartment needing renovation.
The unit at 7/245 Waverley Road, featuring two robed bedrooms and balconies overlooking gardens, was guided at $540,000 to $590,000, with a reserve of $580,000.
The bidding, which opened at $540,000, quickly reached the reserve price as five parties battled it out, said Nelson Alexander Kew listing agent Nick Whyte.
“We had four bidders still active within the last $15,000,” he said. The property sold under the hammer for $635,000 to an investor for “the future use of the family”.
“I imagine they will keep it as an investment for four to five years and then the children will reside there,” Whyte said.
He was confident the market was in good shape, especially in the first-home buyer demographic.
“To have five bidders [compete] for an apartment that needs to be renovated, [that has] a company share title and which wasn’t a straightforward sale in that respect, shows you there is good depth in that first-home buyer market.”

Rome Flynn repeats as NBA All-Star Celebrity Game MVP and Team Giannis wins 65-58
Rome Flynn repeated as MVP and Team Giannis beat Team Anthony 65-58 in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game
- Bookmark
Rome Flynn earned MVP honors for the second straight year in the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday night, scoring 17 points to lead a team coached by Giannis Antetokounmpo to a 65-58 victory.
Actor-comedian Anthony Anderson coached the losing team, led by former 7-foot-6 NBA player Tacko Fall with 20 points.
The game brought basketball back to the Forum, home of the Los Angeles Lakers’ “Showtime” era until 1999, when they moved 10 miles away to downtown Los Angeles. Now, it has a different sponsor name under Los Angeles Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and is mostly used as a concert and entertainment venue.
K-pop made its debut at the game with boy group CORTIS performing at halftime.
Victor Wembanyama tossed up the opening tip between Team Giannis' Jenna Bandy and Team Anthony's Adrien Nunez, who got control, was fouled and missed his first throw.
Bandy was the only woman in either team's starting lineup.
Team Giannis had a huge advantage in the paint with Fall grabbing most of the rebounds. His dunk made it a one-point game in the third.
Chinese actor-singer Dylan Wang garnered the loudest screams of the night, especially after he scored back-to-back baskets in the first quarter for Team Giannis.
Two of the oldest guys on the court were Phoenix Suns owner Mat Ishbia (age 46) and Rick Schnall (50-something), who's part of the Charlotte Hornets ownership group. Schnall fouled Ishbia in the first quarter, and Ishbia hit the free throws in a throwback to his Michigan State playing days.
Los Angeles Chargers star Keenan Allen hit a long shot from the red, white and blue line that was worth 4 points for Team Anthony. It launched a flurry of points for the wide receiver in the second quarter and he finished with 18 points.
Mascots from the Hornets and Mavericks alternated as sixth men restricted to playing in the backcourt for a bit in the third quarter.
Sidelined since Jan. 23 with a calf strain, Antetokounmpo won’t be playing in the All-Star Game on Sunday.
But the two-time MVP was assisted by his brothers Thanasis and Alex on Friday. Another assistant was Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts.
Former NBA player Jeremy Lin credited Betts for an inspiring halftime speech. “He definitely knows a lot about basketball,” Lin said.
The game marked the start of All-Star weekend, followed by the Rising Stars game down the street at Intuit Dome.

The beef began over a cardinal rule of pickleball: A Florida man accused his opponent of playing a shot in a restricted rectangle on the court known as the kitchen.
From there, the match between two husband-and-wife teams descended into an exchange of verbal insults and chaos on Feb 8 at Spruce Creek Country Club in Port Orange, Florida, about 19km south-west of Daytona Beach, Florida, authorities said.
Fists flew; a paddle was used as a weapon; and 20 people joined the fracas, according to the sheriff’s office in Volusia County, which charged the husband and wife from one of the teams with felony battery.
The melee was described in explicit detail in an arrest affidavit.
Three people were injured during the fight, one of whom was transported to a hospital to be treated for cuts and bruises on his face, wrote a deputy who responded to the club.
“All three stated they had been participating in a pickleball match and were assaulted by members of the opposing team,” wrote the deputy, Tiecha West.
The couple who instigated the fight fled the club for their gated condominium on the beach, about 19km away in Ponce Inlet, Florida, and were later arrested, according to the affidavit.
They were identified by the sheriff’s office as Anthony Sapienza, 63, and Julianne Sapienza, 51.
Anthony Sapienza was charged with two counts of felony battery on a person 65 years or older, and one count of aggravated battery causing bodily harm, which, if convicted, carry maximum sentences of five years in prison on the first charge and 15 years for aggravated battery.
Julianne Sapienza was charged with one count of felony battery on a person 65 years or older.
Mr Matthew W. Thompson, a lawyer for Anthony Sapienza, said in an e-mail on Feb 13 that his client had pleaded not guilty.
“There is far more to this story than what has been alleged, and we are confident that the facts will ultimately demonstrate his innocence,” Mr Thompson said. “We will vigorously defend him against these accusations.”
A lawyer for Julianne Sapienza did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Feb 13.
According to West, the match became heated when Anthony Sapienza accused his opponent of a rules violation.
“The ‘kitchen’ is the area extending seven feet from both sides of the net to each sideline and is restricted to prevent players from standing at the net and smashing the ball downward,” West wrote in the affidavit.
At one point during the match, Anthony Sapienza used a misogynistic vulgarity to describe his opponent’s wife, which her husband took exception to, the arrest affidavit said.
The situation reached a boil from there, according to the deputy, who said that the man told him that Anthony Sapienza “then approached him and punched him on the left side of the face and struck him with a pickleball paddle, causing significant bleeding”.
Pickleball paddles resemble those used in table tennis, only they are larger and heavier.
Sapienza continued punching the other man after both fell to the ground, the man’s wife told the deputy. The man was taken to a hospital and was expected to have permanent scarring from his injuries, West wrote.
When the man’s wife ran to check on her husband, Sapienza pushed her to the ground, investigators said.
Another man was punched in the nose by Sapienza after the man tried to pull Sapienza away, according to the affidavit, which said that man was 70 years old.
His nose was bleeding profusely, according to West, who said that Julianne Sapienza began yelling at the man and also punched him.
Matt Payne, the general manager of Spruce Creek Country Club, said in an interview on Feb 13 that many people had been seeking video of the brawl, but one did not exist.
He said that the couple who were arrested did not belong to the club, which has about 550 members, and that the match was part of a league from outside.
“They have been banned from the community for life,” he said. NYTIMES

3 dead as US launches new strike on suspected drug boat in Caribbean
The attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on ‘narcoterrorists’ in the Caribbean and Pacific to 133
The attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 133 people in at least 38 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
“Three narcoterrorists were killed during this action. No US military forces were harmed,” US Southern Command said in a statement on social media.
A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.
But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists”, prompting heated debate about the legality of the operations that have expanded from the Caribbean to the Pacific.

A serious safety incident at an oil refinery has prompted the Health Ministry to issue a directive to all medical institutions and emergency response bodies to inspect all air and oxygen canisters in their facilities, a ministry spokesperson announced on Friday.
Two women were declared dead after being found unresponsive in a lab at the Ashdod Refinery on Wednesday, and early reports suggested a malfunction in their oxygen suits. The Health Ministry stated that concerns were raised about potentially toxic substances in the oxygen cylinders.
According to the directive, all cylinders must be inspected to verify that the imprint on the cylinder body, the color, and the label indicating the contents are all consistent. The ministry emphasized that the supplier's identity must also be consistent.
Any cylinder that does not meet that requirement must be taken out of service and marked accordingly.
Additionally, all canisters from the company Salem Yaakov and Sons are to be taken out of service immediately. Health maintenance organizations are working to conduct a recall of canisters in use by home-ventilated patients and to provide alternatives.
United Hatzalah suspends use of all oxygen canisters
United Hatzalah has instructed all volunteers across Israel to temporarily suspend the use of their oxygen canisters following the directive on Friday, according to a United Hatzalah statement.
The statement stressed that this did not reflect any issue with United Hatzalah or first responders' use of oxygen tanks and that patient safety is always its paramount concern. The organization is complying with the most stringent medical standards.
United Hatzalah’s logistics and medical divisions are working to replace the canisters and supply approved alternative equipment.
The organization remains in communication with the Health Ministry as the review continues and operations are restored.

Israel's MMA Association celebrated a historic achievement as Yotam Glander won the first-ever gold medal for Israel's under-21 national team at the European Championships, in Belgrade, Serbia, according to a report by N12.
Competing in the 52 kg weight class, Glander's victory marked the third consecutive year he reached the finals of the European Championships.
In 2024, he won a silver medal in the under-18 division, followed by another silver medal in 2025 in the under-21 category.
N12 reported that Glander defeated his Spanish opponent in under a minute, using a rear-naked choke to take his victory.
Glander's gold win marked Israel's third medal of the championship, following earlier victories by Guy Priente and Alon Avital in the youth division. In total, Israel's teams earned 19 medals across all age groups.
Also representing the association and Israel at the competition were four Israeli international referees: Ofer Lider, Arkady Sechkovsky, Shai Ofir, and Roi Ben Shalom.
'Proud to represent the State of Israel'
Ido Priente, president of the Israel MMA Association and Glander's coach, stated, "This has been an unprecedented European Championship for Israel's teams this year. For the first time, we won three historic gold medals and a total of 19 medals, representing a significant improvement in both quantity and quality. This is undoubtedly the most successful competition in the association's history since its establishment.”
He continued, “There is no doubt that the present and future generation of MMA in Israel is flourishing. I would also like to thank Eric Kaplan and the ‘Eilat’ Association for their endless support of our activities. I am prouder than ever of Yotam's victory. I had no doubt he would win gold this year, and now we are already looking ahead to the World Championships.”
“We are always proud to represent the State of Israel around the world and will continue to do so with great pride."

US unclear on UNRWA future, jettisoning would leave black hole

Main donor US unclear on UNRWA future, jettisoning it would leave black hole, agency chief says
The United States is still not clear about how it sees the future role of the UN Palestinian refugee agency, its chief said on Friday, warning that jettisoning it would create a black hole similar to Iraq after 2003.
US President Donald Trump's administration has accused UNRWA staff of having links with the Palestinian group Hamas, allegations UNRWA has vigorously disputed.
Washington was long UNRWA's biggest donor, but froze funding in January 2024 after Israel accused about a dozen UNRWA staff of taking part in the deadly 7 October attacks.
"There is no definitive answer, because the interest of the US is also to be successful in this process and if you get rid of an agency like ours before you have an alternative, you are also creating a huge black hole," UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini told Reuters on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.
"Remember what happened in Iraq in 2003 when the entire administration had been dismantled (following the US-led invasion). There was no alternative and people were left without any services," he said in an interview.
UNRWA has functioned for decades as the main international agency providing for the welfare of millions of Palestinian descendants of those who fled or were driven from homes during the war around Israel's 1948 founding.
Lazzarini, who leaves his post at the end of March, said UNRWA did not foresee any more cuts in the immediate term, and it continued to offer public health and education services that no one else was really providing.
He urged Gulf Arab countries to increase their support because their contribution did not match their strong expression of solidarity with Palestinian refugees.
Israel accuses UNRWA of bias, and the Israeli parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with it.

Elon Musk's xAI faces threat of NAACP lawsuit over air pollution from Mississippi data center

Elon Musk's xAI, which merged with SpaceX last week, is facing increased pressure from environmental and civil rights groups over pollution concerns, this time at the company's facility in Southaven, Mississippi.
On Friday, the Southern Environmental Law Center and Earthjustice, on behalf of the NAACP, sent a notice of intent to sue xAI and subsidiary MZX Tech LLC, saying the company's use of dozens of natural gas-burning turbines requires a federal permit, violates the Clean Air Act and harms nearby communities.
Pollution from the turbines, which xAI has also used in Memphis, Tennessee, for its Colossus 1 and Colossus 2 data centers, has been a major source of local contention for more than a year.
Plans for a third data center in Southaven, located about 20 miles from Memphis, were announced early this year, when Mississippi Republican Governor Tate Reeves said he expected the project to create "hundreds of permanent jobs throughout DeSoto County."
Launched by Musk in 2023, xAI is trying to compete with OpenAI, Anthropic and Google in the booming generative AI market. On Feb. 2, Musk said SpaceX, his rocket maker and defense contractor, acquired xAI in a deal that valued the combined entity at $1.25 trillion.
Musk is banking on the area in and around Memphis as the foundation of his AI ambitions, and he's been flouting environmental rules in order to develop as quickly as possible. Musk's social network X, formerly Twitter, is also owned by xAI, which created the Grok AI chatbot and image generator.
XAI is currently under a myriad of government investigations in Europe, Asia and the U.S. after Grok enabled users to easily create and share deepfake porn, including explicit imagery depicting child sexual abuse.
Last year, residents in the majority-Black community of Boxtown in South Memphis testified at public hearings about a stench in the air, and the impact of worsening smog on their health caused by xAI's use of natural gas turbines. Research by scientists at the University of Tennessee also found that xAI's turbine use added to air pollution woes in the area.
Environmental advocates, including the NAACP, had previously said they would sue to stop xAI's un-permitted use of the turbines in Memphis. But they stopped short of filing a legal complaint after Shelby County's health department allowed xAI to treat the turbines as temporary, non-road engines, and issued permits for their use.
At the federal level, the EPA recently clarified gray areas of the law and said these turbines can't be categorized as temporary non-road engines. Nonetheless, xAI has been using the turbines across state lines without obtaining federal permits.
XAI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Noise pollution from the turbines has also been a source of local consternation. Jason Haley, a Southaven resident, told CNBC the turbines make headache-inducing noises around the clock that he can hear inside his home.
Haley is part of a group called Safe and Sound which documents the decibel levels, and is pressing local officials to stop xAI from making so much noise, especially overnight, with its turbines.
Mississippi officials will hold a public hearing, scheduled for Tuesday, for community members who wish to express their concerns about xAI's expansion plans in the area. The hearing will focus on whether the state should give xAI permission to install and run 41 permanent turbines at its Southaven facility, Mississippi Today previously reported.
Similar community dynamics are playing out across the U.S. as tech giants rush to construct massive data centers, which can strain local energy and water supply and cause prices to increase.
In November, Microsoft ended efforts to build a data center in Wisconsin due to the community's vocal opposition. Amazon also pulled out of plans for a data center in Arizona after community protests.
In terms of Musk's Southaven project, Patrick Anderson, a senior attorney with SELC, said xAI "has to follow the law, just like any other company."
"And when it flouts the Clean Air Act's bedrock protections against unpermitted emissions, it puts the health and welfare of ordinary citizens at risk," Anderson said in an email. "That's why we intend to hold xAI accountable here."
The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Jet2 flight from Turkey to Britain diverted after mid-air brawl

BRUSSELS – A brawl broke out on a Jet2 flight from Turkey to Britain on Feb 12, forcing the pilot to land in Brussels and resulting in the removal of two passengers.
The fight, captured in dramatic videos shared widely on social media, happened in the air after the flight took off from Antalya, Turkey, en route to Manchester, England.
The plane was diverted to Brussels three hours into a roughly five-hour flight. Police boarded the plane in Brussels and removed two passengers, who are now banned from the airline for life, according to a statement from Jet2.
The statement attributed the fight to “the appalling behavior of two disruptive passengers”.
“We will also vigorously pursue them to recover the costs that we incurred as a result of this diversion,” the statement said.
“As a family-friendly airline, we take a zero-tolerance approach to disruptive passenger behaviour, and we are very sorry that other customers and our colleagues on board had to experience this too.”
Jet2, a British budget airline, is no stranger to banning and fining those who cause in-air disruptions. In 2022, the airline billed two brothers £50,000 pounds (S$86,230) and handed them a lifetime ban after their violent behaviour reportedly led to a flight diversion.
A couple was banned from flying with Jet2 in 2017 after a disagreement turned physical and also forced the flight to divert.
Incidents of so-called “air rage” rose in 2021, when passengers returned to the skies after an extended quarantine period during the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to the US Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration saw a 400 per cent increase in these types of mid-air outbursts from 2019 to 2025.
Ms Wendy Patrick, a prosecutor and behavioural expert, said in an e-mail that the cramped conditions on many modern airplanes leads to air rage developing quickly. In some cases, she said, the attempts of other passengers and flight crew to de-escalate the situation can only make it worse.
Multiple passengers appeared to be involved in the brawl on Feb 12, with men and women of various ages crowding into the aisle of the plane. Punches were thrown, glasses were plucked off one man’s face and screams reverberated through the cabin.
At one point, according to the videos, a flight attendant stood on a seat and appealed to passengers to stop fighting as a man in front of her held another man in a headlock. NYTIMES

Developer pays $4.5m for unrenovated Federation house in Marrickville

By Robyn Willis
A waterfront apartment with uninterrupted views of the Sydney Opera House and Harbour Bridge sold for $3,705,000 on Saturday, with one half of the successful bidders – a couple – describing it as her “Valentine’s Day present”.
Auctioneer Scott Kennedy-Green opened bidding for the two-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment at 6/23 Waruda Street, Kirribilli at $3,150,000. It initially rose in increments of $50,000 before quickly slowing to $5000. A final $3000 bid sealed the deal.
Both the price guide and the reserve were $3.5 million.
Agent Nigel Mukhi from McGrath McMahons Point said all three bidders were couples looking to invest and eventually downsize into the apartment.
He said the vendors had kept the property, which is just a stone’s throw from the prime minister’s Sydney residence, Kirribilli House, as a “bolthole”, along with their home in Queensland, but had decided they no longer needed it.
Mukhi said the result was in keeping with prices elsewhere in the beautifully maintained art deco block.
“The apartment upstairs sold for $3.6 million last year, and it’s the same size. Anything I sell with views of both icons does well. In terms of what the view is worth, the value is $1.5 million to $2 million alone.”
The new owner of the property said the apartment overlooking Beulah Street Wharf provided “a $100 million view for a several million”.
The property was one of 1009 scheduled to go to auction in Sydney this week. By evening, Domain Group recorded a preliminary auction clearance rate of 69.8 per cent from 649 reported results throughout the week, while 127 auctions were withdrawn. Withdrawn auctions are counted as unsold properties when calculating the clearance rate.
In Strathfield, a young family bought their first home, paying $1.35 million for a three-bedroom townhouse at 4/523-527 Liverpool Road, Strathfield.
The property had a guide of $1.1 million and a reserve of $1.34 million. There is no legal requirement for a vendor’s reserve to be in line with their property’s price guide.
Agent Jesse Di Loreto from Richard Matthews Real Estate said the renovated townhouse had more than 400 inquiries, with six registered and active bidders on the day. In the end, it came down to the young family and a downsizing couple.
Di Loreto said he sold this property to the current vendors four years ago, but they were now looking to upgrade into a house. He said there were some concerns among buyers over the effects of the recent rate hike on this end of the market.
“It’s a bit more sensitive for anything under $1.5 million,” he said.
In Marrickville, a developer was the successful bidder for an unrenovated house, paying $4.5 million for the 727-square-metre site with dual access, beating out an underbidder with restoration plans.
The property at 16 Darley Street, Marrickville was being offered for the first time in 60 years and was marketed as an opportunity to renovate and restore or to redevelop.
The price guide for the property was $4 million while the reserve was $4.2 million.
McGrath Leichhardt agent Alexandra Stamatiou-Buda said the underbidder had plans to restore the single level, five-bedroom Federation home. Interest in the level site was strong, she said, with all six registered bidders active.
McGrath Real Estate managing director John McGrath acted as auctioneer for the sale. He had a longstanding connection to the family home and had dined there in the past.
Stamatiou-Buda said she was unsurprised by the interest in the level block, which was marketed with “dual frontage and superb potential”. It is also within walking distance of shops, cafes and transport hubs like the soon-to-be-completed Metro station.
“There’s strong interest in these properties,” she said. “The size and the quality – they don’t come around often.”
In nearby Dulwich Hill, four bidders registered for the auction of 35 Herbert Street, Dulwich Hill, a circa 1917 four-bedroom Californian bungalow that went under the hammer for $3.5 million.
It had a price guide of $3.2 million and a reserve of $3.5 million.
The bungalow has been updated and restored, maintaining many of its original features, including patterned ceilings and original timberwork, and is surrounded by a well-maintained garden.
Adrian William Real Estate agent Norman Tran said all bidders were owner-occupiers attracted by the character and condition of the house.
“The house was a testament to the owners, to how they have kept and restored the house,” he said.
All the bidders were from the inner west, looking to upgrade and enjoy access to local amenities.
“Dulwich Hill’s popularity is underpinned by the recent opening of the GreenWay,” Tran said. “It’s been a value add. The buyer was talking about it with the owner, telling them he cycles a lot so the GreenWay was a big drawcard.”
The GreenWay is a walking and cycling corridor.

Trump administration sues Harvard, accusing it of not cooperating on admissions probe
Justice Department alleges school ‘refused to produce pertinent data and documents,’ while university says it’s being targeted for ‘refusing to surrender its independence’
The Trump administration sued Harvard University on Friday, accusing it of failing to comply with a federal investigation and seeking documents to determine whether the university had illegally considered race in its admissions process.
The move comes less than two weeks after US President Donald Trump said his administration was seeking $1 billion from Harvard to settle probes into school policies, after a news report that said Trump had dropped his demand for a payment from the Ivy League school.
A Harvard spokesperson said the university is committed to following the law and has been responding to the government’s inquiries in good faith.
“The university will continue to defend itself against these retaliatory actions which have been initiated simply because Harvard refused to surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights in response to unlawful government overreach,” the spokesperson said.
Trump’s administration has been threatening to withhold federal funds from Harvard and several other universities over issues including pro-Palestinian protests against Israel since the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the Gaza war, campus diversity and transgender policies.
The Justice Department said on Friday in a press release that Harvard had “repeatedly slow-walked the pace of production and refused to produce pertinent data and documents,” including admissions policies and correspondence related to banned diversity, equity and inclusion programs.
In the complaint filed in Boston federal court, Justice Department lawyers said the documents requested will help assess whether Harvard is complying with a 2023 decision by the US Supreme Court which said that race-conscious college admissions programs are unconstitutional.
The Justice Department said it brought the lawsuit “solely to compel Harvard to produce documents relating to any consideration of race in admission” and “does not accuse Harvard of any discriminatory conduct, nor does it seek monetary damages or the revocation of federal funding.”
The administration last year attempted to cancel hundreds of grants awarded to Harvard researchers on the grounds the school failed to do enough to address harassment of Jewish students on its campus, prompting Harvard to sue.
Trump’s attempts to freeze federal funds for Harvard have faced legal resistance and the two sides have failed to reach a deal thus far.

Fire at Havana oil refinery as Cuba’s fuel crisis deepens
A fire at a key fuel refinery in the capital comes amid Cuba’s mounting fuel emergency due to US-imposed restrictions.
A fire broke out at a key fuel processing plant in the Cuban capital Havana, threatening to exacerbate an energy crisis as the country struggles under an oil blockade imposed by the United States.
A large plume of smoke was seen rising above Havana Bay from the Nico Lopez refinery on Friday, drawing the attention of the capital’s residents before fading as fire crews fought to bring the situation under control.

Cuba’s Ministry of Energy and Mines said the fire, which erupted in a warehouse at the refinery, was eventually extinguished and that “the cause is under investigation”. There were no injuries and the fire did not spread to nearby areas, the ministry said in a post on social media.
“The workday at the Nico Lopez Refinery continues with complete normalcy,” the ministry said.
The location of the fire was close to where two oil tankers were moored in Havana’s harbour.
Cuba, which has been in a severe economic crisis for years, relied heavily on oil imports from Venezuela, which have been cut off since the abduction of the country’s leader Nicolas Maduro by United States forces last month.
US President Donald Trump has also threatened Cuba’s government and passed a recent executive order allowing for trade tariffs on any country that supplies oil to the island.
The country has seen widespread power outages due to the lack of fuel. Bus and train services have been cut, some hotels have closed, schools and universities have been restricted, and public sector workers are on a four-day work week. Staffing at hospitals was also cut back.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week of a humanitarian “collapse” in Cuba if its energy needs go unmet.
On Thursday, two Mexican navy vessels carrying more than 800 tonnes of humanitarian aid arrived in Havana, underscoring the nation’s growing need for humanitarian assistance amid the tightening US stranglehold on fuel.
Experts in maritime transport tracking told the AFP news agency that no foreign fuel or oil tankers have arrived in Cuba in weeks.
Cuba can only produce about one-third of its total fuel requirements.
Cuba’s Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos de Cossio accused the US of carrying out “massive punishment” against the Cuban people in a post on social media Friday.
Cuba requires imports of fuel and “the US is applying threats [and] coercive measures against any country that provides it”, the deputy minister said.
“Lack of fuel harms transportation, medical services, schooling, energy, production of food, the standard of living,” he said.
“Massive punishment is a crime,” he added.
Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum has said her government seeks to “open the doors for dialogue to develop” between Cuba and the US and has criticised Washington’s oil restrictions as “unfair”.

Dozens of Australians diagnosed with tattoo-related vision loss

Dozens of Australians diagnosed with rare tattoo-related vision loss
When chef Nelize Pretorius felt her vision blurring — first one eye and then the other — it was initially brushed off as conjunctivitis.
But when the swab came back negative, her GP and hospital doctors struggled to understand what was making her eye inflammation progressively worse.
"I could hardly see," she said.
"I was losing my vision and nobody was able to tell me why."
The cause was nothing to do with the eye itself — instead it was due to a years-old tattoo on Ms Pretorius's back.
The condition, known as tattoo-associated uveitis, can lead to permanent vision loss, glaucoma, and patients requiring immunosuppressants for the rest of their life.
"You get a tattoo, and you think the risk is that you might regret it later in life," Ms Pretorius said.
"[The real risk is] you could potentially lose your vision."
While tattoo-associated uveitis was thought to be extremely rare, research published in the journal Clinical and Experimental Ophthalmology has documented 40 new cases of the condition in Australia — doubling the number of published cases detected around the world since 2010.
The research, undertaken by a team of Australians, suggests this complication, while still rare given the number of people who get tattoos, may be more common than we thought.
Experts are calling for more research to understand and try to limit the vision-threatening disease.
Eyes in the immune 'crossfire'
Josephine Richards, the ophthalmologist who treated Ms Pretorius is no stranger to immune diseases.
Working in the field of eye inflammation, she's seen plenty of cases of uveitis — a dangerous condition where immune mechanisms begin to damage the eye.
It can be a complication of autoimmune arthritis, and a number of other autoimmune diseases where the immune system mistakenly attacks a part of the body.
Early symptoms of uveitis include blurred vision, light sensitivity, pain, and — if it is left untreated — glaucoma, and permanent vision loss.
"We do not know why the eye gets caught in the crossfire," Dr Richards said.
"There is something about the immune reaction that targets the eye."
But in recent years, Dr Richards has seen a rise in cases of uveitis caused by injected tattoo ink — sometimes long after the tattoo was done.
Doctors can tell the uveitis is caused by a tattoo because it can look slightly raised and inflamed.
"I only became aware of it about four or five years ago, and then once I was aware of it, I had all these patients all of a sudden," she said.
And she wasn't the only eye doctor seeing this.
At a conference of ophthalmologists interested in eye inflammation, the specialists realised that many of them were being referred cases of young people with tattoos who had ended up with this same issue.
"So we said, 'OK, we better look at this and see if it's becoming more common.'
"And just since our last conference [in November 2025] we've got four more cases in Western Australia. Probably the other states have got more too."
In the recently published research, most cases of tattoo-associated uveitis needed to go on long-term treatment including immunosuppression, and only three of the patients had no vision loss throughout the treatment.
Ms Pretorius continues to use steroid eye drops, and has spent thousands of dollars on treatment. She remains in touch with Dr Richards to deal with regular flare-ups.
"What really worries us is that we're just not managing to get these people off the drugs," Dr Richards said.
"Usually with an immune disease, we treat for two years and then slowly wind back treatment and hope that the person's going to be OK off the treatment. But mostly we're not managing to wind back the treatment."
Why is this occurring?
While it is unknown exactly what causes some tattoos to produce this reaction, the new research offers some clues.
Of the people with tattoo-associated uveitis studied in the paper, it was mostly black ink tattoos that seemed to have caused the inflammation, but pink and red ink was also recorded in one case each.
In most of the cases it was also long after the tattoo had been completed, on average around a year or two, but in one case up to 35 years after the tattoo was done.
According to Dr Richards, some, but not all people, had their tattoos done overseas, including in Bali.
This makes it particularly difficult for researchers to work out what in the ink might cause this reaction.
"It is just so hard to find out what dye was used," she said.
Dr Richards said it was important to be able to identify why the dyes caused the reaction.
"I hope we will understand why it's happening and be able to identify what it is about the dyes that are triggering it and take those out of the mix," she said.
Despite the increase in cases appearing over the past few years, Nicole Carnt, a vision scientist at the University of Sydney not involved with the research, noted that it was still a rare condition given about 20–30 per cent of Australians have at least one tattoo.
"There's millions of people who have tattoos and don't have any problems," she said.
"So what is triggering this in some people?"
Both Dr Carnt and Dr Richards suggested genetic susceptibility and the microbiome might be involved.
Dr Richards said the condition looked very similar to an immune disease called sarcoidosis, where inflammatory cells clustered around the body in red swollen lumps.
"You can take a biopsy of an inflamed tattoo, and it looks almost the same as what you'd see in the chest with sarcoidosis," she said.
"With all immune diseases, there is some genetic predisposition — some way that your immune system deals with the world — and then you get exposed to something and that sets you off," she added.
Dr Richards noted that those with a familial risk of immune diseases like sarcoidosis might be more likely to have this tattoo-associated infection occur.
How to make tattoos safer
The researchers are well aware they are unlikely to convince people to stop getting inked, especially for a rare disease that may occur years down the track.
"So many people get tattooed, and I feel like it would be very hard to stop people from doing it," Dr Richards said.
Even Ms Pretorius wasn't sure if her younger self would be convinced.
"I don't know if 18-year-old Nelize would have listened but 33-year-old Nelize certainly would," she said.
Instead, Dr Richards hoped to focus on what in the inks might cause this, and trying to ensure it could be removed.
"If you were able to make it safer, that would be the best outcome for everybody."
Dr Carnt agreed, suggesting more research was needed to find out what was causing some people to be vulnerable but not others.
Dr Richard is also working on ensuring that more people, and their doctors, know about this disease, so they can be referred and treated faster.
"It wouldn't change the decision for many people. Some of my tattooed patients that are on immunosuppression still carry on having tattoos because that is so important to them," she said.
"But I would like people to at least know."
Despite having a condition that she jokes "sounds made up", Ms Pretorius feels lucky her situation isn't worse.
"I think that my case in particular, was one of the first cases that Dr Richards had in Perth," she said.
"It's just lucky that she knew about it because if she wasn't there on that day, I may still not know what the issue is.
"There's a few people [with tattoo-associated uveitis] that lost their vision permanently, so relatively speaking I came off pretty good."

U.S. women's curling team slides to victory over Canada in an Olympic first
The U.S. women's curling team was surprised to learn that their defeat of Canada on Friday marked an Olympic first.
"If that's true," Minneapolis native Taylor Anderson-Heide said after the 9-8 nailbiter, "I think we just played a really good game. They're No. 1 in the world."
Tara Peterson of Shoreview, Minnesota, chimed in: "It just always feels really good to beat (Canada skip) Rachel Homan. So any team to beat them, that's pretty impressive."
Until Friday, the American women had never beaten Canada — a perennial favorite that has medaled in every Winter Games since curling was added to the Olympics in 1998. The U.S. men beat the Canadians for the first time in the 2018 round-robin and again in the semifinals en route to their gold medal victory in Pyeongchang.
Canada's Team Homan has for years been considered the best in the world.
In Friday's match, the U.S. managed to capitalize on a few weak shots by Canada. After the win, the Americans walked together down the ice and back to their coaches, raising fists in triumph.
Peterson, like Anderson-Heide, couldn't help but add a qualifier to her response to questions from The Associated Press: "Apparently, we've never beat them in the Olympics before. That makes it just extra special."
This year's American women's curling team — like their Gen-Z men's counterparts — meld approachability with ambition. Alongside Anderson-Heide and Peterson, the team includes skip Tabitha Peterson, who's Tara's older sister, as well as cool-as-a-cucumber Cory Thiesse, who has already won a silver medal in the mixed doubles event. Aileen Geving, from Minnesota, is an alternate.
Three of them have jobs other than curling, and three are mothers to young children. Tara is a dentist, Tabitha a pharmacist and Thiesse a lab technician.
Tara gave birth to her son, Eddie, in September 2024 and a few months later, Tabitha had a daughter, Noelle. Geving had daughter Sienna following the 2018 Games.
"That's the cool thing about the sport of curling. Your average Joe is playing against Olympians and we're friends," Tara Peterson told CBS News Minnesota ahead of the Olympics. "And after the game we'll sit down, we have dinner. We have a beer. It's just a normal life."
Tabitha Peterson told CBS News Minnesota she thinks of the Olympics "as just another tournament."
"It's another competition. And try not to focus like, oh my God, we're at the Olympics," she said.
They have several matches left in the round-robin before the semifinals next Friday. The are 2-1 after Friday's match, with a win against Korea and loss to Sweden alongside the milestone.

Son of last shah urges international intervention in Iran
The exiled son of Iran's last shah renewed calls for international intervention to support the Iranian people on Friday, as the opposition figure urged Iranians at home and abroad to continue demonstrations against the Islamic Republic.
US-based Reza Pahlavi, who has not returned to his country since before the 1979 Iranian revolution that ousted the monarchy, said Iran needed an "equalising factor" to oust the clerical authorities, while speaking at the Munich Security Conference.
"I think a lot of Iranians inside and outside hope that an intervention that will neutralise the regime's instrument of repression will finally give us an opportunity for a final solution," he said.
"We are asking for a humanitarian intervention to prevent more innocent lives being killed in the process."
US President Donald Trump had threatened military intervention to support a wave of street protests that peaked in January and were met by a violent crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands.
Trump positioned a US aircraft carrier group in the Middle East and said on Friday he would soon send another, but has shifted his pressure on Iranian authorities to focus on making a deal on its nuclear programme.
Pahlavi said Trump "needs to convince the whole world" that he has given a "diplomatic effort the maximum chance", but that he thinks "President Trump realises that the Iranian people have been very clear in their ask for support, they actually believed in his promise of help is near".
"There's a lot at stake in terms of maintaining face vis-a-vis that expectation," he added during the conversation with CNN journalist Christiane Amanpour at the conference, a rare chance for him to speak at an international event.
He called for "intervention" that will "eliminate the most important stumbling block between them (the Iranian people) and liberation, which is the regime's mechanism of repression and its killing machine", as well as further economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure.
Fresh protests
These echoed demands listed in a call for protests on Saturday in Munich, Toronto and Los Angeles to "compel the international community to take urgent, practical steps in support of the Iranian people".
On Thursday, Pahlavi also urged Iranians inside the country to join in by chanting slogans from their homes and rooftops at 8PM on Saturday and Sunday.
Videos verified by AFP showed people in Iran this week chanting anti-government slogans despite the ongoing crackdown, as the clerical leadership celebrated the anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
According to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, 7,005 people, mostly protesters, were killed in the crackdown, though rights groups warn the toll is likely far higher.
Pahlavi had encouraged Iranians to join the wave of protests, which Iranian authorities have said were hijacked by "terrorists" fuelled by their sworn enemies the United States and Israel.
Many protest chants had called for the monarchy's return, and Pahlavi, 65, has said he is ready to lead a democratic transition in the country.
The Iranian opposition remains divided, and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel, making a highly publicised visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps. He has also never distanced himself from his father's autocratic rule.

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. BRICS is not a military union and there are no plans to transform it into one, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov has told TASS.
"I would like to remind you that BRICS is not a military union and not a collective security organization with collective defense commitments. It has never been planned as such, and there are no plans to transform it for the purpose," he said.
"As far as the recent naval exercise in South Africa is concerned, BRICS members participated in it as sovereign nations. It was not a BRICS event," he added.
When asked whether BRICS can somehow safeguard commercial ships of its members from attacks, he said the group had no collective mechanisms for the purpose, "other than improving logistics and ensuring greater protection from sanctions."
"This is not the task that we have set for ourselves. This security needs to be ensured by other means," he added.

Trump news at a glance: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blasts president’s ‘age of authoritarianism’ at European conference
Democratic representative also condemns US capture of Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and US support for Israel’s war on Gaza – key US politics stories from Friday, 13 February at a glance
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has accused Donald Trump of tearing apart the transatlantic alliance with Europe and of seeking to introduce an “age of authoritarianism”, as she condemned his administration’s foreign policy in front of its allies’ top policymakers at the Munich security conference.
Speaking at a panel on populism on Friday, the New York representative outlined what she called an “alternative vision” for a leftwing US foreign policy, challenging the Trump administration’s shift to the right in front an audience of US allies who have grown increasingly wary of the US’s increasingly nationalist – and militaristic – global posture.
She also condemned the US capture of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro, Trump’s threats to annex Greenland and the US’s support for Israel’s war on Gaza.
“I think that, personally, the idea of completely unconditional aid, no matter what one does, does not make sense,” Ocasio-Cortez said during another panel discussion. “I think it enabled a genocide in Gaza, and I think that we have thousands of women and children dead … that was completely avoidable.”
Ocasio-Cortez also said that she and her fellow Democrats were calling for a return to a “rules-based order” without the “hypocrisies” of US foreign policy that have dominated the past and current administrations.

Can Pop Mart turn viral hits into lasting icons? Molly and Labubu offer the answer
As Labubu’s meteoric rise cools, Molly’s longevity highlights the challenge Pop Mart faces in turning hype into stable intellectual property
Around a decade ago, aboard a train winding through China’s landscape, Wang Ning, the founder and chairman of Beijing-founded international art toy brand Pop Mart, shared with designer Kenny Wong Shun-ming the story of his early attempts at entrepreneurship.
As a fresh graduate, Wang struggled to sell affordable men’s suits sourced from Yiwu in Zhejiang province, eastern China, experimenting with small-scale arbitrage and learning first-hand how difficult it was to connect products with consumers.
The experience, Wong recalled, shaped Wang’s later understanding that branding and emotional connection could matter as much as the product itself. He later described spotting a Michael Jackson poster bearing the words “This is it” while job-hunting – a moment that crystallised that insight.
“Wang soon registered China’s first trademark (of ‘This is it’) and launched a Michael Jackson exhibition; a success that taught him the transformative power of branding,” Wong, the designer of the much-beloved big-eyed and pouty-mouthed character Molly, said in an interview with the South China Morning Post.
The company philosophy that emerged from this early experience – building products around story, identity and emotional connection – is now being tested.
As secondary-market prices for Pop Mart’s breakout figure Labubu fall sharply and the company’s shares swing more than 40 per cent from last year’s peak, the enduring appeal of its Molly doll offers a counterpoint.

‘Uber drivers’: Why specialist nurses are spending hours ferrying patients across the state

‘Uber drivers’: Why specialist nurses are spending hours ferrying patients across the state
Frustrated health workers say their peers have become part-time “Uber drivers” ferrying patients to and from Melbourne because pockets of Victoria do not have dedicated adult detox facilities, sparking calls for an overhaul in the regions.
Ballarat Community Health staff say they clocked up more than 8000 kilometres and at least 110 hours driving clients back and forth between the regional city and detox facilities in Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo late last year.
The trips – the equivalent of almost three weeks’ worth of patient outreach and care – were recorded in the three months leading up to Christmas.
The driving was mostly done by specialist nurses trained to provide in-home or community-based care for Victorians withdrawing from alcohol and other drugs.
Ballarat Community Health clinic lead for alcohol and other drugs Mel Lishman said staff spent a lot of time driving clients to services in Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo because the region did not have a dedicated detox facility for adults.
“Some facilities have specific admission times. And so, for example, one of our nurses this morning left at seven o’clock. She doesn’t usually start until nine, but she had to start or leave here at seven o’clock to pick up a client from Daylesford to get them to Melbourne for a 10 o’clock admission.”
Detox and rehabilitation are two separate, but sequential, phases of recovery from drug or alcohol use.
Detox refers to the short-term medical process of clearing substances from the body and safely managing withdrawal symptoms. It typically lasts three to 10 days.
Rehab follows detox and is focused on longer-term therapy that addresses the root causes of addiction and helps prevent relapse.
Ballarat does have a rehab clinic, but its detox service, Tabor House, is for young people aged 12 to 25.
Ballarat Community Health manager Suzanne Powell, who has worked in this space for 18 years, said detox had been an issue since she started.
“We have raised this issue a lot but we don’t seem to get anywhere,” she said.
“From a funding perspective, it would be more sustainable to have appropriate resources to undertake this [transport] work to reduce the amount of time our NRW [non-residential withdrawal] nurses are spending in the car.”
In community health, residential withdrawal refers to staying at a facility with 24/7 medical supervision. Non-residential withdrawal is done at home or via an outpatient service for more mild dependency.
Ballarat peer support worker Dean Seabrook said alcohol continued to be the most commonly used drug in the region, but cannabis was common, too.
There had also been an increase in the usage of GHB, also known as liquid ecstasy.
“It’s reported by clients that methamphetamine purity is very low at the moment. It’s getting cut with things, so clients aren’t getting that buzz. So they’re using other things as well.”
Chris Christoforou, the chief executive of the Victorian Alcohol and Drug Association, said there had been a general increase in demand for detox services across the state.
“It’s an important part of preparing people for rehabilitation. Often it’s a first step when there’s quite problematic alcohol or other drug use that poses a significant health risk to the individual. So being able to manage that properly as part of a supported withdrawal process is critical,” he said.
“The issue of access to detox beds or withdrawal beds is a major issue, and certainly a major issue for regional communities.”
Christoforou said being able to access support networks was an essential part of treatment success.
“People need services in their communities. Ballarat isn’t exactly a small town. It’s one of the biggest population centres in Victoria.”
Mel Thomson, the chief operating officer at Windana – which runs longer-term rehabilitation services in Ballarat, Geelong and Maryknoll – said all services transported patients, but the burden was higher in the regions.
“It’s an incredible waste of resources. They’re not Uber drivers,” she said of nursing staff. “But they do it because there isn’t an alternative that’s safe or funded.”
Thomson said she would welcome an adult detox centre in Ballarat but in an ideal world, there would be medical detox beds in every major community.
“Why does every major hospital and community health service not have medical detox beds available? This is a health issue.”
Windana also offers home-based withdrawal services for suitable clients around the south-eastern suburbs, Frankston and the Mornington Peninsula. Patients are connected to a nurse and local GP who prescribe the necessary medications.
Thomson said this was an area the government could also invest in. However, she pointed out that home-based withdrawal was unsuitable in some cases, such as Victorians consuming larger quantities of drugs or alcohol, or those at risk of homelessness.
Victorians will head to the polls for a state election in November. Aside from violence against women, the Coalition is expected to campaign hard on better access to healthcare in the regions, according to two sources speaking on the condition of anonymity to anticipate plans not yet finalised.
A spokesperson for the Allan government said that while Ballarat locals had access to specialist alcohol and drug services, more could be done.
“That’s why we’re delivering our $95 million statewide action plan to save lives, reduce drug harms and get Victorians the care they need.”

Cars, cows and more as Australia gets closer to mega trade win

Cars, cows and more as Australia gets closer to mega trade win
London: Australia is closer than ever to a trade deal with Europe that will cut prices for consumers and boost sales for exporters, after talks in Brussels cleared the way to a pact within weeks.
The likely gains for Australian households include lower prices for European exports such as cars and trucks, wiping away tariffs that add 5 per cent to every vehicle.
Australian farmers are also certain to benefit from bigger export opportunities in Europe, although both sides are still wrangling over the scale of the increase in beef and lamb sales.
The net result will expand a two-way trade relationship already worth about $110 billion to Australia each year, making this the most important agreement with the European Union in more than a decade. It has always been about much more than cars and cows.
There was a serious risk of failure when Trade Minister Don Farrell arrived in Brussels for two days of talks on Thursday and Friday with his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič. There was always a chance that the Europeans would not offer enough access for beef and lamb, in which case Farrell would walk away.
So the mere fact that the talks continued into a second day, and ended with a positive statement on Friday afternoon (Brussels time), means that a deal is finally within sight.
There is now a stronger chance that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit Australia to seal an agreement with Prime Minster Anthony Albanese. This potential trip has been aired for at least four weeks, but now there is a solid reason for it to go ahead.
Sure, this will only receive modest attention when the Liberal Party is making headlines with its leadership spill and the rise of Angus Taylor as opposition leader. There is far less drama in the mundane work of government.
But there are three significant and strategic reasons to welcome the news from Brussels.
The first is that Australia and Europe are getting closer at a time when both have to contend with the sudden upheavals from Donald Trump on trade and security. The US president is turning America into an unreliable ally. The rational response for Australia is to tighten links with other allies.
The second is that Australian leaders have been saying for years that we need to rely less on China for our exports. Of course, sales to Europe cannot match the sheer volume of trade with China in coal, gas and iron ore. But it is wise to diversify.
The third is that the trade deal will be accompanied by a defence partnership.
This will not be an alliance like NATO or ANZUS, but an agreement to work together on exercises and procurement.
It might help Australian companies sell equipment to Europe, and it could help both sides work together on “hybrid warfare” threats such as drone strikes and cyberattacks. Put more bluntly, it will be about dealing with Russia and China.
There are likely to be practical and fairly swift benefits as well.
One is that cars from Europe become cheaper for households. Right now, a European car is 5 per cent more expensive because of the Australian tariff regime.
This puts companies such as Volkswagen, Skoda, Fiat and others – not just the luxury brands – at a disadvantage to rivals from China, Japan, Thailand and the US. (All these countries already have trade deals with Australia.) This is good for competition.
Another is that other capital goods also fall in price. While most products get into Australia without a barrier, there is still a 5 per cent tariff on many products from Europe. A cafe might pay more for a coffee machine, for instance. A transport company might pay more for a European truck.
There will also be a benefit for farmers who want to export more beef and lamb but have been blocked by EU quotas. In January, the Europeans appeared to be willing to allow 24,000 tonnes of beef and 20,000 tonnes of lamb from Australia each year. This was so low that there did not seem much point in doing a deal. Farrell has pushed for more.
Right now, Australia is barred from shipping more than 3389 tonnes of beef to the EU each year, according to Meat and Livestock Australia. It wants an increase to 50,000 tonnes, arguing this is in line with EU agreements with Canada and Brazil. Farm groups in Europe are lobbying to keep the number low.
Farrell sounded positive on Friday, which suggests he has made some headway. The “stretch” goal for the Australian side would be anything above 40,000 tonnes.
There are other gains to sweeten a final deal. Europe wants access to Australian critical minerals, and there is no reason to turn it away.
There is likely to be a limited agreement to make it easier for skilled workers to move between Australian and European employers, but this will not be open slather. (Anything more ambitious on visa rules would need approval from national parliaments in Europe.)
Jason Collins, who heads the European Australian Business Council, says finalising a deal would be a “smart move” to increase access to 450 million consumers across the EU.
The decision to start these trade talks dates back to 2015. Progress was so slow that Farrell walked away two years ago because the Europeans were not offering enough access on beef and lamb. He was right to insist on a better deal.
On Friday in Brussels, the trade minister issued a brief statement: “I am confident that both Australia and the European Union will reach agreement that benefits both of our economies.”
He did not say that they “could” reach a deal – he said they “will”. After more than a decade, an agreement is within sight.
This will not get as much attention as a Liberal leadership spill, but it represents a quiet economic win for Labor. The gains for households are real. And, in the age of Trump, the strategic benefits are not to be ignored.

‘An incredibly rare proposition’: Sydney Harbour island up for sale

‘An incredibly rare proposition’: Sydney Harbour island up for sale
An Aboriginal land council is leading a push for a small but historically significant island in Sydney Harbour to be returned to traditional custodians after the site was listed for sale as part of a sweeping $3 billion sell-off of surplus defence land.
Spectacle Island is at the centre of a growing debate about whether prominent public assets with deep historical value should be sold to private interests after the two-hectare former naval outpost was included in a list of 67 defence properties set to be divested by the federal government to fund modern defence priorities.
Vacant since 2023, Spectacle Island has played a quiet but consequential role in Australia’s defence history – first as a gunpowder store established in 1865, later as a naval munitions depot, and more recently as a storage base for the Royal Australian Navy’s heritage collection.
The island contains about 40 heritage buildings, including 19th-century powder magazines and laboratories.
Its listing has ignited discussion about whether surplus defence sites should be sold off or repurposed for public uses such as open space, cultural facilities or social and affordable housing.
While the NSW Government has confirmed it is considering housing options for another defence site, Victoria Barracks in Paddington, Planning Minister Paul Scully was less specific about Spectacle Island, saying NSW would “engage constructively” with the federal government as opportunities arose.
The Metropolitan Aboriginal Land Council is preparing a formal request to the federal government for Aboriginal ownership. Metro LALC chief executive Nathan Moran said the proposed sale was an opportunity to address historic land dispossession.
“More than 99 per cent of our backyard has been taken from us and rather than being sold off to private interests for the highest price, this is a rare opportunity for the federal government to help correct past injustices while creating new economic and cultural pathways for our people,” he said.
Moran said Spectacle Island, together with nearby Goat Island – which remains subject to final transfer negotiations with the NSW government – could support Indigenous-led tourism, education programs and cultural events.
“Over 70 per cent of visitors to Sydney seek an Aboriginal cultural tourism experience, and right now there’s nowhere to deliver it at scale within the harbour,” he said.
The listing has also sparked speculation that the island could be sold to private buyers and repurposed for uses such as boutique accommodation, hospitality or events.
That would align with recent changes to the management of other islands within Sydney Harbour, including the NSW government awarding a tender for a hospitality venue to operate on Fort Denison and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust expanding public access and commercial activity on Cockatoo Island.
Property Council of Australia policy executive Matthew Kandelaars said hospitality and premium tourism were the most plausible commercial options for Spectacle Island, given constraints including water-only access and strict heritage controls.
Resort Brokers director Tim Crooks said the island could attract interest from high-net-worth individuals, investors or hospitality groups, with its value potentially reaching tens of millions of dollars depending on permitted uses.
“The sale of an island in Sydney Harbour is an incredibly rare proposition and it will generate a lot of interest, particularly among buyers looking at adaptive reuse options, such as luxury accommodation, events or destination hospitality,” Crooks said.
Defence audit documents describe many of the island’s structures as “significantly degraded” due to water ingress, lead paint and decades of limited maintenance.
The buildings are listed on the Commonwealth Heritage Register under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, meaning any buyer would face strict conservation and environmental remediation requirements.
UNSW City Futures Research Centre professor Chris Pettit said that while housing had been discussed as an option for other defence sites, Spectacle Island was unlikely to play a meaningful role in easing the housing crisis due to its small size and limited transport access.
He said the island had significant international tourism appeal and suggested it would be better managed by a public authority or Aboriginal organisation rather than a private owner.
“The only other option is a multimillionaire buying it as a trophy asset for prestige, but that would not be an equitable use of what has long been a publicly owned site,” he said.
Heritage advocates have warned that private ownership could jeopardise the preservation of the island’s historic buildings and military artefacts, including gun turrets and ship bells.
David Michael, president of the Naval Historical Society, said preserving the island’s buildings would require significant investment. “It is Australia’s oldest naval explosives manufacturing and storage site,” he said.
Drummoyne state Liberal MP Stephanie Di Pasqua said the proposed sale had “come as a shock” to many in the community and called for the site to remain in public hands.

Peru to debate removal of President Jose Jeri four months into his term
The debate comes as Jeri, who is not running for re-election, faces allegations of bribery and influence-peddling.
The head of Peru’s Congress, Fernando Rospigliosi, has announced a special plenary session to weigh the removal of the country’s right-wing president, Jose Jeri.
The session will take place on the morning of February 17, according to a statement Peru’s Congress posted on social media.

The debate comes as Jeri’s short tenure grows mired in scandal, just four months after he took office as interim president.
In October, Jeri — the leader of Congress at the time — took over as president following the unanimous impeachment of his predecessor, Dina Boluarte, on the grounds of “permanent moral incapacity”.
Boluarte herself assumed the presidency after her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, was impeached for attempting a self-coup.
Next week’s debate about Jeri’s future is the latest chapter in the ongoing instability facing Peru’s government. The country has seen eight presidents within the last decade, with several of them impeached or resigning before their term expired.
In recent months, Jeri has become increasingly embroiled in scandal, including one colloquially known as “chifagate”, named for the Peruvian-Chinese fusion cuisine known as “chifa”.
The scandal started when local media outlets obtained video of Jeri arriving late at night at a restaurant to meet with a Chinese businessman, Zhihua Yang, who previously received government approval to build a hydroelectric plant.
Their meeting was not listed in the official presidential agenda, as is required under Peruvian law. Critics have questioned whether Jeri’s outfit — which had a deep hood that rendered him nearly unrecognisable — was meant to be a disguise.
Additional footage placed Jeri at another one of Yang’s businesses days later. Jeri also allegedly met a second Chinese businessman, Jiwu Xiaodong, who was reportedly under house arrest for illegal activities.
Jeri has dismissed some of the off-the-books meetings as planning for an upcoming Chinese-Peruvian friendship event. Others, he said, were simply shopping trips for sweets and other food. He has denied wrongdoing but has acknowledged taking the meetings was a “mistake”.
“I have not lied to the country. I have not done anything illegal,” Jeri told the news outlet Canal N.
But critics have accused Jeri of using his position for influence-peddling at the unregistered interactions.
Similar accusations erupted earlier this month when Peruvian media highlighted the irregular hiring of several women in Jeri’s administration and contracts he awarded as possible evidence of bribery.
The debate over Jeri’s removal comes as Peru hurtles towards a general election on April 12, with the presidency up for grabs. Jeri will not be running to retain his seat.

Thailand has begun using a birth control vaccine on elephants in the wild to try and curb a growing problem where human and animal populations encroach on each other – an issue in areas where farms spread into forests and elephants are squeezed out of their natural habitat.
The initiative is part of efforts to address confrontations that can turn deadly. As farmers cut down forests to make more farmland, elephants are forced to venture out of their shrinking habitats in search of food.
Last year, wild elephants killed 30 people and injured 29 in Thailand, according to official figures, which also noted more than 2,000 incidents of elephants damaging crops.

Sukhee Boonsang, director of the Wildlife Conservation Office, said that controlling the wild elephant population had become necessary as numbers of elephants living near residential areas rise sharply, increasing the risk of confrontations.
The office obtained 25 doses of a US-made vaccine and conducted a two-year trial on seven domesticated elephants – using up seven doses of the vaccine – which yielded promising results, he said.

US military strikes another alleged drug boat in Caribbean, killing 3
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. military said Friday that it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.
U.S. Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” It said the strike killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.
Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 133 people in at least 38 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared last week that “some top cartel drug-traffickers” in the region “have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean.” However, Hegseth did not provide any details or information to back up this claim, made in a post on his personal account on social media.
President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists.”

Pakistan vs India: Hottest ticket in cricket sparks T20 World Cup fever

Excitement is hitting fever pitch in Colombo and across South Asia after Pakistan decided to play against India in the T20 World Cup, reigniting the most lucrative match in cricket.
The hottest tickets in world cricket were hard to come by, despite Sunday evening's game in the Sri Lankan capital only being confirmed late on Monday.
The 35,000-capacity R.Premadasa Stadium was sold out, sources told AFP news agency, with tickets going for at least four times face value on the black market.
Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared, with the cost of a room climbing as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.
Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623 - $756 while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 percent to roughly $666.
Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) said hotels were booked out. "Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices," Jayasundera said.
Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told Reuters news agency that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20 percent of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.
Hundreds of millions more will watch the match, which has given the tournament a shot in the arm, on television in India, Pakistan and beyond.
Kashmir tensions
Emotions are expected to be high as every ball and shot is cheered or jeered in this high-stakes showdown between the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours, whose rivalry remains rooted in the 1947 partition of British India, subsequent wars, including those in 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999, and ongoing disputes over Kashmir.
Both teams have two wins out of two in Group A, meaning the winner should be assured of a place in the Super Eights round.
The two bitter rivals only meet in global or regional tournaments these days and only on neutral territory.
It has been more than 18 years since India and Pakistan last met in a Test match, and 13 years since either side crossed the border to play a bilateral series.
They met three times in the T20 Asian Cup in Dubai last September, with India triumphant each time, including the final.
The TV audience for Sunday's clash has been tipped to break all records.
Wild estimates of a billion-plus watching are often bandied about for India v Pakistan games.
However, according to verifiable figures from the International Cricket Council (ICC), the most-watched match was the 2011 50-over World Cup final between India and Sri Lanka in Mumbai, which had 558 million unique viewers.
India's win over Pakistan in the semi-final of that tournament is second, with 495 million.
The match will likely generate multi-millions of dollars in advertising, broadcast rights, sponsorship and tourism.
However, the biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket was only revived after a frantic weekend of negotiations.
The governments of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka both wrote to their counterpart in Islamabad on Monday urging it to change its stance and allow the game to go ahead. They got their wish just before midnight.
After "multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the Government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan National Cricket Team to take the field on February 15", the Pakistan government said.
The decision had been taken with the aim of "protecting the spirit of cricket", it said.
'No handshake' policy
The 20-team tournament had been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up.
Bangladesh, who refused to play in India after citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
As a protest, the Pakistan government ordered the team on the eve of the tournament not to face India, which is co-hosting the tournament with Sri Lanka, before relenting eight days later.
The enduring India-Pakistan rivalry manifests in off-field tensions, notably India's 'no handshake' policy from 2025.
On September 14 2025, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav declined the customary pre-toss handshake with Pakistan's Salman Ali Agha, and following India's seven-wicket victory, the entire Indian team walked off without engaging in post-match handshakes, leaving Pakistani players waiting on the field.
Yadav later explained the decision as a deliberate stance aligned with the Indian government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which holds considerable influence over the ICC.
Pakistan expressed disappointment, with coach Mike Hesson calling the snub "disappointing" and not in the spirit of the game, while captain Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest during one game.
The incident recurred in later Asia Cup matches, such as on September 21 2025, further straining relations.
India's last cricket tour of Pakistan was in 2008, for the Asia Cup. Since then, the Indian team has not visited Pakistan for any cricket fixtures, including bilateral series or multilateral tournaments.
As a result, India-Pakistan cricket encounters have been limited to neutral venues in major ICC or Asian cricket events.
Meanwhile, Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.
"I think it’s going to be a great experience," said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend, who is flying in from New Zealand. "I’m really excited about this match."
Sultan added he thought Pakistan "absolutely" could come out on top on Sunday.

What to know about the counter drone technology that triggered the closure of the El Paso airspace
The government’s ability to deal with drones that pose a threat on American soil has been questioned this week after airspace was closed over El Paso, Texas
- Bookmark
The government’s ability to deal with drones that pose a threat on American soil has been questioned this week after the use of a laser designed to shoot down drones near the border in Texas led to the abrupt closure of the airspace over El Paso, sources familiar with the situation told The Associated Press.
The details of exactly what happened before the Federal Aviation Administration shut down the busy airport in the Mexican border city on Wednesday aren’t entirely clear, but a source familiar with the situation told AP that the laser was deployed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection without coordinating with the FAA.
Two months ago, Congress agreed to give more law enforcement agencies the authority to take down rogue drones as long as they are properly trained. That could make situations like the one in El Paso more likely. Previously, only a select few federal agencies had that power.
Here's a look at what happened and the issues that raised:
Communication issues acknowledged
The government would say only that the airspace was shut down when an incursion by Mexican drug cartel drones was neutralized.
But the two people who discussed sensitive details on condition of anonymity said the FAA grounded every aircraft in the El Paso area over concerns about the safety of the laser system being used near commercial planes. The restrictions were initially expected to last 10 days, but then they were lifted a few hours later.
Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Friday that the government agencies involved in El Paso are working to address the concerns that led to the cancellation of more than a dozen flights and sent travelers scrambling.
“This was a joint agency task force mission that was undertaken and we’re continuing to work on the communication through that,” Noem said in Arizona.
But drone warfare expert Brett Velicovich said the dysfunction in Texas raises questions about whether the U.S. will be prepared to deal with a significant drone threat.
“We need to simplify the authorities for who is really in charge and get these egos out of the way from these different agencies before an American gets hurt,” said Velicovich, who founded drone maker Power.us and consults on ways to mitigate their threats.
Drones can be a threat
Armed drones carry out devastating attacks daily in Ukraine. The unmanned vehicles have also allowed Ukraine to strike deep within Russia.
Velicovich, who used to use Predator drones in the military to bomb targets, said it wouldn’t be hard for someone with malicious intent to buy a drone for a few hundred bucks and do great harm at a major public event like a World Cup match or the celebrations of America’s 250th birthday that are planned this summer.
Cartels routinely use drones to deliver drugs across the Mexican border and surveil Border Patrol officers. Officials told Congress last summer that more than 27,000 drones were detected within 1,600 feet (500 meters) of the southern border in the last six months of 2024.
The government recently handed out $250 million in grants to the 11 states that are set to host World Cup matches this summer to help them prepare for the threat of drones. Another $250 million in grants will be awarded later this year to strengthen the nation's drone defenses.
More near misses involving drones
The threat to planes from drones continues to increase along with the number of near misses around airports. Homeland Security estimates there are more than 1.7 million registered drones flying in the United States, and that number has been growing.
Larger drones are required to carry a radio transponder that identifies the drone’s owner and broadcasts its position to help avert collisions. Cities can also invest in additional sensors around stadiums to help quickly detect drones.
Airspace Link, a Detroit company, created a low altitude air traffic control system to track drones and can alert authorities who might soon be able to take action. Cities can buy additional sensors to upgrade that system around stadiums or other high-profile locations.
“We don’t want something to happen," said CEO Michael Healander. “But we also want to be prepared to have the tools in place to take action, because these are such big global events.”
Acting against rogue drones
Common anti-drone systems use radio signals to jam or force drones to land. But the government has also developed high-powered microwaves or laser beams like the one sources say was used in Texas this week that are capable of disabling the machines.
Some other systems station small drones to take flight quickly and ram into drones that are considered a threat. And there are systems that use bullets to shoot down drones.
Michael Robbins, president and CEO of the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International trade group, said these counter drone systems are more common in warzones than across the United States. But the government is working to get them into the hands of more officers nationwide.
“It’s our belief that this is important technology that when responsibly used with proper oversight and intensive training will help to mitigate unsafe or malicious drones in the very rare instances where that needs to occur,” Robbins said.
Pilots worry about drones
Allied Pilots Association union spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said he's not sure how big of a threat the counter drone technology is to the American Airlines jets he flies because so few details have been released about what happened in Texas. And officials with Homeland Security and the FAA didn't respond to questions about it again on Friday.
Tajer said he's more concerned about the possibility of a passenger jet running into a drone because that could bring the plane down. A year ago, 67 people were killed when an American Airlines jet collided with an Army helicopter near Washington, D.C.
“You don’t have to be a pilot, an engineer or a defense expert to understand that two pieces of metal in the sky that one doesn’t know the other is there and is uncontrolled is dangerous,” Tajer said. “We’ve got to keep those two pieces of metal away from each other.”

Kyiv receives 16 generators, charging stations from Slovakia
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko announced this on Telegram, Ukrinform reports.
"Kyiv has received the first batch of humanitarian assistance from Slovakia: 16 generators of various capacities and two sets of charging stations rated at 8 kW each, with a total value of EUR 166,000. The three most powerful generators (225 kW, 100 kW, and 63 kW) will be delivered to schools in different districts of the capital," Klitschko said.
The mayor noted that in the second half of January, on the initiative of the Embassy of Ukraine in Slovakia, together with the country's largest fundraising platform Donio and ten leading civil society organizations in Slovakia, a large-scale fundraising campaign titled "Warmth for Ukraine" was launched.
"Nearly EUR 1.1 million has already been raised from more than 19,500 donors. These funds are being used to support Ukrainian communities. In particular, our Slovak partners are purchasing and delivering generators and charging stations," Klitschko wrote.
He thanked Slovakia for this critically important assistance.
Earlier reports said that Kyiv had received all 500 generators from the European Union's strategic rescEU reserve, with the last 234 power sources delivered on February 12.

US withdraws newly updated list of firms allegedly aiding China’s military
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The United States withdrew an updated list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing’s military shortly after it was posted on Feb 13 with the addition of some of China’s biggest tech companies, including Alibaba and Baidu.
The document, which was posted for about an hour, also had removed China’s top memory chipmakers CXMT and YMTC from the list, drawing fire from China hawks in Washington who fear the growing chipmaking expertise of these companies could help supercharge China’s military.
“We would like to remove this notice from public inspection and withdraw the notice from publication in the Federal Register,” a Pentagon letter to the Federal Register, the official journal of the US government, said without specifying a reason.
The Pentagon and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“Hopefully, (the Pentagon) pulled the document because removing CXMT and YMTC was an error,” said Mr Chris McGuire, a former White House National Security Council official under President Joe Biden, who said that would only make sense, given the addition to the list of many other companies critical to the Chinese AI stack, like Alibaba and Baidu.
Other additions on the withdrawn on Feb 13 document included automaker BYD, biotech firm WuXi AppTec and AI-driven robotics technology company RoboSense Technology Co Ltd. The publication and hasty withdrawal of the list comes as US President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to avoid antagonising China following a trade truce reached by Chinese President Xi Jinping and Mr Trump in October 2025.
Since then, the administration has taken a softer line on China. It gave Nvidia a green light to export its second-most advanced AI chips to China and postponed a rule that would have barred thousands of Chinese firms from buying US technology.
On Feb 12, Reuters reported the administration had shelved a number of national security measures aimed at Beijing, including a ban on China Telecom’s US operations and restrictions on sales of Chinese equipment for US data centres. Mr Trump is expected to travel to China in April, though dates for the visit have yet to be set.
Though the Pentagon list does not formally impose sanctions on Chinese firms, under a new law, the department will be prevented in coming years from contracting and procuring from companies on the list.
Being added to the list also sends a message to Pentagon suppliers and other US government agencies about the US military’s opinion of the firms, some of which have sued the United States over their inclusion.
An Alibaba spokesperson said there was no basis for its inclusion and threatened legal action.
“Alibaba is not a Chinese military company nor part of any military-civil fusion strategy,” the spokesperson said.
The list already includes major Chinese firms such as Tencent Holdings, one of China’s largest tech companies, and CATL, a major battery maker in the electric vehicle industry.
“This appears to be a process issue tied to interagency sign-off on some of the companies being removed,” said Mr Eric Sayers, a non-resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who specialises in Asia-Pacific defence policy and US-China technology policy.
“My view is that the new additions are unlikely to change, but a few removals still appear under review and could remain on the updated list,” Mr Sayers said. REUTERS

MOSCOW, February 14. /TASS/. A court in Moscow has arrested the Kalashnikov Concern’s former director of procurement and logistics, Ksenia Grashchenkova, as part of a criminal case into abuse of power, committed while implementing state defense contracts.
A law enforcement source told TASS Grashchenkova was detained "in the course of a preliminary investigation into a multimillion fraud" and charged with abuse of office.
She was charged under Article 201 of the Russian Criminal Code, 'Abuse of Authority,' committed in a group, while fulfilling the state defense order, which has involved grave consequences.
According to the source, Grashchenkova has been placed under arrest and is now in custody in a pretrial detention facility in Moscow.

Mistrial in case of anti-Israel Stanford students who occupied school president’s office
Jury deadlocks on felony charges against the students, one of whom vows that ‘we will continue to fight… for Palestine’; prosecutors to seek new trial
SAN FRANCISCO — A judge declared a mistrial Friday in the case of five current and former Stanford University students charged after anti-Israel pro-Palestinian protests in 2024, when they barricaded themselves inside the university president and provost executive offices.
The trial in Santa Clara County was a rare instance of demonstrators facing felony charges from protests over the Israel-Hamas war that roiled campuses across the country. The two sides argued over free speech, lawful dissent and crime during the three-week proceedings.
The jury voted 9 to 3 to convict on a felony charge of vandalism and 8 to 4 to convict on a felony charge of conspiracy to trespass. After deliberating for five days, jurors said they could not reach a verdict.
Judge Hanley Chew asked each one if more time deliberating would help break the impasse, and all answered, “No.”
“It appears that this jury is hopelessly deadlocked, and I’m now declaring a mistrial in counts one and two,” Chen said. He then dismissed the jurors.
Demonstrators barricaded themselves inside the offices for several hours on June 5, 2024, the last day of spring classes at the university.
Prosecutors said the defendants spray-painted the building, broke windows and furniture, disabled security cameras and splattered a red liquid described as fake blood on items throughout the offices.
Defense attorneys said the protest was protected speech and there was insufficient evidence of an intent to damage the property. They also said the students wore protective gear and barricaded the offices out of fear of being injured by police and campus security.
If convicted, the defendants would have faced up to three years in prison and been obligated to pay restitution of over $300,000.
Santa Clara County District Attorney Jeff Rosen said he would pursue a new trial.
“This case is about a group of people who destroyed someone else’s property and caused hundreds of thousands of dollars in damage,” Rosen said in a statement. “That is against the law and that is why we will retry the case.”
As the mistrial was announced, the students, some wearing kaffiyehs, sat on a bench in the courtroom and did not show a visible reaction.
“The District Attorney’s Office had Stanford University supporting them and other multibillion-dollar institutions behind them, and even then the district attorney was unable to convict us,” Germán González, who was a sophomore at Stanford when he was arrested, told The Associated Press by phone later. “No matter what happens, we will continue to fight tooth and nail for as long as possible, because at the end of the day, this is for Palestine.”
Authorities initially arrested and charged 12 people in the case, but one pleaded no contest under an agreement that allows some young people to have their cases dismissed and records sealed if they successfully complete probation.
He testified for the prosecution, leading to a grand jury indictment of the others in October of the others. Six of those accepted pretrial plea deals or diversion programs, and the remaining five pleaded not guilty and sought a jury trial.
Protests sprung up on campuses across the country following the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, onslaught that started the conflict in Gaza, with students setting up camps and demanding their universities stop doing business with Israel or companies that support its war efforts against Hamas.
About 3,200 people were arrested in 2024 nationwide. While some colleges ended demonstrations by striking deals with students or simply waited them out, others called in police. Most criminal charges were ultimately dismissed.

From ICE to dodgy hosts, US World Cup could be century's worst

From ICE to dodgy hosts, US World Cup could be century's worst
A World Cup is never just about football. It’s a global audit of the host nation. Everyone zooms in on its politics, culture and the gap between how a country sees itself versus how the rest of the world actually experiences it.
As the US prepares to host the FIFA tournament this summer, millions will tune in not just to watch who lifts the trophy, but to see how the country handles a level of scrutiny it so often directs at others.
And that scrutiny has already started. In the months leading up to kick-off, thousands of fans cancelled their tickets, citing the US’s deteriorating human rights record, an aggressive right-wing political climate and an unrelenting stream of criminal scandals. Even football officials have openly called for a boycott, pointing to the actions of President Trump and his administration at home, as well as on the global stage.
The first thing the world will be watching is who actually makes it through the gate. Though exemptions for athletes, staff and families exist on paper, under the Trump administration, certainty is a luxury few can afford.
The US operates one of the most restrictive and shifting visa regimes, one that categorises entire countries as security risks. Visitors from much of the global south, particularly from Muslim-majority countries, are completely barred from entry. Others, where soccer culture has long thrived, face severe limitations.
Take Senegal. The country topped the Africa Cup of Nations, yet remains among dozens facing entry restrictions. The list stretches across South America, Africa and Asia, regions where FIFA-backed football programs often serve as lifelines for kids and communities.
What gets me most is the irony of it all: the US is hosting the world’s biggest soccer tournament while shutting out the very people who have historically found real joy and refuge in it.
And even for citizens of countries that are technically “allowed,” the welcome is fragile. Stories of sudden visa revocations, border harassment, arrests and deportations are not new. In the last few years, travellers say they’ve been turned away at US airports over political views and memes.
The second test is more on the logistical side: can the US actually host millions of people safely and fairly amid mounting evidence of internal chaos?
Patriotism and confidence, arguably something the US is good at, are unfortunately not enough to host the World Cup. An event this scale requires boring systems: functioning airports, efficient public transit, clear visa processes, fair policing and emergency response that doesn’t depend on an insurance company’s mood swings. These determine whether fans make it to games, players feel safe and whether people can enter and exit a country without fear.
In the US, many of these systems are visibly strained. Air travel teeters on fragility as the administration witnessed a second government shutdown within a span of months, forcing airport staff to work without pay.
With many host cities like Houston heavily dependent on cars, public transit becomes an obvious problem when hundreds of thousands of visitors are expected to move quickly and affordably. And right now, as people are being disappeared by Gestapo-esque forces, the US is asking the world to trust policing systems that aren’t even able to keep Americans safe.
Finally, the world will be watching to see if the age-old myth of American exceptionalism still holds. This idea rests on the notion that the US is uniquely capable, uniquely free and uniquely qualified to lead. Hosting the World Cup is a chance to perform that belief on a global stage and have it tested in real time. Can a country grappling with gun violence host mass gatherings without fear? Can a nation that lectures others on human rights reconcile that image with its own record on policing, incarceration and protest? Can it centre the world without centring itself?
When Qatar hosted the World Cup in 2022, what often went unacknowledged was how much of the criticism, even when rooted in legitimate human rights concerns, slipped into something more unsettling. Labour practices, governance and cultural norms were rightly scrutinised, but with a tone scholars and commentators described as a modern repackaging of old orientalist tropes that Arab and Muslim societies are inherently backward, authoritarian and incapable of meeting global standards.
And Qatari officials pushed back on that framing. In an interview with a German newspaper, Qatar’s foreign minister said European criticism often implied that Qatar was “not intellectually or culturally prepared to host a World Cup,” calling the tone “arrogant” and “honestly… very racist.” He pointed to the double standards at play, particularly from countries that publicly questioned Qatar’s values while privately maintaining deep economic ties, including energy cooperation.
None of this negates the importance of human-rights advocacy. Much of the pressure on Qatar led to real, even if incomplete, labour reforms. But it’s worth noting what often got lost in the conversation: Qatar delivered the tournament itself with remarkable precision. Stadiums were finished on time. Transport was efficient. Fans consistently described the experience as smooth, safe and accessible.
Many fans, including those initially sceptical, later acknowledged that the logistics surpassed expectations. In a BBC poll, the Qatar World Cup was voted the best of the century.
This contrast matters now. Because as the US prepares to host, the question isn’t whether human rights should be discussed, they should. It’s whether the US can even meet the technical and logistical bar that Qatar did.
For decades, the US has positioned itself as both referee and role model. This World Cup flips the dynamic. The cameras will be pointed inward this time, and millions of viewers, many watching from afar by choice or necessity, will be looking to see whether the performance matches the promise.

Perjury probe into ICE testimonies marks latest shooting where evidence contradicts Trump officials
Federal authorities have announced an investigation into two immigration officers who appeared to have made untruthful statements under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis last month
- Bookmark
Federal authorities announced an investigation Friday into two immigration officers who appeared to have made untruthful statements under oath about a shooting in Minneapolis last month.
It is among at least five shootings in which initial descriptions by the immigration officials were later contradicted by video evidence. Those included the fatal Minneapolis shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti, where bystander video quickly raised questions about how they were initially described.
The probe Friday came hours after a federal judge dismissed felony assault charges against two Venezuelan men who were accused of beating an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer with a broom handle and a snow shovel on Jan. 14. The officer, who is not named in court filings, fired a single shot from a handgun that struck one of the men, Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis, in the thigh.
In an unusual reversal, prosecutors asked to dismiss the cases because they said new video evidence contradicted allegations made against the men in a criminal complaint and at a hearing last month.
Here is a look at how the five shootings were initially described and what was later learned:
Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis non-fatal shooting
Date and location: Jan. 14, 2026, in Minneapolis
What federal officials said initially: Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the immigration officer was “ambushed” by Sosa-Celis and others, and fired a “defensive shot” out of fear for his life. “What we saw last night in Minneapolis was an attempted murder of federal law enforcement,” she said.
What came out later: Investigators have not released the new evidence that led charges to be dropped, but cracks were already apparent in a Jan. 21 court hearing. The immigration officer’s testimony recounting the moments before the shooting differed significantly from that of the defendants and three eyewitnesses. Available video evidence did not support the officer’s account of being assaulted with a broom and shovel.
Renee Good fatal shooting
Date and location: Jan. 7, 2026, in Minneapolis
What federal officials said initially: Noem described the incident as an “act of domestic terrorism” carried out against ICE officers by a woman who “attempted to run them over and rammed them with her vehicle." She said the immigration agent shot “defensively” to protect himself and the people around him. Good died of gunshot wounds to the head.
What came out later: Videos filmed from multiple angles challenged the administration’s narrative. Shortly before the shooting Good is seen at the wheel of her SUV that is parked diagonally on a street. She tells an immigration officer, “I'm not mad at you.”
Seconds later, another immigration officer grabs at the driver’s side door while Good’s wife urges her to “drive, baby, drive.” It’s unclear in the videos if the SUV makes contact with ICE officer Jonathan Ross, who shoots while standing in front of the vehicle and then twice more while quickly moving to the driver's side of the SUV as it pulls forward.
Alex Pretti fatal shooting
Date and location: Jan. 24, 2026, in Minneapolis
What federal officials said initially: Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said Pretti approached Border Patrol officers with a handgun and he “violently resisted” when they tried to disarm him. An agent feared for his life and fired defensive shots, she said. Pretti was pronounced dead at the scene. Border Patrol senior official Greg Bovino claimed Pretti intended to “massacre law enforcement," and Deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller described him as “a would-be assassin."
What came out later: None of the half-dozen bystander videos collected by investigators showed Pretti brandishing his gun, which he had a permit to carry. The videos showed Pretti was holding his mobile phone as a masked Border Patrol officer opened fire.
In a tense hearing Thursday in Washington, Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky made leaders tasked with carrying out Trump’s mass deportation agenda watch a video of the shooting while he repeatedly scrutinized the forceful tactics used by immigration agents. Paul argued that Pretti posed no threat to the agents and said it was clear from the video that he was “retreating at every moment.”
Silverio Villegas González fatal shooting
Date and location: Sept. 12, 2025, in suburban Chicago
What federal officials said initially: Homeland Security officials said federal agents were pursuing a man with a history of reckless driving who entered the country illegally. They alleged Silverio Villegas González drove at officers and dragged one with his car. DHS said the officer fired because he feared for his life and was hospitalized with “serious injuries."
What came out later: Body camera videos from local police contradicted the Trump administration’s account. Footage showed the agent who shot Villegas González walking around afterward and dismissing his own injuries as “nothing major.”
An autopsy made public in November declared Villegas González's death a homicide. The report showed he was shot at “close range,” with wounds to his neck and fingers.
Marimar Martinez non-fatal shooting
Date and location: Oct. 14, 2025, in Chicago
What federal officials said initially: A DHS news release asserted that Martinez and the driver of another car involved in a crash with a Border Patrol officer were “domestic terrorists.” An FBI agent said in court documents that she was chasing the Border Patrol vehicle and drove at one of the officers after they got out of the vehicle. The officer was forced to open fire, the FBI agent alleged, striking Martinez seven times. She was treated at a hospital and arrested on felony assault charges.
What came out later: Videos emerged that Martinez’s attorneys said showed agent Charles Exum steering his SUV into her truck.
In a text message presented during a Nov. 5 hearing, Exum appeared to brag about his marksmanship. “I fired 5 rounds and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys," the text read.
The case against her was dismissed.

As I see it | Western media criticism of the Jimmy Lai case verdict needs a fact check
While some critiques of the former media boss’ sentencing come down to different standards of governance and journalism, others are steeped in hypocrisy
There is this old British chestnut that says justice must not only be done, but must be seen to be done.
There is the reality of justice and the appearance of it, and the two don’t always or even usually coincide.
There are two main reasons behind the widespread Western criticism of Lai’s case. One is that Western standards and assumptions about governance and journalism are very different from China’s. I can respect them in the same way that I respect Islamic or Christian beliefs, though I am not a Christian or a Muslim. The other reason is the West’s inherent double standards, to which I do object.
Let’s start with the latter, which I will call the West’s fact-free criticism of the case.
I will cite several examples, the first from The New York Times, written by one of its most prominent commentators, titled “Dissidents are silenced, and the West moves on”.

Lebanon's Berri says parliamentary election must be held on time
Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said on Friday he was committed to holding a parliamentary election as scheduled on 10 May, despite calls from some politicians to postpone the vote.
Several politicians have called for a delay, citing security concerns in southern Lebanon, where Israel has carried out airstrikes in the region.
Berri, a Shia leader allied with Hezbollah, said in a statement carried by the state-run National News Agency that he had informed President Joseph Aoun and the government of his position.
"It is not permissible that, at the start of a new era, we obstruct its launch by disrupting, postponing or extending the most important constitutional entitlement, which is the foundation for forming authorities and producing political life," Berri said.
Berri has opened the candidacy registry for the election and submitted the first nomination request for the Tyre-Zahrani district in southern Lebanon.
Lebanon last held a parliamentary election in May 2022, a vote marked by low turnout and deep public anger over a financial collapse.
The election saw some gains by reformist candidates emerging from the 2019 protest movement, while the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies lost their parliamentary majority.

'Disordered eating': Former captain on relationship with food while playing

Former AFL captain Dyson Heppell speaks about unhealthy relationship with food during playing career
Former Essendon captain Dyson Heppell has spoken about the unhealthy relationship he had with food early in his career after entering footy's "horrendous" environment around body image.
"You would set yourself a target and if you came back from your off season to your preseason and you didn't hit that target, you would be put into a group that would have to do extra cross training — or some form of training to strip some fat off," Heppell said on I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here.
"And the boys hailed this group 'fat club'. It was a pretty vicious one, to be honest.
"The relationship with food and stuff was horrendous and body image and shocking.
"When I had a broken leg, so I'm on crutches all off season and I didn't hit my skinny targets, so I'm in fat club for pre-season. I was like, 'you kidding?'"
Heppell played 253 games for Essendon between 2011 and 2024.
Heppell said he would often obsess over his eating, including pre-preparing meals and being wary of eating when the team was away.
"Early in my career, I ended up with a pretty unhealthy relationship with food. And [it] wasn't a full eating disorder but it was … it was disordered eating," Heppell said.
"I'd hardly want to go out and eat."
Fellow contestant, former NRL player Luke Bateman, who played for the Canberra Raiders between 2015-2019, also said unofficial 'fat clubs' were present across rugby league.
In 2016 it was reported that Carlton had a 'fat club’, set by then-Blues coach Brendon Bolton and his fitness staff.
Measured by skin folds, if a player had more than 12 per cent body fat, they would be put into 'fat club' and have to undertake intense training before rejoining the main group.
At the time, sports administrator Brian Waldron condemned the initiative, saying it was socially irresponsible to name the group the 'fat club'.
"Surely they could call it something else," Waldron said on SEN.
"There will be kids walking around school today being told they're in the fat club and I think that is just social stupidity to be calling a group of players into a group they call the fat club."
In 2024, the AFL banned clubs from conducting skin fold testing on prospective draftees in a move that was widely panned by footy media critics.
For AFLW players and girls coming through the system, they could opt out entirely of being weighed.
A memo sent to clubs, addressed by Kate Hall and Grant Williams, read: "Body weights will only be measured by qualified High Performance/Sport Scientists, Sports Dietitians, or Medical Practitioners, in a safe and private setting. All data collected must be kept private."
Former AFL premiership-winning coach Paul Roos was among those critics, telling the ABC's new AFL Daily podcast that if players were worried about skin folds, they should "go and find another job".
However, former players continue to speak out about unhealthy habits around food and weight obsession during their playing days.
Recently, former GWS player Cooper Hamilton has spoken widely across social media about body dysmorphia and his struggles with an eating disorder during his career.
He said he would avoid seeing friends or doing anything socially if it involved food and would often go into games under-fuelled.
Moreover, the ABC uncovered elite female athletes' struggles with body image and disordered eating in a recent survey.
While the AFL has taken significant steps to reduce the emphasis on player weight and body image obsession in recent years, it remains an issue across clubs.
When Heppell was asked if AFL clubs still did 'fat club', he answered emphatically: "Still a thing."

US paid US$35 million to deport 300 to remote islands, African nations
The bulk of the money – US$32 million – went to Equatorial Guinea, Rwanda, El Salvador, Palau and eSwatini
The Trump administration spent more than US$35 million to deport roughly 300 migrants to countries they had no connection to, doling out millions of dollars in lump sum transfers to foreign governments without a system to track how the money was used, according to a report released on Friday.
The White House has argued that this method is necessary to remove undocumented criminals whose home nations would not take them.
Immigration groups that have challenged the practice in court have said the practice had wide-ranging effects on law-abiding non-citizens who were at risk of being sent to unfamiliar countries with little, if any, opportunity to fight it.

Risk of missteps hangs over US-backed ceasefire deal in north-east Syria
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
DAMASCUS – A US-backed ceasefire agreement in north-eastern Syria
The progress of the deal tests the ability of Syria’s new leaders to stabilise a nation fractured by 14 years of war, following several bouts of violence pitting it against minority groups who are suspicious of the Islamist-led government.
The struggle for Syria’s north-east has brought the biggest shift in control since former leader Bashar al-Assad was ousted in December 2024.
After months of deadlock, Damascus seized swathes of territory from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) before agreeing to the plan that foresees its remaining enclave being integrated into the state.
Preliminary steps have gone smoothly since the Jan 29 agreement: small contingents of government forces have deployed into two Kurdish-run cities, fighters have withdrawn from front lines, and Damascus on Feb 13 announced the appointment of a regional governor nominated by the Kurds.
But a dozen government and Kurdish officials said core issues had yet to be tackled, including precisely how SDF fighters will be integrated, the fate of SDF heavy weapons, and arrangements for a border crossing to Iraq that has been an SDF lifeline.
For now, the SDF has a firm grip over areas it still holds. But the question of how much authority the SDF would retain had yet to be answered, said Mr Noah Bonsey of International Crisis Group, a think-tank.
He said further progress in implementing the deal currently looked like the most likely scenario, “but the risk... of missteps, and thus, ultimately the risk of renewed escalation is still high”.
Washington pleased with progress, urges flexibility
Syria’s President Ahmed al-Sharaa has now brought almost all of Syria back under central control.
A Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington, which withdrew some forces from Syria this week, is pleased with progress toward integration and has urged Mr Sharaa to be as flexible as possible with SDF requests.
The US advice is: avoid taking a hard line as a sign of goodwill, since a degree of autonomy for Kurds is desirable as long as it does not threaten the core need for central authority in Damascus, the official said.
Asked for comment, the US State Department referred to a statement by Syria envoy Tom Barrack in which he said the agreement paved the way for lasting peace for all Syrians. Syria’s information ministry and the SDF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The agreement, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, foresees the defence ministry establishing a division for the north-east, integrating SDF forces into three brigades.
It stipulates that 15 government security vehicles would deploy into each of the SDF-held cities of Qamishli and Hasakah, and that “integration of SDF security forces” would begin.
Deployments in February were largely incident-free, in stark contrast to the government’s attempt to enter Druze-majority Sweida in July 2025, which led to deadly violence. The US, meanwhile, has moved thousands of Islamic State prisoners formerly guarded by the SDF to Iraq.
But there are also signs of friction on the ground.
The SDF accuses the government of besieging Kobani, a Kurdish-run town cut off from the main SDF enclave, while Arabs living in SDF areas are resentful of its continued control, notably in ethnically mixed Hasakah city, according to two Syrian security officials.
SDF commander Mazloum Abdi has said the three brigades comprising SDF fighters will be based in Qamishli, Hasakah and Derik, near the Iraqi border. But officials on both sides said that while there was a tentative understanding on a location near Qamishli, the other two had yet to be agreed.
The SDF wants one stationed on Mount Abdelaziz near Hasakah city, overlooking its southern approaches and an extensive network of tunnels, Syrian military sources said. Damascus objects to this.
Kurdish official sees security in Kurdish hands
Arab-majority areas fell quickly to the government advance, including Deir al-Zor province and its oil fields. But the deal requires the SDF to hand over two other fields near Qamishli – Rmeilan and Sweidiya – and Qamishli airport. This has yet to happen.
A regional intelligence officer described SDF concessions so far as symbolic.
Mr Abdulkarim Omar, a senior Kurdish official, told Reuters that government security forces would withdraw after coordinating and finalising “integration mechanisms”.
“The Asayish (Kurdish security forces) will be part of the interior ministry, and they are the ones who will protect this region from within,” he said, adding that “lengthy discussions” were needed on the agreement’s implementation.
Turkey has also indicated lingering doubts. It views the Kurdish YPG militia, the SDF’s backbone, as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which staged a decades-long insurgency in Turkey before entering a peace process.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the YPG’s withdrawal created a “healthier” security map, but Turkey’s security concerns would only be fully addressed when YPG severs links to the PKK and undergoes a “historic transformation”. REUTERS

US military strikes another alleged drug boat in Caribbean, killing 3
The U.S. military says it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea
- Bookmark
The U.S. military said Friday that it has carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the Caribbean Sea.
U.S. Southern Command said on social media that the boat “was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Caribbean and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” It said the strike killed three people. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.
Friday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 133 people in at least 38 attacks carried out since early September in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.
U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth declared last week that “some top cartel drug-traffickers” in the region “have decided to cease all narcotics operations INDEFINITELY due to recent (highly effective) kinetic strikes in the Caribbean.” However, Hegseth did not provide any details or information to back up this claim, made in a post on his personal account on social media.
President Donald Trump has said the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs. But his administration has offered little evidence to support its claims of killing “narcoterrorists.”

Trump threatens to enforce voter ID for the midterm elections: ‘Approved by Congress or not!’
The president’s warning also included a direct, unusual appeal to the Supreme Court
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
President Trump vowed to impose voter ID requirements ahead of the midterms, with or without congressional approval, the latest escalation of his campaign to assert more control over elections, which he baselessly claims Democrats have been rigging against him and others.
“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer,” the president wrote in a Truth Social post on Friday afternoon. “These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS.”
“I have searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one in the very near future,” he wrote in another post. “There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!”
The president, in his posts, also made an unusually partisan direct address to the Supreme Court, claiming that if the status quo remained, Democrats would eventually try to pack the court with an expanded number of justices, end the filibuster in Congress, and add additional U.S. states.
“Our Country will never be the same if they allow these demented and evil people to knowingly, and happily, destroy it,” Trump wrote.
The comments alarmed critics of the president.
“Trump’s authoritarian takeover and interference in the midterm elections under the guise of ‘election integrity’ has begun,” Melanie D’Arrigo, executive director of the advocacy group Campaign for New York Health, wrote on X.
This week, the House passed the SAVE Act along party lines, which would require proof of citizenship to vote and let the Department of Homeland Security seize voter rolls.
Republicans supporting the bill echoed the president’s unfounded claims of mass election interference from Democrats.
“Cheating is the only path to victory,” Representative Mary Miller, Republican of Illinois, told The New York Times.
Critics of the effort, which is unlikely to advance through the Senate, accuse the Republicans of pursuing a thinly veiled attempt at voter disenfranchisement, given that it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote, and millions of Americans don’t possess the legal documents, like a passport, that would help them prove their citizenship.
Almost all states require voters to attest that they are citizens to vote, under penalty of perjury.
Earlier this month, a federal judge in Washington blocked parts of a previous Trump executive order requiring documented proof of citizenship when military members register to vote and mandating agencies “assess citizenship” before providing federal voting forms.
"Put simply, our Constitution does not allow the President to impose unilateral changes to federal election procedures," U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote.
The Constitution leaves administering elections largely to the states, but President Trump has continued to push for more federal involvement, an effort rooted in his continued insistence that non-citizens are cheating in elections, even though analysis, including a review by the Trump administration, suggests this barely ever happens and does not sway elections.
Earlier this month, the president called on Republicans to “nationalize” elections.
The White House has said it can offer “no guarantee” that federal immigration agents won’t be present at polling stations, as MAGA allies like podcaster and former White House strategist Steve Bannon have pushed to use armed immigration agents to “surround the polls.”
The Justice Department has sued multiple states to force them to turn over voter registration information.
Leaders in Illinois accused the administration of using federal force there to dampen civic participation and voter turnout in future elections.
Gov. JB Pritzker called the efforts a way to “circumvent our democracy, militarize our cities, and end elections.”

U.S. women's hockey tops Italy 6-0 to advance to Winter Olympics semifinals

U.S. women's hockey tops Italy 6-0 to advance to Winter Olympics semifinals
The upstart Italians didn't make it easy on the Americans, and that's everything veteran forward Kelly Pannek could have asked for as the top-seeded U.S. continued its run through the Olympic women's hockey tournament.
A festive atmosphere, a determined opponent, a little chippiness and a 6-0 win in which 13 players — led by Kendall Coyne Schofield's two goals — registered at least a point.
"It feels like right now we're finding different ways within our identity to get the job done," Pannek said. "And it's taken every single person on the ice on our team and our staff to do it. And it feels like we're still building to what we really can be."
After a first period in which the Americans outshot Italy 20-2, but only led 1-0 on Megan Keller's goal, the U.S finally broke through with a five-goal second period.
Laila Edwards, Hannah Bilka and Britta Curl-Salemme also scored. Gwyneth Philips finished with six saves as the Americans posted their fourth straight shutout.
The Group A-winning U.S. has outscored its opponents by a combined 26-1 in winning all five games, with the lone goal allowed in a 5-1 tournament-opening win over Czechia.
With Coyne Schofield, Lee Stecklein and Grace Zumwinkle making the scoresheet Friday, the U.S. has only two skaters — defenders Cayla Barnes and Rory Guilday — without a point.
"At the other day I think it's everyone's willing to do whatever it takes to be a part of the success of this team," Coyne Schofield said. "And whatever role's asked of us on a given night, that's what we're going to do."
Now two wins away from winning its third Olympic gold medal, the U.S. advanced to the semifinals on Monday. The Americans will play either Sweden, after the Group B winner upset Czechia 2-0 earlier in the day, or Germany, should the seventh-seeded team knock off Canada in its quarterfinal on Saturday.
Finland faces Switzerland in the other quarterfinal on Saturday.
The game on Friday featured dueling chants, with each chorus of "USA! USA! USA!" met with an even louder "EEE-TA-LIA!"
Italy stood little chance making its second Olympic appearance, each time as the host team. Advancing to the knockout round was considered an accomplishment for the Italians, who went 2-2 in the preliminary round, and after going 0-4 at the 2006 Turin Games.
Goalie Gabriella Durante stole the show by stopping 19 of 20 shots through the opening period, and 45 overall.
"There's definitely obviously sadness and disappointment, but at the same time, I don't think the team has any regrets in how hard we played," said Durante, who noted the team watched the movie "Miracle," about the U.S. men's run in the 1980 Olympics, as motivation the night before.
"We were just believing from the very start. And obviously the second it got away from us a little bit, but at the same time like it's the best in the world," she added. "I'll remember it for the rest of my life, the crowd specifically, the atmosphere."
Things also got heated following a scuffle after Bilka scored to put the U.S. up 6-0 late in the second period. As Abbey Murphy and Italy's Franziska Stocker were sent off for penalties, U.S. coach John Wroblewski began shouting across the bench at Italy coach Eric Bouchard.
Wroblewski said he was unhappy with the calls seeming to favor the Italians, because Murphy stepped in after Bilka was cross-checked from behind.
"I think his team got frustrated for sure," Bouchard said. "They're the best hockey team in the world, and they found a way to capitalize on their chances. But that third period, the girls never quit."
Sweden upsets Czechia 2-0
Coach Ulf Lundberg declared "the time is now" for Sweden before the women's hockey tournament opened.
A little more than a week and five wins later, his young, talented and fearless team has delivered.
Hanna Olsson scored, Ebba Traff Svensson stopped 29 shots, and Sweden upset Czechia 2-0 on Friday to advance to the semifinal round for the first time in 12 years.
"It's a wonderful feeling," Lundberg said of a team that has finished no better than sixth at the past five world championships. "Going back to the worlds in the Czech Republic, we were close. But everyone talks about when are they going to take the step to the semifinal? And now we have done it. I'm so satisfied."
After Olsson scored a power-play goal 4:47 into the second period, Hilda Svensson sparked a huge celebration by sealing the victory with an empty-net goal with 25 seconds remaining.
Sweden had not advanced to the semifinals since finishing fourth at the 2014 Sochi Games. And the nation is in position to earn its third Olympic medal, and first since winning silver at the 2006 Turin Games, when Sweden upset the U.S. in the semifinals.
The Swedes feature a young, talented roster made up of a core of the team that won silver at the 2018 Under-18 championships. There are eight players 22 and younger, with seven currently competing at U.S. colleges. They include Svensson, the 19-year-old Ohio State freshman, who's tied for seventh in the nation with 44 points (15 goals, 29 assists) in 26 games.
Sweden entered the quarterfinals as the tournament's sixth seed after going 4-0 through preliminary round play to win the Group B title.
Czechia's Klara Peslarova finished with 21 saves.
The loss was a major disappointment for a Czech team on the rise since finishing seventh in its Olympic debut at the 2022 Beijing Games. Czechia has since won two bronze medals — its first in women's play — and finished fourth twice over the past four world championships.
"There's just no words for this. It hurts. It's going to hurt for a long time," Natalie Mlynkova said. "We were supposed to have this one."

Federal immigration officials plan to spend $38.3 billion to boost detention capacity to 92,600 beds, a document released Friday shows, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement quietly purchases warehouses to turn into detention and processing facilities.
Republican New Hampshire Gov. Kelly Ayotte posted the document online amid tension over ICE's plans to convert a warehouse in Merrimack into a 500-bed processing center.
It said ICE plans 16 regional processing centers with a population of 1,000 to 1,500 detainees, whose stays would average three to seven days. Another eight large-scale detention centers would be capable of housing 7,000 to 10,000 detainees for periods averaging less than 60 days.
The document also refers to the acquisition of 10 existing “turnkey” facilities.
Plans call for all of them to be up and running by November as immigration officials roll out a massive $45 billion expansion of detention facilities financed by President Donald Trump’s recent tax-cutting law.
More than 75,000 immigrants were being detained by ICE as of mid-January, up from 40,000 when Trump took office a year earlier, according to federal data released last week.
The newly released document refers to “non-traditional facilities” and comes as ICE has quietly bought at least seven warehouses — some larger than 1 million square feet (92,900 square meters) — in the past few weeks in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas.
Warehouse purchases in six cities were scuttled when buyers decided not to sell under pressure from activists. Several other deals in places like New York are imminent, however.
City officials are frequently unable to get details from ICE until a property sale is finalized.
Tensions boiled to the surface after interim ICE Director Todd Lyons testified Thursday that the Department of Homeland Security “has worked with Gov. Ayotte” and provided her with an economic impact summary.
Ayotte said that assertion was “simply not true” and the summary was sent hours after Lyons testified.
The document mistakenly refers to the “ripple effects to the Oklahoma economy” and revenue generated by state sales and income taxes, neither of which exist in New Hampshire.
“Director Lyons’ comments today are another example of the troubling pattern of issues with this process,” Ayotte said. “Officials from the Department of Homeland Security continue to provide zero details of their plans for Merrimack, never mind providing any reports or surveys.”
DHS did not respond to questions about Ayotte's comments or the new document. But it previously confirmed that it was looking for more detention space, although it objected to calling the sites “warehouses,” saying in a statement that they would be “very well structured detention facilities meeting our regular detention standards.”

Over 50,000 IDF soldiers hold second passports, new data shows

The IDF has for the first time published data detailing the foreign citizenships held by its service members, revealing that tens of thousands of soldiers hold at least one additional nationality beyond Israeli citizenship.
In response to a Freedom of Information request submitted in March last year by the Israeli nonprofit Hatzlacha and published on the British website Declassified, the military said 50,632 service members hold an additional foreign citizenship.
According to the data, 4,440 soldiers hold two foreign citizenships in addition to their Israeli citizenship, while 162 hold three foreign citizenships beyond their Israeli nationality.
The IDF presented the information in two columns: one listing service members with one foreign citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship, and another listing those with at least two foreign citizenships. The military noted that some individuals may be counted in both columns.
The figures show that 12,135 soldiers hold U.S. citizenship, 6,127 hold French citizenship and 5,067 hold Russian citizenship in addition to their Israeli nationality. More than 3,000 service members hold German and Ukrainian citizenship, respectively, while more than 1,000 hold British, Romanian, Polish, Ethiopian and Canadian citizenship.
The list also includes a small number of soldiers with citizenship from Arab countries. Fourteen service members hold Yemeni citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship and eight hold at least two foreign citizenships including Yemen. Fifteen soldiers hold Tunisian citizenship in addition to Israeli citizenship and seven hold multiple foreign citizenships including Tunisia. Four hold Lebanese citizenship, three hold Syrian citizenship and one holds Algerian citizenship, according to the data.

While the near-last-minute U-turn revived excitement, it came at a price for the Indian supporters making late travel plans. Pakistan’s participation was confirmed only six days before the fixture, triggering a sharp surge in airfares from several Indian cities.
Fans who booked their air tickets weeks in advance, too, paid significantly higher fares due to the significantly higher demand surrounding any India-Pakistan match, which is commonly deemed the most lucrative fixture in cricket.
“I paid a premium of approximately 50 percent compared to the usual rates,” Aditya Chheda, a finance professional from Mumbai, told Al Jazeera. “This was despite booking a month in advance and opting for a layover instead of a direct flight.”
Flight, hotel prices skyrocket
A nonstop round-trip journey from India’s western metropolis Mumbai to Colombo, which typically costs approximately $275, went upwards of $1,000 two days before the match.
Similar fares were spotted for nonstop journeys from Bengaluru in southern India, while round-trip nonstop flights from Chennai to Colombo – a route that takes only about an hour and 20 minutes – had surged to at least $550, up from its usual fare of $165.
Planning ahead helped Bengaluru resident Parth Chauhan secure deals at a good price, but his friends accompanying him to Colombo had to pay a steep premium – three times the usual cost – after booking closer to the match date.
Accommodation costs rose sharply as well. Tariffs at five-star hotels in Colombo ranged between $400 and $1,000 per night from Saturday to Monday, when most spectators were expected to fly in and out.
Chauhan, who works in a cybersecurity organisation, had to wait a whopping four hours in a virtual queue to buy match tickets, but he insists the hassle was worth the wait, as he gears up to watch India play abroad for the first time.
“It’s an opportune moment, and there is a lot of exuberance to witness this because it’s a historic fixture,” he said.
For a lucky few, the surprise came not from the difficulty of securing tickets but from their unusually low price. Piyush Nathani, an IT professional from Bengaluru, paid only $5 for the fixture, which draws millions in broadcast, sponsor and advertising revenue.
“This is the cheapest ticket I’ve ever purchased. Just $5 to watch a World Cup match, that too of the magnitude of India vs Pakistan, is a steal,” said Nathani, who has travelled with a group of six friends.
‘More than a cricket match’
Having been part of the Ahmedabad crowd in 2023 that saw India beat Pakistan in a 50-over World Cup group game, Nathani is relishing the chance to watch Sunday’s match in a neutral venue, where fans from both countries are expected to be present.
“The feeling of beating Pakistan is something money cannot buy,” added the 29-year-old.
Like Nathani, Chheda has also travelled abroad previously to watch Team India. The 32-year-old watched India lift the 2024 T20 World Cup in Barbados and now wants to “pick up where I left off”.
“When there’s a World Cup, the first thing Indian fans hope for is to beat Pakistan,” he added.
“Winning the World Cup is the biggest target, but beating Pakistan feels like a moral victory – it’s more than a cricket match.”

Trump says Iran not ready to practical actions for striking deal

WASHINGTON, February 14. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump said Tehran was reportedly not demonstrating readiness to take concrete measures in order to reach an agreement on its nuclear program.
"I would say they want to talk. But so far they do a lot of talking and no action," the US leader said, speaking about the Iranian government.
When asked what Iran should do to avert a US attack, Trump replied: "Give us the deal that they should have given us the first time."
"If they give us a right deal, we won’t do that," the US leader added. "Historically, they haven’t done that."
Trump stated on January 26 that Washington had sent a "big armada" towards Iran, and expressed hope that Tehran would engage in dialogue and make a deal, renouncing nuclear weapons. The US leader warned that "the next attack will be far worse" than the summer 2025 strikes on Iran. "Don't make that happen again," he added.
Iran and the US held another round of talks on Tehran’s nuclear program in Oman on February 6. Tehran’s delegation was led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, and the US delegation was headed by Special Presidential Envoy Steve Witkoff.

US military kills 3 in latest attack on boat in the Caribbean
At least 133 people have been killed in US attacks on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean since September.
The United States military has attacked a boat in the Caribbean Sea, killing three people, as it continues deadly air strikes that have killed at least 133 people since September 2025.
US Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), which oversees military operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, said US forces “conducted a lethal kinetic strike” earlier on Friday, killing three people.

The US military again repeated its claim, without providing any evidence, that it was targeting people suspected of drug trafficking, and described those slain in the attack as “narco-terrorists”.
SOUTHCOM released a video of the attack that appears to show a missile strike on the boat which then explodes into flames, leaving the vessel obliterated.
International law and human rights experts have repeatedly said such attacks amount to extrajudicial executions, even if those targeted are alleged to be engaged in trafficking drugs.
The killings on Friday follow an attack on Monday in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where SOUTHCOM said it struck a vessel, killing two people and leaving one survivor.
SOUTHCOM said it had notified the US Coast Guard that there was a survivor from the attack, but did not provide details on the survivor’s condition or chances of rescue and survival.
The first attack by US forces on vessels in international waters, which took place in September 2025, included a follow-up strike that killed survivors who were clinging to the wreckage of a destroyed boat.
US administration officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the commander of the operation, Admiral Frank Bradley, were placed under scrutiny for the order to carry out the second attack on survivors.
Legal experts said that the US military could be involved in a crime for killing the survivors of a shipwreck.
According to monitors and tallies kept by media organisations, the US has now carried out some 38 attacks against 40 vessels in the eastern Pacific and Caribbean Sea, killing at least 133 people, including an attack that killed two people earlier this week.
US President Donald Trump has said the US is engaged in an “armed conflict” with cartels in Latin America and has justified the attacks as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs to the US.
Legal experts have said that the US has no legal right to carry out attacks in international waters and that people alleged to be involved with drug trafficking have a right to due process under the law.

Indian writer Arundhati Roy pulls out of Berlin Film Festival over Gaza war
Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy said Friday she was withdrawing from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement sent to AFP that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory at a press conference on Thursday.
Roy, whose novel The God of Small Things won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.
However, she said that the "unconscionable" statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider, "with deep regret".
When asked about Germany's support for Israel at a press conference on Thursday, Wenders said: "We cannot really enter the field of politics", describing filmmakers as "the counterweight to politics".
Fellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a "little bit unfair" to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.
Roy said in her statement that "to hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping".
She described Israel's war on Gaza as "a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel".
"If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them," she said.
Roy is one of India's most famous living authors and is a trenchant critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, as well as a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause.
Restored versions of two films by late Egyptian directors, "Sad Song of Touha" by Atteyat Al Abnoudy and "The Dislocation of Amber" by Hussein Shariffe, have also been withdrawn from the festival over its stance on Gaza.
"The Berlinale respects these decisions," a spokeswoman said in a statement sent to AFP.
"We regret that we will not welcome them as their presence would have enriched the festival discourse," she said.
Shying away from politics
The Berlinale traditionally has a reputation for topical, progressive programming, but so far this year's edition has seen several stars shy away from taking a stance on the big political issues of the day.
US actor Neil Patrick Harris, who stars in the film "Sunny Dancer", was asked on Friday if he considered his art to be political and if it could help "fight the rise of fascism".
He replied that he was "interested in doing things that are apolitical" and which could help people find connection in our "strangely algorithmic and divided world".
This year's Honorary Golden Bear recipient, Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh, also demurred when asked to comment on US politics in a press conference on Friday, saying she "cannot presume to say I understand" the situation there.
This is not the first edition of the festival to run into controversy over the Gaza war.
In 2024, the festival's documentary award went to "No Other Land", which follows the dispossession of Palestinian communities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
German government officials criticised "one-sided" remarks about Gaza by the directors of that film and others at that year's awards ceremony.
Israel's genocidal war has left at least 72,000 people dead in Gaza, according to its health ministry, whose figures the UN considers reliable.

Brisbane’s big chill: Rain and cloud bring end to sweltering heat
Brisbane residents woke up to a cold snap on Saturday, with a maximum temperature of 24 degrees forecast.
The temperature is expected to remain cool on Sunday and Monday before rising again.
“It’s quite a bit cooler with all the cloud around, and there’s still a fair bit of shower activity,” meteorologist Daniel Hayes said.
“It will be pretty similar for today and tomorrow. We should start to see the skies clearing a little bit early next week, and we’ll see those temperatures warming up again.
“We’re still likely to see shower activity around today, and potentially increasing again tomorrow.”
Hayes said Sunday could see “rain rather than showers, at least for a period”, with 20 to 30 millimetres possible across parts of the city.
The showers were expected to continue on Monday morning before easing to a dry afternoon.
“After that, there’s very little activity expected for the rest of next week,” Hayes said.
Temperatures will warm up from Tuesday, but will remain at or below average.
“We’re back to around 29 degrees from Tuesday onwards, and then we sit around 30 to 31 through until the end of next week,” Hayes said.
Heavy rain and storms hit Brisbane on Thursday evening, bringing an end to the severe heat that had hung over the city for much of the week.
The temperature in Brisbane city hit 35 degrees on Thursday, while Ipswich residents sweltered through 37 degrees. On Friday, temperatures dropped by almost 10 degrees.
A flood watch is in place for south-east Queensland, with rapid river rises possible in areas that receive the heaviest rainfall.
Catchments that may be affected include the Logan and Albert rivers, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast rivers and creeks, and the Burnett, Mary, Noosa, Pine and Caboolture rivers.
The Upper Brisbane River may be impacted, though the affected portion of the lower section will be contained to the Brewer River, and Warrill, Lockyer, Laidley, Ipswich and Brisbane creeks.

Four people have been indicted on federal charges stemming from clashes with federal officers in Minneapolis, including one woman who is accused of biting off an immigration officer’s fingertip.
The three others were charged in connection with threats made to FBI agents after documents containing the agents' personal information was stolen from a vehicle.
According to sworn statements filed in those cases, the FBI agents were investigating a shooting by an Immigration Customs Enforcement Officer on Jan. 14 when protests made the area unsafe and they had to flee on foot, leaving behind two of their vehicles. The vehicles were vandalized and broken into, and several things were stolen including guns, FBI identification cards and documents that included addresses, phone numbers and other personal information of some FBI employees.
That personal information was then posted on social media, according to the court documents, and that's when the officers began receiving threatening phone calls, text messages and emails.
Woman accused of biting off immigration officer’s fingertip
Claire Louise Feng, 27, is accused of biting off the fingertip of a special agent from Homeland Security Investigations during a Jan. 24 protest that happened after immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti. Feng, who is from St. Paul, Minnesota, was indicted on the charge of assaulting a federal officer resulting in injury.
In an affidavit filed in the case, Homeland Security Investigations special agent Bronson Day said an immigration officer was attempting to arrest another protester when Feng tackled the officer. A Customs and Border Protection officer took Feng to the ground and was trying to secure her arms when Feng bit the officer’s finger through a glove, Day wrote.
The day was very cold and the officer didn’t immediately realize the severity of the injury, Day wrote, but when the officer removed his glove, he realized the tip of his ring finger had been removed, exposing the bone. He was able to get medical attention within an hour, Day wrote.
Feng’s attorney, Kevin C. Riach, said she would fight the charge.
“All you have to do to assess the credibility of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents when they make allegations like this is to look at yesterday’s dismissal that confirmed ICE agents have made false allegations against a defendant,” Riach said. “We look forward to fighting this case and clearing Ms. Feng’s name.”
3 people indicted in threats to FBI agents
Brenna Marie Doyle, 18, of Spokane, Washington, was indicted Thursday on charges of threatening to murder a federal law enforcement officer, threatening to murder a federal law enforcement officer’s family member and interstate transmission of a threat to injure a person. The indictment alleges she left voice messages on the FBI agent's phone threatening to kill them and their spouse and child.
Doyle hasn't entered a plea yet, and her attorney Robert D. Richman said they were waiting to receive evidence from the government so they can evaluate the case. He noted Doyle lives in Washington state and has never been to Minnesota.
“There is no allegation that she took any steps whatsoever to carry out any of these threats or come within a thousand miles of the agent,” Richman said.
James Patrick Lyons, 45, of California was indicted on five counts of interstate transmission of threats to injure a person, and Jose Alberto Ramirez, 29, of Illinois was indicted on one count of the same charge. Both men are accused of sending threatening text messages to FBI employees.
Attorneys for Ramirez and Lyons did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment. Neither man has had the opportunity to enter a plea.

Will allowing more Hong Kong schools to teach in English be too testing for pupils?
After decades of debate, authorities and schools sector say time is right to adjust the language policy but some argue move is mainly political
Throughout her secondary schooling at Yan Chai Hospital Law Chan Chor Si College in Kowloon Bay, only science subjects, such as maths and biology, were taught in English as the school adopted Chinese as the medium of instruction (CMI).
Chan, 19, felt that she lacked the vocabulary needed to tell a compelling story and often compared herself with peers from schools with English as their medium of instruction (EMI).
“I felt hesitant the moment I started writing,” she said. “I questioned whether my plot would be as well written or creative as those of students from EMI schools. I thought my writing was formulaic and lagged behind.”
Chan said she was not alone, as her struggles were shared by many other students who graduated from CMI schools when they entered higher education.

Scientists say they now know what went wrong with Johnson & Johnson’s Covid vaccine
Some people who took the shots developed a rare and severe type of blood clot called VITT
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized Johnson & Johnson’s Covid vaccine for emergency use in February 2021, nearly a year into the global pandemic that would go on to kill more than one million Americans.
Just over two years later, the agency requested the voluntary withdrawal of the authorization, following cases of a “rare and severe” type of blood clot in people who had gotten the shot called “VITT.”
Now, Australian researchers say they finally know what happened with the shots and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in Europe.
The people who developed the clots had a reaction to the virus used to make the shots, known as adenovirus. And, they were genetically prone to the reaction.
“By modifying or removing this specific adenovirus protein, future vaccines can avoid this extremely rare reaction while continuing to provide strong protection against disease,” Flinders University researcher Dr. Jing Wang said in a statement.
So, what happens?
When people get the shots, the body’s immune system can accidentally confuse a normal protein from adenovirus - which is used to ferry coronavirus DNA into our cells, leading to the creation of antibodies that protect us from the disease - with a protein found in the blood called PF4.
It’s this confusion that triggers the production of a dangerous blood antibody that leads to clotting, the researchers said. Known as an autoantibody, it mistakenly attacks the host.
Building on years of previous research that examined PF4 and antibodies from vaccines, they found this out by using a mass spectrometer, an instrument that works to identify and quantify molecules within a sample.
“A novel aspect of the paper was our use of powerful mass spectrometry sequencing to identify molecular mimicry between the adenovirus vector protein and the PF4 culprit target,” Wang said.
“This was the missing link that explains how a normal immune response can, in very rare cases, become harmful.”
Nowhere to go but forward
The FDA and CDC reported that 15 cases of VITT had been reported in 2021, with all cases occurring in women between the ages of 18 and 59 years old.
They experienced symptoms between six and 15 days after receiving the vaccine.
And, hundreds of other cases have been reported in Europe, although little data has been made available regarding cases reported elsewhere.
Some researchers have estimated a death rate for VITT of more than 20 percent.
For patients who have a very low platelet count and have experienced a brain hemorrhage following blood clots in the brain, however, the risk of death jumps to 73 percent, according to University College London.
But the new research can help to prevent this rare problem entirely, the Australians say.
“Researchers say the findings will help ensure future vaccines built on this technology remain effective, accessible and even safer, particularly in regions where adenovirus‑vector vaccines are critical tools for disease prevention,” Flinders University wrote.

Chinese mother prepares ‘thunder breakfast’ for son, goes viral with 900 million views
Stung by online critics who accuse her of neglect over morning meal choices, woman gets creative with bizarre line-up of dishes
A mother from eastern China who faced online criticism for making simple breakfasts has turned heads and gone viral with her bizarre breakfast creations.
Clothing shop owner Zhang Liping from Zhejiang province lives with her husband and their 16-year-old son.
Last December, Zhang casually posted videos on social media of her son’s breakfasts, including several pieces of dry bread, rice crackers and a cup of hot water.
Netizens quickly pointed out the lack of nutrition this provided, with one accusing her of “neglecting her son”, and another humorously dubbing it a “stepmother’s breakfast”.
Dissatisfied with the backlash, Zhang unleashed her creativity, crafting bizarre breakfast combinations.
One morning, her groggy son discovered a skewer of candied fruit, sour fish soup and milk on the table. In another video, she served barbecue, coffee and luosifen.

Feb 13 - A Ukrainian missile attack killed two people and injured five on Friday in the Russian city of Belgorod near the border, regional governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said.
Gladkov, speaking in a video posted on Telegram, said the men were members of crews restoring damaged heating and electricity networks in the city.
Restoration work will resume on Saturday as it was too dangerous for crews to be operating at night, Gladkov said.
Gladkov had earlier said that the attack caused serious damage to energy facilities, and that electricity, heating and water supplies were cut. Three apartment buildings in the city sustained damage.
The unofficial SHOT Telegram channel said residents reported a series of loud explosions in the city and air defences were in operation.

Trump says Iran regime change could be ‘best thing’ as second US carrier heads to Middle East
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON/FORT BRAGG, North Carolina – US President Donald Trump, on Feb 13, embraced potential regime change in Iran and declared that “tremendous power” will soon be in the Middle East, as the Pentagon sent a second aircraft carrier to the region.
Mr Trump’s military moves and tough talk come even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s long-running nuclear dispute with the West.
A source briefed on the matter told Reuters that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Feb 17 in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators.
The source said Mr Witkoff and Mr Kushner will also meet officials from Russia and Ukraine on Feb 17 in Geneva in the US drive to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.
Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Mr Trump responded that it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen”. He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said “there are people”.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” he said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. “In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.”
Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.
Mr Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in strikes in 2025.
When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Mr Trump said the “dust”. He added: “If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left.”
Long deployments
US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.
The Gerald R. Ford, the US’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier in 2026.
Asked earlier on Feb 13 why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Mr Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it... if we need it, we’ll have it ready.”
One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.
The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area in 2025, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites
With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.
In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere”.
The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.
While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.
Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.
Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach there.
The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system. The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.
The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities. REUTERS

IKEA customers shocked at store closure announcement in Memphis
Residents are saddened to see the Swedish furniture store close its location in the spring

IKEA has decided to close one of its stores just a year after it completed a full renovation at the location.
Memphis residents say they are saddened to see the affordable Swedish retailer shut its doors in the Tennessee city later this year.
Once the IKEA store closes on May 3, there will be no more in-store shopping locations in Tennessee. There is another store in Antioch, Tennessee, but it’s pick-up only.
“I just found a place where I can get all the items that I need, and then now I find out it’s closing,” IKEA shopper Jim Kincaid told WMC Memphis. “That’s devastating news to me.”
In an announcement on Tuesday, the retailer said it decided to close its Memphis store after “a comprehensive review, and considering several factors including market share, business performance, cost structure, and overall optimization of physical assets.”
The news came as a shock to some.
“From what we see, it’s busy all the time, never heard about anything bad about it. It’s convenient,” Memphis shopper Milton Siler said of the IKEA location.
“We have friends that come from out of town. They come in here to specifically visit the store before they go back,” Siler told WMC Memphis. “We did not see that coming
The Memphis store had just undergone renovations that IKEA unveiled about a year ago.
After opening the Memphis location in 2016, IKEA overhauled its showroom and market hall. The renovations included a Central Planning Hub with experts ready to help customers with home projects and a 100-plus-seat Swedish restaurant and food market.
The Independent has reached out to IKEA for comment.
Another IKEA shopper, Morgan Shea, called the store closure “really heartbreaking.”
“It’s rare to find affordable, good furniture,” she told WMC Memphis.
IKEA said Memphis customers can still shop online for its home goods.
Despite the Memphis closure, IKEA is investing $2.2 billion in the U.S., according to the company’s announcement.
This investment includes the opening of 14 “new format” stores last year and plans to add an undisclosed number of new locations this year.

Trump threatens an executive order to mandate voter IDs before elections
The US president’s message comes as part of a broader push to increase federal control of the election process, raising legal questions.
United States President Donald Trump has hinted at a new executive order that would force election organisers to require voter identification before distributing ballots.
In a social media post on Friday, the Republican leader warned he would soon take executive action, apparently frustrated by a lack of progress on the issue in Congress.

“This is an issue that must be fought, and must be fought, NOW,” Trump wrote.
“If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order.”
It was not clear from his message what those legal reasons might be. But Trump’s post comes two days after the US House of Representatives successfully passed a bill to require documents that prove citizenship before voter registration.
That bill, however, is unlikely to go any further, as it faces steep odds in the Senate.
In the US, it is illegal for non-citizens to participate in elections, and voter fraud is exceedingly rare.
Nevertheless, Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that election rigging is widespread. Trump himself has continued to falsely claim that he won the 2020 presidential election, despite bipartisan pushback from election officials about the accuracy of the tally.
But faced with drooping poll numbers, Trump has turned his attention to November’s midterm elections, which will decide which party controls Congress for the last two years of his term.
Already, Trump has expressed fears that, should the Democrats claim the majority in the Republican-held House of Representatives, he could face a third impeachment.
He was successfully impeached twice in his first term, once for abusing his office and a second time for inciting an insurrection, after his supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.
The midterms featured prominently in Trump’s message on Friday. He urged Republicans to leverage popular support for voter ID laws in their campaigns for November.
“Republicans must put this at the top of every speech – It is a CAN’T MISS FOR RE-ELECTION IN THE MIDTERMS, AND BEYOND,” Trump wrote.
A study from the Pew Research Center in 2025 found that US citizens from both major parties overwhelmingly supported requiring photo identification before registering to vote.
The rate was higher among Republicans, 95 percent of whom supported such measures. But approximately 71 percent of Democrats also favoured such legislation.
But voting rights advocates and Democratic leadership have largely opposed such measures.
They argue that providing photo identification could be burdensome for members of low-income and marginalised communities who may not have easy access to documents that prove their identity.
That, in turn, could disenfranchise US citizens who might otherwise cast a ballot.
Voter ID laws are not uncommon in the US, though: Roughly 36 states have measures on the books that require residents to show proof of identity before voting, though they vary as to their strictness.
Congress has also weighed such bills before, including last year. But a renewed push has begun as the midterm elections approach and Trump pressures states for increased federal control over elections.
The US Constitution requires that states, not the federal government, administer the “times, places and manner of holding elections”. Election organising, therefore, takes place at the state and local level.
But Trump has threatened to take away that constitutional power. Speaking to conservative podcaster Dan Bongino earlier this month, the president suggested the federal government should take over the election process.
“We should take over the voting, the voting, in at least, many, 15 places,” Trump said, tripping over his words slightly. “The Republicans ought to nationalise the voting.”
His comments coincided with the reintroduction of the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act earlier this month.
The expanded version of the bill initially required proof of citizenship, not just at the time of voter registration but ahead of each ballot cast, in the form of a passport or a birth certificate – documents many US citizens lack.
That provision has since been amended, but critics have also blasted measures that would require state voter rolls to go to the federal government as unconstitutional.
The bill passed the House on Wednesday with 218 votes in support and 213 against. Only one Democrat, Henry Cuellar, voted in favour of the latest SAVE Act.
But even with its House passage, the legislation is unlikely to attract enough backing to overcome the Senate filibuster, a tool which allows the minority to block passage of a bill if it fails to attract at least 60 votes in the 100-seat chamber.
Trump railed against the filibuster, and Democrats in general, in his social media post on Friday.
“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” he wrote.
He also called upon the Supreme Court to reject Democrats’ priorities, calling them “corrupt”, “deranged”, “demented” and “evil”.
But advocacy groups like the Brennan Center for Justice called on the Senate to reject the latest voter ID push.
“These bills are part of a broader federal agenda to sow distrust in our elections, undermine election administration, and discourage Americans from making their voices heard,” the Brennan Center said in a statement.
“Congress should stand firm once again and reject the SAVE Act.”

Philippine efforts to unseat Duterte-Carpio face snags: too popular to impeach?
There is some uncertainty over whether President Marcos’ allies would be able to make up the numbers to support the complaints
The accusations range from misuse of public funds to an assassination threat against Marcos – claims she denies. Her lawyer has said the complaints were “devoid of both factual and legal basis”.
Even with the president’s allies holding a majority in the House, there are doubts whether they will support impeaching his former ally.
The latest complaints against Marcos’ deputy were largely the same as last year’s and what was “crucial is whether the impeachment of the VP still has the support of one-third of the House membership”, said Congresswoman Leila de Lima, a critic of the Duterte family who endorsed two of the three complaints filed against the vice-president this year.

NATO chief explains his odd nickname for Trump: ‘Do you have some daddy issues?’
Mark Rutte admitted it was his ‘insufficient command of the English language,’ that had led to the amusing name for the president
- Bookmark

NATO’s Secretary General has explained the origin story behind the bizarre “daddy” nickname he bestowed upon Donald Trump, which the president awkwardly took ownership of last month.
Speaking to Politico’s Dasha Burns, Mark Rutte admitted that it was his “insufficient command of the English language,” that had led to the amusing name for Trump and that he realized only later that the word had “a lot of connotations.”
“I have to ask: where did ‘daddy’ come from? Do you have some daddy issues, Mr Rutte?” Burns joked to Rutte, at the tail end of a sit-down interview at the Munich Security Conference Friday.
Rutte, who is Dutch, explained that the nickname had risen out of a meeting with Trump last summer, in which they had spoken of the U.S. bombing of Iran and the president’s ongoing negotiations with Israel.
“And then I said – and here is my insufficient command of the English language –I said, ‘Daddy sometimes has to be tough.’ And of course, later realizing that the word ‘daddy’ has a lot of connotations,” he said.
“Then what he did – and this is to his credit because he is a fun guy and he has a lot of humor – the American side then put this on T-shirts. There was a video when he came back from the Hague Summit where he said, ‘Daddy is home.’
“So there it was born, and it was never intended.”
Trump unashamedly owned the nickname during a cringe-inducing speech at the National Economic Forum in Davos last month, amid European criticism of his apparent attempts to annex Greenland.
During his speech the president claimed he’d been “helping” Europe and NATO, before veering off topic, claiming “they loved me” until he tried to claim the Danish territory, which he then incorrectly named as Iceland.
Referring to Rutte’s offhand remark, which had taken place six months prior, he went on: “They called me ‘Daddy,’ right? The last time? [A] very smart man said: ‘He’s our Daddy. He’s running it.’”
He went on: “I was, like, running it. I went from running it to being a terrible human being.”
Rutte now appeared to find the interaction with Trump comical, telling Burns: “I’m now carrying it, living with it. It’s a fact of life. Now he’s Daddy.”
Elsewhere at the Conference, others were not so positive, with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez telling attendees that Trump’s administration was “tearing apart the transatlantic partnership.”

Winter Olympics 2026: US figure skating star Malinin stumbles, Shaidorov wins surprise gold
France

US star Ilia Malinin suffered the biggest upset of the Winter Olympics on Friday as the overwhelming favorite for the men's figure skating title fell twice to finish off the podium, with Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan taking a surprise gold.
Malinin, a two-time defending world champion and undefeated for over two years, had been leading after Tuesday's short program, but he capitulated and ultimately finished 15th in the free skate, and eighth overall, after an error-strewn routine. "I was not expecting that. I felt like going into this competition, I was so ready," the 21-year-old said. "I just felt ready getting on that ice. But I think maybe that might have been the reason, that maybe I was too confident it was going to go well. Honestly, it happened. I can't process what just happened."
Before the Games, Malinin had admitted to not having a mental coach and had often joked that talking to his cats served as therapy. When asked whether his difficulties were more mental or physical, the American replied: "I think it was definitely mental." Despite leading by nearly five points after the short program, Malinin seemed overwhelmed by stress.
With US gymnastics star Simone Biles watching in the stands the three-time Grand Prix final winner failed to reproduce the form that sealed team gold for the United States last Sunday. Taking to the ice last to a deafening roar from the crowd in a shimmering all-black costume featuring gold details, the skater known as the "Quad God" was in difficulty early in his program.
He landed his opening quadruple flip jump but singled his second quadruple axel, which he had been attempting to become the first skater to land at an Olympics. That set the tone for the rest of his four-minute performance which drew gasps of disbelief from the crowd at the Milano Ice Skating Arena.
Two major falls followed and then two of his quadruple jumps were replaced by double jumps, whereas he usually features seven quadruple jumps in his free skate. There were only three clean quads in his routine to the songs The Ball by Asaf Avidan, The Smell of the Sea by Alan Mayer and Code Duello by Power-Haus and Sergiu-Dan Muresan.
'Not a pleasant feeling'
After his performance, Malinin buried his face in his hands, realising the disaster that had just unfolded as his father and coach looked shellshocked in the "Kiss and Cry" area.
They watched as his scores flashed up, nearly 70 points below his personal best of 333.81 points. "It's not a pleasant feeling and, honestly, I'm still trying to understand what happened specifically," said Malinin, the son of Olympic figure skaters who represented Uzbekistan and emigrated to the United States. "But I know that it's done, so I can't change the outcome." "It just felt so overwhelming, so, honestly, I didn't really know how to handle it at that moment."
Japan's Yuma Kagiyama, who had been second after the short program, also fell during his routine along with France's Adam Siao Him Fa who had been third. But Shaidorov surged from fifth after the short program to take a surprise first figure skating gold for his country at the Olympics.
His free skate to The Diva Dance earned him personal best scores of 198.64 for the routine and 291.58 overall, racking up over 21 points for his technically difficult opening triple axel-quad salchow combination.
Shaidorov said Malinin told him after his victory: "You deserve it." "I just did my work. I just wanted to enjoy my free skate," said Shaidorov, who finished sixth in the Grand Prix final in December, where Malinin hit a record seven quads. "It was my goal. It's why I'm training every day, and why I wake up and go to the training. That's it. It was my goal this season (to) do five quads."
Kagiyama took silver, as he did in Beijing four years ago (280.06 points), ahead of compatriot Shun Sato (274.90 points) who moved up from ninth.

Thai election sees old order restored as political dynasties weigh on vote
Thailand’s dynastic centres of political power and patronage, the ‘Baan Yai’ (Big Houses), swayed election for conservatives, analysts say.
Bangkok – Thailand’s swing to more conservative politics in last weekend’s election reveals as much about the dynamics of local power brokers as it does the missteps of the main progressive party, which failed to get its message to stick outside of urban centres.
Anutin Charnvirakul, the leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, comfortably won Sunday’s election, according to an unofficial count by the Election Commission of Thailand (ECT), securing more than 190 of the 500 seats in Thailand’s parliament.

While the ECT has 60 days to verify the results, Anutin is wasting no time.
On Tuesday, his attention had already turned to forming a coalition government with himself as prime minister, as his election rivals were left to pick through the ruins of their failed campaigns.
The youth-facing reformers in the People’s Party had been widely expected to secure the largest number of seats and the biggest share of the vote.
But they won just 118 seats, according to the ECT’s website, dozens fewer than the party secured in the 2023 election. The drop in support would seem to suggest that the public has turned away from the People’s Party’s call for structural reform in Thailand’s economy and politics.
Votes appear to have shifted to Anutin’s camp, an arch-nationalist who represents the interests of the country’s political and economic elite.
‘Baan Yai’ (Big Houses) politics
Though allegations of vote-buying and other polling irregularities in close constituency contests were growing, even the People’s Party leader, Nattaphong Ruengpanyawut, said it would not have been large enough to change the overall result.
Instead, a tearful Nattaphong apologised in a television interview to the party’s faithful and his members of parliament who lost their seats.
“I’m sad how the results turned out … but despite these tears, I’m committed to carrying on working for the people,” the 38-year-old said.
Analysts and political insiders told Al Jazeera that the People’s Party’s loss of voters – apart from urban areas in and around the capital, Bangkok, and the northern city of Chiang Mai – pointed to the deeper realities of Thai politics that continue to be insurmountable for reformists.
First among those obstacles is political patronage, experts say, where political support is based upon the promise of future favours.
Powerful political dynasties, called “Baan Yai” (Big Houses) in the Thai language, are entrenched across the country and particularly in Chonburi, Buriram and Sisaket provinces.
The “Baan Yai” joined forces under Anutin’s Bhumjaithai Party umbrella and brought along their followers to block out the People’s Party on election day.
“It’s been like this for a really long time,” said an aide to one of the most prominent of the political dynasties.
“In Bangkok, they think of their MPs as lawmakers, but we see them as village heads – someone who goes out and bats for you,” said the aide, who requested anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
“This is a person you see every day. This is the person who fixes your problems,” the aide added.
‘The only safety net they have’
Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, a constitutional law scholar at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, said the People’s Party may have made a strategic mistake by neglecting “to combat the entrenched influence of Baan Yai” over local voters.
“Because resources are so scarce, rural populations do not view an MP as a representative in the civic sense … instead, they see them as a ‘clan leader’,” Khemthong explained.
“They remain tethered to this patronage system because it is effectively the only safety net they have,” he said.
Thailand’s last election in 2023 delivered a shock warning to some of those dynasties – in Chiang Mai and Chonburi – as younger voters could not be counted on to respect the influence of the Baan Yai at the polls.
That year, a so-called “orange wave” got behind the strong pro-democracy and reform message of the Move Forward Party – the People’s Party predecessor – after nine years of military rule by former army chief Prayut Chan-ocha.
Move Forward won that election, but it was promptly dissolved as a political party by the courts over its intention to reform the country’s draconian royal defamation laws, which protect Thailand’s powerful monarchy from criticism.
Move Forward rose from the ashes and came back as the People’s Party. But with its front-line leaders banned from politics, the movement struggled to reorganise across Thailand, another reason given for the party’s shortfall at the polls last weekend.
History also appears to be repeating.
Barely 24 hours after polling stations closed, Thailand’s National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) forwarded a petition to the Supreme Court seeking to ban 44 of the People’s Party Members of Parliament – including Natthaphong – from politics.
The Supreme Court’s decision could result in a lifetime ban for the progressive MPs – the latest legal blows to its momentum.
Nationalism also played a big part in Anutin’s win, particularly in the wake of the recent border war with neighbouring Cambodia.
Bhumjaithai cast itself as the party that got behind the military during the conflict and cast its political rivals as less able to protect the country.
‘Politicians buy the poverty of rural people’
Now, as election analysts assess the results, it appears that the return of the Baan Yai was the most crucial to Anutin’s decisive win, as old political power brokers consolidated under Bhumjaithai’s conservative credentials and refrained from splitting the vote share, which would have been advantageous to the progressive bloc.
“Voter turnout is at a historic low in the last 30 years, only 65 percent, according to the Election Commission,” said Prinya Thaewanarumitkul, a Thai politics expert and an academic at Thammasat University in Bangkok.
“When voter turnout is low, the ‘organised votes’ [mobilised supporters] and the influence of the ‘Baan Yais’ become the deciding factors,” he said.
Preliminary results show that Bhumjaithai made significant gains from central Thailand to the northeast, as well as the southernmost border area with Malaysia – many seats being won due to support from political families who expressed their support publicly for Anutin before the vote.
Beyond the drop in support for reformers and MPs losing their seats, the vote has left many Gen Z supporters at a loss as to why people did not choose to change Thailand for the better. They wonder why their countrymen appear to have thrown their support behind conservatism rather than change, especially when the poor are falling further behind the rich in Thailand’s slowing economy.
For People’s Party voter Arsikin Singthong, 22, who lives in Thailand’s southern Muslim-majority border province of Pattani, the reason can be found in money, politics and rural poverty.
“These Baan Yai politicians buy the poverty of rural people. This is the game,” Arsikin told Al Jazeera.
“But they can’t buy the urban population any more because we have already woken up,” she said.
The return of the political dynasties as power brokers reflects the systemic poverty still found in many parts of rural Thailand, analysts say.
The northeast, north and south lean towards political dynasties and populist promises in nearly all Thai elections, they say.
“The country is fundamentally split by resource allocation,” said Chulalongkorn University’s Khemthong.
“A younger generation has managed to break free from these patronage networks,” Khemthong said, referring to urban voters who form the People’s Party support base in Bangkok and elsewhere.
“They have the luxury of dissent because they have exited the system that still binds those left behind,” he added.

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. The United States cannot afford to be a member of an unbalanced alliance where it bears the majority of costs, US Permanent Representative to NATO Matthew Whitaker told the Munich Security Conference.
"We can't have an unequal Alliance where the United States bears the burden. We can't have an unequal Alliance within Europe where certain European countries do a lot more than others. We need everybody to equalize and get stronger together," he said.
At the same time, he expressed hope that the additional defense expenditures, which European allies had to undertake under the US pressure, have made the alliance stronger.
"NATO is stronger right now than certainly it has been in the last five years. And it's probably stronger than it has been since the end of the Cold War," Whitaker added.

IDF chief in Rafah: 'Ready to shift to offensive, not giving up on Gaza demilitarization'

After a week of clashes in southern Gaza, the IDF chief of staff visited Rafah and delivered a message, speaking with a female soldier, against the backdrop of the coalition’s effort to pass the exemption bill. “We are not giving up on the war’s objective — the complete demilitarization of the Gaza Strip and the disarmament of Hamas,” Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir said during a situation assessment and field tour he conducted Friday in Rafah.
Zamir toured the area following the clashes over the past week and instructed forces to deepen clearing operations, with an emphasis on targeting underground infrastructure. He was accompanied by Southern Command chief, Gaza Division commander Brig., the commanders of the 188th Armored Brigade, the 7th Armored Brigade, the Paratroopers Brigade and the Southern Brigade, as well as the commander of the elite Yahalom combat engineering unit and other officers.
“During the war, we achieved an unprecedented accomplishment — all of Hamas’ frontline battalions were destroyed. Hamas was militarily defeated and all the hostages returned home,” Zamir said. “The IDF is deployed along a security boundary, the Yellow Line, controlling the entrances to the Strip and systematically clearing the area of terrorist infrastructure. We are prepared to shift from defense to offense. For every violation, we will respond and strip away capabilities. We have recently eliminated many terrorists, including senior members of terror organizations.”
“We are acting in accordance with the directives of the political leadership, while holding military plans for decisive action and prepared to operate offensively as required. We will continue to strengthen the defense of communities in the western Negev,” a region of southern Israel bordering Gaza. “The achievements across all combat arenas are the result of courageous fighting and the bravery of IDF soldiers over the past two years. You, the fighters and commanders, deserve the highest appreciation.”
Zamir stressed that “there is no immunity for terrorism. What is true for Gaza is also true for the other arenas. We will remain focused and cut down threats with determination and offensive action.”
He also noted the establishment of the 38th Division, the first new maneuvering division formed by the IDF since 1956. “It will enhance the IDF’s operational capabilities and ground strength. The war has demonstrated the importance of divisions as the driving force of the IDF’s war machine and as a vital component in achieving a decision and victory in a prolonged, multi-front campaign,” he said.
IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin also attended the tour in the Yellow Line area and said: “We are continuing determined operations to thwart emerging threats and cut down terrorism in Gaza and in all nearby and distant arenas. I want to emphasize again — we are monitoring developments across the Middle East and are well prepared in all arenas. Home Front Command guidelines remain unchanged. If there is any change, we will update accordingly.”

‘There’ll be nothing left of the Liberal Party’: Inside the downfall of Sussan Ley

‘There’ll be nothing left of the Liberal Party’: Inside the downfall of Sussan Ley
By the time Sussan Ley rose to the dispatch box for one final question time on Thursday, her political fate was sealed.
She had less than 24 hours remaining as leader of the Liberal Party, but it did not show. The composure held. The smile remained fixed.
But the faces behind her told the story: colleagues who had concluded the greater risk lay not in change, but in standing still. The argument that had ultimately toppled her was neither ideological purity nor factional revenge. It was survival.
James Paterson, a key player behind Angus Taylor’s accession, had earlier given it blunt expression that, under Ley, the party had lost about 200,000 voters every month since last May’s worst-ever election result.
“It’s more than 50,000 votes a week. It’s more than 7000 votes a day. This cannot go on,” the Victorian senator said, announcing he was joining Taylor and resigning from the shadow cabinet. “If it goes on, there’ll be nothing left of the Liberal Party by the next election.”
That arithmetic – repeated in corridors and offices – reframed the contest. If the trajectory continued, MPs warned privately, no seat would be safe: not marginals in outer suburbs, not regional Queensland strongholds, no chance of regaining once-blue ribbon electorates eroded by teal independents. The fear was no longer of losing more seats; it was of mass extinction.
The scale of the revolt became clear internally at 10.30am on Thursday, when James McGrath, a member of Ley’s shadow cabinet and leadership group, wandered into her Parliament House office.
Accounts of that short conversation are disputed, but his message to Ley was ultimately clear. Her leadership was doomed. McGrath would hold off on making his resignation public until 3.30pm, after the end of question time.
“While I realise this news won’t please everyone, it is important that Australia has a strong and effective opposition,” he said. “I have made this decision as I believe it is in the best interest of Queensland, Australia and the Liberal National Party.”
McGrath has a reputation for sniffing the breeze. In 2015, he was a central player in the move to kill off Tony Abbott’s prime ministership. He then moved on Malcolm Turnbull three years later when his leadership was in peril.
A key supporter last May, McGrath was rewarded with a role in Ley’s inner circle. Allies now paint it as a major betrayal, but others say McGrath’s move should not have blindsided Ley. In recent weeks, they say, the Queensland senator had sharpened his interventions, pressing colleagues about electoral losses and questioning whether the leadership could arrest the slide reflected in polling.
Facing a looming preselection battle within the LNP, he was acutely aware of conservative grassroots anxiety and the rise of One Nation.
“The McGrath switch was a big deal,” says one MP, aligned to the party’s moderate faction. “When he deserted Sussan, it gave an impression to others on the fence that this thing was over. People wanted to back a winner.”
The numbers men in both camps slowly shifted names from one list to another. Ley supporters from May were moved into Taylor’s column, among them Western Australia’s Dean Smith, South Australian Tom Venning, Queenslander Leon Rebello, Victorian Zoe McKenzie, and Tasmanian Wendy Askew.
But the collapse had deeper roots.
For much of her two decades in parliament, Ley had been a steady if largely nondescript presence; a competent minister across portfolios including health and environment, but rarely a dominant personality shaping the national argument. What she was not was a political insurgent capable of redefining a party in crisis.
The chaos had spread dramatically lately after Nationals leader David Littleproud detonated the Coalition arrangement when Ley attempted to discipline three Nationals senators who had crossed the shadow cabinet’s position on hate speech laws.
Littleproud’s declaration that he could not serve under her leadership – later reversed – left her authority exposed. The attempted reconciliation, staged at a joint press conference, convinced few that unity had been restored. In parliament, Labor MPs revelled in the spectacle of an opposition fighting itself.
Ley had tried to recalibrate many times along the way. She toughened rhetoric on immigration, linking migration to housing affordability. Likewise, she dumped the Coalition’s net zero policy to placate conservatives. But the shifts failed to cut through.
Close allies argue that right-wingers in the party room were never comfortable with a woman leader, especially one who made clear in her first press club speech that she wanted to ditch the types of culture wars increasingly animating conservative voters.
One ally said: “If we got every decision right, every hour of every day, this party room never would have allowed her to succeed.”
Ley herself hinted as much on Friday when she resigned.
“It is important that the new leader gets clear air, something that is not always afforded to leaders, but which in the present moment is more important than ever,” she said.
Another moderate MP says Ley was an introvert who took advice from a small group of figures, including NSW numbers man Alex Hawke, trusted staff and, occasionally, moderate faction figures such as Anne Ruston and Maria Kovacic. On the whole, though, even MPs who believed in the Ley project were often perplexed by her tactics, and felt cut out.
Shrill attacks on the prime minister’s fashion sense, on Penny Wong’s emotional state and demands to recall parliament early to vote on hate speech legislation left the Coalition wedged and many questioning her judgment.
“She didn’t talk to people. It was really quite bizarre. No leader ever has had so few MPs who would really fight for her,” the same MP said.
A deeper dispute was about identity. Should the Liberals attempt to win back moderate, teal-held inner-city seats? Or pivot harder towards cultural conservatism and economic nationalism to reclaim voters drifting to One Nation?
“It was never going to be easy to lead the party after its worst-ever defeat,” Abbott, who elevated Ley to cabinet in 2014, said on Friday, adding that she had shown strong character and dignity, often under great pressure.
“As John Howard once said, politics is a hard and unforgiving business, but it’s the highest and noblest form of public service.”
Ongoing tensions came to a head about 10 days after the first damning Newspoll of the year, published in The Australian, which showed the Coalition behind One Nation on the primary vote for the first time.
In Melbourne, on the morning of former Liberal MP Katie Allen’s memorial service on January 29, senior figures gathered.
Ley had emerged from what supporters considered her strongest stretch – internal critics quiet over summer as she led attacks on Anthony Albanese over the Bondi massacre. Then the poll landed.
At the suburban home of a party figure, Taylor expressed strongly that he was intent on running. Fellow leadership aspirant Andrew Hastie was less conclusive, according to sources in the room. Hastie’s key supporters there – senators Jonno Duniam and Matt O’Sullivan – had urged him to nominate but acknowledged he would have time on his side if he stepped back.
Taylor told Hastie that a challenge could only succeed with his support. Paterson advised Hastie that he did not have the numbers and would be better served by waiting. Former PM Abbott was also strongly lobbying internally for Taylor.
Hastie, in the end, determined he should withdraw and give Taylor a clear run, avoiding a damaging split among those on the right of the party that would further diminish the party.
But even then, there was no fixed timetable. Those involved were open to waiting weeks or months. But secrecy collapsed after photojournalist Liam Mendes, of The Australian, unexpectedly exposed the talks. Once it became clear that Paterson and Duniam – senior members of the shadow ministry – were discussing Ley’s leadership, pressure intensified for movement.
Those images had infuriated many MPs, who likened them to a meeting of mafia bosses, labelling the meeting “grotesque”, “student politics” and “amateur hour”. Some even thought they might even buy more time for Ley.
But the next Newspoll would become pivotal. On Sunday night, it showed One Nation up five points to 27 per cent and the Coalition down three percentage points at 18 per cent.
Taylor did not move immediately. He delayed declaring until late Wednesday, prompting internal jokes about a “TACO spill” – a reference to the “Trump Always Chickens Out” insults circulating in US politics. The hesitation reflected his concern that Ley might call a snap spill the moment he declared, catching him before every commitment was secured.
In recent weeks, McGrath, Ruston, Hawke and leading moderate figure Andrew Bragg had all attempted to convince right-wing MPs to give Ley a few more months. The need to give her a budget reply speech became a narrative.
In these whispered talks, Ley’s supporters suggested they could convince Ley to stand down sometime after the May budget if she was unable to lift the party’s standing in the polls.
But the overtures went nowhere. Members of the conservative grouping felt the case for change was too urgent to wait. Hawke’s suggestions were not believed by his right-wing enemies.
When Taylor eventually walked to Ley’s office just after 7pm on Wednesday, he found the door locked. Security guards were closing up for the night. Ley and her senior staff were minutes from leaving for an evening engagement.
The pair spoke in her suite for just three minutes before Taylor left and publicly announced he would quit the frontbench. The next morning, he moved. NSW senator Jess Collins and Queensland MP Phil Thompson wrote to the whip the next day, demanding a party room meeting.
Shadow treasurer under Peter Dutton’s leadership, Taylor had narrowly lost the previous leadership ballot, 29-25, and waited as defence spokesman while polls weakened Ley’s standing. Events had forced him to launch earlier than he had planned.
“I am running to be the leader of the Liberal Party because I believe that Australia is worth fighting for,” he said in a slick Instagram video.
On Friday morning, the party room met. Ley lost 34 votes to 17. Taylor had the leadership.
The margin was emphatic. It formalised what had been obvious in the corridors days earlier.
“What we’ve been through over the last 10 or 11 months has been incredibly difficult,” said Victorian MP Dan Tehan, who withdrew his support for Ley and ran unsuccessfully for deputy, on Friday.
“The feedback I was getting was that things did need to change and there was no criticism against Sussan and what she’s done.”
The symbolism will linger. The Liberals have removed their first female leader after 276 days. But for MPs staring at polling that suggested erosion on multiple fronts – to Labor, to the teals, to One Nation – symbolism proved secondary.
“We’re at a critical juncture right now. Sussan Ley has been a diligent, hard-working servant to our party and to the country, but unfortunately, we’re simply not cutting through now,” Senator Jane Hume, who won a ballot for deputy leader, told reporters.
Taylor’s win on Friday morning was decisive and hands him a mandate larger than many predicted. However, the party room remains fractured, and the coup has left scars.
A supporter of Ley suggests that Taylor has little time to prove his mettle and begin reviving the Liberal Party’s fortunes in the polls – rather than just getting a short sugar hit from the change of leader – or supporters of his conservative rival, Hastie, will come knocking.
“He will need to hit the ground running,” said the MP, who asked not to be named so they could speak freely.
“I think he has six months. Angus’ first gift to the party could be handing Farrer [Ley’s seat] to an independent at a byelection.”
Taylor inherits the numbers and the warning: 50,000 voters a week; 7000 a day.
The arithmetic that felled his predecessor will not spare him if it continues.

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations
The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the United States and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Friday the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Trump, speaking to US troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had "been difficult to make a deal" with Iran.
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of," Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: "President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran."
"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security," Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June's "Midnight Hammer" operation was essentially a one-off US attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and the crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would "be very traumatic, very traumatic."
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, "it must include the elements that are vital to Israel."
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

PM calls for 'full explanation' after Muslim prayer disrupted by police at Sydney protest

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says NSW Police should provide a "full explanation" after officers dragged away Muslim worshippers praying at a Sydney protest opposing the visit of Israeli President Isaac Herzog.
Speaking on The Sydney Morning Herald's Inside Politics podcast, Albanese said he was concerned by the incident outside Sydney's Town Hall on Monday evening.
"I'm concerned at the great deal of hurt which the Muslim community are feeling about the disruption of prayers," he said.
"I think that is something that needs a full explanation. I know that that has caused a great deal of distress."
More than 100 Muslim organisations issued a joint statement condemning the incident as "completely unacceptable" and calling for a public apology and an investigation after footage emerged showing officers pulling several men from the ground as they prayed.
NSW Police commissioner Mal Lanyon said he had privately apologised to Muslim community leaders for any offence caused.
However, NSW Premier Chris Minns has refused to apologise, defending the actions of the police and saying he didn't support an independent inquiry.
On Friday, the NSW police watchdog, the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission, said it was investigating the conduct of officers at the rally, including "incidents of alleged misconduct".
NSW Police also revealed said a senior officer had told others to wait for the prayer to be completed before moving the group on, but the order was not followed.
"The senior officer was attempting to relay that message to other officers who were carrying out a move-on direction during what was a noisy, dynamic and fast-moving situation," police said in a statement to SBS News.
PM defends Herzog invitation
Asked whether Herzog's visit — which was on invitation by the federal government — had failed to advance social cohesion, Albanese said the Israeli president's trip was about supporting the Jewish community following the Bondi Beach terror attack.
"People can have criticism of the actions of the Netanyahu government and [they] are entitled to express that," he said.
Albanese said the majority of pro-Palestinian demonstrators wanted to peacefully express their views.
But he was critical of organisers of the Sydney rally, noting they had refused to relocate the demonstration to Hyde Park, as suggested by NSW Police.
"They chose not to come up with or participate in a sensible way that would have ensured separation by having the meeting in Hyde Park and then walking, marching, to Belmore Park," he said.
"It is beyond my comprehension why that would not be taken up, that suggestion by the New South Wales Police."
Josh Lees, of Palestine Action Group, earlier this week said the rally would not be "shunted off to some park out of sight and out of mind".
The prime minister said his electorate office in Marrickville, in Sydney's inner-west, had been targeted by some protesters with stink bombs, graffiti and broken windows, which did nothing to advance the Palestinian cause.
He also reiterated his government's support for a two-state solution.
"There are two paths in the Middle East," he said.
"One is a passive path of peace and reconciliation, and a settlement which gives Palestinian justice but also recognises the right of Israel to exist within secure borders, to have security assured [and] its right to defend itself."
He said the other path was the "status quo", which had existed for decades and left Palestinians oppressed and without self-determination.

All Eyes On Rubio: Munich Braces For Transatlantic Reality Check
Unknown

09:29:35 KST

MUNICH -- The first day of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) ended late on February 13 with the world’s foreign-policy elite left in a state of suspended animation.
After a day defined by pointed rhetoric and “wrecking ball” warnings from European leaders, the focus has shifted entirely to the man set to deliver Washington’s answer: Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
As the “Davos of Defense” concludes its opening sessions, the spotlight has fixed squarely on Rubio, who arrived tasked with articulating how US President Donald Trump’s “America First” doctrine will interface with a jittery global order.
In the ornate corridors of the Bayerischer Hof and during a series of frantic "pull-aside" meetings on the sidelines, a singular question dominated the day's discourse: Will Rubio’s keynote address -- scheduled for the morning of February 14 -- serve as a stabilizer for the transatlantic project, or will it further expose the widening fissures between Washington and its oldest allies?
A Moment Of Reckoning
Established in 1963 as a forum to coordinate Western strategy against the Soviet Union, the Munich gathering now faces a different strategic test: whether Washington and its European allies can adjust the terms of their partnership without allowing it to fracture.
Several European officials told RFE/RL late on February 13 that this year’s meeting represents a pivotal moment for the transatlantic alliance.
One scenario discussed in the hallways would see NATO recalibrated around a more capable European pillar -- a Europe better able to provide for its own defense while maintaining a steadier, more-balanced partnership with the United States.
The alternative, which weighed heavily on the first day's atmosphere, is a continuation of transatlantic disputes over shared values, national priorities, and burden-sharing -- tensions that, left unresolved, could harden into lasting estrangement.
Senior Western officials who spoke privately as the sun set on the forum’s first day said the concern is shifting from headline-grabbing rhetoric to a gradual weakening of cohesion.
The greatest risk, they cautioned, is not an open rupture but another round of forceful declarations unaccompanied by concrete steps -- deepening uncertainty about US reliability and Europe’s willingness to act.
Rubio’s Balancing Act
Rubio has described his trip as taking place at a defining moment and the dawn of a “new era” in geopolitics. Before departing for Germany, he offered reassurance about the depth of US-European ties.
“We’re very tightly linked together with Europe,” he told reporters. “Most people in this country can trace both, either their cultural or their personal heritage, back to Europe.”
But he also signaled change: “We live in a new era in geopolitics, and it’s going to require all of us to reexamine what that looks like.”
Early impressions from the first day in Munich show Trump’s allies defending the administration’s “America First” approach, even as Rubio spent his arrival working to reassure skeptical Europeans that the United States is acting in their interest as well.
His schedule on February 13 reflected that dual track.
Rubio began with an hour-long meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, underscoring that Europe’s security debate cannot be divorced from broader US-China competition.
He then spent significant time with Germany’s leader, Friedrich Merz, the host country’s representative. Merz acknowledged that Europe’s “excessive dependency” on the United States was its own doing but insisted the answer is not to abandon NATO.
During a brief photo-op between the two leaders, RFE/RL asked Rubio directly whether the United States remained committed to European security. In a moment that underscored the day's prevailing uncertainty, neither Rubio nor Merz took the opportunity to respond, leaving the question hanging in the air as they were ushered away.
Rubio also met Moldovan President Maia Sandu, held a pull-aside meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, and spoke with Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski -- key voices from NATO’s eastern flank.
Notably, while Rubio has been active in Munich, he was absent from a key NATO ministerial last December, and US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also did not attend the corresponding meeting earlier this week.
“But he [Hegseth] is here in Munich,” one European official said, adding that Russia’s war against Ukraine would be addressed in “all possible formats.”
On February 14, following his speech, Rubio is expected to huddle with G7 allies and meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Deep Concern -- And Hard Truths
Veteran US diplomat John Herbst, now a senior director at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, told RFE/RL on February 13 that European leaders’ anxiety was palpable.
“What we heard today was deep concern from European leaders about the state of transatlantic relations,” Herbst said.
Since the end of World War II, he noted, global security and prosperity have largely been based on the NATO alliance and the partnership between the United States and key European allies.
Tensions over the past year have strained that foundation. European leaders recognize this is not good for their security or prosperity, Herbst said -- and, in his view, it is not good for American security or prosperity either.
He argued that Rubio has long understood the importance of NATO and strong US-European relations and expects his speech and interactions to reflect that. At the same time, Herbst noted, Rubio is a loyal secretary to Trump, and some themes from the administration -- even those not always welcome in Europe -- will likely feature in his remarks.
On Europe’s role, Herbst said Washington has been urging greater European defense efforts for decades. Europe is now moving in that direction, but he cautioned against shifting the overwhelming burden of ensuring European security entirely onto Europe.
Close cooperation between Washington and Europe remains essential, he argued, even as Europe must increase defense spending, expand arms production, and strengthen troop sustainment.
Looking ahead to Rubio’s meeting with Zelenskyy and his messaging on NATO’s eastern flank, Herbst said he expects Rubio to follow the policy lines evolving within the Trump administration.
But he added that he would hope -- and expect -- the secretary to underscore that when Europe needs the United States, it will be there, provided Europe fulfills its commitments.
The Question Of Consistency
For Tyson Barker, a former US deputy special envoy for Ukraine’s economic recovery and now with the German Council on Foreign Relations, the central issue is consistency.
Speaking to RFE/RL hours before Rubio’s speech, Barker said the tone currently coming from Washington -- including signals about tapered troop withdrawals, continued commitment to nuclear deterrence, and a rebalancing of conventional forces -- is constructive.
But it must be sustained. “It’s not enough for the Trump administration to say this once and have a different message in two weeks,” Barker said. The message must remain consistent from the highest levels, including the president, over the medium and long term, he said.
Right now, he argued, the concern is less about a single headline and more about the trend line -- which has appeared erratic. A reassuring speech in Munich could be undercut by destabilizing signals weeks earlier or weeks later.
As the first day concludes, NATO's Rutte pointed to a “shift in mindset,” with Europe taking more care of its own defense. Meanwhile, US Ambassador to the UN Mike Waltz told the conference that the status quo was no longer sustainable.
The broader European debate -- championed by leaders like French President Emmanuel Macron -- envisions a more integrated Europe.
But “strategic autonomy” demands politically fraught trade-offs. Building a stronger European pillar will take more than three days in Munich, most agree.
For now, all eyes are on Rubio’s podium on the morning of February 14.

Australia and EU on the cusp of signing landmark free trade agreement

In short:
Australia is close to forming a new free trade agreement with the EU.
Farmers in Australia and the EU have warned that the agreement exposes them to intensified competition in fragile markets.
What's next?
EU President Ursula von der Leyen is widely expected to travel to Australia to sign the free trade deal.
Australia and the European Union (EU) are on the cusp of finally reaching a free trade agreement after years of sometimes fraught negotiations, with both sides increasingly optimistic that Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and EU President Ursula von de Leyen will be able to sign a deal within weeks.
Talks have long been stalled after collapsing spectacularly in 2023, and Trade Minister Don Farrell has been adamant Australia will not sign a deal unless the EU agrees to tear down tariff barriers to larger quantities of agricultural exports such as beef and lamb.
Both sides have also been negotiating over working rights and labour mobility, Australia's luxury car tax, and the use of geographical indicators that could stop Australian producers using labels such as "fetta" and "prosecco".
Earlier this week Senator Farrell flew to Brussels for talks with EU Trade Commissioner Maroš Šefčovič and Agriculture Commissioner Christophe Hansen, as both sides try to break the deadlock and strike a blow for free trade in the face of global economic fragmentation and the Trump administration's tariff assault.
Sources from the EU and Australia said the deal was now close.
Mr Albanese and Ms von de Leyen now have to resolve one outstanding issue — believed to be connected to red meat exports — before the deal can officially be signed.
In a joint statement, Senator Farrell and the EU commissioners said the talks were "constructive and positive" and "allowed the two sides to converge positions on a range of issues".
"Good progress was achieved in narrowing gaps on a small number of outstanding matters," the statement said, adding they would take the offer to Mr Albanese and Ms von der Leyen respectively for sign off.
EU nations are collectively already Australia's third-biggest trading partner, and the deal could help further open the 450 million-strong market to Australian producers, delivering a major win to the federal government and, potentially, a significant boost to GDP.
It would also help reinforce the strategic relationship with Australia and the EU — which are already close to finalising a separate security partnership — in the face of global turmoil.
Agriculture access a sticking point
But farmers' groups in Australia have been fiercely critical of Europe's generous agricultural subsidies, and have urged the federal government to reject any deal that does not provide "significantly increased access" for Australian agricultural exports.
The European Union and member states are also likely to face political pressure from European farmers, with one prominent lobbying group warning earlier this week that the pact should not "expose EU farmers to intensified competition in already fragile markets".
Senator Farrell said he was confident both sides would "reach agreement that benefits both of our economies".
"As I've said repeatedly, any agreement must be in Australia's national interest and provide real benefit for Australian business, producers, exporters and workers,"he said.
Ms von der Leyen is widely expected to travel to Australia to sign the free trade deal and the security partnership, but it is not yet clear exactly when she will make the trip.

PALM BEACH, Florida, Feb 13 - Two sets of diplomatic negotiations, on Ukraine and Iran, are set to take place in Geneva on Tuesday, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday.
A U.S. delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, the source said. Representatives from Oman will be on hand and mediate the U.S.-Iran contacts, the source said.
Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
President Donald Trump is pressuring the Iranian government in the wake of its violent crackdown on protesters and has amassed a large U.S. naval presence in the region.
He is also trying to coax Ukraine and Russia into an agreement to end Moscow's four-year-old invasion of Ukraine. REUTERS

Eyeing midterms, Trump threatens to bypass Congress with executive order on election reforms

US President Donald Trump has threatened to bypass Congress and impose new nationwide voting rules ahead of November's midterm elections, signalling he could act unilaterally if lawmakers fail to pass election reforms.
In a post on his Truth Social platform on Friday, Trump said he would issue an executive order requiring photo identification to vote and introducing other nationwide measures if Congress does not approve the changes.
"There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" Trump wrote.
"If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order," he added.
Any such move would likely face immediate legal challenges and could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court.
The Trump-backed "SAVE America" election reform act passed the Republican-controlled House of Representatives this week.
Potential failure
However, it is widely expected to fail in the Senate, where Republicans hold only a narrow majority and would require Democratic support to advance the legislation.
In addition to requiring a photo ID to cast a ballot, the bill would also require proof of citizenship to register to vote.
Critics say that the bill's measures would push millions of people away from casting ballots, because they don't have a passport or a paper copy of their birth certificate.
An analysis by the Brennan Center found more than 21 million Americans lack easy access to such documents.
This would "disenfranchise Americans of all ages," the center found — especially young people and ethnic minorities.
While many US jurisdictions already mandate photo ID, others do not.
Trump and several Republican allies have argued that areas without strict ID requirements are vulnerable to voter fraud.
Under the US Constitution, states retain broad authority over the administration of elections, and it remains unclear how the White House could legally impose a national voter ID mandate.
Opinion polls suggest Republicans risk losing their narrow control of Congress in November.
Democrats have indicated that, if they regain the majority, they would block Trump's legislative agenda and could pursue impeachment proceedings.

Air Assault Forces cadets must repeat course if they miss over 30% of training – Commander

Air Assault Forces cadets must repeat course if they miss over 30% of training – Commander
This was stated in an interview with Ukrinform by Lt. Col. Viktor Moroz, commander of a training battalion at the 199th Training Center of the Air Assault Forces.
“If a person misses more than 30% of the training, for example, due to medical treatment or family leave, they are assigned to repeat the course. A cadet cannot leave the training center without completing live-fire drills and all required exercises. Nearly 1,000 rounds are now allocated for the shooting course, so we give cadets the opportunity to fire as much as needed to acquire the necessary skills,” Moroz said.
According to him, there are many cases when brigade combat training officers and battalion commanders call the training center saying a soldier claims they were not properly trained there. Moroz noted that this is a typical reaction driven by fear or a deliberate attempt to mislead commanders – behavior that often begins during training.
“A cadet who did not want to defend the country continues that attitude after joining a brigade. If we managed to retain them for the brigade and they did not abandon service, they then try by any means to avoid combat missions. We have various safeguards in place to independently monitor a cadet’s level of training. This includes full records of completed exercises and mandatory attendance tracking for every discipline,” the lieutenant colonel said.
He added that all documentation is transferred to brigades in both electronic and paper form, making it possible to review training records even if the soldier completed training a year earlier.
Moroz also emphasized that newly arrived soldiers are given at least two weeks for unit coordination, regardless of the direction or specialization of the brigade. This period includes familiarization with unit-specific weapons systems, operational realities related to terrain, and other factors. If additional skills are needed during this time, new arrivals receive further training from brigade instructor teams, which also operate at a very high level.
As previously reported by Ukrinform, nearly 45% of service members are satisfied with their experience of basic combined-arms training, while another 30% report partial satisfaction.

Times Square billboard targets PA 'pay-for-slay' policy

Times Square in New York City unveiled a new billboard on Friday that highlighted the Palestinian Authority's 'pay-for-slay' policy.
The billboard, created in collaboration with the Foreign Affairs Ministry, features a photo of Mahmoud Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). The message read: "Palestinian Authority still pays for killing Jews - END PAY FOR SLAY."
This is not the first time Times Square has served as a prominent stage for the Israel-Palestine regional conflict and the Israel-Gaza war.
Times Square campaigns
In December, a billboard sponsored by the American Arab Discrimination Committee displayed the Christmas-themed message: “Jesus is Palestinian.”
Efforts to raise awareness about Israeli captives were also showcased at the New York landmark. The Israeli government purchased a billboard in Times Square to feature a video released by Hamas showing Israeli hostage Evyatar David, along with the message: “Hamas is starving the Israeli hostages - Ignored by the media, too busy echoing Hamas propaganda.”
The inclusion of the Palestinian Authority's 'pay-for-slay' policy (also known as the ‘Martyrs’ Fund’) in the Times Square campaign comes into focus as President Mahmoud Abbas ordered the publication of a draft constitution for a Palestinian state earlier this week.
Formalizing ''pay-for-slay''
The drafted constitution notably omits any mention of Jewish ties to Jerusalem, refers to greater Palestine as "part of the Arab homeland," and appears to formalize the continuation of the Palestinian Authority's controversial "'pay-for-slay'" policy, which provides financial stipends to families of convicted terrorists and terror suspects.
Article XXIV of the draft outlines the Palestinian state's commitment to "provide protection and care for the families of martyrs, the wounded, prisoners, and those released from occupation prisons, as well as victims of genocide."
It further states that Palestinian leadership will ensure "comprehensive care for the families of martyrs, the wounded, prisoners, and those released [from prison], in order to preserve their national dignity and meet their humanitarian and living needs."
This formalization of the 'pay-for-slay' policy comes after multiple attempts by the PA to deny its continued effect, following its reported cancellation in February 2025 when PA President Abbas signed a decree to end it.
Michael Starr, James Gunn, and Jerusalem Post staff contributed to this report.

MUNICH, February 14. /TASS/. During the Munich Security Conference, Europeans made it clear that the European Union will help the Kiev government for as long as it can, German political scientist Alexander Rahr wrote on Telegram.
In his post, the expert noted that French President Emmanuel Macron made emphases that differed from those of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. "He [Macron] sees reasons for Europe to negotiate with Russia on Ukraine’s future," Rahr said. "But the general message of the conference is clear: Europe will continue fighting on Ukraine’s side for as long as it can."
Commenting on Merz’s speech, the expert described it as "provocative," adding that in his opinion, the German chancellor wants Germany to play the leading role in Europe and to start rapid militarization of the European Union.
"For Merz, it makes no sense to negotiate with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin," Rahr wrote.
Therefore, in his opinion, Germany "once and for all rejected its historical role of a mediator between the East and the West."

Arundhati Roy withdraws from Berlin Film Festival in protest over Gaza genocide remarks

Award-winning Indian writer Arundhati Roy has withdrawn from the Berlin Film Festival over jury president Wim Wenders's comments that cinema should "stay out of politics" when asked about Gaza.
Roy said in a statement on Friday that she was "shocked and disgusted" by responses from Wenders and other jury members to a question about the Palestinian territory at a press conference on Thursday.
Roy, whose novel "The God of Small Things" won the 1997 Booker Prize, had been announced as a festival guest to present a restored version of the 1989 film "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", in which she starred and wrote the screenplay.
However, she said that the "unconscionable" statements by Wenders and other jury members had led her to reconsider, "with deep regret".
When asked about Germany's support for Israel at a press conference on Thursday, Wenders said: "We cannot really enter the field of politics," describing filmmakers as "the counterweight to politics."
Fellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a "little bit unfair" to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.
Roy said in her statement that "to hear them say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping."
She described the situation in Gaza as "a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel".
"If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them," she said.
"It is a way of shutting down a conversation about a crime against humanity even as it unfolds before us in real time — when artists, writers and filmmakers should be doing everything in their power to stop it," she said.
Roy is one of India's most famous living authors and is a trenchant critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing government, as well as a firm supporter of the Palestinian cause.
Restored versions of two films by late Egyptian directors, "Sad Song of Touha" by Atteyat Al Abnoudy and "The Dislocation of Amber" by Hussein Shariffe, have also been withdrawn from the festival over its stance on Gaza.
"The Berlinale respects these decisions," a spokeswoman said in a statement sent to AFP.
"We regret that we will not welcome them as their presence would have enriched the festival discourse," she said.
Shying away from politics
The Berlinale traditionally has a reputation for topical, progressive programming, but so far this year's edition has seen several stars shy away from taking a stance on the big political issues of the day.
US actor Neil Patrick Harris, who stars in the film "Sunny Dancer" was asked on Friday if he considered his art to be political and if it could help "fight the rise of fascism".
He replied that he was "interested in doing things that are apolitical" and which could help people find connection in our "strangely algorithmic and divided world".
This year's Honorary Golden Bear recipient, Malaysian actor Michelle Yeoh, also demurred when asked to comment on US politics in a press conference on Friday, saying she "cannot presume to say I understand" the situation there.
This is not the first edition of the festival to run into controversy over Israeli genocidal war in Gaza.
In 2024, the festival's documentary award went to "No Other Land," which follows the dispossession of Palestinian communities in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
German government officials criticised "one-sided" remarks about Gaza by the directors of that film and others at that year's awards ceremony.
Israel’s genocide in Gaza has left at least 72,000 people dead in Gaza and wounded more than 171,400, according to conservative estimates by Palestinians.
Analysts suggest these figures may be an underestimation, with the total death toll possibly reaching around 200,000.

Some US schools cancel class pictures after online claims surrounding Epstein
Some school districts in the U.S. dropped plans for class pictures after widespread social media posts linked a billionaire with ties to Jeffrey Epstein to the photography giant Lifetouch

Some school districts in the U.S. dropped plans for class pictures after widespread social media posts linked a billionaire with ties to Jeffrey Epstein to the photography giant Lifetouch, which on Friday called the claims “completely false.”
The disruption to school picture plans in Texas and elsewhere began after online posts linked Lifetouch, which photographs millions of students each year, to the investment fund manager Apollo Global Management. Apollo's former CEO is billionaire investor Leon Black, who met regularly with Epstein and was advised by Epstein on financial matters.
Black led the company in 2019, when funds managed by Apollo bought Lifetouch's parent company, Shutterfly. The $2.7 billion deal closed in September 2019 — a month after Epstein's death by suicide behind bars as he awaited trial over allegations from federal prosecutors that he sexually abused and trafficked dozens of girls.
Both Lifetouch and Apollo noted that timeline in statements Friday, two days after Lifetouch CEO Ken Murphy said in an Instagram post that neither Black nor any of Apollo's directors or investors ever had any access to Lifetouch photos.
“No Lifetouch executives have ever had any relationship or contact with Epstein and we have never shared student images with any third party, including Apollo,” Lifetouch said in its statement Friday. “Apollo and its funds also have no role in Lifetouch’s daily operations and have no access to student images.”
The canceled school pictures are another ripple effect over the release of millions of files from the Epstein investigation, including documents showing Epstein's regular contacts with CEOs, journalists, scientists and prominent politicians long after a 2008 conviction on sex crimes charges.
In the small Texas town of Malakoff, the local school district canceled a student picture day after several parents told the district they weren't comfortable with Lifetouch photographing their children, spokesperson Katherine Smith said in a statement e-mailed Friday. Several other schools and districts in Texas also canceled or changed plans, as well as a charter school in Arizona, according to Facebook announcements posted by the schools.
“We decided our students and families would be best served by keeping all of our pictures in-house for the rest of this year, and we are looking at all of our options for the 2026-2027 school year,” Smith said.
Parents concerned about Lifetouch included MaKallie Gann, whose children attend schools in Howe, about 60 miles (97 kilometers) north of Dallas. She said she was worried about how much information Lifetouch collects on students.
“Whenever you order the pictures, it has their name. It has the age, of course. It has their grade, their teacher, the school that they’re in,” she said.
No evidence of Epstein or anyone in his orbit seeing Lifetouch photos has emerged from news organizations' review of thousands of documents released this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, though there are at least 1.7 million records.
The review shows Black's name appeared 8,200 times, though that figure likely includes some duplicate records. Black stepped down as Apollo's CEO in March 2021, saying he wanted to focus on his family, health, and "many other interests.”
That was two months after a committee of the company's board issued a report concluding that Epstein had advised Black personally on estate planning, tax issues, charitable giving and running his “family office,” but provided no services to Apollo or invested in no Apollo funds.
The report also said the review — which Black requested — found “no evidence” that he was involved with Epstein’s alleged criminal activities “in any way” or “at any time.” ___

Europe calls for reset in relations with US at security talks
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
MUNICH – European leaders called on Feb 13 for a reset in relations with the United States as they met at a top security conference where US President Donald Trump’s potshots at traditional transatlantic ties loomed large.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged “a new transatlantic partnership” and French President Emmanuel Macron called for “a strong Europe” as more than 60 leaders gathered for the annual Munich Security Conference.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meanwhile tell the conference on Feb 14 that Europe is “a sleeping giant” and must rely less on the United States for its defence, his office said in a preview of his remarks.
The 2026 conference comes at a time of strained ties between Europe and the United States, after Mr Trump threatened to take over Greenland, and criticised “decaying” and “weak” European nations.
Russia’s war against Ukraine, set to enter its fifth year in February, is high on the agenda, alongside efforts by European NATO members to raise their defence budgets, in line with Mr Trump’s demands, out of concern that Moscow could seek to expand into their territory.
European leaders at the gathering defended their security commitments and the NATO alliance, which Mr Trump’s rhetoric has rattled.
“Being a part of NATO is not only Europe’s competitive advantage. It’s also the United States’ competitive advantage. So let’s repair and revive transatlantic trust together,” Mr Merz said.
“In the era of great-power rivalry, even the United States will not be powerful enough to go it alone.”
‘Greater European autonomy’
The gathering comes a year after US Vice-President J.D. Vance used the conference’s stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking allies on the continent.
Mr Macron emphatically defended Europe in his speech, saying “everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us”.
Mr Starmer’s office said his speech would call for “a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who arrived on Feb 13, is also due to speak at the gathering on Feb 14, as is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, organisers said.
A German government source said Mr Merz and Mr Rubio had met at the conference and discussed “Ukraine, the status of negotiations with Russia and further support for the country, particularly in terms of military aid”.
They also discussed Iran and NATO, and “Rubio praised Germany’s steps to strengthen the alliance”, the source added.
Mr Rubio also met his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on the sidelines of the conference, at a time of heightened Washington-Beijing tensions.
Mr Rubio then held a 15-minute meeting with the prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland about the future sovereignty of the Arctic island. Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen called the talks “constructive”.
Ties plunged in January when Mr Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.
Ukraine discussions
Mr Merz, Mr Macron and the leaders of the European Union, Canada and NATO met with Mr Zelensky on Feb 13 for talks on Ukraine.
A US official said Mr Rubio did not attend those talks due to a packed schedule, but was “engaging on Russia-Ukraine in many of his meetings” in Munich.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said he discussed ending the Russian invasion with Mr Wang, whose country is a close partner of Moscow.
Mr Wang told Mr Sybiha that Beijing was “willing to provide Ukraine with new humanitarian aid”, according to a Chinese foreign ministry readout.
Mr Macron meanwhile said a new framework was needed to deal with “an aggressive Russia” once the fighting in Ukraine ends.
“If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk,” said Mr Merz. “But as you can see with the American side, Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously.”
Mr Zelensky, urged by Mr Trump to “get moving” on a deal to end the war, visited a drone factory near Munich with German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius before meeting with European leaders.
“It’s good to have (a) strong partnership with Americans... but I think that Europe... needs (an) independent defence industry, very strong,” he said.
NATO’s Secretary-General Mark Rutte said on the sidelines of the conference that Europe was “stepping up... taking more of a leadership role within NATO” and “taking more care of its own defence”.
“A strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever,” Mr Rutte said. AFP

Gary wasn't impressed by Australia's dumpling scene. Now he's selling thousands a day

At a small restaurant near Melbourne's Chinatown, dumpling-making is in full swing.
It's a special Lunar New Year event that's drawn almost 30 foodies from a range of backgrounds.
"This is the first time I have made dumplings," customer Gavin Rajahmoney said. His family migrated from Sri Lanka.
"I am studying Chinese language and my teacher invited me to this event," he said.
"I first made dumplings when I was in China, about 25 years ago," said Adam, who previously lived and worked in Hong Kong and drove 70km from home in Geelong to join the workshop.
Hand-rolling dumplings is an age-old skill in Asia, dating back thousands of years to the Han dynasty in China.
The pockets of pastry symbolise prosperity and are traditionally filled with vegetables or minced meat such as pork, ginger and spices.
"Normally we start off with the dumpling skin that'll be pre-prepared," customer Paul Hordijenko said.
"Then we roll it out and then get some of the filling, pop it into the middle, and then we have to squeeze it together to make a seal."
Dumpling restaurant owner Gary Zhao, 33, who came up with the idea of a make-your-own workshop several months ago, said the concept has taken off.
"The reality has shocked me. Many people from different cultures have come along and they are all very interested in this," he said.
"Also, the customers learn very fast to make the dumplings, even faster than I can imagine, and they really enjoy it."
Zhao grew up in China's Guangdong province, and his family — originally from northern China — routinely prepared dumplings for meals.
After migrating to Australia in 2016, Zhao felt disappointed by the local offering.
"I really love to eat dumplings and didn't find the ones I liked here, so I decided to start my own dumpling restaurant," he said.
Zhao opened Hoppy Dumpling in Melbourne's Russell Street in 2024 and will soon open a second venue in South Yarra.
Hoppy Dumpling's menu spans pan-fried dumplings, premium steamed xiao long bao, wontons, noodles and a range of fried dishes.
Dumplings are served cooked to order, and fresh or frozen for takeaway.
However, Zhao said the workshop offered fillings beyond traditional flavours, with five pre-prepared choices.
"One traditional filling is celery and pork. But other filling flavours are Korean-style spicy kimchi with pork. There's also a French-style chicken liver pâté, as well as chicken, cheese and corn," he said.
"I liked the chicken and corn, it tasted really good. It was like a burst of flavour in my mouth," customer Linisha Condisetti said.
To please the palates of a diverse range of customers, there is also a curry beef option.
"Curry beef I like but I also like all the others," Rajahmoney said.
While new flavours are well received, many still prefer traditional fillings — with pork and celery crowned most popular.
"Some customers do prefer original Chinese style dumplings," said Zhao.
"But Melbourne is a very diverse city with people from all over the world and we wanted to offer a fillings inspired by different cultures."
While the choice of filling may be to personal taste, there's one thing many agree on:
"The dumplings that you buy in a supermarket are just quick and convenient, with pretty standard taste," Hordijenko said.
"But the ones that you make by hand, they taste much fresher."
Hordijenko's family migrated from Ukraine, where dumplings called varenyky are also popular. They are crescent-shaped, boiled and made from unleavened dough.
"Ukrainian dumplings are normally quite a lot bigger and the skin is thicker and sticky. And then the traditional filling that you will get inside is normally a mix of potato and cheese," he said.
Hordijenko said he discovered more about the history of Lunar New Year celebrations during the workshop.
"Today I learned that in China, people normally put a coin inside the filling for good luck, for prosperity."
Good fortune has certainly arrived for Zhao, who said sales have soared since he introduced the first DIY dumpling event.
"Previously, we sold about 1,000 dumplings a day. But after launching this event, now we average 2,400–2,500 dumplings a day," he said.
"Business is getting better and better so we also plan more make-your-own dumpling events, and also hope to open even more branches."
For many customers, making dumplings together helps to bring the family closer.
"It is a really nice activity for family bonding and a really great way to learn the art of making traditional dumplings," Condisetti said.
Zhao can only agree.
"Gathering to make dumplings and eat dumplings — no matter the holiday and even if people are busy across the country — sharing dumplings does unite families," he said.
"This is the food culture we really want to convey."

Lindsey Graham says Greenland ‘is behind us’ and ‘who gives a s***’ who owns the territory

Lindsey Graham says Greenland ‘is behind us’ and ‘who gives a s***’ who owns the territory
Trump’s aggressive push to gain control of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark, has been met with intense backlash from Europe
- Bookmark

Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, has said Greenland is “behind” the United States and asked, “Who gives a s***” who owns the Danish territory amid President Donald Trump’s efforts to acquire the mineral-rich Arctic island.
Trump’s aggressive push to gain control of Greenland has been met with intense backlash from Europe.
After threatening last month to impose a 10 percent tariff on several NATO allies, including Denmark, until a deal is reached for the “complete and total purchase of Greenland,” leaders from those European nations said they “stand in full solidarity” with Denmark.
They rebuked Trump’s tariff threats, saying such an ultimatum would “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”
Trump later pulled back on his tariff threats after a “very productive meeting” with the head of NATO, Mark Rutte, where they “formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland.”
When asked by Politico what he’d say to his “friends from Europe” who are “nervous” about the controversy over Greenland, Graham joked, “If you’re nervous, have a beer, go see a doctor.”
“Greenland is behind us, but the goal is to get outcomes. Who gives a s*** who owns Greenland? I don’t,” Graham said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday.
“Greenland is gonna be more fortified because Donald Trump…is gonna go big,” Graham said, adding that Trump has “got skin in the game.”
Trump claims his push for Greenland is rooted in “national security” concerns, warning that the semi-autonomous territory is threatened by Russia and China.
The U.S. currently has one military base in Greenland. The Pituffik Space Base “supports Missile Warning, Missile Defense and Space Surveillance missions,” according to the U.S. Space Force.
Trump mentioned the ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Europe over Greenland Friday.
“Greenland’s gonna want us, but we get along very well with Europe. We’ll see how it all works out. We’re negotiating right now for Greenland,” the president told reporters outside the White House.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York reassured Europe that the “vast majority of the American people do not want to see these relationships frayed.”
The Democrat said during a discussion at the Munich Security Conference Friday that her party is “shocked at the president's destruction of our relationship with our European allies. His threatening over Greenland is not a joke. It is not funny. It threatens the very trust that allows peace to persist.”

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations

The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the ongoing diplomacy between the United States and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran's nuclear program, after Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Friday that the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops, fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers, and other firepower capable of conducting attacks and defending against them.
Trump, speaking to US troops on Friday at a base in North Carolina, said it had "been difficult to make a deal" with Iran.
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of," Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: "President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran."
"He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security," Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, June's "Midnight Hammer" operation was essentially a one-off US attack, with stealth bombers flying from the United States to strike Iranian nuclear facilities. Iran staged a very limited retaliatory strike on a US base in Qatar.
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the United States fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Thursday, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would "be very traumatic, very traumatic."
Iran's Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Trump for talks in Washington on Wednesday, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, "it must include the elements that are vital to Israel."
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

One-month deadline? Trump weighs military options as new threat looms over Iran

Iran has begun observing 40 days of mourning for those killed in the massacre, as U.S. President Donald Trump said the deadline for talks with Tehran is “within the next month” — and a possible reason for that timetable may now be emerging. According to an assessment cited by the Daily Mail, the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford, which the United States has decided to deploy to the Middle East along with its strike group, will take up to four weeks to reach the region from its current position in the Caribbean.
Speaking outside the White House on Friday evening, Trump was asked why he had ordered the Ford’s deployment. "If we need it, we’ll have it ready,” he replied. The president added that he believes the talks will succeed, "but if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran, very bad.”
The New York Times reported, citing U.S. officials, that the options Trump is considering include military action against Iran’s nuclear program and its ability to launch ballistic missiles. He is also weighing the possibility of sending U.S. commandos to strike specific military targets inside Iran.
A senior U.S. administration official told the Daily Mail that during a White House meeting between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump, Netanyahu urged the president to take a tougher line on Iran. “Netanyahu basically said, ‘Iran is playing games. You don’t want them to maneuver you.’ Trump listened,” the official said.
Inside Iran, anger continues to simmer over the regime’s sweeping crackdown on protests and the killings that followed. The outrage may intensify in the coming days as families begin marking the traditional 40-day mourning period for their loved ones.
Videos circulating online already show mourners gathering in several parts of the country, holding portraits of the dead. One video showed mourners at a cemetery in Razavi Khorasan province singing a patriotic song dating back to the 1940s, during the rule of Shah Reza Pahlavi. “O Iran, land full of treasures, your soil is full of art,” they sang. “May you live forever. O enemy, if you are granite — I am iron.”
According to the New York Times, at the outset of the anti-regime protests in late December, demonstrators received threatening text messages from authorities stating that their presence at “illegal gatherings” had been documented and that they were under “intelligence surveillance.” “It is recommended to refrain from participating in such gatherings, which the enemy desires,” the message said. Researchers concluded that the government likely tracked protesters using cellphone location data.
Organizations that have examined Iran’s capabilities say the regime possesses one of the most extensive surveillance systems known worldwide, including technology to monitor mobile devices, as well as facial recognition and other tracking methods. While these digital tools have received less attention than the sweeping internet shutdowns imposed during last month’s violent crackdown, Iranian accounts and a security official told the Times that as authorities gradually restore internet access, they have detained individuals suspected of participating in protests and subjected them to lengthy, aggressive interrogations based on facial recognition and phone data.
The USS Gerald R. Ford will join the USS Abraham Lincoln already in the Middle East, marking the first time since March 2025 that two U.S. aircraft carriers have operated in the region simultaneously. At that time, the USS Harry S. Truman and USS Carl Vinson were deployed during U.S. strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen.
The Ford previously deployed to the region at the outset of the war, in a move intended to deter Hezbollah following former President Joe Biden’s widely noted “Don’t” speech. U.S. officials at the time informed Israel of the deployment and stressed that sufficient forces were in place, with additional assets available if needed.
Named for the 38th president of the United States, the carrier carries more than 75 aircraft and is staffed by thousands of Navy personnel. Its defensive systems include missile launchers, Rolling Airframe Missiles, radar systems and Phalanx close-in weapon systems designed to intercept short-range threats, as well as 25 mm and .50-caliber machine guns to defend against small vessels.
In remarks that included sharp criticism of President Isaac Herzog, Trump reiterated that talks with Iran have a deadline of “the next month” or the consequences would be “very traumatic” for Tehran. “A deal with Iran will probably happen within the next month, something like that,” he said. “It shouldn’t take long — it should happen quickly. They need to agree very quickly.”
He noted that when Iran previously failed to reach an agreement, it culminated in Operation Midnight Hammer, during which the U.S. military struck Iranian nuclear facilities, including the site at Fordow. He did not explicitly mention Israel’s Operation Rising Lion, which marked the start of the 12-day war.
Asked whether Netanyahu wants him to halt negotiations with Iran, Trump said, “He didn’t say that and we didn’t discuss it. I’ll talk to them as long as I want, and we’ll see if we can make a deal. And if we can’t, we’ll have to move to phase two, which will be very hard for them. I don’t want that to happen.”
Israeli officials are familiar with the timeline Trump outlined and say he has allocated only a few weeks for negotiations. Netanyahu remains skeptical, though he has defined his red lines.

As a Colorado River deadline passes, reservoirs keep declining

- The Trump administration gave seven states a deadline to reach a water deal for the Colorado River.
- As they missed it, the governors of California, Arizona and Nevada called their stance “firm and fair.”
The leaders of seven states failed to negotiate a deal to share the diminishing waters of the Colorado River by a Trump administration deadline on Saturday, leaving the Southwest in a quagmire with uncertain repercussions while the river’s depleted reservoirs continue to decline.
Former U.S. Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in an interview with The Times that the impasse now appears so intractable that Trump administration officials should take a step back, abandon the current effort and begin all over again.
Babbitt said he believes it would be a mistake for Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to “try to impose a long-term solution” by ordering major water cuts across the Southwest — which would likely set off a lengthy court battle.
“We need a fresh start,” Babbitt said. “I believe that in the absence of a unanimous agreement, [the Interior Department] should renew the existing agreements for five years, and then we should start all over. We should scrap the entire process and invent a new one.”
Negotiators for seven states remain deeply divided over how to cut water use along the Colorado River. The chances of a court battle appear to be growing, with the threat of deep cuts in water deliveries to California and other Western states.
Officials for the seven states have tried to boost reservoir levels via voluntary water cutbacks and federal payments to farmers who agree to leave fields dry part of the year. But after more than two years of trying to hash out new long-term rules for sharing water, they remain deadlocked; the existing rules are set to expire at the end of this year.
The states similarly blew past an earlier federal deadline in November.
Interior Department officials have not said how they will respond. The agency is considering four options for imposing cutbacks starting next year, as well as the option of taking no action.
Babbitt, who was Interior secretary under President Clinton from 1993 to 2001, said he thinks the Trump administration’s options are too narrow and inadequate. They would place the burden of water cuts on Arizona, California and Nevada while not requiring any for the four other upriver states — Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico.
Without a consensus, the only reasonable approach is to extend existing water-saving agreements for a few years while making a new push for solutions, Babbitt said.
Federal officials have “missed the opportunity” to take a strong leadership role, he said, and it’s time to reimagine the effort as a “much more inclusive, public, broad” process.
The river provides for about 35 million people and 5 million acres of farmland, from the Rocky Mountains to northern Mexico. California uses more water than any other state but has cut back substantially in recent years.
Since 2000, relentless drought intensified by climate change has sapped the river’s flow and left reservoirs depleted. This winter’s record warmth and lack of storms has left the Rockies with very little snow.
Lake Mead, the river’s largest reservoir, is now 34% full, while Lake Powell is at 26%.
Years ago, scientists said climate change would bring a Colorado River crisis. Their warnings, which largely went unheeded, are now playing out.
“Our states have conserved large volumes of water in recent years,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a joint statement with Arizona’s Katie Hobbs and Nevada’s Joe Lombardo. “Our stance remains firm and fair: all seven basin states must share in the responsibility of conservation.”
The states’ positions haven’t changed much in the last two years, said JB Hamby, California’s lead negotiator, and moving toward an agreement will require firm commitments for cuts by all.
Officials representing the four Upper Basin states said they’ve offered compromises and are prepared to continue negotiating. In a written statement, they stressed they are already dealing with substantial water cuts, and said their downstream neighbors are trying to secure water “that simply does not exist.”
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s latest forecast shows the amount of runoff flowing into Lake Powell will decrease so dramatically this year that the dropping reservoir levels could render Glen Canyon Dam unable to continue generating electricity.
The Interior Department said in a written statement Saturday that it will finalize new rules by Oct. 1, and it “cannot delay action.” The agency is accepting comments from the public as part of its review of options until March 2.
“Negotiation efforts have been productive,” Burgum said. “We believe that a fair compromise with shared responsibility remains within reach.”

Enemy weapons detector in the hands of soldiers five years early
New acoustic weapon detection system will help keep soldier safe on the battlefield by helping to locate and target positions of enemy gunfire, mortars and explostions.
-
250 jobs across the country sustained after new contract signed with Leonardo UK.
-
System to be in soldiers’ hands five years ahead of schedule, with rollout to frontline troops within 12 months.
-
29 UK SMEs to benefit as part of the supply chain, helping to make UK defence an engine for growth.
British soldiers will be able to more aggressively hunt, detect, and locate hostile gunfire, as well as receive a further layer of protection on the battlefield, with the early delivery of new technology.
Through SONUS - a new system to detect enemy weapons - UK forces will now have access to a capability that weighs 70% less than its predecessor, making it easier to transport and able to deploy in under three minutes.
SONUS works by detecting acoustic pressure waves from gunfire, mortars and explosions.
This form of detection means the system can operate covertly, without emitting an electronic signature, helping troops to avoid enemy fire. It will also enable soldiers to identify targets faster and more accurately, meaning they can take evasive or offensive action more effectively.
Defence supplier Leonardo UK have been awarded the £18.3 million contract by the Army five-years earlier than originally planned. The works sustains 250 jobs across the UK, notably at Leonardo’s Basildon site, as well as through 29 small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs).
The procurement is happening as part of the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War – hitting 2.6% of GDP from 2027.
Minister for Defence Readiness and Industry, Luke Pollard MP, said:
We’ve accelerated our procurement of this equipment by five years to provide additional layers of safety for our personnel through more durable, lightweight systems in a new era of threat.
Making defence an engine for growth is a key priority for this government and this deal sustains jobs across the UK, benefits multiple SMEs and boosts our Armed Forces.
The SONUS platforms will be delivered to 5th Regiment Royal Artillery, the British Army’s dedicated Surveillance and Target Acquisition Regiment, over the next 12 months.
Brigadier M Birch, Senior Responsible Owner for the Land ISTAR Programme, said:
This investment in Leonardo’s SONUS Acoustic Weapon Locating System demonstrates the Army’s commitment to delivering cutting-edge technology to the front line.
It will significantly enhance our ability to protect our people and respond to emerging threats, ensuring the Army remains ready to meet the challenges of the future.
Olly Manning, Vice President Mission Systems at Leonardo, said:
Leonardo has over 40 years of experience in passive acoustic weapon-locating technology, with battle-proven systems that have seen operational use with over 13 armed forces – many of whom are NATO members.
We are looking forward to working in partnership with the British Army to ensure SONUS provides them with an accurate, robust and reliable passive detection system that will keep our Armed Forces safe – now and into the future.
The investment helps deliver on the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and Defence Industrial Strategy (DIS) – improving warfighting readiness, strengthening the UK’s defence industrial base, and making defence as an engine for growth.
Through procurement reforms, the Army prioritised fast tracking important weapon-locating systems as part of the Army’s initiative to modernise and double their lethality by 2027. Its accelerated delivery was achieved by the LAND ISTAR Team, working with Defence Equipment and Support (DE&S) and Task Force RAPSTONE.

Twenty years of the Chip and Pin: How the way we pay has evolved
There has been a 95 per cent reduction in losses to counterfeit card fraud over the past 20 years thanks to the chip & pin

This weekend marks two decades since Chip and PIN fundamentally transformed in-store card payments, revolutionising daily transactions long before mobile phones became digital wallets.
The system significantly enhanced security, replacing traditional signature authorisations with a four-digit personal identification number (PIN) entered via a keypad for purchases.
According to UK Finance, the banking and finance industry body, a primary objective was to reduce "card-present" fraud, including magnetic stripe cloning and counterfeit card scams.
The initiative proved highly effective, leading to a 95 per cent reduction in losses from counterfeit card fraud over the past 20 years.
The UK's full adoption of Chip and PIN officially began on 15 February 2006, following the implementation deadline on Valentine's Day.
At that time, 99 per cent of cardholders were thought to have at least one chip and pin-enabled card in their wallet.
Some security concerns were voiced around the time that the scheme was initially introduced, including that criminals may watch someone inputting their pin and then steal their card, and that some people could become a fraud target by carrying their pin details around with their card.
However, there were also significant concerns about the opportunities for fraudsters from using the old-style payment.
Ways to pay have transformed in the past 20 years, along with criminals’ tactics.
UK Finance said there are more than 25 million additional cards now in circulation compared with two decades ago.

Contactless payments were also introduced in 2007, initially with a limit of £10.
The current contactless card payment limit is £100 and in March the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will make changes to enable banks and payment providers with strong fraud controls to set their own limits in future, if they choose to.
Currently, contactless accounts for two-thirds (66 per cent) of all credit card and three-quarters (76 per cent) of UK debit card transactions, according to UK Finance.
Mobile payments have also grown rapidly, UK Finance said, with about half of people using mobile contactless payments at least once a month.
Despite the evolving way that people pay, UK Finance said that chip and pin remains important for higher value transactions, accounting for 30 per cent of credit and debit card payments by value.
As a result, the average chip and pin transaction is £93 compared with an average of £17 for a contactless payment.
As criminals’ tactics have changed, there has been a rise in remote purchase fraud, with £215 million stolen in the first half of 2025, UK Finance said.
Fraudsters will use social engineering techniques to trick people into handing over their one-time passcodes, enabling criminals to make fraudulent online card transactions or fraudulently register digital wallets.
UK Finance is urging people to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign, which encourages people to pause to consider whether something could be a scam, before acting on a request.
Jana Mackintosh, managing director of payments at UK Finance said: “The evolution of payments is remarkable and will continue to be so as the needs of consumers and businesses change.
“In 2006 the iPhone hadn’t yet been launched, and you couldn’t tap your card to pay for something, whereas today these are the most popular payment methods for UK consumers and many people are happy to only carry their phone rather than a bank card.
“The industry will continue to support and drive innovation and change, like the introduction of chip and pin, which gives consumers the confidence to safely buy things in shops and drive growth across the economy.”
Nick Quin, chief corporate affairs officer at ATM and cash access network Link, said: “The anniversary highlights how things change quickly in payments and banking.
“In the past 20 years we’ve seen people increasingly shift from cash to card and now increasingly digital wallets.
“Our research shows that half of people are happy to leave the house without a physical wallet but cash still plays role in everyday spending for millions.
“As we embrace the next generation of payments technology, we need to make sure it serves everyone, from cash users to digital natives.”
Simon Forbes, division president, UK and Ireland at Mastercard, said: “Chip and pin – and more recently contactless – have played a pivotal role in the evolution of payments.
“Today, online innovation is driving the next leap forward, moving us away from manually entering long card numbers when shopping online and towards one‑click payments, such as click to pay, that are safer, faster and more convenient.”

Valentine’s Day: What makes a good kiss? Here is the psychology behind it
Scientists have explained that ‘thoughts, fantasies and emotional context’ all enhance kissing quality
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
Scientists have revealed that the quality of a kiss is less about technique and more about the "thoughts, fantasies and emotional context we bring to it".
Researchers at Abertay University challenged the common belief that kissing inherently ignites sexual chemistry, instead investigating the profound impact of cognitive and emotional elements on kissing behaviours.
Their methodology involved an online survey, where participants from the UK and Italy were questioned on their attitudes, experiences, and fantasies concerning intimacy and the act of kissing.
They rated what they considered to be the hallmarks of a good kiss, alongside assessing their own perceived kissing prowess.
The survey also gathered data on the frequency of intimate fantasies and details regarding their sexual desire.
The results showed kissing is “far more than a sensory experience”.
The researchers found people who often daydream about intimacy tend to place more importance on contact and arousal when deciding what makes someone a good kisser.
This pattern held even when the researchers considered factors like creativity and sexual desire.
They said this shows imagination, and not just physical sensation, plays a key role in how we experience affection.
Dr Christopher Watkins, senior lecturer in the department of sociological and psychological sciences at Abertay University, said: “Our findings show that kissing is far more than a sensory experience.
“It’s shaped by the thoughts, fantasies, and emotional context we bring to it.
“Historically, certain strands of research on human sexuality have focused on sensory experiences and how we respond to physical stimulation, but our study highlights how imagination and internal states play an important role in how we interact with a partner when kissing them.
“By examining both the psychological and physical elements, we can better understand why people differ in how they use and appreciate kissing in their relationships, and why a single kiss can feel so meaningful.”
The team said the study’s findings could be developed into a “simple tool” within couples therapy.
Study co-author Milena Rota, who is now a PhD student at the University of Leicester, said: “By showing how fantasy shapes romantic behaviour, our research offers fresh insight into the role played by our thoughts in how we express ourselves in romantic contexts.
“Our research could be developed further as one simple tool within couples therapy, looking at how fantasy could guide behaviours – in this case a romantic kiss – where frequent kissing has previously shown to be related to higher quality romantic relationships.”
The study was published in the journal Sexual and Relationship Therapy.

Thousands of mental health patients could receive better treatment thanks to major study
The research, which is being supported by 10 NHS trusts, could “transform” the understanding of severe mental illness, officials said

Thousands of individuals in England with severe mental health problems are being recruited for a major study, aiming to develop personalised treatments for conditions like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Supported by 10 NHS trusts, officials state the research could "transform" the understanding of severe mental illness.
The three-year GlobalMinds project is looking for 49,000 participants.
Eligible patients with severe depression and psychosis will be identified and contacted via NHS England’s DigiTrials service.
Participants will receive at-home sampling kits, enabling experts to combine genetic data from blood or saliva with questionnaire responses and NHS medical records.
The aim is to develop detailed data on severe mental health conditions to eventually improve diagnosis and potentially develop personalised treatments.
Dr Adrian James, NHS England’s national medical director for mental health and neurodiversity, said: “This major new study could transform our understanding of severe mental illness and lead to the dawn of a new era of personalised treatments for patients with conditions including schizophrenia and severe depression.
“People living with a severe mental illness are affected by their condition every day, and it can often lead to preventable physical conditions and shorter lifespans.
“The new study gives us the opportunity to change the way we treat these conditions and we’re using the NHS’s DigiTrials service to invite suitable people faster, fairly and at scale. I’d encourage anyone contacted to consider signing up to be part of this ground-breaking study.”
The study is being led by mental health data science company Akrivia Health in partnership with Cardiff University.
It has initially been launched in England and Wales, with plans to expand internationally.
Around 2,000 patients are already enrolled and 1,000 people with dementia will also take part.
Professor James Walters of Cardiff University, who is chief investigator on GlobalMinds, said the study “provides an unprecedented opportunity to uncover and identify the many personal and biological factors behind mental health conditions”.
He added: “Precision medicine has already revolutionised the treatment of cancer and other rare diseases and we want GlobalMinds to bring the same breakthroughs to mental health.
“By creating the first large-scale dataset linking both genetic and detailed routine clinical information, GlobalMinds will unlock a new era of personalised mental health care, so we can help tackle the global mental health crisis.”
Brian Dow, deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: “This study has real potential to deepen our understanding and open the door to a new generation of treatments for mental illness.
“The strength of the study lies in the partnership between researchers, the NHS and charities like ours, which means data can be powerfully fused with lived experience, with the voices of people experiencing mental illness remaining front and centre.”
According to the mental health charity Mind, around one in five adults in England have a common mental health condition, such as anxiety or depression, in any given week.
It also estimates the percentage of people reporting severe mental health symptoms rose from 7% in 1993 to nearly 12% in 2023/24.

‘Remarkable’ changes to the way we pay in 20 years of using chip and pin

This weekend marks 20 years since chip and pin fully replaced signatures for in-store card purchases, with the initiative transforming how people make day-to-day transactions long before people started digging out their mobile phone to pay.
The move enhanced security around card payments as customers put their four-digit personal identification number (pin) into a keypad to authorise a purchase, moving away from the “traditional” signature authorisation.
Banking and finance industry body UK Finance said that one of the key reasons for the introduction of chip and pin was to reduce “card-present” fraud, and magnetic stripe cloning or counterfeit card fraud.

Ocasio-Cortez says US military aid to Israel ‘enabled a genocide in Gaza’

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said during a Munich security conference panel on Friday on the future of foreign policy that the Democratic party’s next presidential nominee should reconsider the country’s military aid to Israel.
Hagar Shezaf of the Israeli newspaper Haaretz asked the US congresswoman if she thought “the Democratic presidential candidate in the 2028 elections should re-evaluate military aid to Israel”.
“To me this isn’t just about a presidential election,” Ocasio-Cortez replied, “personally, I think that the United States has an obligation to uphold its own laws, particularly the Leahy laws.
“I think that, personally, the idea of completely unconditional aid, no matter what one does, does not make sense,” she added. “I think it enabled a genocide in Gaza, and I think that we have thousands of women and children dead … that was completely avoidable.
“So I believe that enforcement of our own laws, through the Leahy laws, which requires conditioning aid in any circumstance when you see gross human rights violations is appropriate,” Ocasio-Cortez concluded.
The Leahy laws are two statutory provisions, named for the former senator Patrick Leahy who introduced them in the 1990s, which prohibit the US defense department and state department from providing funds to “units of foreign security forces where there is credible information implicating that unit in the commission of gross violations of human rights”.
But, according to Charles Blaha, the former director of the state department office that leads Leahy vetting of foreign security units, while state “department officials insist that Israeli units are subject to the same vetting standards as units from any other country. Maybe in theory. But in practice, that’s simply not true.”
Matt Whitaker, the US ambassador to Nato, declined to directly answer the question, saying Israel is “one of our closest allies”.
Earlier in the day, Ocasio-Cortez had accused Donald Trump of seeking to introduce an “age of authoritarianism” and condemning his foreign policy in front of its allies’ top policymakers.
In her remarks, Ocasio-Cortez said Trump and Marco Rubio, the secretary of state, were “looking to withdraw the United States from the entire world so that we can turn into an age of authoritarianism”, as they sought to “carve out a world where Donald Trump can command the western hemisphere and Latin America as his personal sandbox, where Putin can saber rattle around Europe and try to bully our own allies there”.
She went on further to outline what she called an “alternative vision” for a leftwing US foreign policy, saying that she and her fellow Democrats were calling for a return to a “rules-based order” without the “hypocrisies” of US foreign policy that have dominated the past and current administrations.
It remains unclear how big a role Democrats’ positions on the Israel-Gaza conflict will play in the 2028 presidential race. Some of the Democrats viewed as likely contenders have already faced questions on the issue, with some staking out a more critical stance than Kamala Harris or Joe Biden did in the 2024 race.

Philippines’ AI reckoning puts 13 million jobs on the line
The US$30 billion outsourcing sector is fighting to adapt, leaving millions of workers with a stark choice: upskill or be left behind
Renso Bajala didn’t expect a machine to help decide whether he kept his job.
The AI analysed his tone, delivery and keyword usage, scoring each interaction for sentiment and customer experience. No one had mentioned it during training.
“I was a new hire, and nothing in our training curriculum said that AI would be used to measure our performances,” Bajala told This Week in Asia. “Then the trainer informed us that the outcome from the AI software would be part of our metrics.”
At first, he did not resist the idea of being evaluated by AI. What wore him down was the way the scoring felt fixed and context-blind, as if the system could not see what a human listener might understand about a difficult call.
“If it [the score] was low, you’d start overthinking what you did wrong, even if you felt you did your best,” he said, adding that the process felt “unfair”.

President Volodymyr Zelensky met with Reza Pahlavi, Iranian opposition figure and exiled son of the country's last monarch, on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference on Feb. 13.
In a social media post after the meeting, Zelensky said Ukraine "supports the Iranian people in their struggle for their future" and expressed sympathy "with all the victims of the Iranian regime."
Zelensky said the two discussed the situation inside Iran and "the areas in which the people of Iran need support," as well as the importance of strengthening sanctions against Iran and other authoritarian governments.
He also condemned cooperation between Moscow and Tehran, citing Iran's supply of Shahed drones to Russia and what he described as the transfer of licenses related to their production.
"Such a partnership poses a real threat not only to Ukraine, but also to the entire region," Zelensky wrote.
Zelensky thanked Pahlavi for supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Ukraine was prepared to help "to protect human lives."
Pahlavi, who has lived in exile since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled his father—the last shah of Iran—said on social media he was "very pleased" to meet Zelensky.
"We represent two nations that are fighting against threats to their freedom and national sovereignty," Pahlavi wrote. "Our two nations are bound together by this very reality and also by the extraordinary courage of their people."
Pahlavi has advocated for a secular, democratic Iran, though his prominence among opposition figures and influence inside the country are debated. During Iran's most recent wave of protests, he urged demonstrators to overthrow the government.

WASHINGTON – Anthropic’s artificial-intelligence model Claude was used in the US military’s operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb 13, citing people familiar with the matter.
Claude’s deployment came via Anthropic’s partnership with data firm Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are widely used by the Defense Department and federal law enforcement, the report added.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The US Defense Department, the White House, Anthropic and Palantir did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pentagon is pushing top AI companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, to make their artificial-intelligence tools available on classified networks without many of the standard restrictions that the firms apply to users, Reuters exclusively reported on Feb 11.
Many AI companies are building custom tools for the US military, most of which are available only on unclassified networks typically used for military administration. Anthropic is the only one that is available in classified settings through third parties, but the government is still bound by the company’s usage policies.
The usage policies of Anthropic, which raised US$30 billion (S$37.9 billion) in its latest funding round and is now valued at US$380 billion, forbid using Claude to support violence, design weapons or carry out surveillance.

Memo says White House was 'excellently preserved' during East Wing demolition for Trump's ballroom
A White House memo says demolition crews "excellently preserved" the White House residence when they tore down the East Wing for President Donald Trump’s planned ballroom
- Bookmark
The White House mansion's eastern facade appears to have been “excellently preserved” when demolition crews tore down the East Wing to make way for President Donald Trump's planned ballroom, an administration official said in a memo made public Friday.
Contractors took pains to protect the White House residence during demolition, keeping heavy equipment at a safe distance and removing some pieces by hand, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, wrote to the commission charged with approving plans for Trump's ballroom. Some sections of the building were stabilized ahead of time, and vibration and crack movement were monitored, he wrote.
The National Capital Planning Commission, which is led by a top Trump aide, had requested more details about the demolition that began with little advance notice last fall. The agency has jurisdiction over construction and major renovations to government buildings in the region.
The East Wing demolition prompted a public outcry when it began without the independent reviews, congressional approval and public comment that are typical for even relatively minor modifications to historic buildings in Washington. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has sued to halt construction of the ballroom.
The memo documents the history of the East Wing dating back to Thomas Jefferson's presidency and lays out the White House's justification for tearing it down, saying it was not feasible to preserve it while meeting Trump's goals for the project. The completed ballroom will include an improved visitors center for security screening and will lessen the need for road closures during major events, Fisher wrote.
Curators documented and preserved artwork, furniture and other items of historical significance, including “the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, the Porte-cochere columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and other hardware and fixtures,” he wrote.
“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure,” Fisher added.
Engineers are studying whether the West Colonnade, which connects the White House residence to the West Wing offices, can support a second story that would make it more visually symmetrical with plans for a larger East Colonnade connecting to the ballroom, the memo said. No decisions have been made.
The White House also submitted the most detailed renderings of the ballroom published to date. It shows a massive new building that dwarfs the size of the demolished East Wing and matches the height of the historic White House mansion.
The project is scheduled for discussion during a March 5 meeting of the National Capital Planning Commission.

Prince William wanted Andrew banished from royals ‘before rot set in’, new book claims
Charles was said to be furious over William trying to rid Andrew from the Royal family

- CommentsGo to comments
Prince William demanded that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor be forced out of the royal family “before the rot set in”, following his disastrous Newsnight interview in 2019, a new biography has claimed.
After further details of Andrew’s relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, the Prince of Wales was said to have viewed the then-prince as a serious threat to the royal family’s survival.
The revelations are in an upcoming book about the Prince and Princess of Wales, written by the Mirror’s royal editor, Russell Myers.
A palace source in the book said: “The Prince of Wales was adamant the whole episode would never go away and, despite how others may have felt, there was absolutely no upside in Andrew being protected.”
William had urged action from Charles and Queen Elizabeth, who were in favour of protecting him, which provoked a furious reaction from his father, who “put him in his place”, the book claims.
The new biography alleges Charles was “engaged in a full-scale fire fight”, and William feared the Epstein scandal would pose a threat to the royal family’s survival.
A palace source in the book, said: “His view was crystal clear, Andrew shouldn’t be anywhere near the family under any circumstances, not by association, not at family functions, anywhere.
“Every single time there was a new revelation, which no one knew when it was coming or what the next one would be, it was a stain on all of the family.”
In a now infamous interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Andrew was asked about sexual abuse allegations made by the late Virginia Giuffre. Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing.
He claimed he had “no recollection” of ever meeting Ms Giuffre and said it was not possible he could have had sex with her in March 2001, as he was at a Pizza Express in Woking with his daughter.
Andrew also failed to apologise for his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
The Prince and Princess of Wales publicly addressed the Epstein scandal for the first time this week, saying they have been “deeply concerned” over the ongoing revelations surrounding Andrew.
Another source in the book said: “Once you understand the fact that everything that happens in the here and now, affects everything in the future, William’s future, it is very easy to put yourself in his shoes.
“He never much liked his uncle and wanted him out of the picture immediately before the rot further set in. William’s view was that he [Andrew] got himself into the whole mess, so he should be left to his own devices to sort it out away from the family.”
A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said the King had “profound concern at allegations which continue to come to light in respect of Mr Mountbatten-Windsor’s conduct.”
US Congress members have urged the King to “answer what he knew” about his brother’s ties to Epstein and compel him to testify in the US.
Andrew suffered a fall from grace following the release of Epstein files in October, which saw him stripped of all his titles, including the Duke of York.
In the latest tranche of documents released, Andrew is alleged to have shared confidential reports with Epstein that he had access to in his role as a UK trade envoy.
The Independent has contacted Buckingham Palace and Andrew’s representatives.

Kristi Noem abruptly ends press conference when asked about CBP shooting down a party balloon forcing airport closure
Federal officials initially claimed a cartel drone infiltrated U.S. airspace in bizarre incident

Homeland Security Kristi Noem abruptly ended a press conference in Arizona on Friday after being asked about a bizarre incident in which federal officials closed the airspace above El Paso this week after border officials reportedly used a laser to shoot down a party balloon they mistook for a cartel drone.
During the press conference in Phoenix, a journalist asked if the reports were true, and if so, why border officials did not appear to coordinate with the Federal Aviation Administration.
“You know, this was a joint agency task force mission that was undertaken and we’re continuing to work on the communication through that but recognize we’re grateful for the partnership of the Department of War and FAA as we go forward,” said Noem, who then walked away from her microphone.
Following the abrupt airspace closure and reopening, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the FAA and Defense Department had “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.”
“The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region,” he wrote on X, in a post that is still public.
However, reporting suggests that the incident occurred when officials at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, with military officials present, used a new Defense Department anti-drone energy weapon this week on a flying object that in fact appeared to be a party balloon, The New York Times reported.
The FAA, which hadn’t been briefed on the technology, shut down the El Paso airspace out of safety concerns, according to the paper.
The apparent inter-agency confusion alarmed elected leaders.
"The information coming from the administration does not add up," U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, Democrat of Texas, said after the incident in a press conference.
"This should have never happened. You cannot restrict airspace over a major city without coordinating with the city, the airport, the hospitals, the community leadership," El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson told reporters after the closure. "This was a major and unnecessary disruption, one that has not occurred since 9/11."
The closure comes at a sensitive time for both Noem and the U.S. transit system.
Noem’s agency, the Department of Homeland Security, is under heavy scrutiny after agents carrying out the administration’s military-style crackdown on illegal immigration shot and killed two Americans last month during their deployment in the Minneapolis area.
A recent Wall Street Journal exposé, meanwhile, alleges that Noem’s department has been in a state of internal “chaos,” with the secretary chasing made-for-TV moments dressing up in agency-branded flak jackets while carrying on an alleged extramarital affair with a deputy, which they both strongly deny.
There have been multiple high-profile incidents in U.S. airspace under the Trump administration, including a crash last January near Reagan airport in Washington, D.C., between a civilian airliner and a military helicopter, which killed 67 people.

IDF's new mechanical AI robot takes two hours to clean tanks, which soldiers needed 48 hours for

The IDF unveiled a new robotic system that enables its tank mechanics to perform 48 hours of maintenance, including fault location and equipment cleaning, in just two hours.
Developed by the Israeli company Ruby AI, the new IDF robot looks like something out of an animated movie. With multiple robotic arms, kind of like a mechanical octopus, it can penetrate the tank's engine, clean and wash, scan, and perform operations that previously required a human hand.
The robot operates autonomously, without soldiers present in dangerous environments and without exposure to chemicals, oils, or extreme heat.
Daniel Ben Dov, CEO of Ruby AI, founded the company in the Bar Lev High-Tech Park in Northern Israel. He had previously worked n the space and defense industries, including management positions at Gilat Satellites and Elbit.
The company currently employs about 20 people, most of them engineers in software, hardware, aerospace, and physical artificial intelligence.
“We are developing both the robotic arms themselves and their brains,” explained Ben Dov. “We have developed a Physical AI core that can learn elements of the physical world, understand what it sees, and perform precise actions. This is not a sterile factory robot, but one that can work in mud, dust, heat, and cold.”
The system was developed during the war to take soldiers out of dangerous maintenance chores, and Ben Dov explained that it is now fully operational.
More than just cleaning robots
Founded in 2020, Ruby AI has been working with clients worldwide, with one of its most prominent products being the United Arab Emirates' refueling robots.
This is the only robot in the world that performs a full refueling without human contact, in an explosive environment, and with strict safety standards.
"If a robot knows how to refuel, it also knows how to deal with hazardous materials," says Ben Dov. "This opens the door to a whole world of military maintenance."
Among the developments in the pipeline are robots that will assist in replacing heavy wheels on tanks and bulldozers, a task that currently requires enormous physical effort and poses an injury risk. The robots are capable of holding weights over 100 kilos, performing the operation with the required precision, and working alongside a soldier, taking the most dangerous chores instead of humans.
“We are not developing cute robots that fold laundry,” Ben Dov emphasizes. “We focus on difficult, repetitive physical work in places where a person is not supposed to be.”
From terror tunnels to field hospitals
One of the company's main objectives is to develop a robot capable of performing a task that is extremely dangerous for a soldier: clearing underground tunnels.
Being close to dangerous areas makes tunnels an ideal environment for mission robots. "A humanoid robot eighty meters tall won't go in there," says Ben Dov. "It can't crawl, it can't work in mud and water. We design the robot according to the mission, not according to how it looks."
The world of military medicine is also on the horizon, with the development of five-fingered bionic arms that could, in the future, perform precise therapeutic operations, from physiotherapy to working in dangerous environments such as areas affected by chemical or biological warfare agents, where you don't want to send a person.
The IDF is examining the developments cautiously, but it’s clear that the direction has been set. The robots are not coming to fight in the place of soldiers, but to relieve them of burdens, risks, and drudgery.

US President Donald Trump on Friday embraced the idea of regime change in Iran, telling reporters it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," as Washington plans new talks with Tehran while also upping its military presence in the region.
A US delegation, including envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, is set to meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning in Geneva, according to a source briefed on the matter.
When asked what Iran should do to avoid attack, Trump said that Iran would need to "give us the right deal," but that, despite Iran being willing to talk, historically, they haven't agreed to give the right deals.
"For 47 years they've been talking and talking, and in the meantime we've lost a lot of lives," Trump said.
Setting course for the Persian Gulf
On Thursday, the USS Gerald R. Ford, the largest aircraft carrier in the world, was reported to receive instructions to set course for the Persian Gulf in order to bolster forces in the Middle East. Currently, the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln is in the region alongside several other vessels.
When asked for comment on sending a second aircraft carrier on Friday responded that "in case we don't make a deal, we'll need it."
The president added that if a deal was made, the trip could be cut short, and that the aircraft carrier would be leaving "very soon."
Trump said he had a deadline for Iran, but did not specify further.

ICE wants to spend more than $38 billion to convert warehouses into massive detention centers

ICE wants to spend more than $38 billion to convert warehouses into massive detention centers
Officials and residents in red and blue districts across the country urge DHS to block plans to detain up to 10,000 people at a time in formerly industrial buildings

Donald Trump’s administration intends to spend nearly $40 billion on a plan to detain tens of thousands of immigrants in retrofitted warehouses across the country, expanding the president’s mass deportation efforts into cities and towns that are increasingly urging officials to keep them out of their backyards.
Documents published by officials in New Hampshire offer the clearest and most comprehensive picture yet of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s nationwide plans to scale up the president’s campaign to quickly arrest, detain and deport people from the United States, which is already detaining more than 60,000 immigrants at any given time.
ICE expects to spend more than $38 billion buying up 16 buildings it can convert into “processing” centers to temporarily detain up to 1,500 immigrants in each before they’re moved to larger facilities.
Another eight larger warehouses would hold up to 10,000 people at a time, serving as “primary locations” for removal from the country, according to the documents.
Those facilities add to an already-expansive immigration detention system of more than 200 jails, mostly operated by private firms, in a country with one of the highest incarceration rates on the planet.
The plans are meeting fierce resistance, including in states and counties that supported Trump — and from Republican officials.
Last week, Mississippi Senator Roger Wicker (R) said he spoke with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about a proposed facility in Marshall County. “I relayed to her the opposition of local elected and zoning officials as well as economic development concerns. I appreciate her for agreeing to look elsewhere,” he said.
Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire, whose state published documents about the warehouse expansion, grilled ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons on whether he would similarly cancel a project in her state.
“No, ma’am,” he said during his testimony to the Senate Homeland Security committee Thursday.
“The people of Merrimack, their leadership, do not want this ICE facility in their community. I have yet to find a Granite State community that does,” she said. “I would hope I get the same treatment that Senator Wicker got, which is that the town doesn’t want the detention center, so please cancel it.”
New Hampshire’s Republican Governor Kelly Ayotte said Homeland Security shared the documents with her office for the first time that same day, appearing to contradict Lyons’s testimony that he spoke with the governor and provided her with an “economic impact summary” about the project.
ICE plans to spend $158 million retrofitting a warehouse in Merrimack.
Similar plans are underway across the country. ICE has already spent nearly $700 million acquiring warehouses in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas, according to public records and local reports.
This week, ICE announced the purchase of a former warehouse in Chester, New York, which it plans to convert into a detention center, despite widespread, bipartisan opposition to the project from state and local officials
That facility, roughly 60 miles outside of New York City could hold up to 1,500 people.
“I think every American should be alarmed,” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said this week. “They are building and have built a black box system that disappears people, both immigrants and U.S. citizens alike.”
ICE’s decision to move forward with the project “despite clear local opposition underscore the urgent need for New York to be a bulwark against the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda,” according to Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigration Coalition.
That kind of opposition is working in other states, even in deep-red districts.
But ICE, flush with cash after a massive injection of taxpayer funds through Trump’s One Big Beautiful Act domestic spending bill last year, intends to “fully implement a new detention model by the end of Fiscal Year 2026,” according to the documents.
Last month, Homeland Security told officials in largely Republican-leaning Hanover County, Virginia, that ICE intends to build a facility on a former cattle farm that houses a 500,000-square-foot warehouse constructed by a company owned by Canadian billionaire Jim Pattison.
Pattison’s company reportedly intended to sell that warehouse to ICE, but after a threat of boycotts, in addition to business and union pressure and outrage from nearby residents, the county’s board of supervisors announced plans to oppose the sale and called on federal, state and local leaders to do the same.
Shortly after the board’s vote, Pattison’s company issued a one-line statement: “The transaction to sell our industrial building in Ashland, Virginia will not be proceeding.”
In Utah, local opposition forced a real estate group that owns a warehouse with plans for ICE conversion to issue a brief statement saying it has “no plans” to lease the property to any federal agency.
In Oklahoma, officials passed a resolution to block any ICE facility there. And in Maryland, Howard County Executive Calvin Ball revoked the building permit for one.
Similar resistance is underway across the country, though with mixed results; ICE spent nearly $130 million on a more than 1 million square foot warehouse roughly 50 miles outside of Atlanta, one of two new additions to Georgia’s already-sprawling immigration detention center network.
Officials there already appear to be regretting it.
“This is not something, hands down, that the city can support,” Social Circle City Manager Eric Taylor told Georgia Public Radio. More than 72 percent of residents in Walton County voted for Trump in 2024.
“The frustration here is that they’re looking at a building that was not built for human habitation,” he said. “There's nothing more than a shell of a building.”

Trump threatens to bypass Congress and order new voting laws ahead of midterms
France

US President Donald Trump, on Friday, February 13, threatened to try to bypass Congress and force new voting laws ahead of the November midterm elections, where his Republican Party fears losing control of the legislature. Trump said he would soon issue an executive order attempting to impose the rules if Congress does not pass a law requiring photo identification to vote and other nationwide reforms.
Any attempt would likely be met by a legal challenge that could ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. "There will be Voter ID for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. "If we can't get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order," he wrote.
While many jurisdictions across the United States require photo ID to cast ballots, not all do, with Trump and many Republicans arguing without evidence that those areas have permitted significant voter fraud.
Expected to fail in the Senate
The Trump-backed "SAVE America" election reform act passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives this week. However, it is expected to fail in the Senate, where the Republican majority is too slim to pass the law without Democratic support.
In addition to requiring a photo ID to cast a ballot, the bill would also require proof of citizenship to register to vote. There is no evidence of meaningful fraud in US elections and critics say that the bill's measures would instead push millions of people away from casting ballots, because they don't have a passport or a paper copy of their birth certificate.
An analysis by the Brennan Center found more than 21 million Americans lack easy access to such documents.
This would "disenfranchise Americans of all ages," the center found – especially young people and ethnic minorities. Trump's push for federal election reforms has also run up against constitutional concerns. Under the US Constitution, states retain broad control over the administration of elections.
Debunked claim of mass fraud
It was unclear how Trump could legally force a national mandate on voter ID. However, the 79-year-old Republican has repeatedly overturned norms in the White House.
In his post on Friday, he repeated his widely debunked claim that more election security is needed because of mass fraud. For years, Trump has propagated the falsehood to justify his unprecedented – and ultimately unsuccessful – attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.
Polls show that Trump's Republican Party faces a serious threat of losing its narrow control of Congress in the Midterms, particularly the lower chamber. If Democrats win, they have signaled they will block Trump's agenda and could move to impeach him.

US used Anthropic’s AI model Claude during the Venezuela raid, WSJ reports

WASHINGTON – Anthropic’s artificial-intelligence model Claude was used in the US military’s operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the Wall Street Journal reported on Feb 13, citing people familiar with the matter.
Claude’s deployment came via Anthropic’s partnership with data firm Palantir Technologies, whose platforms are widely used by the Defense Department and federal law enforcement, the report added.
Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The US Defense Department, the White House, Anthropic and Palantir did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The Pentagon is pushing top AI companies, including OpenAI and Anthropic, to make their artificial-intelligence tools available on classified networks without many of the standard restrictions that the firms apply to users, Reuters exclusively reported on Feb 11.
Many AI companies are building custom tools for the US military, most of which are available only on unclassified networks typically used for military administration. Anthropic is the only one that is available in classified settings through third parties, but the government is still bound by the company’s usage policies.
The usage policies of Anthropic, which raised US$30 billion (S$37.9 billion) in its latest funding round and is now valued at US$380 billion, forbid using Claude to support violence, design weapons or carry out surveillance.

Trump says change of power in Iran would be ‘best thing’, as he sends second carrier
The US president’s comments are his most overt reference yet to regime change, as he pushes Tehran to make a nuclear deal
US President Donald Trump said on Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic republic.
Trump’s comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran’s clerical establishment, and came as he pushes on Washington’s arch-foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
At the same time, the exiled son of the Iranian shah toppled in the 1979 Islamic revolution renewed his calls for international intervention following a bloody crackdown on protests by Tehran.
“Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” Trump told reporters at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina when a journalist asked if he wanted “regime change” in Iran.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that “there are people”.
He has previously backed off full-throated calls for a change of government in Iran, warning that it could cause chaos, although he has made threats towards Khamenei in the past.

IDF says its series of Lebanon strikes targeted Hezbollah arms depots, rocket launchers
A wave of Israeli airstrikes in several areas of southern Lebanon this evening targeted Hezbollah weapon depots and rocket launchers, the military says.
The IDF says Hezbollah continues to attempt to rebuild its infrastructure in southern Lebanon, and that the presence of the arms caches and rocket launchers is a violation of the November 2024 ceasefire.
Crew commanded by Jewish American Jessica Meir docks with International Space Station
WASHINGTON — Four astronauts dock at the International Space Station for a months-long research mission, replacing a crew forced to return to Earth early over a medical issue.
The US space agency’s Crew-12 arrives at the orbiting laboratory after a journey of about 34 hours that started with blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.
“We have bridged the legacy of humankind’s continuous presence in space spanning more than 25 years at this very site,” Jewish American astronaut Jessica Meir says after docking at the ISS.
“As we look back at Earth from these windows, we are reminded that cooperation is not just possible, it is essential. Up here, there are no borders and hope is universal.”
Other members of Crew-12 are American Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.
The foursome is replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned, in the first medical evacuation in the space station’s history.

Netanyahu’s office denies he pushed Trump to criticize Herzog over failure to issue pardon
US President Donald Trump’s statement on Thursday calling President Isaac Herzog “disgraceful” for not granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “entirely his own initiative,” says a source in the premier’s office.
Herzog is reportedly seeking clarification from Netanyahu over whether or not he encouraged Trump to rebuke him over his hesitation to pardon the premier. The comments came a day after Trump met Netanyahu in the White House, leading to speculation that Netanyahu raised the issue during their sit-down.
“The prime minister learned about it from the media and had no prior knowledge of it, just as he had no prior knowledge of the president’s remarks on this issue in his speech in the Knesset,” says the PMO official.
Mansour Abbas: Foreign-linked actors wanted Ra’am coalition with Netanyahu, who sought deal with Hamas
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sought a “long-term arrangement” with Hamas in order to keep the Palestinian national movement fractured, claims Ra’am chairman Mansour Abbas in an interview with Channel 12 News.
Speaking to the outlet, the Arab lawmaker says foreign-linked actors pressured him to persist in coalition talks with Netanyahu rather than join with opposition parties, due to the premier’s pre-October 7 policy on the terror group.
When asked whether he received messages from Qatar urging him to stay with Netanyahu, Abbas refuses to confirm or deny but says he was contacted by “people from here [Israel] with links to countries abroad.”
“These people encouraged me to continue and try to form a government with Benjamin Netanyahu and not with the other side [opposition]” because Netanyahu “doesn’t do wars,” Abbas says.
“I understood that Benjamin Netanyahu had an interest in ensuring that the fragmentation on the Palestinian side was preserved,” he says, adding that the premier sought to “advance a long-term arrangement with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.”
When asked whether Netanyahu made an explicit reference to this, Abbas says: “There was reference to this issue” in coalition talks. “I understood from his words that he was in favor of an arrangement [with Hamas],” he continues, claiming that such an arrangement stood to benefit both Netanyahu and the terror group.
Later on in the interview, Abbas recalls that Netanyahu gave him “lectures” on Zionist leader Zeev Jabotinsky during the since-scuttled coalition talks between the two.
He says it was as if the premier “wanted to stress that Likud is precisely the party that is trying to advance Arab society’s standing” and thus quoted Jabotinsky’s saying that “if there is a Jewish prime minister, his deputy should be Arab.”
Abbas takes a swipe at Netanyahu, saying that “they [in Likud] aren’t faithful to the path of Jabotinsky, who is considered the right-wing party’s ideological forebear.
Man shot to death on highway in Negev, hours after separate killing in north
A young man has been shot to death on a highway in the Negev desert, hours after a homicide in the north.
Another man was injured in the shooting.
The victim, around 20 years old, was found in critical condition by paramedics on Route 40, just south of Beersheba.
He was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after they reached him.
Another man, also around 20 years old, was injured moderately in the shooting and is being taken to a hospital, Magen David Adom says.
Police are at the scene and have launched an investigation into the killing. No suspects have yet been arrested.
Several IDF troops suspended from combat after filmed beating Palestinian suspect in West Bank
Several IDF soldiers have been suspended from combat duty after they were filmed beating a detained Palestinian suspect in the West Bank this week, the military says.
Footage posted by Palestinian media showed a group of soldiers hitting a Palestinian man who appears to be handcuffed, in the West Bank town of Turmus Ayya on Thursday.
In response to a query by The Times of Israel, the IDF says that the troops had detained the man after he approached them “in a suspicious manner.”
“During his arrest, several soldiers struck the suspect in a manner that is not consistent with IDF values and what is expected of its soldiers,” the military says.
The IDF says that the incident is under investigation, “and the soldiers were immediately suspended from operational activity until the conclusion of the investigation.”

Palestinian Prisoners’ Club accuses Ben Gvir of ‘revenge’ for alleged abuse of inmates in video
A Palestinian NGO denounces what it calls an Israeli act of revenge after a video showed far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir overseeing alleged abuse of detainees in a military prison.
Just days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Ben Gvir held a tour of Ofer Prison in the West Bank.
In footage filmed yesterday and posted by the minister, around 20 police officers are seen stationed in a hallway leading to prison cells, brandishing their weapons and firing stun grenades.
They then pull five detainees from their cells, their hands tied behind their backs, forcing them face down onto the floor.
“This is all part of ongoing displays meant to take revenge on Palestinian detainees,” Abdallah al‑Zaghari, head of the Palestinian Prisoners’ Club, tells AFP.
“Everything Ben Gvir and the far‑right government are doing affects not only the Palestinian people and prisoners in detention camps — it also impacts the global legal and human rights system,” he adds.
“It is simply a source of pride — arriving at a prison like this, a prison for terrorists, the vilest of the vile, seeing them like this,” Ben Gvir says in the video.
“I want one more thing: to execute them — the death penalty for terrorists,” he adds.

IDF says terrorists killed after emerging from tunnel and approaching troops in north Gaza
A group of armed Palestinian terror operatives emerged from a tunnel and approached troops in the northern Gaza Strip, on the Israeli side of the ceasefire line, earlier this evening, the military says.
The IDF says soldiers monitoring surveillance cameras identified the gunmen coming out of an underground site and entering a damaged building on the Israeli side of the Yellow Line, near troops of the Gaza Division’s Northern Brigade who are stationed in the area.
An Israeli Air Force drone then struck the building, killing at least two of the gunmen, the military says, adding that additional operatives were likely also killed in the strike.
The IDF publishes footage showing the gunmen and the strike.

Troops are continuing to scan the area “to locate and eliminate the terrorists who may remain,” the IDF says.
The IDF says the incident is a “blatant violation” of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, hinting that it will respond.
“The IDF views any attempt by terror organizations in the Gaza Strip to carry out terror attacks against IDF troops and civilians of the State of Israel gravely,” the army adds.
Government trying to ‘erase the truth’ of Oct. 7 massacre, bereaved sister says at Tel Aviv rally
Thousands of anti-government protesters are reported to gather at Tel Aviv’s Habima Square, calling for a state commission of inquiry into the Hamas-led October 7, 2023, massacre.
Hila Abir, whose sister Lotan was murdered at the Nova music festival, accuses the government of trying to “erase the truth” of the onslaught, after the government this week dropped the word “massacre” from the title of a bill establishing an annual commemoration for the brutal assault.
“When the government tries to erase this truth, it reveals how scared it is of us. Because when the government is afraid of the people, it lies and plays with our conscience,” she says.

Stephen A Smith makes strong hint at 2028 presidential run
ESPN star has been hinting at a possible presidential run for at least a year
- Bookmark
- CommentsGo to comments
ESPN broadcaster Stephen A. Smith is once again dangling a potential presidential run after saying last year he had abandoned the notion.
Smith sat for an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning's Robert Costa, which will air in full on February 15. Costa teased a snippet of the interview in a social media post, revealing that Smith said he was giving "strong consideration" to a 2028 run.
“I will confess to you, I’m giving strong consideration to being on that debate stage for 2027,” Smith reportedly said. “I’ve got this year coming up, 2026, to think about it, to study, to know the issues.”
It's not the first time Smith has suggested he wants the Oval Office, and he has even appeared in some 2028 candidate polls, according to Mediaite.
When asked who his preferred 2028 Democratic candidates are, Smith has previously named both Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro — who was considered a likely candidate for former Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate in 2024 — and Maryland Governor Wes Moore.
However, he has also said he is so disillusioned by the Democratic party that he believes he has no choice but to run himself.
“I’ve been approached by people on Capitol Hill. I’ve been approached by people who are elected officials in office, whether it’s governors or mayors or what have you. People have legitimately, seriously, asked me about it. I have no desire to be a politician, but I’ve decided that I’m no longer going to close that door,” Smith said last April.
A month before that, Smith told USA TODAY that he didn't "give a damn about the office" and said he preferred trading jabs with other sports personalities.
But he also made comments on The View that same month saying he could "beat them all," referring to likely Democratic primary opponents.
Then in June, he ruled out a run entirely during an appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
During the episode, Smith said he would prefer to be a "hell raiser" and was not looking to run for president in 2028.
“The way I look at it, the money that I have earned working my ass off all of these years now, I would have to curry favor, which means I would be owned. And I ain’t having that, so I’m not interested in that at all,” he told Stewart.
It's unclear if he still feels as though he'd be "owned" if he does run.
In July 2025, Smith told ABC News that the Democratic Party looked "leaderless."
"I'm certainly not here to cast dispersions upon individuals, but as a body, the Democratic Party just looks very, very bad right now because they look leaderless," Smith said at the time. "They don't have a definitive voice that anybody can depend on."
It's unclear who Smith's primary base of supporters would be, but what's clear is that he has at least one fan who says he'd "love" to see the broadcaster make a run at the Oval Office: President Donald Trump.
"I love watching him. He’s got great entertainment skills, which is very important. People watch him," Trump told NewsNation during a town hall last year. "I've been pretty good at picking people and picking candidates, and I will tell you, I’d love to see him run."

Trump threatens to impose photo ID for voters for midterm elections

Donald Trump threatened on Friday to impose a requirement that US voters present photo identification before being allowed to cast ballots in the upcoming midterm elections.
Trump insisted he will push for the change even if Congress fails to pass the Save America act, which cleared the House earlier this week but faces an uphill battle in the Senate. The bill would impose a national photo identification requirement to vote, in addition to requiring proof of citizenship to register and drastically limiting mail-in voting.
“There will be Voter I.D. for the Midterm Elections, whether approved by Congress or not!” Trump posted while onboard Air Force One on Friday afternoon after speaking to troops at Fort Bragg.
“Also, the People of our Country are insisting on Citizenship, and No Mail-In Ballots, with exceptions for Military, Disability, Illness, or Travel,” the president added, falsely, since there is no popular majority for banning vote by mail.
In fact, polling conducted last year showed the exact opposite: 58% of Americans favor allowing any voter to cast their ballot by mail if they want to.
Trump’s efforts to impose voter ID requirements are likely to face immediate legal challenges, as the US constitution leaves the conduct of elections to the states.
The president, however, claimed to have “searched the depths of Legal Arguments not yet articulated or vetted on this subject, and will be presenting an irrefutable one” that would allow the federal government to take unprecedented control of elections run by the states. But in a second post during his flight to his Palm Beach resort, he offered more hyperbole than facts, in a long diatribe punctuated with all-caps words.
“We cannot let the Democrats get away with NO VOTER I.D. any longer. These are horrible, disingenuous CHEATERS,” Trump wrote.
“If we can’t get it through Congress, there are Legal reasons why this SCAM is not permitted. I will be presenting them shortly, in the form of an Executive Order,” Trump added.
“I hope the Supreme Court realizes, as they ‘painstakingly’ review the very simple topic of Country Saving Tariffs … that these Corrupt and Deranged Democrats, if they ever gain power, will not only be adding two States to our roster of 50, with all of the baggage thereto, but will also PACK THE COURT,” the president posted.
Trump has long alleged systemic voter fraud contributed to his 2020 presidential election loss, despite no evidence to back up that claim.
Trump signed an executive order last year requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote and blocking states from accepting mail-in ballots received after election day, even if they were postmarked before then. A federal judge blocked the citizenship requirement in October, saying the president “lacks the authority to direct such changes”.

Britain’s ‘Brexit years’ are over, Starmer says
- Sir Keir Starmer will declare Britain's "Brexit years" over at the Munich Security Conference, advocating for closer European security ties and reduced dependence on the United States.
- The prime minister will describe Europe as a "sleeping giant" with significant economic and military power, urging the continent to leverage its defence capabilities through greater cooperation, including with the UK.
- His remarks come amidst transatlantic tensions, following a US president's threats regarding Greenland and criticism of European NATO allies, with a Munich Security Report warning of "wrecking-ball politics" and the destruction of the post-1945 international order.
- Sir Keir will also criticise Reform UK and the Green Party, accusing them of offering "easy answers" that are "soft on Russia and weak on Nato", potentially leading to division and capitulation in Europe.
- On Friday, Sir Keir held trilateral talks with Germany's Friedrich Merz and France's Emmanuel Macron, emphasising the interconnectedness of UK and European security.

Judge dismisses charges against 3 Connecticut officers accused of mistreating paralyzed prisoner
A Connecticut judge has dismissed criminal charges against three New Haven police officers accused of mistreating a prisoner who was paralyzed in the back of a police van
- Bookmark
A Connecticut judge on Friday dismissed criminal charges against three current and former New Haven police officers who were accused of mistreating prisoner Richard “Randy” Cox after he was paralyzed in the back of a police van in 2022.
Judge David Zagaja dropped the cases against Oscar Diaz, Jocelyn Lavandier and Luis Rivera after granting them a probation program that allows charges to be erased from defendants' records, saying their conduct was not malicious. Two other officers, Betsy Segui and Ronald Pressley, pleaded guilty last year to misdemeanor reckless endangerment and received no jail time.
Cox, 40, was left paralyzed from the chest down on June 19, 2022, when the police van, which had no seat belts, braked hard to avoid an accident, sending him head-first into a metal partition while his hands were cuffed behind his back. He had been arrested on charges of threatening a woman with a gun, which were later dismissed.
“I can’t move. I’m going to die like this. Please, please, please help me,” Cox said in the van minutes after being injured, according to police video. He later was found to have broken his neck.
Diaz, who was driving the van, brought Cox to the police department, where officers mocked Cox and accused him of being drunk and faking his injuries, according to surveillance and body-worn camera footage. Officers dragged Cox out of the van and around the police station before placing him in a holding cell before paramedics brought him to a hospital.
Before pulling him out of the van, Lavandier told Cox to move his leg and sit up, according to an internal affairs investigation report. Cox says “I can’t move” and Lavandier says “You’re not even trying.”
New Haven State's Attorney John P. Doyle Jr.'s office said prosecutors and Cox did not object to the charges being dismissed.
Defense lawyers said that while the officers were sympathetic to what happened to Cox, they did not cause his injuries or make them worse. The three officers whose cases were dismissed were scheduled to go on trial next month.
“We don’t think that there was sufficient evidence to prove her guilt or any wrongdoing,” said Lavandier's attorney, Dan Ford. "This is a negotiated settlement that avoids the risk of having go through the emotional toll of a trial.”
Rivera's lawyer, Raymond Hassett, called the decision to charge the officers “unjust and misplaced.”
“The actions of the Police Chief and City Mayor in targeting the officers were a misguided effort to deflect attention from the police department shortcomings in managing the department and ensuring proper protocols were in place and followed,” Hassett said in a statement.
Attorneys for Cox and Diaz did not immediately return phone and email messages Friday. Cox's lawyer, Louis Rubano, has said Cox and his family hoped the criminal cases would end quickly with plea bargains.
New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said city officials disagreed with the judge's decision to dismiss the charges.
“What happened to Randy was tragic and awful,” he said in a statement.
The case drew outrage from civil rights advocates including the NAACP, along with comparisons to the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. Cox is Black, while all five officers who were arrested are Black or Hispanic. Gray, who also was Black, died in 2015 after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van.
The case also led to reforms at the New Haven police department as well as a statewide seat belt requirement for prisoners.
In 2023, the city of New Haven agreed to settle a lawsuit by Cox for $45 million.
New Haven police fired Segui, Diaz, Lavandier and Rivera for violating police conduct policies, while Pressley retired and avoided an internal investigation. Diaz appealed his firing and got his job back. Segui lost the appeal of her firing, while appeals by Lavandier and Rivera remain pending.

Trump: Regime change in Iran ‘would be the best thing that could happen’
US president confirms sending second aircraft carrier to Middle East in case ‘difficult’ Islamic Republic doesn’t make a deal, says ‘fear’ is only thing that will get Tehran to sign agreement
Asked Friday about potential regime change in Iran, US President Donald Trump said, “it seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” as he confirmed sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East “in case we don’t make a deal” with the Islamic Republic.
“For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump told reporters after visiting with troops at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, referring to Iran’s clerical rulers. “In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.”
Pressed on who he would like to take over Iran, Trump declined to answer, but he added that “there are people.”
His comments appeared to contradict those made by US Vice President JD Vance, who indicated earlier this week that the administration was not pursuing regime change in Iran.
“If the Iranian people want to overthrow the regime, that’s up to the Iranian people,” Vance said, appearing to suggest that this was not the administration’s goal. What we’re focused on right now is the fact that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon.”
The US had recently appeared to be open to the idea of regime change in Iran, with Trump calling on protesters to “take over” government institutions amid the mass protests there, and reportedly asking aides for a strike plan that could help spur the toppling of the government.
But then Washington entered negotiations with Iran, a second round of which will be held in Geneva next week, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. Trump has repeatedly threatened Tehran with an attack if it doesn’t agree to a deal that sees the Islamic Republic give up its capabilities to produce a nuclear weapon, roll back its ballistic missile program, and cease its support for armed proxies in the region.
According to the source, a US delegation including envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will meet with the Iranians on Tuesday morning, with representatives from Oman — which hosted the first round of talks — on hand to mediate the US-Iran contacts.
Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in separate trilateral talks with representatives from Russia and Ukraine in the afternoon, the source said.
‘Sometimes you have to have fear’
Before heading to Fort Bragg, Trump hit out Iran for being “difficult” in the nuclear talks.
“If we don’t have a deal, we’ll need it; if we have a deal, we could cut it short — it’ll be leaving very soon,” said Trump of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier.
The Ford’s deployment was first reported by the New York Times on Thursday.
The aircraft carrier is currently en route from the Caribbean to join the USS Abraham Lincoln, which deployed in the Arabian Sea in January amid Trump’s threats to strike Iran if it did not stop its crackdown on anti-regime protests, where regime forces killed thousands of people.
Referring to the Lincoln, Trump told reporters outside the White House that “if we need it, we have it ready, a very big force.”
Later, speaking to troops at Fort Bragg, Trump said only fear would get Iran to sign a deal.
“We have a situation right now where we have sent a very big carrier group to Iran,” he said. “I would love to see if we could make a deal. They’ve been difficult to make a deal with.”
“I thought we would have had a deal last time. They wish they did,” said Trump, citing the US strike on Iran’s key nuclear sites on June 22, during the 12-day Israel-Iran war, which put an end to a previous round of US-Iran nuclear talks.
“Sometimes you have to have fear. That’s the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,” he added.

Iran, whose leaders are sworn to destroy Israel, denies seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, but has enriched uranium to levels that have no peaceful application, obstructed international inspectors from checking its nuclear facilities, and expanded its ballistic missile capabilities.
Rafael Grossi, head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, told the Munich Security Conference on Friday that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities is possible but “terribly difficult.” He added that the agency’s inspectors had returned to Iran following the war, but have not been able to visit any of the sites that were targeted.
Oman facilitated the indirect US-Iran talks in its capital Muscat last week. A spokesperson for Iran’s foreign ministry said the talks let Tehran gauge Washington’s seriousness, and showed enough consensus for diplomacy to continue. The date and venue of the next round of US-Iran talks have yet to be announced.
The Islamic Republic has refused US demands to expand the scope of the negotiations to include the Islamic Republic’s ballistic missile program and support for regional proxy forces. Trump has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran if it doesn’t agree to a deal that encompasses all three issues.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, returning from a meeting with Trump at the White House, on Thursday said any agreement with Iran must cover “not only the nuclear issue, but also ballistic missiles and Iran’s regional proxies.”
The premier expressed “general skepticism about the possibility of reaching any agreement with Iran,” but said Trump believes the Iranians could be forced into “a good deal.”
Commenting on the meeting with Netanyahu, Trump told reporters on Thursday: “We have to make a deal, otherwise it’s going to be very traumatic, very traumatic.”

Seoul intelligence reports about 6,000 North Korean troops killed or wounded in war against Ukraine
According to Ukrinform, Yonhap stated this in an article, citing data from South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS).
According to the intelligence agency, about 10,000 North Korean combat troops and 1,000 engineering soldiers are currently deployed in Russia's Kursk region to support Moscow's war against Ukraine.
The NIS estimates that approximately 6,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded in the war.
The intelligence service added that about 1,100 troops and engineers who returned to North Korea last December could be sent back to the war.
"Despite suffering 6,000 casualties, the North Korean military has achieved the results of acquiring modern combat tactics and data in the battlefield, as well as upgrading its weapons systems with technical assistance from Russia," the NIS stated.
The intelligence agency also noted that Pyongyang has created a new unmanned aerial vehicle department and is accelerating efforts to build a system capable of developing and mass-producing drones.
As Ukrinform previously reported, South Korea's Minister of Unification, Chung Dong-yong, during talks in Seoul with Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel, stated that there is a link between negotiations to end the Russia–Ukraine war and the situation on the Korean Peninsula.

A Russian blogger documented horrific conditions at a local morgue — and police promptly beat him up and threw him in jail

A Russian blogger documented horrific conditions at a local morgue — and police promptly beat him up and threw him in jail
A blogger in Siberia faces criminal charges after posting a video documenting unsanitary conditions at a morgue, according to a lawyer familiar with the case. Artem Pavlechko, who lives in the city of Tulun in the Irkutsk region, has been charged with violating privacy laws, according to his lawyer, Anna Anufrieva. State investigators confirmed that a 34-year-old man is suspected of illegally sharing private details about a doctor, including his home address, in a video posted in January to VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network.
The footage that led to the charges shows graphic conditions inside the morgue. Anufrieva said that on January 14, Pavlechko published a 16-minute video recorded inside Tulun’s forensic medical department with the caption: “Horrible unsanitary conditions at Tulun morgue, or making money off people’s grief.”
Dressed in camouflage, Pavlechko confronts morgue staff, including a medical worker who discards a cigarette butt in a sink beside an autopsy table. “People are complaining that things here aren’t done in a Christian way,” he says in the video. “It’s a mess, it’s filthy, it’s a dump. You’re spraying bodies down with a hose; dead bodies are just piled on top of each other. People bury these folks later, kiss them goodbye. Is everybody in Tulun going to end up like this someday? Right? Tossed here with your cigarette butts?”
You’re currently reading Meduza, the world’s largest independent Russian news outlet. Every day, we bring you essential coverage from Russia and beyond. Explore our reporting here and follow us wherever you get your news.
The video shows bodies on dirty cots, with clothing and belongings scattered or piled on the floor beside them, and filthy instruments lying near the autopsy tables.
Pavlechko then visits a church, a funeral services company, and the residence of Sergey Dolenchuk, whom he identifies as the morgue’s director. Throughout the video, Pavlechko is accompanied by an unnamed man, possibly the former morgue worker who had also lobbied human rights activists to “bring national attention to this story.”
The footage ends with police being called to the morgue after the blogger’s visit. He and his companion then go to the prosecutor’s office to file a complaint. Shortly after the video was published, the prosecutor’s office reported that it had initiated an inspection of the Tulun morgue facilities following a complaint from a local resident, whose name was not disclosed. No results of the inspection have been announced.
The morgue director countered by filing a police complaint against the blogger, alleging invasion of privacy, according to Baza, a Telegram channel with law enforcement ties. The director accused Pavlechko of “barging onto private property,” Baza said.
Police arrested the blogger on the morning of February 11. Human rights activist Anna Tazheeva told the media outlet Ostorozhno Media, run by socialite Ksenia Sobchak, that special forces officers raided Pavlechko’s home and assaulted him. Lawyer Anna Anufrieva published a photo showing Pavlechko being escorted by several officers. The image shows a large bruise on his face.
Law enforcement held Pavlechko for two days and released him only on the evening of February 13, Sobchak reported. After his release, Pavlechko confirmed that officers beat him while he was in custody and forced him to record an apology to the morgue staff and the person who filed the complaint against him — likely the morgue’s director.
Irkutsk police later released footage of the arrest. The video does not name Pavlechko, identifying him merely as a 34-year-old “offender who calls himself a blogger” and partially blurring his face. However, Pavlechko remains identifiable in the video, largely due to his clothing. The footage shows special forces officers smashing down his apartment door with a sledgehammer before forcing him to apologize to the morgue workers.
Law enforcement officials studied Pavlechko’s posts and filed a report against him for publicly displaying extremist symbols, according to the agency’s statement. It did not specify the exact nature of the violation. Baza reported that anti-extremism authorities spotted a keychain with a “thieves’ star” image in one of the blogger’s videos and may have deemed it a symbol of the banned “AUE movement” — a purported subculture among Russian teenagers that glorifies prison and criminality. The Interior Ministry said a court had already reviewed the case and ordered Pavlechko to serve the short jail sentence he had just completed.
Baza reported that Pavlechko was released on his own recognizance. The blogger’s family and friends told the Telegram channel he suffered bruises and scrapes on his body. Baza published a video of Pavlechko showing visible signs of beatings on his body.
Artem Pavlechko, a Tulun-based blogger who documents local and regional issues on social media, became known for videos in which he argues with traffic police officers, according to the Siberian news outlet People of Baikal. Pavlechko ran for mayor of Tulun in 2024 and won 17 percent of the vote.
Pavlechko has styled himself as the “blogger of all Russia” and “Russia’s future president.” His YouTube channel, Siberian Freshness, promises to “sow goodness, light, and eternity,” according to its description. Pavlechko’s public page of the same name was later rebranded as “Your Mentor at Alfa,” where he actively promoted Alfa Bank’s services and published videos until January 2025.
Pavlechko’s Instagram reveals a catalog of videos: musings on his personal life, feuds with other bloggers, and criticism of local government officials. He began posting frequently about local issues in Tulun roughly a year before the city’s mayoral race.
His social media accounts also feature darker content, including a xenophobic video urging followers to form a “Bastrykinite militia” — a reference to Federal Investigative Committee Chairman Alexander Bastrykin — to target Tajik migrant workers in Russia. He also posted videos about fundraising for Russian forces in Ukraine. At the same time, however, his Facebook avatar depicts his Russian passport engulfed in flames.

'Recipe for disaster': Piastri raises Melbourne F1 safety concerns

Oscar Piastri raises safety concerns ahead of F1 Australian Grand Prix
In short:
Concerns over the safety of the new Formula 1 cars off the starting grid have been raised during preseason testing.
Oscar Piastri drove 161 laps on Friday during testing in Bahrain.
What's next?
A second three-day testing session in Bahrain will be held from February 18-20, ahead of the Australian Grand Prix weekend on March 6-8.
Oscar Piastri has raised concerns about safety issues at the upcoming Australian Grand Prix, worried about potential chaos at the very start of the F1 season opener.
The McLaren ace warned it sounded like "a recipe for disaster" to have the sport's new-look "low downforce" cars, still untested in race conditions, jostling for position, and he also brought up uncertainties surrounding overtaking.
Piastri noted his concerns after a successful but long day behind the wheel of his new McLaren on Friday, during which he churned out 161 laps — more than anyone else — and finished fourth-fastest in the standings behind a Mercedes 1-2 led by Kimi Antonelli.
Piastri believes his concerns will need to be looked at before his home grand prix in Melbourne in three weeks when the first race will take place since F1's cars, rules and regulations were completely revised.
"Starts need to be addressed because, probably as we've all seen, it's a pretty complicated process now to have a safe start, let alone a competitive one," he said after the final session of the first official preseason testing at the Sakhir circuit.
"There's plenty of topics to address. Starts, and overtaking is certainly going to be different as well.
"Whether we use straight mode at the start or not, as well.
"I think a pack of 22 cars with a couple hundred points less downforce sounds like a recipe for disaster to me, but there's a few of those aspects that need to be spoken about.
"The thing is, everyone's going to need different things for the start, and to be completely honest with you, I'm not sure any of us know exactly what we need yet.
"There's so many things just from an even borderline safety point of view that need to be kind of figured out on track, that do need addressing."
Piastri was talking to reporters after the drivers went through a practice start in Bahrain, which turned into a fairly chaotic exercise.
He said that wasn't connected to the new engines but to a miscommunication.
The Australian had failed to get away in his McLaren but explained: "I got told to wait until whoever was in front of me had gone and then do my own launch, and not do it to the lights.
"Clearly, some other people had a different idea. So that was nothing to do with the power units."
As for his verdict on which teams looked most powerful over the week — McLaren, Mercedes, Red Bull and Ferrari all seemed their usual powerhouse selves — he shrugged: "Where we are in the pecking order, I don't know.
"It kind of looks like the top-four teams are still the top-four teams, but I don't know where exactly we sit in that at the moment."
Mercedes's George Russell, second-fastest on Friday ahead of Ferrari's third-fastest Lewis Hamilton, was still adamant Red Bull had a "pretty scary" advantage over the rest as Max Verstappen finished fifth on the time sheets.
Red Bull, in turn, reckoned Mercedes looked impressive as the pre-Melbourne mind games started to get into gear.
A second three-day testing session in Bahrain will be held from February 18-20, ahead of the Australian Grand Prix weekend on March 6-8.

Hume was punished after the election. Now she's been crowned Liberal deputy

Jane Hume was punished for her election slips. Now she's been crowned deputy Liberal leader
Jane Hume started the parliamentary term in the doldrums.
The Victorian senator and favourite of the media had been turfed from the opposition front bench by her "friend" Sussan Ley, after being tarred personally with much of what went wrong to deliver the Coalition its cataclysmic election loss.
The demotion had hurt, she conceded, but she also wasn't about to let it get her down.
"This isn’t the playground, this is the parliament. I’m not here to make friends. I’m here to make a difference," she told morning television two days after Ley's first shadow cabinet was unveiled.
"As my very wise mother would say, 'Stop your nonsense, chin up, chest out, straighten your tiara and let's get on with the job.'"
On Friday there was no tiara but a metaphorical crown as she ascended over three of her colleagues to be elected deputy Liberal leader, while the party ousted the woman that had orchestrated her move to the back bench just nine months earlier.
It makes Hume the first senator to hold the title since 1990 and, depending on the portfolio she chooses for herself, that could mean some new horizons for the opposition to traverse.
Hume, along with new Liberal Leader Angus Taylor, made up Peter Dutton's economic team. Whether they can shake that association in the minds of voters, who emphatically rejected the party the last time around, remains to be seen.
"We know the challenge that faces us. We know that many people have lost faith," she told reporters on Friday.
"Our party and our movement has a proud history. In my role as deputy, I will make it my mission to ensure that it also has a bright future."
From banker to parliamentarian
Hume, 54, was born in Melbourne and stayed in the city for her studies, earning a commerce degree at Melbourne University.
She entered the workforce as a graduate at NAB, before spending two decades moving between various roles in the banking and superannuation sector.
After multiple attempts at Senate preselection, she was elected in fifth position on the Coalition ticket in 2016, behind now prominent frontbencher James Paterson.
Her success at the ballot box came after a bleak period in her personal life. At a women's summit last year, she spoke of finding herself unemployed, recently divorced and a single mother of three.
"Were my parents thrilled? Absolutely not. Was I thrilled? No, not in the least," she said.
Three years after joining parliament, Scott Morrison named the former super adviser as assistant minister for superannuation and financial services.
Hume got straight to work, telling the Sydney Morning Herald she sought to make urgent changes to the "inefficient" super system and reintroduce legislation to make it opt-in for those under 25 years of age.
After the Coalition's 2022 defeat, the senator was appointed as the shadow minister for finance and the public service.
She was also tasked with helming the party's election review alongside former director Brian Loughnane, which recommended targets rather than formal quotas for female MPs, despite the party's poor result with women.
It was an issue she had some experience with. Long before being elected to the Senate, Hume had established a program to help mentor young women keen on entering politics.
"One of the tough things we have to do is convince our members and our colleagues that there is a business case for increasing the number of women in parliament," she told the ABC in 2017.
But she came under fire the following year for comments made during an episode of Q&A that suggested women who weren't able to break through the preselection process should simply work harder.
"We have to work for what we want," she said "And for women that don’t get there, well, the trick is work that little bit harder. Don’t get bitter, get better."
Blunders mar election campaign
The first sign of trouble for Hume came before the official election campaign. During a speech at the Menzies Research Centre she declared it would be an expectation of a Coalition government that "all members of the APS [Australian Public Service] work from the office five days a week".
While there would be some exceptions, she said, "they will be made where they work for everyone rather than be enforced on teams by an individual".
Hume had apparently been inspired to float the proposal after a conversation with her son, who was working from home as an intern.
Her comments were quickly met with backlash and Labor seized upon them to claim that everybody would be at risk of being forced back to the office if Dutton was elected.
The policy was particularly poisonous among women, for whom the ability to work from home is often essential to being able to juggle a career and parenting responsibilities.
Such was the outrage that Dutton had to publicly abandon the position — a remarkable concession in the midst of an election.
"I think it was pretty clear during the election campaign that that policy was a mistake," she told reporters on Friday.
It was not her only election misstep. Two days before Australians went to the polls, she suggested on live television that there were "Chinese spies" volunteering for Labor.
The comment swiftly went viral on social media platforms popular with Chinese voters and prompted calls for the prominent Liberal to apologise.
Hume this week labelled the comment a "throwaway line" that had been taken out of context and blamed Labor for weaponising it.
"I have in fact, apologised to those that were offended by that," she said. "They were ill-considered remarks."
Both fumbles were widely cited as key contributors to the Coalition's defeat — and Hume did not escape unscathed.
Banished to the backbenches
With the wreck of the election still smouldering, Sussan Ley stood up in front of journalists and declared that the Liberal Party would go in a new direction, one that reflected modern Australia.
That new vision for the party apparently did not include Hume on the front bench, despite her status as a fundraising powerhouse.
The high-profile senator was unceremoniously left off Ley's ministry, along with fellow Liberal woman Sarah Henderson. It meant the number of women on the front bench went backwards under Ley, even as she acknowledged the need to attract more women to the party.
Asked about the snub, Ley described Hume as a "strong performer across a range of different subject areas" and an "enormously talented, fantastic" team member.
Hume kept quiet on the slight for two days, before turning to Sunrise to break her silence.
"If you’re asking me whether I feel hurt or slighted by this move from Sussan, of course it hurts," she said.
"It hurts professionally because I was a hard-working and prolific member of the front bench in the previous opposition. It hurts personally, too, because you know, Sussan and I are friends."
But Hume also saw a silver lining: "There is something very liberating about being on the back bench and being able to speak without having to stick to the party line and without having to stick to talking points."
Indeed, despite being on the back bench, Hume managed to stay in the spotlight. She is known for her strong and often entertaining performances in Senate estimates, including one particularly memorable exchange with a witness who she often bumped into wearing lycra at the gym.
"Less worthy men have seen me in far less," she joked, before her own mouth dropped open seemingly in surprise at what had slipped out.
In the hearings this week, Hume questioned the Department of Parliament Services about why condoms were available in women's changing rooms but not men's. The public servant said she thought it was wonderful that women were taking control of their sexual health.
"I agree ... I just wonder why men aren't taking responsibility as well," Hume replied.

Mark Carney visits memorial as new details surface about Canada shooting

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has laid a bouquet of flowers at a makeshift memorial in Tumbler Ridge, as new details have emerged about the school shooting that left eight people dead in the remote British Columbia town.
On Friday, Carney travelled to the mining community alongside opposition leaders in a show of national solidarity following Tuesday’s attack at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, one of the deadliest episodes of violence in recent Canadian history.
Police have identified the shooter as 18-year-old Jesse Van Rootselaar.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said she was "hunting" and that "there was no specific targeting of any individuals."
According to investigators, Van Rootselaar killed her 39-year-old mother and 11-year-old stepbrother at their home before heading to the school, where she shot dead five students and a teacher, then took her own life.
'Unforgivable act of violence'
Her estranged father, Justin Van Rootselaar, said in a statement to CBC that he was offering condolences for a "senseless and unforgivable act of violence."
"As the biological father of the individual responsible, I carry a sorrow that is difficult to put into words," the statement said.
Police have released a photograph of the suspect and confirmed she had known mental health issues.
Carney is expected to address a vigil outside the town hall in Tumbler Ridge, about 1,180 kilometres north of Vancouver.
The town of roughly 2,400 residents has been marked by grief, with families of victims sharing tributes.
Carney earlier told parliament that "these children and their teachers bore witness to unheard-of cruelty," describing Tumbler Ridge as resilient and compassionate.
He cancelled plans to attend the Munich Security Conference following the attack.

Judge gives US 2 weeks to retrieve student deported to Honduras while traveling for Thanksgiving
A federal judge says the U.S. government has to bring a Babson College freshman back after officials deported her to Honduras
- Bookmark
A college student deported to Honduras while traveling for Thanksgiving in November must be returned to the United States within two weeks, a federal judge in Boston ruled Friday.
U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns issued an order that required the return of 19-year-old Babson College freshman Any Lucia Lopez Belloza by the end of February.
Stearns said he had hoped the Trump administration would come up with a solution after it acknowledged mistakenly deporting Lopez Belloza. Having failed to do that, Stearns said, he was compelled to act. He said it was up to the courts to determine her rights and the legality of her removal.
“This is not an issue for the Executive to prejudge and arrogate to itself, whatever stance it may choose to take in litigating the removal issue before a court of law,” Stearns wrote.
Asked about the decision, the Department of Homeland Security e-mailed a statement saying Lopez Belloza received “full due process” and a final order of removal. The federal agency said she entered the U.S. in 2014 and that the removal order was issued by an immigration judge the following year.
The government has said she missed multiple opportunities to appeal. But Lopez Belloza said her previous attorney told her there had been no removal order.
Her lawyer, Todd Pomerleau, said previously that the government’s response “spills a lot of ink on the difficulty of a student visa, but it fails to address the numerous simple solutions available to itself to rectify its ‘mistaken’ deportation.” Pomerleau could not be reached for comment late Friday.
Lopez Belloza, who has no criminal history, was detained at Boston's airport Nov. 20 as she prepared to fly home to Texas for the holiday. She was deported two days later.
She has been staying with her grandparents in her native Honduras, a country she had last been to more than a decade ago.
Babson has offered her support to continue her studies remotely, as she pursues a business degree.

Wife of Cherokee Nation judge accused of shooting him dead in his sleep
Elizabeth Poteete, 70, told deputies she shot her husband because she feared for her life
- Bookmark
An Oklahoma woman is facing murder charges after she allegedly shot and killed her husband, a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, as he slept in their home.
Elizabeth Poteete, 70, is charged with first-degree murder in the Cherokee Nation District Court in connection with the February 5 shooting death of Troy Wayne Poteete, according to newly filed court records obtained by KOTV.
Investigators say Poteete called 911 around 11 p.m. that night and reported that she had shot her husband multiple times. She told the dispatcher that she would be waiting for deputies on her front porch.
When deputies with the Sequoyah County Sheriff’s Office responded to the couple’s home in Vian, they found Troy Poteete on the couch suffering from gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
Poteete told investigators that her husband had threatened her, saying that his girlfriend and another person were going to kill her.
She claimed she feared for her life, so she grabbed a handgun from a file cabinet, stood four to five feet away from her husband, and fired multiple shots, according to records viewed by FOX24.
She told investigators she was unsure how many times she pulled the trigger.
Troy Poteete was a founding member of the Trail of Tears Association. He also served eight years as a Cherokee Nation Tribal Council member and was director of the Arkansas Riverbed Authority.
Poteete is being held at the Sequoyah County Jail without bond, according to court records. She is scheduled to appear in court on March 3.

A woman thought she was bathing alone in her apartment. When she looked out the window a police drone was staring back
Denver police admitted its drone was on the way to the scene of a call and was part of a four-month first responder program

A Denver woman was left shocked and feeling “violated” after spotting a police drone hovering outside her window while she was taking a bath.
"I was just playing on my phone, relaxing, and I saw a flashing light coming from the window," the woman, who asked to be identified as Eden, told KUSA. "It was a drone, and I was like, 'Oh my God’... I felt violated.”
Eden called out to her boyfriend, Carlos, who was also in the apartment and saw the drone flying close to their window on Monday night. The couple estimated the drone was flying around 30 ft from the ground.
"I mean, I saw it right out of my window," Carlos told the outlet. "At least, close enough to where I feel like if I threw a rock, I'd be able to hit it."
When contacted, Denver police admitted that the drone belonged to them and was part of a four-month first responder program, on the way to the scene of a call about a suicidal person near to the apartment.
Despite police insisting that the camera had been pointed in the other direction, Eden said she still felt uncomfortable.
"I almost preferred that it was a stranger because the police are here to protect and not to violate," she told KUSA. "It didn't feel good. It didn't make me feel safe at all."
The department told the outlet that it offered to show Carlos the footage from the flight – which were confirmed by DPD logs – and said the drone was flying at 200 ft for the entire flight, which the couple disputes.
The Independent has contacted the Denver Police Department for more information on Monday’s incident.
DPD told the couple that the drone had only been flown in the area for approximately two minutes and circled the location of the call for service during that time. Information is stored on its Drone as First Responder Transparency Dashboard for 60 days.
According to the department, such first responder drones have been deployed to 622 calls for service from when the program was quietly rolled out in October last year, through to February 12.
Drones arrive on scene before officers more than 84 percent of the time and drone pilots can determine whether or not a physical patrol response is needed in more than 36 percent of cases – freeing up officers for more serious incidents.
Eden told KUSA that, despite her negative experience, she believed that the drones “can be used in a right way,” though added: "I don't like the fact that they were hovering in a very residential spot where people could get the wrong idea."

Andrew tried to ‘fix’ meeting between Jeffery Epstein and Colonel Gaddafi, emails reveal
The disgraced financier appeared to ask for a meeting with Gaddafi but it is understood that it did not go ahead
- Bookmark

Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor tried to arrange a meeting for Jeffrey Epstein with Colonel Gaddafi in Tripoli, Libya, emails appear to show.
Messages within the latest release of the US Department of Justice’s Epstein files, from the autumn of 2010, show the disgraced financier contacted royal aide David Stern.
He said: “i want to go to tripoli lets organize with pa”.
The paedophile then sent another email to Mr Stern, which said: “people that have seen the father, have asked me if i want to meet him as he does not know where to put his money as opposed to what to do with it, currencies etc, I wondered if Pa should make the intro instead.”
The emails were first unearthed from the Epstein files by Channel 4 News, which reported “the father” refers to the late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi to distinguish him from his well-known son Saif.
It appears Mr Stern then consulted Andrew, in a reply dated the following day, October 8 2010, writing: “He is thinking about the best approach and will discuss with me when I see him next on 17th Oct in Hong Kong (he is leaving today for Asia).”
Andrew then spoke to a Libyan contact in an attempt to facilitate the meeting.
The former Duke of York made an official visit to China in October 2010 and was the UK’s trade envoy at the time.
Later emails from “The Duke”, signed “A”, to Epstein’s address say “I will call you later this evening after I have had my chat with my Libyan contact to see what we can arrange for you in Tripoli.”
The same day, November 4 2010, “A” follows up to Epstein writing “Libya fixed. Call me whenever.”
The emails come as Thames Valley Police on Wednesday said it had held discussions with specialists from the Crown Prosecution Service about allegations that Andrew shared confidential reports from his role as the UK’s trade envoy with Epstein.
It appears the planned meeting did not go ahead, as Epstein did not end up flying to the Libyan capital, Channel 4 News reported.
Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor has been contacted for comment.

US military preparing for potentially weeks-long Iran operations, as second carrier heads to Middle East
Sign up now: Get ST's newsletters delivered to your inbox
WASHINGTON – The US military is preparing for the possibility of sustained, weeks-long operations against Iran if President Donald Trump orders an attack, two US officials told Reuters, in what could become a far more serious conflict than previously seen between the countries.
The disclosure by the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the planning, raises the stakes for the diplomacy underway between the US and Iran.
US and Iranian diplomats held talks in Oman last week in an effort to revive diplomacy over Tehran’s nuclear programme, after Mr Trump amassed military forces in the region, raising fears of new military action.
US officials said on Feb 13 the Pentagon was sending an additional aircraft carrier to the Middle East, adding thousands more troops along with fighter aircraft, guided-missile destroyers and other firepower capable of waging attacks and defending against them.
Mr Trump, speaking to US troops on Feb 13 at a base in North Carolina, said it had “been difficult to make a deal” with Iran.
“Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of,” Mr Trump said.
Asked for comment on the preparations for a potentially sustained US military operation, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: “President Trump has all options on the table with regard to Iran.”
“He listens to a variety of perspectives on any given issue, but makes the final decision based on what is best for our country and national security,” Ms Kelly said.
The Pentagon declined to comment.
The United States sent two aircraft carriers to the region last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites.
However, the June 2025 Midnight Hammer operation
Risks increasing
The planning underway this time is more complex, the officials said.
In a sustained campaign, the US military could hit Iranian state and security facilities, not just nuclear infrastructure, one of the officials said. The official declined to provide specific details.
Experts say the risks to US forces would be far greater in such an operation against Iran, which boasts a formidable arsenal of missiles. Retaliatory Iranian strikes also increase the risk of a regional conflict.
The same official said the US fully expected Iran to retaliate, leading to back-and-forth strikes and reprisals over a period of time.
The White House and Pentagon did not respond to questions about the risks of retaliation or regional conflict.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to bomb Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and crushing of internal dissent. On Feb 12, he warned the alternative to a diplomatic solution would “be very traumatic, very traumatic”.
Iran’s Revolutionary Guards have warned that in case of strikes on Iranian territory, they could retaliate against any US military base.
The US maintains bases throughout the Middle East, including in Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met Mr Trump for talks in Washington on Feb 11, saying that if an agreement with Iran were reached, “it must include the elements that are vital to Israel”.
Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles. REUTERS

Trump says Iran regime change best, 'fear' is powerful motivator
US President Donald Trump said Friday that a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen," as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure on the Islamic Republic.
Trump's comments were his most overt call yet for the toppling of Iran's clerical establishment, and came as he pushes on Washington's arch-foe Tehran to make a deal to limit its nuclear programme.
At the same time, the exiled son of the Iranian shah, toppled in the 1979 Iranian revolution, renewed his calls for international intervention following a bloody crackdown on protests by Tehran.
"Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters at the Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina when a journalist asked if he wanted "regime change" in Iran.
Trump declined to say who he would want to take over in Iran from Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but he added that "there are people."
He has previously backed off full-throated calls for a change of government in Iran, warning that it could cause chaos, although he has made threats towards Khamenei in the past.
Speaking earlier at the White House, Trump said that the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest warship, would be "leaving very soon" for the Middle East to up the pressure on Iran.
"In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it," Trump said.
The giant vessel is currently in the Caribbean following the US overthrow of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro. Another carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln, is one of 12 US ships already in the Middle East.
'Fear' is powerful motivator
Trump told US troops on Friday that Iran has been "difficult" in nuclear negotiations and suggested that instilling fear in Tehran may be necessary to resolve the standoff peacefully.
"They've been difficult to make a deal," Trump said of the Iranians before an audience of active-duty soldiers at Fort Bragg Army base in North Carolina, after US officials said they were sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East.
"Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of."
During his address, Trump also referenced the US bombing of Iran's nuclear sites last June.
Earlier, he said the deployment of the world's largest aircraft carrier was being made so "we'll have it ready" should negotiations with Iran fail.
Oman facilitated talks between Iran and the US last week, which a spokesperson for Iran's foreign ministry said had allowed Tehran to gauge Washington's seriousness and showed enough consensus for diplomacy to continue. The date and venue of the next round of US-Iran talks have yet to be announced.
The head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, said Friday that reaching an accord with Iran on inspections of its processing facilities was possible but "terribly difficult".

Emerald Fennell’s New Take on This Wuthering Heights Character Is Its Best Twist
Unknown
Unknown Publisher
2026-02-13
23:04:37 UTC
08:04:37 KST

Warning: This post contains spoilers for "Wuthering Heights."
As far as iconic characters from Wuthering Heights go, Isabella Linton typically isn't one of the first to come up in conversation about Emily Brontë's classic 1847 gothic romance novel. In the timeless tale of the obsessive love-hate relationship between headstrong Catherine Earnshaw and her brooding outsider of a foster brother Heathcliff, Isabella is introduced as the pampered and privileged younger sister of Edgar Linton, the wealthy heir to Wuthering Heights' neighboring estate of Thrushcross Grange and Catherine's eventual husband. Isabella goes on to fill the role of used and abused pawn in Heathcliff's quest for vengeance against the Earnshaw and Linton families before ultimately fleeing the Yorkshire countryside and dying young.
In the newly-released "Wuthering Heights" (purposefully stylized with quotation marks to distance the adaptation from its source material), on the other hand, filmmaker Emerald Fennell (Promising Young Woman, Saltburn) paints Isabella (played by a scene-stealing Alison Oliver) as the shy, skittish, and sexually repressed young ward of Shazad Latif's measured and mature Edgar—her guardian rather than, as in the book, her brother. Titillated by the introduction of Margot Robbie's Catherine into their lives, and even more so by the subsequent arrival of a newly rich and polished Heathcliff (Jacob Elordi), the delightfully unhinged Isabella transforms before our eyes.
"There are a lot of descriptions in the book about how she is infantile and ill-mannered, and can be quite like a petulant child, and obviously very romantic and spoiled," Oliver told ELLE Canada of her character's spin. "[This] Isabella is this sort of baby-woman, and she’s been kept a child by Edgar. The experience of having Cathy and Heathcliff come into her home is her stepping into a new phase of her life."

Despite some mean-spirited warnings from Cathy that Heathcliff will destroy her, Isabella ultimately gives in to Heathcliff's advances and consents to a loveless marriage in which she will serve as his tormented plaything. The novel's Isabella is coerced and tricked into this arrangement, and finds herself miserable, alone, and at the mercy of a sadistic abuser once the wedding deed is done. The Isabella of "Wuthering Heights," however, not so much.
When Catherine's handmaid Nelly (Hong Chau) shows up at Wuthering Heights in an attempt to retrieve Isabella from Heathcliff's clutches, she finds her chained up like a dog—an apparent dark wink to the reveal in the book that Heathcliff has hanged Isabella's beloved springer spaniel. But in a raunchy and unexpected twist on Brontë's tortured naif, when Isabella crawls across the floor and peers smirkingly up at Nelly with a mad glint in her eye, it becomes decidedly (if somewhat uncomfortably) clear that she's not only a willing participant in Heathcliff's cruel game, but also seemingly enjoying her role as submissive pet.
"'Emerald’s interpretation of Isabella’s story is the reverse of Cathy's; there's an uncorseting of her," Oliver told ELLE UK. "Like she becomes undone. There’s something so powerful about being underestimated."

‘Please don’t shoot me’: Missing Wisconsin woman found dead in woods after desperate call to family
The body of 24-year-old Gabriella Cartagena was found in a wooded area of Menominee County, Michigan
- Bookmark
Five days after Gabriella Cartagena’s family heard her pleading for her life before vanishing, the Wisconsin woman was found dead in a wooded area in Michigan – and her boyfriend is in custody.
The 24-year-old was last seen around 5 p.m. on February 4 at her home in Marinette, Wisconsin. Around 7:20 p.m. that same night, Cartagena made a troubling phone call to her mother.
Family members later told police that during the phone call, they heard Cartagena in distress as she cried, “Please don’t shoot me. I’m sorry.”
Cartagena was reported missing the next day. Her body was found five days later in a wooded area off Birch Creek Road in Menominee County, Michigan.
Investigators learned from the family that Cartagena was believed to be with her boyfriend, 29-year-old Robert Chilcote, at Red Arrow Park in Wisconsin. He was identified as a person of interest, police confirmed at a press conference Thursday, FOX11 reported.
When officers initially responded to the park after receiving the missing persons report, they found signs of blood and immediately treated the area as a crime scene, Marinette Police Department Chief John LaCombe said.
“While looking around the scene, we found some signs of possible blood and other disturbances in the area, which led us to believe that this was a scene we needed to focus on from the start,” LaCombe said.
Police tracked Chilcote in Minnesota and on February 5, after a 16-minute car chase that reached speeds of up to 100 mph, Chilcote was taken into custody.
“There was weapons found in the vehicle,” LaCombe said. “I don’t know if those were the weapons used in this incident or not. There was several firearms located in his vehicle at the time of his arrest in Minnesota.”
Chilcote, who is from the Marinette area, had no known ties to Minnesota, LaCombe added. It took another four days to find Cartagena’s body.
Using surveillance footage from area businesses and cell tower data to track Chilcote’s movements after her disappearance, police were led to a wooded area near Birch Creek Road in Menominee County.
Police said they searched the area repeatedly before locating Cartagena’s body Tuesday morning. LaCombe said he believes Cartagena was killed at Red Arrow Park and later transported to the wooded area in Michigan.
Chilcote is being held on a $100,000 bond in Minnesota on charges of fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle and being a fugitive from justice from another state.
Marinette County District Attorney DeShea Morrow said her office is awaiting the results of Cartagena’s autopsy before filing charges. She added that the extradition process is underway to bring Chilcote back to Wisconsin.
Authorities have not released a motive. It’s unclear how long Cartagena and Chilcote had been together, but police say the two lived together in Marinette and there were no prior domestic disturbance reports involving the couple.
LaCombe said Chilcote is the only suspect and does not believe anyone else was involved.
“We remain committed to seeking justice and ensuring the safety of our community,” LaCombe said.
Cartagena, who moved to Marinette from the Milwaukee area about a year ago with her family, leaves behind a three-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, her family said.
A GoFundMe created by Cartagena’s brother states that “their family is still trying to process this sudden loss.”

Trump Says Regime Change 'Best Thing That Could Happen' In Iran

US President Donald Trump said regime change is the "best thing that could happen" in Iran, as he confirmed that a second aircraft carrier would soon join a "massive" US armada in the Arabian Sea amid high tensions between the bitter rivals.
"Seems like that would be the best thing that could happen," Trump told reporters on February 13 at a military base in North Carolina when asked whether he sought "regime change" in Tehran.
"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking. In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk," he added in his most direct call for the fall of Iran's hard-line clerical regime.
Trump did not say who he would like to see take over should the government fall, only that "there are people."
Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran, is one of many figures vying for prominence among the fractured Iranian opposition in exile.
Iran's theocratic regime has been in power since 1979, when the Islamic revolution saw clerics loyal to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrow the US-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1980.
Washington and Tehran have been involved in indirect talks over Iran's nuclear program. Western countries suspect Iran is attempting to develop a nuclear weapon, while Tehran insists its program is strictly for civilian purposes.
Trump has also threatened a new military strike against the Iranian government if it executes any of the protesters arrested during recent mass anti-government demonstrations.
'Difficult' Nuclear Negotiations
Trump told US troops at the base that Tehran has been "difficult" in nuclear talks and suggested more pressure on the Iranians was needed.
"They've been difficult to make a deal," he said. "Sometimes you have to have fear. That's the only thing that really will get the situation taken care of."
Trump also hailed the 12-day war in June, when Israel and the United States launched a bombing campaign targeting Iran's nuclear and military sites.
The latest comments come amid one of Washington's largest-ever military buildups in the Persian Gulf region.
Experts say the deployment is aimed at giving Trump military options if he chooses to act on his threats to attack Iran for failing to make a nuclear deal and violently cracking down on protesters.
Iranian security forces killed thousands of demonstrators in January, after protests erupted in late December 2025, initially over economic issues but later raging into general anger against the regime. More than 53,000 people were arrested, rights groups say.
"The gathering of forces is a point of pressure applied by the United States on Iran to come to a negotiated agreement," said Amin Tarzi, professor of strategic studies at Marine Corps War College.
Tarzi added that after the buildup, the US military posture in the Gulf is "robust" with "naval and defensive air defense capabilities, plus offensive air components."
Reuters on February 13 quoted two unnamed US officials as saying the military was preparing for the possibility of a weeks-long operation against Iran if Trump orders an attack.
World's Largest Warship
The US military has previously deployed the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to the Persian Gulf region to join what Trump called a "massive Armada" near Iran.
On February 13, Trump confirmed that another aircraft carrier, Gerald R. Ford, along with its escort ships, was departing the Caribbean and would soon join US forces in the region, likely within about seven days.
The Gerald R. Ford is considered the largest warship in the world with a length of 337 meters and the capability to carry some of the most advanced military technologies.
When asked why he was sending the second warship, Trump said: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it.... If we need it, we'll have it ready."
Negotiators met in Muscat last week in talks mediated by the Omani government, and follow-up sessions are unclear, although Reuters quoted sources as saying a fresh round of talks are scheduled for Geneva on February 17.
The source said the US delegation will include envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and that Omani representatives would serve as mediators. Witkoff and Kushner will then participate in trilateral US-Russia-Ukraine talks later in the day, the source added.
Tehran has expressed a willingness to discuss its nuclear program but has ruled out negotiations over its ballistic missile program and other related matters.
Sanctions Hit Iranian Economy
Iran has been hit hard by Western financial sanctions that have helped crater the country's economy.
Iran in 2015 agreed to a landmark nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers aimed at preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon in return for an easing of economic sanctions.
However, it started rolling back its commitments after Trump, during his first term, withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran.

LONDON, February 13. /TASS/. The United Kingdom will spend 400 million pounds ($545 million at the current exchange rate) in 2026 to design new types of high-precision and hypersonic weapons in cooperation with other European countries, the UK Defense Ministry said.
"Britain is progressing the Stratus joint missile programme with France and Italy - leading the work to develop a next generation stealth replacement to the Storm Shadow missile," the statement says.
According to the ministry, the new missiles will be able to defeat high-value targets, destroy enemy ships, and suppress enemy air defenses.
Apart from that, "Britian’s new long-range weapon programme with Germany is progressing rapidly with a new joint study phase about to begin, accelerating both future stealth and hypersonic weapons."
The new system will be known under the name Deep Precision Strike. With the range of over 2,000 km, it will be "among the most advanced systems ever designed by the UK, coming into service in the 2030s.
The UK’s hypersonic weapons investment this year "also includes funding for developing critical technologies, ground and flight testing, as well as significant funding for academic skills and training including funding post-graduate study."

‘The best thing that could happen’: Trump hints at change in power in Iran
Washington: President Donald Trump has said that a change in power in Iran “would be the best thing that could happen” as the US administration weighs whether to take military action against Tehran.
Trump made the comments on Friday (US time) shortly after visiting with troops in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and after he confirmed earlier in the day that he’s deploying a second aircraft carrier group to the Mideast for potential military action against Iran.
“It seems like that would be the best thing that could happen,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters when asked about pressing for the ouster of the Islamic clerical rule in Iran. “For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking.”
Trump said earlier that the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world’s largest aircraft carrier, is being sent from the Caribbean Sea to the Middle East to join other warships and military assets the US has built up in the region. The planned deployment comes just days after Trump suggested another round of talks with the Iranians was at hand. Those negotiations didn’t materialise as one of Tehran’s top security officials visited Oman and Qatar this week and exchanged messages with U.S. intermediaries.
“In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it,” Trump told reporters about the second carrier. He added, “It’ll be leaving very soon.”
Already, Gulf Arab nations have warned any attack could spiral into another regional conflict in a Mideast still reeling from the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Meanwhile, Iranians are beginning to hold 40-day mourning ceremonies for the thousands killed in Tehran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests last month, adding to the internal pressure faced by the sanctions-battered Islamic Republic.
The Ford, whose new deployment was first reported by The New York Times, will join the USS Abraham Lincoln and its accompanying guided-missile destroyers, which have been in the region for over two weeks. US forces have already shot down an Iranian drone that approached the Lincoln on the same day last week that Iran tried to stop a US-flagged ship in the Strait of Hormuz.
It is a quick turnaround for the Ford, which Trump sent from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean last October as the administration built up a huge military presence in the lead-up to the surprise raid last month that captured then-Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.
It also appears to be at odds with the Trump administration’s national security and defence strategies, which put an emphasis on the Western Hemisphere over other parts of the world.
In response to questions about the movement of the Ford, US Southern Command said US forces in Latin America will continue to “counter illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.”
“While force posture evolves, our operational capability does not,” Colonel Emanuel Ortiz, spokesperson for Southern Command, said in a statement. US “forces remain fully ready to project power, defend themselves, and protect US interests in the region.”
The Ford strike group will bring more than 5,000 additional troops to the Middle East but few capabilities or weapons that don’t already exist within the Lincoln group. Having two carriers will double the number of aircraft and munitions that are available to military planners and Trump.
Given the Ford’s current position in the Caribbean, it will likely be weeks before it is off the coast of Iran.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to agree to constrain its nuclear program and earlier over Tehran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests.
Iran and the United States held indirect talks in Oman a week ago, and Trump later warned Tehran that failure to reach an agreement with his administration would be “very traumatic.” Similar talks last year ultimately broke down in June as Israel launched what became a 12-day war on Iran that included the U.S. bombing Iranian nuclear sites.
Asked by a reporter about the new negotiations, Trump said that “I think they’ll be successful. And if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran, very bad.”
Trump held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday and said he insisted to Israel’s leader that negotiations with Iran needed to continue. Netanyahu is urging the administration to press Tehran to scale back its ballistic missile program and end its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah as part of any deal.
Iran has insisted its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. Before the June war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60 per cent purity, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels.
The USS Ford, meanwhile, first set sail in late June 2025, which means the crew will soon have been deployed for eight months. While it is unclear how long the ship will remain in the Middle East, the move sets the crew up for an unusually long deployment.
The Navy’s top officer, Admiral Daryl Caudle, told reporters last month that keeping the Ford longer at sea would be “highly disruptive” and that he was “a big non-fan of extensions.”
Carriers are typically deployed for six or seven months. “When it goes past that, that disrupts lives, it disrupts things ... funerals that were planned, marriages that were planned, babies that were planned,” Caudle said.
He said extending the Ford would complicate its maintenance and upkeep by throwing off the schedule of repairs, adding more wear and tear, and increasing the equipment that will need attention.
For comparison, the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower had a nine-month deployment to the Middle East in 2023 and 2024, when it spent much of its time engaged with the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. The ship entered maintenance in early 2025 as scheduled, but it blew past its planned completion date of July and remains in the shipyard to this day.
Caudle told The Associated Press in a recent interview that his vision is to deploy smaller, newer ships when possible instead of consistently turning to huge aircraft carriers.

Abortion, again, threatens to bring Crisafulli’s careful plan unstuck

Abortion, again, threatens to bring Crisafulli’s careful plan unstuck
Coming into the second calendar year of their first term in government in more than a decade, the LNP has been ticking off much of what it came to power promising to do.
Premier David Crisafulli and his team are now well into a thornier patch of events over which they have little or no control – or find themselves backed into a corner.
And not just any events: these are ones that pick at the ideological and pragmatic stitching holding together its party room members and their promises to Queenslanders.
One, a response to the Bondi massacre, tore their federal Coalition apart. Another – abortion – has delivered the first public rupture in the facade of unity since the state election.
Then there’s the budget, which the government says is headed for further inevitable credit downgrade-driven debt woes, despite experts saying their own actions will be crucial. These actions are likely to rub against vows to not lift taxes or slash the public service.
On Bondi, the state’s drip-fed “calm and methodical” response has resulted in its status as the only jurisdiction to give a hard no to a national gun buyback.
Instead, it has tinkered with penalties and police powers while seemingly walking back from limits on gun ownership, and rejecting the Wieambilla inquest’s calls for a serious look into mental health checks.
The state LNP has also pressed ahead with a crackdown on hate symbols and what it deems hate speech – contested pro-Palestinian slogans.
Crisafulli has painted these laws as tough. They have been backed by the state’s major Jewish group, but panned by civil libertarians and supporters of the Palestinian cause.
His gun law reform efforts have been described by at least one advocacy group as leaving the state with “weakest” scheme in the country. The opposition has issued some criticism of this and is seriously considering a symbolic stand over free speech concerns with omnibus bill’s hate speech element.
What Labor has seized on more forcefully is Mackay LNP backbencher Nigel Dalton’s break with his colleagues in a procedural parliamentary vote to unwind a gag on any debate around abortion.
Dalton then sat down for an interview with an anti-abortion campaigner to say he never believed Crisafulli’s insistence law changes were “not part of our plan”, and regretted his silence since.
A major anti-abortion lobby group then fired up its own social media channels to put the spotlight on similar claims said to have been made privately by some of Dalton’s party room colleagues.
While Labor jumped on this as more evidence of barely papered-over LNP desires to unwind the state’s recent abortion reforms within Crisafulli’s ranks, this came in a parliamentary week parallel to CFMEU inquiry evidence of former minister Mark Bailey’s directions around talks with the union.
Asked in question time on Thursday about Oodgeroo MP Amanda Stoker’s reported statements on abortion, Crisafulli fired up through a series of interjections to accuse Labor of trying to “run a scare campaign again”.
Later, amid more interjections, Crisafulli called out Opposition Leader Steven Miles for not holding a media conference while the inquiry was running this week and “not even going out to face the music as to what is going on in his own backyard”.
At the centre of the abortion debate issue, though, is Robbie Katter, the Traeger MP and eponymous party leader who provided a heaping of the election campaign pressure on the LNP and has made little effort to hide his anger at the party’s campaign tactics then and in the recent byelection loss.
Katter provided the fuel for Dalton’s rebellion in his motion which, while failing to lift the ban on abortion law debate in parliament, succeeded in reigniting broader public debate about the issue.
In light of that, you can expect it won’t be the last Katter effort to poke at the LNP’s fault lines. And One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, currently riding the shine rubbing off from the federal Coalition, is joining in.
Polls suggest One Nation’s rise is not yet playing out at a state level. But they have shown falling support for Crisafulli and his party. At some stage, carefully kept plans may need to be altered.
Alternatively, further events might force them to be.
Heads up
- While the state’s corruption watchdog did not get a chance to air its concerns and suggestions around government’s unpicking of a developer donation ban and quadrupling of the donation cap at a public hearing last month, its boss is likely to face MPs at a regular parliamentary appearance on Tuesday.
- It’s due to be a busy week for committees, with at least one hearing also scheduled for MPs to probe gun control and antisemitism laws set for Thursday.
Catch up
- This week, parliament also passed the government’s bill to give the option of electronic monitoring for youth offenders as young as 10, with Labor even lobbing a bill this week to introduce a daily five cent cap on fuel price increases (the LNP opposition didn’t introduce its first in the last term until three years in).
- Meanwhile, the Child Safety inquiry has agreed to shave six months off its November deadline to give the government suggestions to fix the “broken” system it can feed into its budget deliberations. Labor has accused minister Amanda Camm of prematurely cutting off the probe before it could look at a troubled IT system rollout.
